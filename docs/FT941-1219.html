			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Skanska, NCC return to black Skanska and NCC, Sweden's top two construction and property groups, yesterday reported a return to profit in 1993 after severe losses in 1992. However, both companies continued to be hit by the slump in the Swedish market, relying on lower write-downs and income from divestments to see them back into the black. Revenues were down for both groups, reflecting another tough year - especially in Sweden, where the property and construction sectors have been hit hard by recession. Mr Jan Sjoqvist, president of NCC, said property prices and rent levels were stabilising, although there were variations between geographical areas and market segments. Infrastructure investment was also regaining momentum. However, he warned: 'Investments in the construction sector will remain low in 1994 and 1995, but should begin to show growth again in 1996.' Skanska showed the biggest improvement in 1993, swinging to a profit after financial items of SKr1.1bn (Dollars 149m) from a loss in 1992 of SKr3.98bn. NCC reported a profit after financial items of SKr175m following a deficit in 1992 of SKr1.63bn. Skanska increased its dividend to SKr3.25 per share from SKr1.50, but NCC suspended its dividend, as it did for 1992. Total revenues at Skanska were down 9 per cent at SKr28.9bn, with the share of revenues taken outside Sweden rising from 14 to 23 per cent. Revenues from Swedish construction slumped to SKr14.8bn from SKr17.4bn. Property write-downs of SKr2bn were less than half the SKr4.3bn incurred in 1992. NCC's total revenues slipped to SKr17.6bn from SKr20bn. But non-recurring income of SKr463m, against a loss of SKr324m in 1992, and write-down costs cut to SKr371m from SKr1.4bn, resulted in an operating profit of SKr961m after a loss in 1992 of SKr649m.</p>

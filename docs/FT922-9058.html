			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: For the really serious - Arthur Hellyer reviews two definitive books for gardeners THE NEW Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening, in four volumes, has been published. For serious gardeners and students of gardening this is the most important set of books to appear for a long time, probably since WJ Bean's Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles appeared in its eighth edition between 1970 and 1988. But between these two great works there is a fundamental difference. Bean's five volumes were a straightforward revision, updating and enlargement of something that had been with us for a long time; a familiar friend with much new material and a considerable alteration of names but nevertheless looking much like previous editions. This new RHS work, of which Anthony Huxley is editor-in-chief, Mark Griffiths, editor, and Margot Levi, managing editor, and on which something like 250 contributors have been employed, is an entirely new work, not an update of the old RHS Dictionary of Gardening, which was itself based on Nicholson's Illustrated Dictionary of Gardening, first published in parts between 1884 and 1888. The only things that are familiar are the arrangements in strictly alphabetical order and similar-sized pages, although the columns of type are wider. The old line drawings in the text have disappeared, to be replaced by mainly whole-page plates of line drawings which are too widely dispersed to do much to alleviate the very solid appearance of the text. There are obvious gains that have been obtained from all these points of difference. First and foremost, there can have been no temptation, in a drowsy moment, to let old copy slip through unchallenged. Where all is new, everything must have been considered critically and I would expect this important work to find a great deal of favour with botanists. It must not go completely unchallenged for it is the job of taxonomists to examine their material constantly and to come up with new suggestions for more revealing or more accurate systems of classification. Many of the names in the new dictionary are quite different from those in the volumes they replace and, where they are the same, the descriptions, although fully botanical like those of the old work, are quite new, which can sometimes be a bit disconcerting. But, now that we have "The Plant Finder", not only to tell us where to buy plants but what names we should be using for them, a great many of these new names have a degree of familiarity. I am interested to note that Chris Phillip and Tony Lord, compiler and editor of The Plant Finder, are among those acknowledged for their usefulness in the editorial forward to the new RHS Dictionary of Gardening. I have nothing but commendation for the pains which the editors have taken to explain how to use the book and what various names mean. It is the fullest and clearest such explanation I can recollect reading. There has also been an effort, characteristic of some thinking in the higher ranks of the RHS at the moment, to rate some plants for hardiness based on a fairly simple system of zoning, such as that which has been in use in North America for many years. There are two hardiness maps, one for North America and the other for Europe. For the time being, the rest of the world must exist without such guidance and I do not know that there is very great loss in this, because hardiness depends upon so many things other than minimum temperatures. The editors are well aware of this, and the long entry on hardiness is full of excellent advice. One advantage of the closely packed pages is that it has been possible to compress into four volumes what appears to be an even greater amount of information than that contained in the former five. There are 3,983 genera and about 50,000 plant entries. 20 pages are devoted to the history of gardening in the UK - never attempted in the previous work  -and a further 12 1/2 pages are given to US history. Nearly 150 pages at the end of volume four are devoted to ancillary matters such as pests, diseases and disorders; a long horticultural glossary and another on botanical epithets; an index of all the authors cited in the text; an extensive bibliography, and an index of popular names which I have already found useful. For the next 10 years or so, this is going to be the definitive work, to which all of us who are not active botanists will turn for the 'correct' names for each and every plant that we grow, write about or discuss. Not that any dictionary of plants, however authoritative, can remain completely unchallenged for long. The speed of increase of knowledge about plants and the variety of opinions about their relationship to one another has never been greater than it is today. There is no doubt that Anthony Huxley and his assistants have done a wonderful job - one that I would have called impossible if it had been explained to me at the outset what was proposed. I thought they were revising the work, not replacing it. The price of the new dictionary is Pounds 495. An encyclopaedia of very different character is Blooms of Bressingham Garden Plants, sub-titled Choosing the Best Hardy Plants for your Garden. It is by Alan and Adrian Bloom, a father-and-son team; between them they have as good a knowledge of hardy plants, shrubs and heathers as anyone I know. Alan, who has been growing and raising good plants all his life, is now 85, and still tending his famous dell garden near Diss, in Norfolk, as assiduously as ever. Adrian has one of the most extensive heather and small conifer gardens in the UK, only a few hundred yards away from his father's, and they are both involved in Bressingham Gardens which supplies garden centres all over the country. They also have a couple of very good centres of their own and do a big retail trade. Their encyclopedia is well written, informative, practical, and contains no strange new botanical names to disturb its readers. Beautifully produced, with excellent colour pictures, it is a book to instruct as well as to delight readers and browsers. It costs a reasonable Pounds 19.99, and is published by Harper Collins.</p>

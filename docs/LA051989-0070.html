			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVERS FROM CITY LEAGUE TOOK ALTERNATE ROADS TO SECTION MEET  </P> <P> Imagine trying to practice and play basketball without the hoop, hockey without  the ice. Or playing in a game but not having the points you score count.  </P> <P> A handful of athletes in city league high schools must, because of the lack of  facilities, scrounge for places to practice and compete.  </P> <P> No city league schools have swimming pools, forcing swim teams to practice at  local colleges or recreation centers. The situation is worse for divers,  because there are no boards at the rec center pools. They must find a club  program, for which they pay themselves, or the swim coach arranges for their  training, often at a separate facility.  </P> <P> To qualify for the San Diego Section diving championships today at UC San  Diego's Canyon View Pool, divers must have scored 160 points in a six-dive meet  or 250 points in an 11-dive meet. Qualifying chances for city divers were  limited, because diving is not contested in city league meets. They had to  qualify in nonleague meets or invitationals.  </P> <P> "A lot of swim meets are won because of diving points. At city schools, diving  doesn't count in the swim team's points during a meet, so why are my divers  here?," said Julie Green, University of San Diego High School diving coach.  "They dive for themselves."  </P> <P> City divers must not only concern themselves with how they will dive in  competition but where. Most city divers went on their own to two or three  invitationals during the seasons. The meets must be CIF-sanctioned to count  toward qualifying for the section meet.  </P> <P> Diving programs are strong and successful at non-city league schools such as  Santana, Mt. Carmel and Valhalla because they have pools equipped with diving  boards and a coach who helps divers pursue their talent.  </P> <P> But the Mira Mesa swim team practices at the Mira Mesa Racquet and Swim Club,  convenient because it is close to the school but lacking diving boards. Mira  Mesa's two divers -- seniors Kimberly Lofft and Dawn Schmitt -- must rely on  their club coach, training year-round at Canyon View under Tom Scotty of UCSD  and Dive San Diego.  </P> <P> Scotty said he has 15 competitive divers in Dive San Diego, including five from  the city leagues.  </P> <P> Lofft and Schmitt have trained with Dive San Diego for three years and under  Scotty, a former University of Illinois diving assistant, since October. Both  were gymnasts who turned to diving because of injuries. Lofft joined the  program first, then urged Schmitt to do the same.  </P> <P> Schmitt said their situation has advantages -- the same coach and facility all  year -- but the inconvenience of having to find meets in which to compete and  lack of team support is often frustrating.  </P> <P> "In a way, I feel secluded," said Lofft, who placed third at the section  championships last year. "When I was a sophomore, we worked out at the Miramar  Naval Air Station pool with the swimmers. I went to all the meets with the team  (although she competed in few because there was no diving). Now they're at the  rec center, and I've only competed once with the team. I don't feel like I'm  part of the team."  </P> <P> This season, the girls competed with the team in one dual meet and attended two  invitationals on their own. Scotty attends when he has no prior commitments  with UCSD. He also finds meets for his high school divers. They will many times  compete in meets not sanctioned by the CIF for Dive San Diego. The experience  is beneficial, Scotty said.  </P> <P> Last year, USDHS had one diver. But when Dan Crane became swim coach, Green was  also hired. Freshman Debbie Howard and senior Mike Murphy, two of USDHS's 12  divers, will compete in today's section meet.  </P> <P> They practiced at University of San Diego's pool along with the swim team for  most of the year. But this week, USDHS swimmers and divers were forced out  because it was the only time for the school to have work done on it. Swim  practice was moved to Swanson Memorial Pool. On Wednesday and Thursday, all  divers competing today were allowed to practice at Canyon View to become  familiar with the boards.  </P> <P> Howard said she didn't think she'd qualify for the diving championships because  she had little chance to compete -- one nonleague meet and three invitationals  this season. She has five years of experience diving for a park district team  in Palatine, Ill., during summers when she visits her father. Most of the other  divers at USDHS were rookies this season, so Green started from scratch. Howard  said that helped her become better.  </P> <P> "I always felt I had the advantage. I knew and perfected my dives. I took from  what I learned and made my dives better," Howard said. "My parents never pushed  me to dive, and Julie pushes you. It helped me a lot."  </P> <P> USDHS has the largest diving team of the city league schools. Most, such as  Mira Mesa, wouldn't be represented in diving at all if it wasn't that the diver  had previously been involved with Dive San Diego or the other local club, Dive  West out of Helix High School.  </P> <P> "There are hardly any coaches," Green said, "and some of the kids don't have a  coach and must dive on their own."  </P></p>

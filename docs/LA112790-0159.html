			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH DESCRIBES U.S. AND MEXICO AS 'ONE FAMILY'  </P> <P> President Bush today said the United States and Mexico are "one family," united  in their goal to break down trade barriers and in their opposition to Iraq's  aggression in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "The size and sophistication of U.S.-Mexico trade today only hints at our  potential.  </P> <P> We can create and share unprecedented prosperity and jobs," Bush said,  referring to the free-trade pact that both governments want to accomplish.  </P> <P> Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, joining Bush in speaking at the  Monterrey City Theater, emphasized that Mexican migrant workers make a positive  contribution to the U.S. economy and the United States has a "moral and  juridical obligation" to respect their human and labor rights.  </P> <P> Bush, on the second day of his visit, focused primarily on the two countries'  efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement.  </P> <P> This morning, the President met with a group of U.S. and Mexican business  leaders.  </P> <P> Later, he met for a second straight day with Salinas before they addressed the  Monterrey City Theater audience.  </P> <P> Bush's schedule also called for a meeting with another group of Mexican and  U.S. businessmen and more bilateral talks on issues such as drugs, the  environment and economic matters.  </P> <P> Bush praised Mexico's cooperation in the U.S.-led opposition to Iraq and also  for its stepped-up oil production that has helped cover the loss of oil from  Iraq and Kuwait due to a United Nations-imposed embargo.  </P></p>

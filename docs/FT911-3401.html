			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (9): Why the timetable is slipping - The progress towards privatisation A RECENT survey of Greek industry caused a stir by pointing out something the Finance Ministry knows only too well: the total amount of tax paid each year by private sector companies falls considerably short of the overall figure for losses incurred by public sector corporations. It is not just the state-owned transport and utilities companies whose payrolls are swelled by political appointees with little interest in boosting productivity. The public sector also has a dominant role in manufacturing though that is less visible, since many larger companies are controlled indirectly through the state-owned banks. Others belong to the Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, a state umbrella for a group of debt-burdened companies nationalised in the early 1980s by the former socialist government. While the socialists were held responsible for weakening Greek industry through selective nationalisations in sectors they considered strategic, the seeds of today's crippling deficits were undoubtedly sown by the statist policies of their right-wing predecessors. However, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis is determined to reverse past attitudes. The prime minister himself supervises a wide-ranging privatisation programme launched immediately the conservatives came to power last April. The companies to be privatised form a profile of Greek industry: among them are shipyards, mineral processing units, a textile group, several paper mills, a leading construction company and a group of co-operative dairies that belong to the Agricultural Bank. The original aim was to dispose of the 20-odd companies controlled by the IRO as quickly as possible and encourage the banks to shed another 70 companies. As a parallel measure, legislation was passed permitting the sale of up to 49 per cent of public sector corporations through the Athens Stock Exchange. To co-ordinate the process, the government issued official guidelines for handling sales and appointed NM Rothschild, the British merchant banker, as its privatisation consultant. But the timetable has slipped badly and it now seems unlikely that this year's budget forecast of Dr200bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in privatisation revenues will be met. Only two small IRO companies have been disposed of, a yachtbuilder and a plastics manufacturer. One partial privatisation has taken place with the sale of a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways' catering subsidiary to Abela, an international industrial caterer. Valuations and appointments of financial advisers took longer than expected, while potential buyers were fewer than anticipated given the surge in acquisitions of Greek manufacturing units by both local and foreign companies over the past two years. Mr Yiannis Piperoglou, an independent consultant serving as secretary to the government's privatisation committee, says: 'When we started, I was looking forward to putting some deals together. But we all underestimated the legal complexities of privatisation. The process will take years and getting rid of the IRO companies is only a small part of it.' Government officials admit that chairmen and managing directors of some companies on the privatisation list have resorted to delaying tactics to keep their jobs for as long as possible. Last year the IRO companies' losses totalled Dr45bn and their accumulated debts reached Dr215bn. Mr Mitsotakis remains adamant that the IRO must shut down at the end of the year. This means in effect that a number of companies will be have to liquidated since the IRO will be unable to continue its current practice of extending deadlines in the hope of attracting better offers. Further delays may be caused by a European Court of Justice decision in a case brought by the former owner of an IRO company. The court is expected to rule that the socialists' method of nationalisation, through a compulsory increase of share capital, flouted Community directives on company law because shareholders were not consulted. Such a ruling could bring a spate of lawsuits against the IRO as other former owners see a chance to recover control of their companies, or at least to demand compensation from the government. At the same time, Greek officials are having to stay in close touch with the European Commission to make sure that terms of sale for larger industrial companies, such as the heavily subsidised shipyards, do not run foul of directives on fair competition. Much attention is being focused on the upcoming sale of Heracles General Cement, by far the best buy among the IRO's holdings and one of the few companies slated for privatisation that has posted operating profits in recent years. While Heracles was being valued, the statist faction in the government argued in favour of keeping it in the public sector. The company was nationalised in 1983 with a capitalisation of debts totalling Dr27bn. The move later allowed the IRO to gain control of 70 per cent of its shares. Even before the government committed itself to selling Heracles, the Commission had decided that this method of writing off debt violated competition rules. Despite the legal complications, there is no shortage of interest in Heracles, said to be Europe's largest single cement exporter, among international producers. The company's pre-tax profits totalled Dr11.9bn last year on Dr41.6bn turnover. The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Stelios Stavridis, a former Heracles executive who left shortly after its nationalisation, is seen as underlining the government's intention to speed up its sale. 'The company has deteriorated while under state control, but it is still in reasonably sound shape. My job is not to get involved in running Heracles but to accelerate the pace of privatisation. I don't intend to have to stay here longer than nine months,' he says.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Economics: Clear end to UK recession expected TODAY'S release of the provisional estimate of first quarter GDP figures in the UK will mark the clear end of a recession that began almost three years ago.

There will be more clues to the strength of the UK's economic recovery in the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey tomorrow, generally a good guide to future trends in manufacturing. But while the news in the UK might be good, the world's economic problems will be taxing the minds of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors when they meet in Washington on the eve of the IMF's Policy Making Interim Committee meeting.

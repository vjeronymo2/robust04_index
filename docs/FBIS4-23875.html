			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, the fighting has resumed, though it is  reported to be less intense. The calm we reported yesterday in  fact only lasted for a few hours. Monique Mas asked Paul  Kagame, the RPF's [Rwandan Patriotic Front's] chief of staff,  why the cease- fire has been violated.    [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French  translation] The cease-fire that was discussed in Tunis was  broken just a few hours after it was announced. This is because  we had agreed to stop shooting on the condition that the killing  stop and that the government forces stop holding the civilian  population hostage.    The cease-fire was therefore violated because it had been  barely announced when government forces and militiamen abducted  children from the Sainte Famille church and murdered them. I do  not know what cease-fire we are now talking about. [end  recording]</p>

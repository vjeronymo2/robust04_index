			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Ex-war correspondent of  the Korean People's Army Yi In-mo who was embraced in the bosom  of the DPRK on March 19, 1993, sent a letter of sympathy today  to Kim Chi-hyon, the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, his old  comrade-in-arms, who is suffering from a serious illness in  South Korea.    Kim Pyong-chu was an old comrade-in-arms of Yi In-mo, who  together with Yi fought for the reunification of the country  during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950-July 1953) and  Kim and his daughter looked after Yi In-mo with utmost care in  South Korea.    In the letter Yi said that, reading an article by Yim  Su-kyong, "the flower of reunification", carried by NODONG  SINMUN, he learned that Kim Chi-hyon who is in the hospital  attached to the Hanyang University for her serious illness was  going to leave the hospital, worried about the doctor's fee and  her younger brothers, though her illness is severe.    Yi said he still remembers the days when Kim Chi-hyon washed  his face and put spoonfuls of thin rice gruel into his mouth for  two months, temporarily leaving her work. "My diseases over  which you were so much concerned have been completely cured like  a miracle in Pyongyang and I am even making a tour in health,"  Yi said, and continued:    "It is the dear leader General Kim Chong-il who called me  the  incarnation of faith and will, me who was called by prisoner  number instead of my name in prisons of South Korea, took all  measures so that I could be embraced in the bosom of the DPRK,  took the utmost measures for medical treatment when I returned  to Pyongyang and is showing deep loving care for me."    Noting that the bright rays of the great love of dear  general  Kim Chong-il have reached Kim Chi-hyon, Yi In-mo stressed: "The  DPRK is now making every possible effort to bring your brothers  and you who are suffering from diseases in poverty, treated  coldly for the mere reason that your father was an unconverted  long-term prisoner who was taken prisoner while active as a  guerrilla, and to give you medical treatment and look after you".    Yi said they should fight it out with confidence, earnestly  appealing to the South Korean Red Cross and other human rights  organisations to help them come to the North and get medical  care.</p>

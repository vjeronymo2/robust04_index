			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commission could halve anti-dumping unit Sir, If Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission's trade commissioner, wants to double the staff of his anti-dumping unit he ought to be told that predatory dumping presupposes a dominant market share ('Brittan wants larger anti-dumping unit', November 4). If the Commission confined itself to those cases in which a foreign supplier or a cartel of foreign suppliers has acquired a dominant market share in the Community, it could cut its anti-dumping unit by more than one half. The condition of a dominant market share is well established in EC competition policy. It would also be consistent with the EC anti-dumping regulation. Competition and anti-dumping policy would at least be integrated. Roland Vaubel, department of economics, University of Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Shift of ownership likely at C&amp;J Clark C&amp;J CLARK, the footwear manufacturer and one of Britain's largest private companies, is not likely to remain a family-run business for much longer. After 167 years of family control, the consensus which emerged at yesterday's emotional extraordinary meeting was that only a change in ownership could end decades of family feuding, writes Peggy Hollinger in Glastonbury. That was about the only point on which the board unanimously agreed during the 90-minute meeting, with the differences in opinion only too obvious. The EGM had been called by four directors members, who proposed to replace Mr Walter Dickson, the chairman, and Mr James Power, a non-executive director. The rebels claimed a disagreement over corporate strategy and aimed to increase family influence on the board. The proposals were never put to the vote, however, as shareholders voted unanimously to adjourn the meeting until after the annual meeting in April. The adjournment was part of a last-minute compromise agreed late on Thursday afternoon. The deal included the creation of a committee to review possible bids for Clark's, and to target a price which could be recommended by the board. Between 300 and 400 angry shareholders packed the modest town hall in Glastonbury, Somerset. There were sharp rebukes for the feuding which, in the words of one investor and former employee, had made Clark's 'the laughing-stock of the industry'. But shareholders reserved their fiercest criticisms for the 'Gang of Four' who had called the meeting. Mr David Edwards, a shareholder and friend of the family, called on Mr Lance Clark - leader of the rebels - to 'consider his position' before the annual meeting. His call received an almost deafening round of applause. Mr Clark leapt to the defence of the rebels, saying he felt it would have been irresponsible to 'sit and watch' as profits steadily declined. The adjournment has merely postponed the dispute. The resolution to oust the two directors will be put to the vote in April, unless the rebels decide to withdraw. They have refused to comment.</p>

Replying to a message from the Russian leader, 'Arafat said  he accepted Yeltsin's invitation for "detailed" discussions on  bilateral ties and Russia's contribution to implementing  Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.    The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted 'Arafat as  saying he was confident that Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle  East peace process with the United States, would continue to  work for implementation of the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal "in the  time scale set by the accord", signed in Washington last  September.    Yeltsin's message was conveyed to 'Arafat on Friday by  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    'Arafat praised Yeltsin's "interest" in getting the peace  talks back on track, and the Russian Government's moves to get a  UN Security Council resolution adopted "which responds  effectively to Palestinian demands." [passage omitted]    'Arafat thanked the Russian Government for its "important"  efforts aimed at "preventing an escalation of violence in the  occupied territories," and said he was "very satisfied with the  friendly and sincere" PLO-Russian dialogue.    Besides Kozyrev, two Russian special envoys have visited PLO  headquarters in Tunis in the past two weeks in a Russian  diplomatic offensive to revive the peace talks.    The US State Department's Middle East coordinator, Dennis  Ross, will hold talks with 'Arafat in Tunis on Monday and travel  to Israel on Tuesday.    'Arafat aide Bassam Abu-Sharif said the Ross-Arafat meeting  would also be attended by a Russian envoy.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> WEINTRAUB CHALLENGER BLAMES LOSS ON LACK OF UTLA SUPPORT  </P> <P> The teachers union and the Democratic Party could have easily forced Los  Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub into a runoff election if they  had chosen to back her opponents with money and volunteers, one defeated  challenger said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks physician and screenwriter Barry Pollack was less than 1,000 votes  short of forcing East Valley incumbent Weintraub into a June 6 runoff. A third  candidate, Ernesto Llanes, received about 13% of the vote.  </P> <P> Weintraub, who won a fourth term on the board, received 28,510 votes, about  51.7% of the vote, according to semi-official results. A 50% plus one vote  majority is needed to win.  </P> <P> Pollack said financial and volunteer support from United Teachers-Los Angeles  could have won the union another ally on the board, namely him. UTLA, which  gave strong support to West Valley incumbent Julie Korenstein and Westside  challenger Mark Slavkin, remained neutral in the Weintraub race.  </P> <P> "I think the UTLA made a grave judgment error," said Pollack, who received  19,374 votes, about 35% of the ballots cast. "Weintraub outspent me 2 to 1, has  10 years of name recognition and only managed to squeak by me with about a 1  1/2% margin of victory."  </P> <P> Weintraub said that if Pollack had received UTLA support, she would have run a  more aggressive campaign. She said she spent only about half of the $100,000  raised for her campaign.  </P> <P> "There is no question people threw up their hands about schools" and voted to  oust incumbents, Weintraub said of the close outcome.  </P> <P> Pollack said he told UTLA officials early in the race that he would support the  union in the stalled contract talks that threaten to escalate into a teachers'  strike by next month.  </P> <P> Members of the 22,000-teacher union contributed a total of more than $100,000,  volunteered to walk precincts and telephoned voters to help Korenstein defeat  her five challengers and to assist Slavkin in forcing incumbent Alan Gershman  into a runoff.  </P> <P> Although Slavkin was able to force Gershman into the runoff, the results of the  costly union effort in the West Valley race are still unclear. Korenstein is  less than 50 votes above the 50% plus one majority she needs for a victory over  Principal Gerald Horowitz, with potentially hundreds of uncounted ballots  remaining, city election officials said. Final results are not expected for  several days.  </P> <P> UTLA took no position in the Weintraub race because "there was no strong force  wanting Roberta out of office" among teachers and union officials, UTLA  spokesman Don Schrack said.  </P> <P> Pollack also said he is disappointed that such Democratic Party leaders as Rep.  Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Los  Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky failed to endorse him even though he  received the party's endorsement.  </P> <P> Weintraub, a Republican, received her party's endorsement in the school board  race, which is nonpartisan.  </P> <P> Parent activist Barbara Romey, who finished third behind Horowitz in the West  Valley race, said she is pleased to have raised issues such as the reopening of  closed Valley schools and the continuing opposition to year-round schools.  </P> <P> Romey, who split conservative votes with Horowitz, said she has not decided  whether she will make any endorsements if there is a runoff. Romey lost to  Korenstein in a bitterly fought 1987 runoff election, which was held to fill  the two years remaining in former board member David Armor's term.  </P> <P> Horowitz, a political newcomer, said his strong showing reflects the  community's growing dissatisfaction with the school district and with  Korenstein's strong ties with the teachers union.  </P> <P> "I think the district's current offer to teachers is adequate," Horowitz said.  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Japan learns the American Way - Banks are taking a new approach to bad debts When Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, suggested this week that the country's banks could learn from the US experience of dealing decisively with bad loans, he was conceding that the Japanese Way has not worked. The Japanese Way was to sit on bad loans for a decade or more. It came with the confidence that Japanese banks were incapable of failing, and encouraged the idea that the 11 leading commercial banks were all in exactly the same shape, walking the same line at roughly the same pace. Mr Mieno's statement highlights a remarkable change in thinking in Japan over the past year. Bankers had laughed at the thought of copying the US method of taking a big hit, clearing the balance sheet and starting afresh. A finance ministry official insisted early last year that 'you will never see that kind of thing here'. Japanese banks will not suddenly swallow their bad loans whole, but Mr Mieno's statements indicate that further deregulation is needed in the financial markets to speed the process. He has previously suggested that both the strong and the weak banks should be more subject to markets and less to the whims of the finance ministry. The banks' sense of urgency in dealing with their bad loans has been heightened by the weakness of stock prices, which slipped another 2.3 per cent yesterday. When stock prices fall, so do the banks' unrealised gains on equities, which have been seen as their buffer against bad loans. Banks are also nervous because they are noticing a change in the structure of their non-performing loans. The bubble of the late 1980s is generally seen as the cause of the burden, but another layer of bad loans is appearing and will push their totals far higher than envisaged. Bankruptcy figures collected by Teikoku Data Bank, a credit research company, suggest that a record 63 per cent of the 1,258 corporate failures in October were caused by the recession. Banks had expected that their non-performing loan totals would peak as the bubble worked its way out of the system, but the recession is adding to their woes. The banks have also wasted opportunities to deal with their non-performing loans, which at the 21 leading institutions rose 7.7 per cent to Y13,800bn (Dollars 128bn) in the first half to September. This narrowly defined figure does not reveal the full extent of exposure, widely estimated to be Y30,000bn. Falling interest rates over the past two fiscal years increased banks' core profits, but the banks only assaulted the mountain of loans this year. In the six months just ended, core profits at the 11 largest banks slipped 10.6 per cent, and the weak demand for new loans and an official discount rate at a record low of 1.75 per cent do not create much margin for improvement. To cope with the burden, Mr Mieno suggested that Japan's financial markets would need to be further liberalised to enable banks to securitise their non-performing loans. His concern was that the banks have become too risk-averse and could worsen the recession by refusing to provide fresh finance to companies in need. 'The many functions of the financial markets, particularly the transfer of risk, played a major part in the recovery of US (banking) companies. We must examine if there is room to use those functions in Japan's financial system,' Mr Mieno said. The Bank of Japan has already told the finance ministry that securitisation is needed, and the ministry formed a committee in late November to examine the establishment of a secondary market for bad loans. But the first report is not due until March, and the ministry is said to be irritated that the bank is taking the lead. 'The ministry people don't like following the bank's idea. They have been very slow to respond,' a Japanese banker said. The finance ministry is central to the Japanese Way of dealing with bad loans, providing guidelines on how much the banks should write-off and encouraging them to walk at roughly the same pace. The Bank of Japan would prefer that stronger banks deal with their problem loans more quickly. Interim results and non-performing loans announced last month highlighted the differences in the banks' health. Mitsubishi Bank, the strongest of Japan's banks, has non-performing loans equivalent to 1.9 per cent of its total loans, while the figure was 5.38 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, perceived to be one of the more exposed banks. If the ministry remains reluctant to allow securitisation, another possibility is the establishment of a government-backed land buying agency. Members of Japan's governing coalition suggested this week that the agency could buy property collateral held by the banks, either using the land for government buildings or reselling it when the market improves. This would be more effective than the banks' own Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, which assesses the collateral on non-performing loans and buys the loan credit, enabling the seller bank to write-off the loss. The CCPC uses the banks' money to buy their own loans and is more a response to tough tax laws than the vehicle which will move the mountain of bad loans.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Wembley Trail: Wolfson's tactics may still secure the trophy - Impending rescue package / As moves towards refinancing Wembley approach a climax, Tim Burt reports on the likely outcome From the police control room at Wembley, every approach and movement around the stadium can be monitored on a bank of TV screens. Inside the famous twin tower complex, high-powered cameras can pick out individual supporters. In recent weeks, directors and bankers of the debt-burdened stadium and leisure company have been scrutinising rival refinancing groups in an equally rigorous fashion, ahead of a final decision later this month. Although Wembley is only a small player on the UK corporate field, its run of poor form has attracted interest out of all proportion to its size. Most companies with debts exceeding Pounds 100m and a market value of Pounds 20m would be regarded as terminally ill, not long for this world. Not so Wembley. Such is the crowd appeal of Britain's self-proclaimed 'Venue of Legends', that it has received three firm refinancing proposals, while informal rescue offers have also been touted by other teams. Moves to revive the company began in earnest after it reported a near-doubling of pre-tax losses from a restated Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m last year. With lenders demanding large debt repayments, Wembley had to change tack. After over-expanding in the 1980s and cutting borrowing through disposals, it had little choice but to seek court approval for a financial reconstruction. After almost six months of deliberation, the company and its syndicate of 22 banks will shortly name their favoured rescue package. The teams waiting on the sidelines boast some well known entrepreneurs. Mr Leon Black, the former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert, is behind an offer from Apollo Advisers, the US investment house. Mr Harvey Goldsmith, the music impresario, is thought to be offering a merger with his promotions business, Allied Entertainments. And Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, who oversaw the reverse takeover of PizzaExpress, have also pitched in. A group of 'phantom bidders' has also emerged, among them Mirror Group Newspapers, Chelsfield, the property developers, and Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian media and sports mogul. Sir Brian Wolfson, Wembley chairman, is tired of the speculation. 'There are only three bids on the table. Packer talked several months ago about taking a strategic stake but we told him it wouldn't solve the problem. That was a diversion.' He has also dismissed a Pounds 250m plan by Stadi Varios, the private stadium company, to reconstruct Wembley - claiming a larger venue would not attract any more events. MGN's interest remains uncertain, while Chelsfield is discussing only the possibility of acquiring three properties that were part of a sale and leaseback by Wembley in 1990. Through all these bids and counter bids, Sir Brian remains the pivotal character. He has dictated the pace of negotiations and refused even to enter discussions on some proposals. At the helm of Wembley since it acquired the stadium complex from BET in 1985, he is emphatic about his preferred scenario. 'We will only be able to go forward with a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. All the money raised will go towards reducing debt.' As the year-end deadline looms for the next Pounds 30m tranche of debt repayment, City analysts have detected a shift in the likely outcome. 'None of the rival bidders want to change the group's operational management and at least two of the parties don't bring anything in terms of hard cash,' says Mr Peter Joseph at brokers Peel Hunt. 'I think Wolfson could go it alone.' Despite Wembley's woeful debt-funded acquisitions strategy, its banks have remained faithful and been rewarded by on-time payments. Although write-offs and hefty interest payments have ripped through the profit and loss account, its core venue management and greyhound track activities remain profitable. 'The company tripped over a brick in a big way,' says one adviser to the banks. 'But they've cut costs and stemmed losses in North America. If the final proposal allows a substantial part of debt to be repaid and the banks to take part in the regeneration of the business, that would be the preferred option.' All the indications are that this is what Sir Brian intends to do, without outside intervention if possible. Although any deal would dilute the stakes of existing shareholders, he will be in a strong position when it comes to recommending an offer. Not only does Capital Development SA - his family trust - control some 4 per cent of the company, but he is also likely to receive the support of Rolaco  -the Saudi-owned investment group - which has built up a 15.17 per cent stake via Orpington Investments. 'If he can demonstrate things have changed, I bet he'll pull it off without any of the bidders,' predicted one analyst. When the banks and the board blow the final whistle later this month, Sir Brian will most likely end up with his hands on the trophy.</p>

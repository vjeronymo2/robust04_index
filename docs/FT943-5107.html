			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / CBI puts spotlight on late payers The problems caused by late payment of bills are highlighted today with the launch by the Confederation of British Industry's northern region of a detailed survey, based on responses from 5,000 companies. The survey, conducted with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Durham University Business School, hopes to gauge the extent to which companies are victims of late payment and how much they increase the problem by delaying payment to their suppliers. Mr Julian Kenyon, CBI assistant regional director, said the CBI hoped the research would help to change the business culture on payment and ease the cash flow difficulties. The CBI estimates that nationally one in five companies risk going out of business because of unpaid debts, which are said to total Pounds 145bn. However, the CBI does not favour legislation, fearing it might result in companies deferring payments until the last possible date. The 5,000 companies include the top 250 by turnover in north-east England and Cumbria. The rest are small and medium-size businesses employing under 500 people. In tandem with the research, to be published in November, the CBI is challenging northern businesses to sign up to its Prompt Payers Code, under which companies pledge to adopt and stick to a clear, consistent policy on paying bills.</p>

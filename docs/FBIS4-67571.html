			<p>Oct   94   <F P=102> LD1605154894 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1327 GMT 16 May 94 </F> <F P=103> LD1605154894 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow INTERFAX </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] The final results of a study into radioactive  pollution in the Far East's seas, conducted in March-April by a  Russian-Japanese-South Korean expedition, will be revealed not  earlier than in October. Interfax learned this in the  scientific-industrial amalgamation Taifun which was one of the  organizers of the expedition to the Far East.    Currently, scientists have preliminary data on cesium-137.  The study of sea water and bottom at sites where Russia had  buried nuclear waste did not show excessive levels of radiation.    However, as Taifun noted, it would be possible to make a  conclusion on whether nuclear waste damaged the environment only  after a study of the data on the levels of strontium-90,  plutonium, and a number of other radionuclides, expected to be  finished not later than in October.    The expedition which was organized at the initiative of  Japan  and South Korea made a study of regions where Russia buried its  nuclear waste. This summer it is planned to study the burial  sites at sea of Japanese and South Korean nuclear waste.</p>

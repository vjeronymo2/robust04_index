			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan can count  on assistance of the German Government in the sphere of  disarmament. This can be concluded from a program presented by  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn. He proposed that  the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, whose validity ends in  1995, become unlimited and that all nuclear states join it.  Klaus Kinkel said that his government was ready to extend  various forms of aid, including financial, to the four CIS  countries. It should be mentioned that Ukraine has recently  made an important step in this direction by ratifying START I  and the Lisbon Protocol.</p>

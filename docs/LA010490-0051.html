			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: REDUCING FAT IN 'DELICIOUS' BREAD  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This recipe looks delicious, but I want to try to decrease the  fat.  </P> <P>  -- MARY, Fort Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> DOM DELUISE'S CHEESE AND ONION BREAD  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sour cream  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 2/3 cup milk  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  </P> <P> Saute onions in 2 tablespoons butter until tender.

Makes 8 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR MARY: In spite of the changes I have made and the huge reduction in  calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium, most people would not be able to tell  the difference between the original and my revision. I took advantage of the  reduced-fat products now in the markets to lower the calories and fat from the  sour cream and the cheese. Using egg whites instead of a whole egg eliminates  the cholesterol from the yolk, and nonfat milk instead of whole milk also  worked beautifully.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> JEANNE'S CHEESE AND ONION BREAD  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> 2 egg whites  </P> <P> 1/2 cup light sour cream  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup shredded 20% fat-reduced Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 2/3 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley  </P> <P> Melt 1 teaspoon margarine in skillet over medium heat.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 31 Jan--The Russian and Kazakh experts  who opened a meeting in Moscow today will agree on the texts of  draft agreements on the status and conditions of exploitation of  the Baykonur cosmodrome and the town of Leninsk and draft  treaties on leasing facilities at Baykonur cosmodrome and the  town of Leninsk. [passage omitted]    The Russian side believes that Baykonur will not be able to  exist in the foreseeable future without the Russian Federation  space forces that currently ensure virtually all of the  functioning of the cosmodrome. Kazakhstan, however, is coming  out in support of withdrawing the military from its territory.  Russia, therefore, proposed to its partner to consider a  compromise solution--that is, a lease. Kazakhstan supported  this option in general.    The current meeting is a step toward implementing the  compromise. The experts are to determine the time limits of the  lease, payments under it, and whether Leninsk should be included  in the leased territory.    After completing the talks, the experts will go back to  finalize the documents so that the agreement and the treaty are  ready for signing when Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin visits Kazakhstan in late February.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Brazil party plays for time on Franco BRAZIL'S largest political party has postponed until September 21 its decision on whether to break with the government of President Itamar Franco. The Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), which held its national convention yesterday, decided on the postponement to win more time for both sides to solve their disagreements, which include personal and policy differences. Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest state, is heading a small but powerful group of party leaders who are critical of the president and his government. They also fear the PMDB will suffer in presidential and congressional elections next year if the party remains linked to President Itamar's unpopular government. Another wing of the party, probably in the majority, is afraid that breaking with the government would throw Brazil into crisis. The PMDB guarantees the government's majority in Congress and a withdrawal of support would put in doubt reviews of the constitution and fiscal reform due to start later this year. Another reason for the PMDB's delay was concern that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, was preparing an economic 'shock' plan to tackle inflation, running at an annual 2,000 per cent. Mr Cardoso had intended to address the nation on television tomorrow to give an update on Brazil's economic situation. He is now thought to have cancelled the TV appearance in a bid to stop speculation about 'shock' plans.</p>

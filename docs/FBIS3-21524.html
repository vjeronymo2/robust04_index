There Is No Money and No Work"]    [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The situation in the  military-industrial complex' Siberian domains is becoming  explosive: The many-thousands-strong collective of one of thje  biggest production facilities in the Russian defense industry --  the Krasnoyarsk Machine Building Plant, a state enterprise upon  which an order has been conferred -- is in a state of turmoil.  The missile builders are taking a tough stand and demanding  money and work.    On the last working day of last week around 500 people  "besieged" the plant's management, and by evening practically  the entire shift at the Krasnoyarsk Machinebuilding Plant was  participating in an emergency meeting. General Director V.  Gupalov was taken to hospital for intensive care, suffering from  an attack of angina pectoris. The disturbances spilled over  from the territory of the secret plant onto the streets; workers  went off to see the governor in search of the truth, threatening  to blockade the kray administration building and seal off the  roads if he did not help immediately.    There was another meeting on Monday where, as the "Krasmash"  directors informed IZVESTIYA, the collective by and large agreed  with the proposals made by the plant's leadership for  stabilizing the situation. Gupalov flew to Moscow. It has been  said that the government has allocated money. But this money  has not appeared yet. So a new outburst of passions may occur  at any moment.    "Krasmash's" customer -- the Ministry of Defense -- has  failed to pay the missile manufacturers 11.3 billion rubles [R]  for the state order carried out last year. Wages have not been  paid for four months, and there is no money for the absolute  essentials.    Technical Director L. Kovrigin told IZVESTIYA that the plant  leadership has appealed to the president, the premier, the  Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Finance. At the end of  December V. Chernomyrdin gave instructions for the debts to be  paid off during January. Security Council Secretary O. Lobov  reported that the president wrote the following resolution on  the appeal from the missile manufacturers: For immediate and  strict implementation. Nevertheless, the plant has not received  the money.    The director's order on the closure of the assembly shops as  of 15 February for six weeks -- as it stands at the moment --  has added fuel to the flames. Those who have not taken  enforced leave will work three days a week (until now the plant  has had a four-day week). The point is that in recent years,  the Ministry of Finance has not only not been in a hurry to  settle its accounts, but even to conclude contracts with the  plant. Under the law on the state order, "Krasmash" should  obtain a contract two years before the manufacturing deadline,  since the cycle of manufacture of the articles takes up more  than one year. The plant was meant to have been given an  advance by 1 February for the purchase of vital materials. The  contract has still not been signed and the money has not been  transferred. This practice has become the norm. Others would  doubtless interpret it as the fact that their services are no  longer needed. But "Krasmash" has continued to selflessly forge  the motherland's missile shield. The conversion of the leading  brains in the military-industrial complex is a very difficult  matter. Judging by his behavior, which is not consonant with  the economic situation, the general director is continuing to be  more worried about the Russian defense capability than about the  fate of the labor collective entrusted to him. The director has  remained a general, but has not become an entrepreneur. Which  may be pleasant to the state, but not to the workers, the  reserves of whose selfless devotion have run dry.    At the moment it is the local authorities who are settling  up  for the debts to the military-industrial complex. Governor V.  Zubov has allocated 1 billion to the machine builders. This will  be enough to pay October's wages and part of November's. The  missile builders have received assistance from the budget by  dint of their strength, although the situation of other groups  in the population is scarcely much better. Workers in high  schools, colleges, and universities are in a state of combat  readiness for mass protest actions. The list of enterprises in  the kray which have come to a standstill or are working at  half-strength is breath-taking. The ship-building plant has  just stopped carrying out the military order, and its workers  have been sent off on a three-week vacation. The trade union  committee has of course put forward some demands... The  professional guardians of the people are increasingly feeling  that they are "in their element." The unforgettable appeal to  the proletariat to unite is in use again. Communists are  proposing to extend the spheres of influence of the strike  committees, and the executive committee of the "Trudovoye  Krasnoyarye" movement is appealing for the formation of a united  city strike committee.    The revolt at "Krasmash" has been brewing for a long time  and  seems to be entirely natural. At one time the empire of the  missile builders had been divided into six plants, and in a  single year of their free existence, matters took an upward turn  for capable people. But in 1992, under pressure from the  Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Industry, the State  Committee for the Management of State Property scorned the laws,  the opinion of the labor collectives, and economic expediency,  and drove five plants into the stable of the military-industrial  complex once again, thereby placing them under a single boss.  Having glued together an unviable monster, the state has not  nevertheless even determined whether it needs "the most  important strategic output," on whose production "Krasmash" has  the monopoly. No money is being found to pay for it. Well, if  even the instructions of the president and the prime minister  are not being carried out, should the basic production be carved  up for scrap? After all, in principle it cannot respecialize.  Or does Russia still need ballistic missiles for submarines and  other complex military output? Why does the state allow chiefs  of shops and workers and officials at local level to be  tormented by these questions?    In the past we use to be called Upper Volta with missiles. I  don't know about the Volta bit, although I suppose there is a  similarity, but all the indications are that it may be tough as  regards the missiles.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOURCES OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY  </P> <P> It came as a shock but not a surprise to learn in Gregory Nowell's commentary  (Aug. 31) that oil companies are trying to block the state Air Resources Board  plan to require that methanol be made available at 300 gasoline stations. But  there is an even more compelling reason than cleaning up the air to break our  addiction to gasoline.  </P> <P> Our dependence on foreign oil will soon increase drastically, since at the  present rate of consumption all U.S. oil may be gone in 32 years according to  Department of the Interior Geologic Survey.  </P> <P> But Nowell's suggestion to call the Air Quality Management District hot line  and protest the oil companies' attempt would interfere with the line's  important function. Letters to the AQMD or the ARB urging the plan be approved  at the Sept. 27 meeting would be more effective (as well as letters to auto  manufacturers requesting methanol-capable engines).  </P> <P> Until methanol becomes more widely available, we can each take immediate  actions to reduce our gas consumption by 1) decreasing our maximum speed  (especially vans and other vehicles with high wind resistance), 2) avoiding  jack-rabbit starts and 3) looking ahead to try to coast to a stop since every  braking is lost energy.  </P> <P> EARL BUDIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey </F> Kozyrev correspondent Mikhail Svetlichnyy at Moscow airport on  17 April; from the "Itogi" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] Last week was marked by  a sharp deterioration of the situation in Bosnia, where fighting  between Serbs and Muslims has resumed, leading to several NATO  air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. The Russian  interpretation of the present situation and a new initiative  from Russia to settle the crisis was set out in an exclusive  interview to "Itogi" given by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who returned to Moscow from Belgrade several hours ago.    [Svetlichnyy] Are we talking about a sticking plaster job or  some new initiatives from Russia?    [Kozyrev] We are talking about an initiative from Russia,  which, unfortunately does resemble a sticking plaster job, when,  after provocations from a Muslim warring group in Gorazde, the  Serbs started using heavy artillery against the town, including  the site where UN observers were deployed.    The next step toward worsening the situation was made by  NATO, which, in an equally inappropriate and uncalculated  manner, and I would say, with the same level of responsibility  as the warring sides, carried out two air strikes, which was  obviously tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. It is possible  that the fighters there were just waiting for something like  that to happen in order to have a free hand and escape from the  control of the political leadership.    And so for a week Vitaliy Churkin -- but I must add that he  was together with Charles Redman, the U.S. special  envoy...[pauses] The French are now also actively involved. We  are maintaining constant contact with French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe. Fortunately, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic  was, in essence, willing to accept the range of measures that we  had proposed. This is an initiative by President Yeltsin -- I  mean my trip to see Slobodan Milosevic. And the range of  measures has been precisely determined and coordinated. They  include the lifting of the blockade of Gorazde. Then, there  must be an agreement on the cessation of hostile actions along  the entire front line to avoid having to jump from one crisis to  another -- Sarajevo today, Gorazde tomorrow, and there will be  plenty of other towns after tomorrow -- so, an agreement on a  cease-fire along the entire front line.    This will create a situation conducive to further  negotiations on a political settlement.    Therefore, Russia will put all its political weight in favor  of this option. But I would like to note that every step by the  Serb side will be accompanied by appropriate, decisive pressure  on our part about the lifting of sanctions. And both this plan,  the process and the plan to lift the sanctions are fully  coordinated and are well known. And I think that our Western  partners have a better understanding of the need for such a  consistent approach.    [Svetlichnyy] This week, both in the State Duma and in  various political circles here in Moscow, there has been  discussion concerning Russia not having been informed about the  bombing. Could you perhaps say now that such actions on the  part of NATO, without prior notification to the Russian side,  are completely ruled out?    And the second question, as I said, after Russia was not  informed, in Bosnia and in Yugoslavia, some circles, generally  speaking, started to adopt a pretty skeptical attitude toward  the role of Russia. Has this action also not had an effect on  diminishing Russia's influence in this conflict?    [Kozyrev] Well, first, I want to reply that we are acting in  close contact with the State Duma and the Federation Council.  Yesterday, at our request, and as a result of joint work, both  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, and State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin sent a message to the leaders of the  parliaments of Yugoslavia, both of Serbia and of the Bosnian  Serbs. The Russian Orthodox Church also put forward an  initiative of this kind.    So, I think that Russia has in fact become almost the only  powerful player on this stage that is not stained with  irresponsible actions, and it is for this reason that Vitaliy  Churkin is right there where the issue is being decided.    Now, with regard to notification about the strikes, then on  this occasion we were au fait with events. We are aware that  Yasushi Akashi, the deputy UN secretary general, who is managing  the operation in Bosnia had asked for air support -- yesterday  at about 1700, after the Bosnian Serbs -- and this must be made  clear -- mounted another artillery attack on Gorazde -- which is  of course impermissible -- and after about 150 UN servicemen  found themselves blockaded.    Things went so depressingly far that in Sarajevo area the  Serbs, Serb fighters threatened our subunit of Russian  peacekeepers with weapons. In other words, I think this shows  with utmost clarity the degree of irresponsibility of Serb  fighters.    But as a result of these consultations we were able to  persuade both the United Nations and our NATO partners to stay  cool this time. After all, consultations are needed not simply  to say: Well, bomb them if you like, provided you have consulted  us. Consultations are needed in order to exhaust all  possibilities. If NATO has no other alternative but to send a  fighter aircraft or a bomber, we, rather, have a possibility --  in any case, we do not mind taking a flight in the evening in  order to have night talks with the political leadership and to  try to find a different solution, after all. Well, each has his  own way, but that is exactly why we say that Russia must be  consulted and that we should act together.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Haeju Cement Plant workers, who are marking the  significant day of the 30th anniversary of dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il's on-the-spot guidance, are accelerating production  with great gratitude and joy.    In a meeting with reporter Yun Tong-kon of the Central  Broadcasting Network, Comrade Cho Tok-yun, secretary of the  elementary party committee, said:    [Begin recording] It has been 30 years since the dear  comrade leader, who visited our Haeju Cement Plant with the  great leader, gave his historic on-the-spot guidance.    I can still recall the gratitude of 28 May 1964, when the  dear comrade leader visited our Haeju Cement Plant and checked  the production capacity and operation status of the production  equipment, and taught us about the position and importance of  Haeju Cement Plant.    The dear comrade leader taught us that Haeju Cement Plant  should repair and reinforce the production process in the future  and apply active modern calcination methods. The dear comrade  leader also said production was important, but it was more  urgent to build housing units to improve the workers' living  conditions.    Thanks to the wise leadership and warm care of the great  leader and the dear comrade leader, our Haeju Cement Plant has  steadily improved in a truly glorious manner for the past 30  years. The development history of our plant was only possible  due to the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader.    As in the past, the working class of our plant is resolved  to  share a significant role in carrying out our party's trade-first  policy by taking only the leadership of the dear comrade leader  as guidance and waging a struggle to implement his guidance with  all wisdom and zeal.

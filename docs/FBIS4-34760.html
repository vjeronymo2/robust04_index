			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Approximately 200 U.S. citizens, members of the  second Freedom to Travel flight, will arrive in Cuba on 23 June  to visit sites of economic, historic, and social interest.  These U.S. citizens are exercising their constitutional rights  to travel anywhere in the world and to reject the blockade  against Cuba. Freedom to Travel members are challenging a U.S.  law on visiting Cuba and face a possible 10-year prison term and  fines of up to $250,000. The first such trip to Havana took  place in November 1993 and included 165 citizens from over 25  different U.S. states. This visit is sponsored by the Cuban  Institute of Friendship with Peoples with the help of the Union  of Young Communists and the Pablo Milanes Foundation.</p>

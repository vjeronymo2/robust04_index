			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) </F> Spokesman Denouncing the Continued implementation by the Hanoi  Communist Vietnamese of the Indochinese Federation Strategy to  Occupy Cambodia Under the Label of their Criminal Military  Cooperation Between Vietnam and Cambodia;" dated 1 April -- read  by announcer]    [Text] I. On 30 march 1994, the communist Vietnamese  summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat to Hanoi to receive  orders for the puppets and lackeys and the two-headed government  to allow communist Vietnamese and all kinds of weapons,  particularly tanks, armored vehicles, multiple rockets  batteries, and artillery pieces to flow into Cambodia. This is  for continued offensives against the people and the Cambodian  national resistance forces through the strategic policy of the  Communist Party of Vietnam and the alliance and to continue  fueling the war against peace, national reconciliation, and the  king.    It is still remembered that in early March, the communist  Vietnamese already summoned puppet Chea Sim to Hanoi. At that  time puppet Chea Sim was ordered to use his titles of so-called  acting head of state and assembly chairman to sign documents  legitimizing Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia. This  is done through, first, a demographic war by opening up  Cambodia's eastern border to more Vietnamese nationals; second,  through the annexation of large chunks of Cambodia's land and  maritime borders; and third, through a military war by allowing  the communist Vietnamese to bring various weapons into Cambodia  under the label of military cooperation with Cambodia to join  the mischievous alliance and continue to fuel the war. This is  done to enable the comnmunist Vietnamese to continue annexing  and exterminating the Cambodian race through the Indochinese  federation strategy, which Vietnam calls special friendship  among the three brother countries like teeth and tongue of the  late Ho Chi Minh.    Now the Vietnamese have summoned puppets Tie Banh and Tea  Chamrat, who are the so-called co-ministers of national defense  of the two-headed government, to Hanoi to concretely implement  what they have ordered puppet Chea Sim to sign.    II. The communist Vietnamese, their puppets and lackeys, the  alliance, and the two-headed government are panicking, now that  their invading forces are being disgracefully attacked,  defeated, and inflicted serious damage in terms of troops,  command posts, and weapons on the Anlung Veng battlefield. They  are being pushed toward more serious defeats on the Pailin  battlefield.    This is why their puppets, the communist Vietnamese, and the  mischievous alliance are running about frantically and are  carrying out all kinds of military, political, economic, and  diplomatic, and psychological propaganda activities to get out  of their successive setbacks against the fighting and opposition  by the Cambodian nation and people and the Democratic Kampuchean  national resistance forces. They are trying to extricate  themselves so that they can continue to fuel the war with one  hand pushing puppet Cambodians to attack nationalist Cambodians,  and the other allowing Vietnamese nationals up to four, five,  six millions and more to flow into Cambodia at will.    One day after another, the entire Cambodian nation and  people  in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad more clearly  realize the face of the Vietnamese and their allies as the ones  who oppose peace, national reconciliation, and Cambodia's  independence. They have been trying to hide all this under the  elections organized by UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia] and the two-headed government.    In this situation the PDK appeals to the entire Cambodian  nation and people to continue carrying out all kinds of  activities everywhere and through every means to oppose the  communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys, the alliance  and its puppets, to prevent the communist Vietnamese from  achieving their Indochinese federation strategy through any form  to annex and exterminate our Cambodian race.    Furthermore, the PDK appeals to peace-and justice-loving  countries and people the world over to take concrete measures in  every form to prevent the communist Vietnamese and their allies  from fueling the war of aggression in Cambodia to kill people  and the resistance forces. This not only destroys Cambodia's  sovereignty and independence and exterminates the Cambodian  race, a nation and a country that is a member of the United  Nations, it also threatens the security and stability in the  entire Southeast Asian and Pacific region now and in the future.    [Dated] 1 April 1994    [Signed] PDK spokesman</p>

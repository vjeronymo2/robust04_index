			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: American strike brings chaos to US airports The strike by flight attendants at American Airlines enters its second week today with unions and management no nearer agreement, and thousands of flights still delayed or cancelled because of the industrial action, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Yesterday Mr Robert Crandall, chief executive of American, the largest US carrier, estimated that this week nearly half the airline's scheduled flights would leave with passengers. Until now, many flights have been cancelled or have left without passengers because of lack of attendants. The percentage of flights leaving on schedule would be higher at its hub airports, which include Dallas-Forth Worth, Chicago and Miami. American also claimed a growing number of attendants were returning to work, but the attendants' union said 95 per cent of its members were still on strike. The strike, which is due to continue until the end of this week, has stranded thousands of passengers. Competing airlines, including Continental, Delta and Northwest, have scheduled extra domestic flights and said they will honour any valid ticket endorsed by American. On international flights, British Airways, and Virgin have also said they will honour endorsed American tickets. POLAND: Flights between London and Warsaw are still heavily disrupted by the dispute between the British and Polish governments over landing rights. British Airways has been banned from flying to Warsaw, while Polish Airlines has been denied access to Heathrow. BA is flying passengers to Frankfurt and then bussing them to Warsaw. SPAIN: A national strike planned for Thursday could severly disrupt travel. BELGIUM: On Friday Belgian unions are threating a national strike in protest at the government's austerity plan. FRANCE: Public sector unions plan further strikes against privatisation plans. NIGERIA: The situation is very tense following the announcement of a military government, the dissolution of all democratic institutions and the banning of all political parties. Non-essential visits should be postponed. An indefinite national strike is disrupting business and services, internal travel and international flights. Industrial action might escalate to rioting, especially in the south west. Residents should exercise caution. There is a high incidence of street crime and armed robberies, especially in Lagos and the south. Travelling outside cities after dark is unsafe. Fraud is commonplace. Business people should check credentials of Nigerian contacts thoroughly. Those in doubt should consult the Department of Trade and Industry (Nigerian Desk, tel: 071-215-4966). MEXICO: Robbery in Mexico City and other major urban areas is commonplace. There is particular risk on the metro (underground) and around bus stations. Only official airport taxis should be used. Take special care when using taxis late at night. Because of incidents of robbery, visitors are advised that excepting travel on first class buses on the 'Cuota' highways, it is unsafe to travel on roads outside major cities at night, and on the following roads at any time: coast road between Acapulco and Puerto Escondido Highway 37 from Uruapan to Playa Azul (Particularly in the State of Guerrero) Highway 51 from Zitacuaro to Huetamo in Michoacan roads in the Yucatan Peninsula, especially Route 180 from Merida to Campeche and Route 186 from Chetumal to Villahermosa. Avoid isolated beaches (Particularly around Puerto Escondido). GUINEA: Tension remains high in the run-up to December 5 presidential elections. No reports of violence in or around Conakry since disturbances in October, but caution advised.

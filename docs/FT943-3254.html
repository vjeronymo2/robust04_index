			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US anti-dumping battle predicted US multinational companies and subsidiaries of foreign companies in the US have mounted a lobbying effort against an obscure provision in the Uruguay Round aimed at implementing legislation which they said would lead to the levying of punitive anti-dumping duties on imported products. The European-American Chamber of Commerce, one of the industry groups mobilised for the fight, said the proposed export sales price (ESP) amendment in the Senate version of the implementing legislation discriminates against multinational companies that have operations on both sides of the Atlantic. The provision is in a final version of the Uruguay Round legislation still being hammered out in a House-Senate committee. The committee is expected to send it to the White House in the next two weeks. The president will then almost immediately submit the legislation to Congress under fast-track authority, which means Congress must vote yes or no but cannot amend it. The ESP provision would amend current US dumping law and change the way prices are calculated to determine whether foreign goods are being 'dumped' in the US market. The proposal is supported by Senator Ernest Hollings, an unabashed protectionist, as well as Senator Max Baucus, usually a free trader who chairs the trade subcommittee. Domestic US companies in favour of the provision, include steel and ball bearing makers which mostly supply the US market, are calling for a strengthening of US trade laws to protect US companies from 'predatory' practices. Clinton administration officials have expressed concern but hesitate to weigh in while they are rounding up votes for final passage of the Uruguay Round package.</p>

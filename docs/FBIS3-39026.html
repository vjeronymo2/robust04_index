			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eric Zemmour report: "European Elections -- The Single </F> List? Matter Closed in the Republican Party"]    [Text] The Republican Party [PR], which held a National  Council meeting at the Mutualite yesterday, demanded the  formation of a single majority list for the coming European  elections. A list headed by Jean-Francois Deniau.    This is the story of a National Council meeting which came  too late. Or too soon. Too late, because the PR leaders --  Gerard Longuet and Philippe Vasseur -- had set this cumbersome  mechanism in motion to prevent the formation of an autonomous  UDF [Union for French Democracy] list headed by Giscard  d'Estaing at the UDF National Council meeting scheduled for 19  February. However, since then, the former president of the  republic has given up this idea and his remaining supporters in  the UDF seem to accept the principle of a single majority list  in the forthcoming European elections.    But this PR National Council meeting also came too soon: The  party cadres meeting in Paris were thinking more of the cantonal  elections next March; Giscard and Chirac will not meet until  tomorrow; and it is not yet known whether Edouard Balladur will  still be strong enough in two months' time to impose a single  list on the RPR [Rally for the Republic]; and if either will  still want it.    This inopportune timetable produced a National Council  meeting without an issue, without a debate, and without  interest. For instance, the PR had launched a wide-ranging  consultation of its members on the European program which was  intended to be "exemplary," but which, despite thousands of  amendments sent in for weeks, ended in a unanimous show of  hands. Similarly, the deliberately "blue, white, and red" final  text tries to answer the opposing objectives of "the new  frontier" to the East, so dear to Philippe Seguin, and that of  the single currency shared by four or five countries proposed by  Maastricht's supporters, and urges a stronger Community  protection but at the same time a move to put the Brussels  Commission in its place.    Finally, the question of the single list raised virtually no  problem. Of course, Charles Million once again -- without  saying it explicitly -- argued enthusiastically for the  formation of two RPR and UDF lists: "The European debate  concerns us, because it cannot be stifled by tactics or by  resignation or reduced to mutual concessions on a minimum  program.... Europe is worth a debate. Let us not lock  ourselves into a petty political game."  <H5>  Tactical Choices </H5>   But the debate on the debate did not take place. Giscard's  supporters know that the fate of the two lists is in the hands  of the RPR alone and its tactical choices in its struggle  against Balladur. In these conditions, the ministers had no  difficulty in imposing a single list, with the simplistic tone  so dear to the advertisements advocating the privatization of  Elf: "Who can doubt that we would defend our interests better  if we are separated, when we have a single government, and a  single majority?" Francois Leotard seems to be asking.  "France's voice must be heard strongly in the Strasbourg  Assembly," Gerard Longuet said without even a hint of doubt.  "The French public and especially the European public must be  presented with a union list expressing the solidarity and  strength of our majority."  <H5>  Opinion Poll Wars </H5>   The matter was therefore settled. In advance. The party  cadres, who will need the RPR's votes in next March's canton  elections, had to heed this message of unity. Having triumphed  without fighting on the essential issue, the PR leadership could  make some concessions to the Giscard clan. First, the pledge by  all members on the list to take their seats in Strasbourg. That  rules out [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe as head of the list.  And at the same time it settles the quarrels on precedence  within the RPR with Philippe Seguin. Furthermore, the assurance  that all the future French elected representatives will join the  same group -- the PPE [European People's Party] -- to help form  the "liberal Europe" so dear to Alain Madelin.    That only left the question of who would head the list. It  is know that the PR is pushing Jean-Francois Deniau, and the CDS  [Social Democratic Center] Dominique Baudis. For several days,  the opinion poll war has been raging, each having its own,  naturally favorable to its candidate. But the PR, which proudly  proclaims that it is the "second party in France," after the  RPR, has an undoubted numerical superiority, in members and  deputies, over the centrist party. And it intends to use it.  That is why the PR made do yesterday, through Gerard Longuet,  with referring the choice of candidate to the "confederation's  competent bodies."    Gerard Longuet does not want to violate the UDF, he simply  wants to dominate it, for instance to be president of it in 1995  when Giscard no longer is. Meanwhile, he is showing his  strength. He is asking the UDF to choose Deniau at a political  office meeting or at its next National Council meeting on 19  February. Or later. It does not really matter when, the  important thing is to be as strong as possible with a view to  the big bargaining session which will preceed or follow the 1995  presidential election.</p>

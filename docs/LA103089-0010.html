			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS CAN'T BREAK THEIR FALL, 20-10  </P> <P> The Rams extended the wrong losing streak here, theirs, and showed no signs of  stopping at three with capable streak-stretchers such as the Minnesota Vikings  and New York Giants next on the schedule.  </P> <P> If the Rams were planning on playing this season in bunches -- five consecutive  victories here, five consecutive losses there -- they seem smack-dab in the  bunch that's rotting off the vine.  </P> <P> Remember, the Chicago Bears were working through their own mini-dramas Sunday,  attempting to shake the effects of a three-game losing streak, an  injury-depleted defense and a quarterback controversy that officially broke out  with 5:50 left in the half, when Jim Harbaugh replaced Mike Tomczak.  </P> <P> Still, the Bears had plenty left to defeat the Rams, 20-10, in front of 65,506  at Soldier Field.  </P> <P> The Rams are in need of a football repairman. Their third consecutive loss was  similar to the first two; the Rams couldn't stop the rush, run the ball, or  keep balls from flying over their cornerbacks' heads.  </P> <P> Stop themselves? The Rams did that well.  </P> <P> There were glimmers of progress, especially on defense, as the Rams played the  Bears to a 3-3 snug-fest late into the third quarter. But two big pass plays  later, one over corner LeRoy Irvin, the other over corner Jerry Gray, set up  the touchdown and field goal that sent the Rams to their corner.  </P> <P> As opposed to past weeks, when sieve was the operative word in describing the  Rams' defense, the secondary held its own for nearly three quarters before  giving in. A fine week for the offense not to show up.  </P> <P> "I've been in the league 10 years and every day shows up in my face," Irvin  said later. "I wonder what I'll look like tomorrow?"  </P> <P> Bear defensive end Richard Dent, by the way, was able to wrap up a sore thigh  and play some, leaving a piece of his helmet in tailback Greg Bell's chest on  one vicious third-quarter tackle -- you had to hear it to believe it -- while  also chipping in with a fumble recovery and a sack of Jim Everett.  </P> <P> Sacks are becoming old hat for recent Ram opponents, an effective wrench thrown  into what was once an effective offensive machine. The Bears took Everett down  three times Sunday, making that 10 sacks against the Rams in three weeks.  Everett was sacked only eight times in the first five games, all victories.  </P> <P> Do you sense any connection?  </P> <P> With the running game limping along with 84 more net yards Sunday, Everett is  left to the mercy of the rush.  </P> <P> "It makes sense," Everett said of the strategy. "It's something we have to deal  with, especially with Minnesota next week. I'm sure you'll see them do the same  thing."  </P> <P> Everett, rushed on many of his timing passes, completed only 13 of 35 passes  for 185 yards with two interceptions. He has completed 46% of his passes in the  losing streak, 65% in the five victories.  </P> <P> "He's like all the rest of us," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "We're a football  team out of sync. We were sailing along for a while."  </P> <P> Now, all masts are down.  </P> <P> Sunday's game didn't get going until late in the third quarter, both teams  mired in a defensive struggle highlighted only by Bear Coach Mike Ditka's  second-quarter decision to replace Tomczak with Harbaugh, although it couldn't  be considered a stroke of genius.  </P> <P> Tomczak threw 11 consecutive incompletions at one point in the half, making the  decision almost unavoidable.  </P> <P> Harbaugh was a spark, no doubt, leading the Bears on a second-quarter march to  a field goal, which tied the score, 3-3.  </P> <P> How was Tomczak taking it?  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get down every time something goes wrong," he said. "I didn't  have a first half and it showed. That's why he took me out. I was excited, even  though, because we started to put points on the board."  </P> <P> The Rams had their best chance in the third quarter, with a first and 10 on the  Bears' 43-yard line in a 3-3 game.  </P> <P> Bell, who didn't start because of lower back strain, fumbled when the ball was  stripped from him by William Perry, Dent recovering at the 44. It was only  Bell's second fumble in 147 carries this season, but the timing couldn't have  been worse.  </P> <P> Harbaugh took over and marched the other way, the key play a 24-yard pass  interference call on Rams' safety Anthony Newman, accused of jumping over tight  end Cap Boso's back at the Ram 24. The flag was thrown late, much to Newman's  dismay.  </P> <P> "I touched the ball before I touched him," Newman claimed later. "The flag  seemed to come five minutes later. There were no flags when I first looked. I  guess that's part of football. Flags happen."  </P> <P> After using a 14-yard pass to fullback Brad Muster to get inside the Ram five,  the Bears scored on third down on a one-yard Muster run, giving the Bears their  first lead at 10-3 with 39 seconds left in the quarter.  </P> <P> The Rams went three-plays-and-out on their next possession, with the Bears  taking over on their 30. Chicago moved to the Rams' 37, where Harbaugh burned  Irvin on third and six by lofting a 36-yard pass to Wendell Davis. Harbaugh  dived in from the one, making it 17-3 with 11:11 left.  </P> <P> The Rams cut the lead to seven on a one-yard Bell run with 6:03 remaining, but  the Bears came back, Harbaugh hitting Dennis McKinnon on a 41-yard pass over  Gray to set up Kevin Butler's 46-yard field goal with 2:47 left.  </P> <P> "In the fourth quarter, two passes were thrown over our head and basically took  us out of any chance to win," Robinson concluded.  </P> <P> Irvin concluded three good quarters of defense weren't good enough.  </P> <P> "People have lost respect for us," Irvin said. "That's what hurts. We're not  dominating anybody. We had Buffalo on the ropes and let them off. We had these  guys on the ropes and let them off the ropes. It hurts."  </P> <P> It's no secret that the Rams haven't had much spunk since the dramatic Monday  night loss to Buffalo two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It all started in Buffalo, mentally, losing that type of game," Everett  conceded.  </P> <P> And another one Sunday, three in a row if you're keeping tabs. And another long  plane ride home.  </P> <P> "This is not the game to point fingers," said Bell, limited to 32 yards in 12  carries. "Everyone here lost this game."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Dale Hatcher probably saved his job with a strong kicking effort, finishing  with a 44.4 average in seven punts. Hatcher entered the game as the National  Football Conference's lowest-rated punter. "I made up my mind, I knew I was up  against the wall," Hatcher said. "This was a good test to see what I was made  of. I prayed about it a lot." Hatcher said he wasn't nervous beforehand, even  knowing his career possibly lay in the balance. "I was more nervous in practice  than here," he said. "I just had that good feeling. That's the real me. That's  the way I should be kicking."  </P> <P> Bear quarterback Jim Harbaugh completed 10 of 13 passes for 157 yards. When  Tomczak left, he had completed only four of 16 passes for 29 yards. . . . The  Rams reported no serious injuries. . . . Gaston Green started the game at  tailback but was out after five carries and 14 yards.  </P> <P> Greg Bell said afterward his back felt fine in warmups and that he could have  started. "He's been making the decisions about how he wants to play me," Bell  said of Robinson. "I didn't question his decision." Bell, however, did make it  clear he wanted to play. "I just kept standing in front, helmet in hand," he  said. "I was getting antsy."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters believed that &sect;690.83(e) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations does not comply with the statute because, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing section 487(c)(7) of the HEA, it places undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on an institution seeking additional funds which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would have been eligible to receive if it had met  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Pell Grant Program reporting deadlines. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the Secretary had unduly limited the scope of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 487(c)(7) of the HEA by making the provision of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable only to funds received under the Federal Pell Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that the proposed rule in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;690.83(e) is in accordance with the program statute. When an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's auditor identifies underreported Federal Pell Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures beyond the normal reporting and reconciliation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadlines for the Federal Pell Grant Program, &sect;690.83(e) provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a mechanism for an institution to receive credit for having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly expended those funds. Congress intended that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution have such a mechanism available. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that Congress intended for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting recaptures of properly expended funds to continue in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perpetuity. In order for the Department to complete its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting for the Federal Pell Grant Program appropriations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are expected to timely reconcile the expenditures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the award year, with a final accounting made on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before September 30. The procedures in &sect;690.83(e) will provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further opportunity for an institution to seek credit for having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly expended these funds during a prior award year, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes it is appropriate to limit the circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and timing for receiving credit for such prior expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, &sect;690.83(e) is limited to the Federal Pell Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program because the auditing procedure permitted under &sect;690.83(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in an adjustment to the institution's prior year funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization for the Federal Pell Grant Program. There is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding capability to adjust prior year funding for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters disagreed with the Department's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation of the annual public reporting and recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden contained in the regulations. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questioned whether the Department had complied with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations in 5 CFR part 1320. This commenter also believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that students should be considered in computing the burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's computation of the annual public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting and recordkeeping burden in the regulations is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate based on the best information available. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified sections of the regulations containing information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection requirements in the preamble to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and complied with all applicable requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing regulations in 5 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 1320. The Department appreciates the additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by commenters regarding the estimated burden. To the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that commenters identified specific regulatory provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as imposing burdens or provided estimates of the amount of burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed, this information has been considered in developing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations. The Department did not consider students in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing the estimated burden of the information collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the regulations because the regulations govern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary institutions participating in the Title IV student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial assistance programs. If any burden is imposed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, it is indirect and not subject to computation under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act. As a result of the comments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions to the regulations, the Department is modifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden estimates. The total annual reporting and recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden that would result from the collection of the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is 123,485 burden hours for the package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRMs, the Secretary certified that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a substantial number of small entities. Several commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that this statement was erroneous and that these rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will definitely have a significant impact on institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially the smaller ones that are not computerized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary recognizes that the regulations will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an impact on small institutions. However, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department estimates of the impact, the Secretary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the impact will be disproportionately or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically significant. The Secretary therefore reaffirms his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification that the regulations would not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact or a substantial significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities. To the extent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters are able to provide additional information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact of the regulations, the Secretary invites the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters to submit this information so that it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in reviewing the regulations to reduce regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the final regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are those resulting from statutory requirements and those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently.

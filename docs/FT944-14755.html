			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Number of omissions in government's 'rosy' view of its immigration policy Sir, The letter by Nicholas Baker, immigration minister, (October 20) contains a number of omissions in its rosy portrait of the Conservatives' immigration and asylum policy. He says that detention powers under the 1971 Immigration Act 'are exercised only when there are good grounds for believing that the person will not comply with any conditions imposed, if released'. What he fails to point out is that the decision to detain is made without reference or accountability to any independent review body. That such decisions are left to the discretion of immigration officers with no or little grounding in human rights and foreign affairs is a situation which needs to be remedied. Not one of the 50 detainees who were the subject of Amnesty International's report was given full written explanations of their rights and how to exercise them. How can the minister claim that Britain 'complies with its obligation under international conventions to which it is a signatory' when international standards require that all detainees be fully informed of their rights and how to use them? This begs the question of whether immigration officials making these decisions are actually themselves aware of the rights of detainees? Mr Baker further claims that: 'Detention is a necessary part of a policy of firm and fair immigration control.' This slogan might be passable if detention were to occur in a humanitarian manner. Unfortunately it does not. How can the Home Office justify the fact that more than one third of all those detained are held in prisons and can be treated far worse than the common criminal charged with a serious offence? Surely detention ought to take place in recognised and properly equipped detention centres? Labour would seek to adopt a fairer system so that detention was used only in the most pressing circumstances as an absolute last resort. We would also ensure that detainees were treated humanely and given their due rights in line with the UK's international and European commitments. This would include a known limit to the length of time for which detainees could be held and special attention to the physical and mental health of detainees. Ahead of the UK introducing a bill of rights, there is much that could be done to ensure that people desperately fleeing from persecution in their own land are given safe haven if they escape to Britain. Fair treatment requires a government that takes its human rights responsibilities seriously. Graham Allen, Labour spokesperson on immigration, House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA</p>

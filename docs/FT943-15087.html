			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Seat subsidy fixed at Pta38bn The Spanish government and Catalan regional government are to provide Pta38bn (Pounds 189m) in state subsidies for Volkswagen's heavily loss-making Spanish subsidiary, Seat, under an agreement signed in Madrid last night. The deal, described as conforming with EU guidelines on subsidies, commits VW to maintaining Seat's research and development in Spain but puts no fresh obstacles in VW's path in terms of plant and work force restructuring. The German car maker intends to cut 4,000 jobs by the end of this year, shut the 40-year-old Zona Franca assembly plant in Barcelona and concentrate all car production in a new facility at nearby Martorell. The Spanish government is providing Pta30bn of the funds over a four-year period through the Official Credit Institute (ICO). Catalonia is putting up the remaining Pta8bn. A key condition of the funding is that it must be invested in Seat's development, not used to finance job cuts. 'Seat will continue as a major vehicle assembler' as a result of the agreement, Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, Spanish industry minister, said following last night's signing.</p>

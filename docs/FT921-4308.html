			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Observer: Scheduled plight Unlike British Airways' dalliance with KLM, the protracted affair between Air France and Sabena is still on schedule for the altar. Lunching together in Paris, Sabena president Pierre Godfroid and Air France chairman Bernard Attali both attested that their troth remains plighted, although there will probably be a trial marriage in which the French partner takes a big minority share in the Belgian before the two parts beat equally as one. Attali noted that long engagements often make happy marriages. Godfroid said he hoped the last political hurdles in Belgium would soon be overcome so that the wedding bells may ring. One of the snags from the French point of view, however, is what might be called a heavy father-in-law problem. Under Sabena's statutes, King Baudouin of the Belgians has veto rights on decisions affecting the airline. As good republicans, the French want the statutes changed and the regal veto jettisoned.</p>

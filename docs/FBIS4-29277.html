			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>   [Text] Criticism is mounting over some citizen's rash and  thoughtless action of hoarding provisions against a possible war  amid mounting tension over the North Korean nuclear issue.    Military experts said such reckless acts would only  aggravate  the situation eventually by dancing to the North Korean tune of  psychological warfare.    They said such emergency buying is quite unnecessary because  the North's military preparations for invasion would be  detectable at least three months in advance.    Some people, mainly in wealthy apartment complexes in  Kangnam, south of the Han River, began showing a keen sense of  insecurity this week in sharp contrast to their earlier lack of  concern about national security.    Such a drastic change of attitude was apparently nudged by  the ever-intensifying North Korean stance over the nuclear  issues highlighting withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    Following the reports on the hawkish policy of the North,  lots of people rushed to supermarkets and other stores to buy  such contingency provisions as ramyon (fried instant noodles),  rice, butane gas and medicines.    At the Grand Department Store in Taechi-tong, Kangnam-ku,  all  660 20-kg packs of rice in the store were sold out Tuesday,  compared with an average daily sale of 160 packs. Residents in  the region had to form long lines to buy such daily necessities  as flour, canned food, canned gases and candlesticks etc.    A similar phenomenon took place in other department stores  in  Sanggye-tong in northern Seoul and Sinchon, north of the Han  River.    Small stores are also enjoying profits from a remarkable  increase in sales of such contingency necessities as candles,  matches, batteries, wooden chopsticks and soap.    In an attempt to hang on to as much cash as possible, most  buyers paid with credit cards.    Nhongshim Corp., one of the largest ramyon makers, said it  began producing 30 percent more ramyon than average a day since  this week.    The Bank of Korea also started to issue more cash than in  ordinary time -- 49.3 billion won (61 million dollars) on June  10, 42.8 billion won the next day and 57.4 billion won Monday.    The spread of a sense of instability is also seen in the  increase in the number of people applying for visas for foreign  tours.    A travel agency official said that the application increased  by 30 percent this week, adding, "Most of their planned trips  seemed not to have special purposes."    Military experts said there is no need for the people to buy  a large amount of provisions because during wartime they would  be moved to public places like schools for safety and daily  necessities will be rationed.    They said the current buying spree among some people would  be  of no use if hostilities were to occur, but would only cause  panic among the people.</p>

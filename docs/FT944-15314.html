			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / People: Commercial Union Commercial Union, the large UK general insurance company, is breaking with past practice and appointing a finance director. Peter Foster, 48, will be responsible for group finance, corporate planning and tax. The decision underlines the trend within the financial sector towards appointing board directors with specific responsibilities for the finance side of operations. Finance had been the responsibility of Tony Wyand, executive director, who was also in charge of CU investments. Wyand is now expected to spend an increasing portion of his time in Paris, overseeing the integration into the group of French insurer Groupe Victoire, which CU acquired this summer. Foster was general manager, finance, at CU. He joined the company in 1963.</p>

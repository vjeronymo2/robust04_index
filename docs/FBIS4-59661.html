			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Instructed by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme  commander of the Armed Forces, Local Administration Minister  Muhammad Hasan Dammaz continued his field inspection tours of a  number of areas and districts in the southern governorates of  our country which have been purged from the filth of the  apostate and secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP].    The local administration minister yesterday visited the  Mukayris district in Abyan Governorate. He was welcomed on his  arrival in Mukayris by brother Staff Colonel Muhammad Isma'il  Ahmad, the axis staff officer; Muhammad 'Abd-Rabbuh Dahnan,  commissioner general of the Mukayris district; a number of  district officials; officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers from the 8th Special Forces Brigade; and a large crowd  of citizens from the Mukayris district.    The brother local administration minister visited the 20th  Brigade's camp which had been purged and recovered from the  YSP's apostate and secessionist forces by the men of our Armed  Forces, the gallant heroes of the Special Forces Brigade, and  with the support of citizens supporting the constitutional  legitimacy and Yemeni unity.    Brother Muhammad Hasan Dammaz toured various positions in  the  camp and inspected its strong fortifications, which were built  in accordance with the most up-to-date military systems. He  also visited several weapons stockrooms in various parts of the  camp, which contained thousands of ammunition boxes, weapons,  batteries, artillery pieces, and antiaircraft guns. He also  inspected large numbers of tanks, guns, and automatic machine  guns that have been seized from the 20th Brigade after fierce  battles waged by our Armed Forces against the forces of  injustice and aggression, giving the most glorious examples of  heroism and sacrifice. [passage omitted]    The brother local administration minister also met in the  same camp with the officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers of the 30th Brigade, who, together with their weapons  and equipment, joined our Armed Forces, the forces of justice  and defense of the constitutional legitimacy and unity.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KCBS BUYS REMAINING TICKETS, PUTTING RAM GAME ON TV SUNDAY  </P> <P> Los Angeles will get a Ram-Raider doubleheader on television Sunday.  </P> <P> The Rams announced Thursday that their game against the New Orleans Saints on  Sunday at Anaheim Stadium was a sellout before the 1 p.m. deadline for lifting  the television blackout.  </P> <P> A Ram spokesman said KCBS, which will televise the game here, bought the  remaining tickets. The spokesman did not say how many tickets remained, nor did  a spokeswoman for KCBS.  </P> <P> Reportedly, about 5,000 tickets were still unsold Thursday morning.  </P> <P> The game announcers for the 1 p.m. telecast on Channel 2 will be Steve  Zabriskie and Hank Stram.  </P> <P> KCBS was originally scheduled to show the New York Giant-San Diego Charger game  from San Diego.  </P> <P> The Ram-Saint telecast will follow the Raiders' game against the Eagles at  Philadelphia, which will be on Channel 4 at 10 a.m. Joel Meyers and Paul  Maguire will report.  </P> <P> This is first local telecast of a Ram home game this season. Even Eric  Dickerson's return with the Indianapolis Colts on Sept. 17 wasn't televised  locally. The game didn't sell out, but even if it had, it couldn't have been  televised because of a scheduling snafu. LARRY STEWART  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: The Editing Process - Theatre In The Editing Process, the new play by Meredith Oakes now staged by Stephen Daldry at the Royal Court Theatre, the word 'editing' scarcely if ever occurs. And the concrete practice of editing - of making a literary work suitable for publication - also makes only fleeting appearances. No accident, this. On one level, Oakes is showing us the terrible truth about modern publishing: that all too little of it is actually concerned with the central process of editing. On another level, however, as she shows us the larger processes of a large publishing house, she lets us feel the larger metaphorical sense of 'editing'. Editing, even on a tiny paragraph, has many ingredients: improving, changing, adding, subtracting, deleting. I edit, he edits, they have been edited. The Editing Process is a satire - bitter and tender, very uneven and always interesting - about aspects of modern life. At first it is mainly about the dismaying way in which a serious specialist journalistic endeavour is incorporated into a brash philistine publishing firm; and for any sensitive person with some acquaintance with the ways of modern publishing this is a highly affecting subject. Oakes's treatment, however, is tough and ironic. The little old magazine, Footnotes in History (ho ho) - edited by William, with the support of his long-term secretary, Peggy, who keeps on resigning from her job - is in no way run well. William is lofty, pompous, insensitive, in person and, one presumes, as an editor. But the crass modern establishment in which Footnotes in History finds itself is just as absurd. Its corridors bristle with careerism; and Ted, the assistant editor, proves responsive to the new climate. Later, however, the play's subject becomes redundancy. Peggy must be made redundant; William lacks the guts to tell her. He not only drives her hard towards resignation, he does nothing to woo her back this time when (near the end of Act One) she does resign. In due course (during Act Two), redundancy comes to William too. But whereas Peggy still believes in Footnotes in History with a selfless love, William suddenly feels that his whole career has been a fraud. And, anyway, they are both footnotes in history now. 'Life does go on, doesn't it,' Peggy says; then (my favourite line) 'As soon as one's back is turned, life goes on.' It is by no means a completely realistic play. There are sudden soliloquies amid ensemble scenes; and there are set speeches like arias, set dialogue like duets or stichomythia. The characterisations are complex but not always convincing. Still, its blend of realism, stylisation, and artifice is what Daldry's production emphasises intensely. William, attacking his new boss Lionel, says 'People like you swim in the polluted waters of this company all oblivious, opening and shutting your mouths with the idiot complacency of dying fish.' Et voila] The dominant metaphor of Daldry's, and his designer's Ian McNeil's, staging. We see fish-tanks small and large around the office of Footnotes in History; and we see, I think, that the office - the firm - is itself a goldfish bowl, enveloped in a high curving perspex wall. A note of caution. Too many Daldry stagings seem to apply the same formula: heavy scenic effects to stress a play's socialist intentions. Watching and hearing, you may well feel that Daldry and Co. are pressing more omens, metaphors, and melodrama from the play than it needs. On the other hand, the play is strongly cast, and most of its pacing excellent. Fascinating to watch Prunella Scales, whose method is to fix the social character of a role with a satiric edge, as Peggy, alongside Alan Howard, whose style is to stylise a role's pure thought, as William. There are moments when they hardly seem to be on the same planet, but their dissimilarity underlines the whole point of Oakes's writing. The Editing Process - Daldry's first production of a new play  - is just the kind of drama the Royal Court is all about. Royal Court Theatre, London SW1</p>

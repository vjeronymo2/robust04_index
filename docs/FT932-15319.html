			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Leading Article: Recoupling the through train IT WAS tempting yesterday, after Britain and China had put an end to months of wrangling by announcing the imminent resumption of talks on the political future of Hong Kong, to ask which side blinked. Was it the British or the Chinese government that made the crucial concession on the precise role to be played by Hong Kong officials in the talks? Or is it Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, who has gone the extra distance by agreeing not to initiate the debate on his modest proposals for political reform in the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) while the talks continue? Entertaining as they may be, however, these questions are irrelevant. Yesterday's announcement is a compromise in which the parties have side-stepped obstacles of their own creation. It was always certain that, were talks to resume, they would take place between the two sovereign powers in dispute, Britain and China, with Hong Kong officials playing something of a secondary role; it was never plausible that they could happen, as China seemed until yesterday to be demanding, with these officials barred from seats at the negotiating table. The resumption of dialogue is undoubtedly a welcome development for Hong Kong - provided it gets off to a brisk and businesslike start. Without it Mr Patten knew he was in a fragile position, facing the prospect of a difficult LegCo debate on his proposals buffetted by threats from Beijing, and the risk of a stand-off thereafter that might have seriously debilitated his governorship through the last four years of British colonial rule. By agreeing to talk, Britain and China have at least taken the essential first step towards reconstituting the 'through train' that was supposed to pull Hong Kong through this delicate period of transition. Clear timetable Yet there are also risks for Mr Patten in the new course. The most obvious is that China, rather than engaging in a serious debate about Hong Kong's future political structure, will see the talks as an opportunity to mount a protracted filibuster with the aim of completely derailing Mr Patten's plans. The timetable is not open-ended. One of the governor's proposals affects elections to local district boards in the colony, due to take place next year; another would mean that officials elected on that occasion would have an important role to play in choosing members of LegCo in 1995. This means that if a balanced package of electoral reforms is to have a chance of coming into effect, it will have to be passed by the Legislative Council by the autumn. If the talks starting on April 22 move slowly, or not at all, the British and Hong Kong governments may thus again find themselves facing a familiar dilemma later this year - whether to pull out of talks and press ahead with reforms in the teeth of Chinese threats to set up a shadow Hong Kong government before 1997 and to declare any changes null and void thereafter. LegCo's role Talks, then, cannot be an end in themselves, or indefinite in duration. Their value for Britain and Hong Kong will lie in seeking to ascertain what China itself wants for the colony before and after 1997, for while Beijing has been voluble in its denunciation of Mr Patten and all his works since October, it has been noticeably reluctant to come forward with proposals of its own. If the negotiation means some amendment to the governor's reform proposals, so be it - provided that the outcome can be debated by, and is acceptable to, the Legislative Council. Strengthening LegCo as an autonomous legislature is, after all, Mr Patten's clearest and most sensible objective  -and is more important than the precise way in which he proposes to tinker with electoral arrangements. Enhancing LegCo in this manner is also the best test of China's sincerity in having agreed that Hong Kong should be ruled after 1997 under the principle of 'one country, two systems'. It remains entirely possible, of course, that China's objection is not to Mr Patten's precise proposals, or even to the unilateral manner in which he put them forward, but to the whole idea of having such an independent-minded legislature in Hong Kong. If that is the case, no amount of talking will suffice to bridge the gap.</p>

The deputies thus approved the institution of a  presidential republic. Does this mean moving to the next stage  now -- that is, to elections of the future leader of the state  and head of executive power in the republic?    [Hryb] No. It does not mean yet that Belarus will have a  presidency, because these sections which have been voted on by  named ballot will be part of the section on the constitution.  And only when we adopt the constitution as a whole and  determine, adopt a resolution on the procedure for bringing it  into effect will this section, that is, the one on introducing a  presidency, come into force. If we do not adopt the  constitution in the Supreme Soviet, I will use my right to  submit this question to a national referendum.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan likely to set back metals demand JAPAN'S PRESENT economic problems will hold back worldwide metals demand and consequently western world consumption growth this year will be only 'modest', the Metal Bulletin Research organisation says in its latest report. MBR suggests that Japan is going into recession and 'metals demand there will be disappointing throughout 1992. Nearly all the indicators suggest that the short-term prospects for base metal demand are poor and they are likely to continue to deteriorate during the remainder of the second quarter'. Analyst Mr Neil Buxton says that, given the weakness of the first half-year, 'there will be little, if any, growth in base metals demand in Japan for 1992 as a whole'. As that country's industries consumes between 10 and 25 per cent of the traded metals, when Japan's slowdown is added to the continuing sluggish demand in Europe, 'these combined factors will offset the revival that appears to be gaining ground in the US,' he says in MBR's Base Metals Monthly. Drawing together some statistics to back his case, Mr Buxton says that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry is forecasting that crude steel output in Japan will fall by 16.8 per cent in the second quarter and that speciality steel production will be 17.2 per cent down from the same months last year. In the copper market, the Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers' Association saw copper electric wire orders in January dip below 90,000 tonnes for the first time since January 1990. They were down more than 5 per cent from January last year. The Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners' Association forecast that demand for secondary (scrap) aluminium will fall 3.6 per cent in the 1992 fiscal year. The International Lead and Zinc Study group recently forecast a slight fall in zinc consumption in Japan in 1992, while lead consumption was predicted to be unchaged from last year's level. According to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics, aluminium consumption in Japan grew by 1.8 per cent last year compared with 9.5 per cent in 1990; copper consumption was up 2.3 per cent (9 per cent); nickel 10.4 per cent (down 2.3 per cent) and zinc 3.7 per cent (6 per cent.)

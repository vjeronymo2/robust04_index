			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: Tapie puts Adidas stake up for sale MR Bernard Tapie has put his controlling stake in Adidas, the troubled sporting goods group, up for sale with a price tag of FFr2.085bn (Dollars 390m). Adidas's future has been clouded by uncertainty ever since the collapse in October of Mr Tapie's plans to sell control of the company to Pentland, the UK consumer products concern. Pentland had agreed to buy the Tapie shareholding - which centred on Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF), Mr Tapie's master company - for FFr1.6bn, only to abandon the deal three months later. BTF has since bought Pentland's original 20.05 per cent stake in BTF and has put its entire 78.05 per cent holding on the block. It has appointed Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO), a Paris-based bank, to find a purchaser and to orchestrate the deal. Adidas is one of the world's best known brand names. However, it has had a series of financial problems in the two years since Mr Tapie took control. It has faced fierce competition from the US sportswear groups, notably Nike and Reebok, which had strong links with Pentland. Adidas has also undergone expensive rationalisation and a series of senior management changes since the Tapie takeover. Mr Tapie is said to be short of cash following the demise of the Pentland deal and the failure of other proposed disposals, including the planned sales of the Terraillon weighing machine business and La Vie Claire health food chain. On Wednesday he announced final plans to buy out the external shareholders in BTF for FFr100 a share, against the FFr130 at which the shares were suspended this summer. Only 5 per cent of the shares in BTF, valued at FFr692m under the buy-back terms, are in public issue. The decision to privatise BTF is believed to have been fuelled by Mr Tapie's financial position and by his political ambitions. Mr Tapie, who has a parliamentary seat, is one of the few French politicians to be actively involved in business. He was forced this spring to resign from the cabinet after only seven weeks because of his involvement in a fraud case concerning past business interests. The case against him was yesterday dismissed by a French court.</p>

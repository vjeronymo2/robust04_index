			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, June 15, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati said in Frankfurt today that Iran will continue  its efforts to consolidate peace and stability in the region.    Velayati who is here on an official visit said at a press  conference here today that Iran will also follow its policy to  resolve the current crises in the world through boosting  regional and international cooperation.    Asked about Gaza-Jericho compromise accord, Velayati said,  "We believe that the current peace process was not in the  interest of Palestinian nation and peace and security in the  region. Palestine belongs to all the Palestinians on that land  and an individual or a certain group can not impose their views  upon the Palestinian people."    Despite the declared Palestinian control" over Gaza and  Jericho, the problems of Palestine still remain to be solved, he  said.    More than 200 Jewish townships exist in the region, the  problem of Qods [Jerusalem], Palestinian refugees and Golan  Heights remain unresolved and the southern Lebanon is still  under zionist occupation, he said.    On the date of his upcoming visit to Baghdad, Velayati said  that an expert delegation will go to Baghdad and will designate  the date for the visit of the two countries' foreign ministers.    He described the United Nations Resolution 598 as the ground  for consolidation of Tehran-Baghdad relations and said that the  implementation of the United Nations resolution positive steps  [as received] would be taken to strengthen bilateral relations.    Asked about Iran's view on the developments in Yemen,  Velayati said that Iran's policy favors unity and territorial  integrity of Yemen. "We believe that the crisis in Yemen can be  resolved through peaceful means," velayati Said.    On Iran's support for Bosnian Muslims, he said that despite  some claims, Iran has not dispatched forces to interfere in  Bosnian affairs directly. Instead it has repeatedly announced  its readiness to dispatch 10,000-strong peacekeeping force to  Bosnia under the banner of the Nia Oionsxmh [as received].  Answering a question on the export of the revolution, Velayati  said that Iran was against the so called forcible export of the  revolution, calling the allegation that Iran is using force to  promote its revolution as "the fabrication of the western  propaganda machine."    The Islamic Republic of Iran regards strengthening of  regional cooperation as an important principle and makes efforts  to expand activities of the Economic Cooperation Organization  (ECO) and the organization of the Caspian Sea Littoral States to  stregthen ties among neighbouring states, he said.    Velayati described his talks with German officials as  positive and said that the talks opened a new chapter in  bilateral relations in the framework of ECO and the European  Union (EU).</p>

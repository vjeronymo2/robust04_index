			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / New broadcasting union leader MR Roger Bolton has been elected general secretary of Bectu, the broadcasting union. He won by more than 1,000 votes from Mr Roy Lockett, his nearest rival, who will continue as the union's deputy general secretary. He takes over from Mr Tony Hearn who is retiring at the end of the month. Mr Bolton has been leading union opposition to the BBC's controversial Producer Choice. This policy, introduced earlier this year, encourages programme-makers to invite tenders for crews and studios from private-sector companies.</p>

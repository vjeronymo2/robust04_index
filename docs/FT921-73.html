			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hi-tech replaces rap of the knocker - David Butler looks at the big changes taking place in constituency campaigning This is a new kind of election. I have been writing about campaigns for 40 years. None of the phenomena now manifest is original. Every bit of technology and strategy deployed in the past two weeks was in existence five years ago. What is new is the comprehensiveness of its general adoption. A difference in degree can be a difference in kind. In March 1992, as in every previous campaign, there are two different elections in progress - one at the centre, one in the constituencies. They hardly meet. The leaders may flit out to the marginals for their publicised visits, and the marginals - and the safe seats - may report daily, via their regional offices, to Smith Square and Walworth Road. But the plodding activity in the constituencies, canvassing, delivering addresses, organising registers and preparing poll-cards, bears little relation to the frenetic agitation in party headquarters and in the broadcasting studios. In local offices the manifestos lie unread and the telecasts stay unwatched. The nineteenth century routine of getting a full marked-up register for use on polling day continues - but with a difference. What is new this year is not that it didn't happen anywhere in 1987 but that it happens almost everywhere in 1992. There are four big areas of innovation: Virtually every party in with a chance in any marginal has a sophisticated computer system. It has programmes that address envelopes, prepare direct, targeted mail, organise canvass cards, and annotate the electoral register with details from past years and with information about ethnicity, occupation, and response to financial appeals or questionnaires. Almost every marginal has acquired a fax machine in the past two years. Many candidates have mobile faxes and portable phones in their cars. The party headquarters, national and regional, deluge the contestants with press releases and daily campaign notes, seeking (usually in vain) a nationwide, co-ordinated response to any new development. The facilities of Telecom Gold, BT's computer network service, are being fully employed. Agents and candidates have been schooled, to an altogether new degree, to co-ordinate their operations to the needs of the media, local and regional, to give absolute priority to their requirements and deadlines. The number of party workers willing to go out on the door knocker has fallen in all parties, but 85 per cent of electors are on the telephone. The cost of local calls is greater than the election expense permitted for each voter. But volunteers often choose to canvass by telephone, even though, if co-ordinated, it falls under the law that limits expenses. Certainly this is being conducted on a new scale and no one seems to worry too much about the formal provisions of the Representation of the People Act. In theory these developments could transform constituency electioneering. In practice they may amount to very little. Some candidates, even some area agents, are sceptical or mutinous. In the end most people go to the polling booths under the stimulus of the national campaign. The margin for even the most effective use of the new technology is small, manpower is short and skilled manpower is shorter. Constituency campaigning is very different this year but its impact may be just as small as in previous years. The same may not be quite so true at the centre. It was only in 1987 that Peter Mandelson dragged the Labour party reluctantly into the new, Americanised world that had been developing over the past 20 years. The planning of photo-opportunities, the exact timing of press conferences with their well-honed sound-bites, the elaborate attempts to manage the news, to cap the other side's headline offerings, the orchestration of meetings and walkabouts, all have their precedents in the 1960s and even earlier. But the scale and thoroughness with which they are pursued today makes even 1987 seem antediluvian. But are the innovations effective? Let us not be bemused by the health service fracas. The main impact of the ever more sophisticated campaign strategies may be alienating and counter-productive. In the fetid atmosphere of headquarters, professional partisans talking all day to other professional partisans can lose their perspective. Their principal outside contact is with journalists who seem to be becoming ever more resentful at the expert attempts to feed them and to fool them. The successive headlines pass over the heads of a bored and sceptical electorate. Currently the coverage of the campaign on the air and in the quality press has attained an altogether new standard of thoroughness and excellence. But editors have to remember that elections are, for a minority, a spectator sport. The enthusiastic watchers are taught, with increasing subtlety, to appreciate the mores in the game and to watch the pollsters' scoreboard, with its indirect assessment of the success of the players. But does it help the voters to a rational choice? There never was a golden age when elections were feasts of reason. This is, God help us, by far the most sophisticated campaign we have seen. But it seems no nearer than its predecessors to offering an ideal way of selecting the best politics and the best people to rule us. The author is a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford.</p>

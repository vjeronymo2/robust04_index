			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ministry denies role in OCP counter-bid THE French industry ministry has denied involvement in an attempt to mount a counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler, which is facing a takeover offer from a German group. A senior official said the ministry had responded to requests for information from shareholders of Gehe, the German group that last month made a friendly FFr1.8bn (Dollars 318.6m) offer for OCP. The French government had no interest in meddling in purely private business, the official said. 'We do not get involved in takeovers,' he added. The only industry ministry involvement was to provide information about French medicine marketing rules to Gehe shareholders, the official explained. 'I can assure you that Franco-German business relations are very good,' he said. The ministry's denial contradicts claims earlier this week by some representatives of OCP and a member of a French consortium of pharmaceuticals companies that the government was sponsoring a French counter-bid. However, a leading French drugs group in the consortium yesterday reconfirmed that the industry ministry had advised it on mounting a possible counter-bid for OCP. Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP's chief executive, supports the German deal, but OCP's largest single shareholder, the Bourely family, with 15 per cent of the equity, opposes it. A legal action between rival existing shareholders for control of OCP is understood to be under way. Meanwhile, the French Treasury has delayed for 10 days its decision on whether to give the German bid the go-ahead. OCP says that officials want to examine the ownership structure of Gehe and in particular Franz Haniel, the Duisburg-based trading and service company which owns Gehe.</p>

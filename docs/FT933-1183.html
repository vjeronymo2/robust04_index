			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (40): A productivity paradox - Industry overview / The gap between accelerating technical change and weak economic performance is perplexing economists THE PARADOX could not be greater. The industrialised world is experiencing a rapid and far-reaching technological revolution. Information and communications technologies, advanced automation and robotics, and new engineering materials, such as polymers, composites and ceramics are revolutionising production processes and products. Yet the big industrial countries are either struggling to get out of recession, or still facing declining production and rising unemployment. With few exceptions (one may be Britain), productivity has shown few signs of regaining the strong growth demonstrated in the main industrialised countries in the two decades following the second world war. This so-called productivity paradox has become a question of growing concern to governments and economists. Some have suggested that the problem may be partly statistical: that the contributions to growth and prosperity created by the new technologies are not properly captured by the data that governments gather. The slow emergence of harmonised industrial standards may also be delaying the application of technology. But many economists believe the reason for the perceived gap between accelerating technical change and weak economic performance is social conditions and the organisation of companies. Such ideas have emerged in research encouraged by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and carried out at centres such as the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex in Britain. This research highlights the distinction between technical innovation and its diffusion. New technologies are coming on stream and becoming ever more sophisticated but they may also be proving difficult to introduce in what economists call the existing techno-economic system. The industrialised world is undergoing a difficult transition. At one extreme, the development of compact personal computers, low-cost modems and falling telecommunications costs have enabled some workers in knowledge-based industries to work from home. But much of the productive apparatus of the big industrial countries would look familiar to anyone who had seen a factory shortly after the first world war. Continual rationalisation and innovation mean the car industry, for example, now produces many varieties of a car model on a single production line: a huge difference to Henry Ford's day when people could buy the Model T in any colour 'provided it was black'. But the rigidly organised factory system, based on the mass consumption of standard products and with a high energy and raw material requirement, still has not been replaced by any clearly identifiable new technological style. The coexistence of old and new is a sign that the industrialised world can only slowly apply new technologies to its industrial base and that it will be some time before today's technological revolution becomes a true industrial revolution. Nor should this be a surprise. The diffusion of innovations can be a hit and miss affair and history offers many lessons of slow take-up. Markets may not be ready to accept inventions. The McCormick reaper, which later become one of the 19th century's most successful inventions, was invented in the 1830s but not bought in large numbers until 20 years later, when the grain farms of the US grew in size and labour became more expensive. Bottlenecks can arise because it is difficult for users of a new technology to see its full potential. The introduction of the electric motor at the end of the 19th century yielded no rapid rise in productivity. Factory owners often attached the motors to existing group drive systems of belts, shafts and pulleys that had earlier been driven by steam or water rather than use the motors in the most productive way to power individual machines in a unit drive system. Such lags in the application of technology can have a positive side. Companies, which are not in the vanguard of achievement, can still adopt recent developments to compete effectively. In its recent report Manufacturing into the late 1990s, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry observed that: 'While important and fundamental developments in technology will be seen, no doubt, over the next 10 years, the vast majority of UK manufacturing companies will be concerned with applying and using incremental developments of technologies that are already established.' However, the DTI does expect that the rate of uptake of technology will increase. This already seems to be happening in the US, according to Mr Albert Edwards, an economist and global equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank. US investment in computers surged by 38 per cent last year as the country pulled out of recession. Spending on computers had also risen in the 1991 recession year. According to Mr Edwards, such a jump in investment at that phase of the economic cycle is unusual, and could be a sign that the technological revolution is sweeping smokestack America. If so, the late 20th century productivity paradox may soon be overcome. But in so far as it represents the replacement of middle management by machines, it will open up new social and political problems of which the biggest will be the redeployment of redundant middle class labour.</p>

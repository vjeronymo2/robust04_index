Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton met with visiting German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to strike a Western consensus on  how to deal with the two-year-old ethnic war in the former  Yugoslav republic.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said in a letter  Friday [28 January] that he had instructed top UN officials to  actively plan to open the Tuzla airport for relief supplies and  to replace Canadian troops at Srebrenica with Dutch peacekeepers.    "We've endorsed that report," said Warren Christopher, the  secretary of state. "That could lead to the use of air power if  there's not an agreement."    One administration official was quoted by the ASSOCIATED  PRESS as saying that Washington could seek tough UN sanctions  against Croatia similar to those Serbia is now suffering.    Top on the agenda during Kohl's meetings with Clinton  included Bosnia, but the German chancellor disclosed little  specifics.    "We talked about a number of possibilities that I wouldn't  want to make public just yet," Kohl said at a news conference.    A White House statement said the two leaders discussed "a  range of international and bilateral issues, including  developments in Russia, Ukraine, Central Europe, Bosnia and the  Middle East."    "They agreed on the need for vigorous follow-up on NATO  summit decisions," the statement said.    The Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims will resume talks in  Geneva, Switzerland, on February 10.    While France urges the United States to exert pressure on  the  Bosnia Muslims to reach a peace agreement with the Serbs and  Croats, Washington has stressed all along that no peace  settlement should be imposed on the warring sides.    The U.S. is unwilling to dispatch ground troops to Bosnia  unless all three sides reach a peace accord in good faith.    Clinton won support today from Kohl on that front.    Kohl said he was against imposing a settlement on the  warring  parties and intervening with NATO ground troops.    That would lead to "blood bath" and "more traumatic and more  tragic" results, Kohl said.</p>

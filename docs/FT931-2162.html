			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Miners struggle to find paydirt BRITISH COAL Enterprise, founded to create jobs in coalfield areas, has launched a research project to discover how more ex-miners can be turned into successful businessmen. 'Our view is miners don't make very good entrepreneurs. They make good employees,' said northern regional BCE manager Mr Roland Stevenson. With hundreds of miners leaving the industry each week and more pit closures looming, BCE is working with Durham University Business School to study how suitable ex-miners would be for a career in business. Mr Stevenson said the aim of the Durham study was to see 'if there is something hidden we can bring out'. Since its formation in 1984, BCE claims to have been highly successful in placing former miners in new employment and helping coalfield companies, through financial support, to create more jobs. But its experience helping them become entrepreneurs has been more mixed. Of the relatively small number who have opted for self-employment, few have created substantial businesses and some have failed, losing their redundancy money. As part of the research, co-funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, BCE has started running pilot one-day workshops in north-east England and the Midlands, in which ex-miners planning self-employment undergo psychometric analysis and behaviour studies. The sessions are intended to gauge personality traits such as goal orientation, leadership, communication skills, the ability to thrive under pressure and willingness to take risks. The research is also assessing a selection of companies in Durham and Bristol to identify which qualities in the person at the helm have contributed to their survival. Since 1985 the number of miners employed by British Coal has dropped from 191,000 to 33,000. BCE estimates that of 27,207 ex-employees, including miners and white-collar staff, whom it has resettled since 1987, 2,070 have become self-employed. It does not know how many are still in business. Ex-British Coal employees no longer in business include Mr Michael Peary of Pegswood, Northumberland. His British Gnome Stores at the Gateshead Metro Centre, which opened in the late 1980s and did a brisk trade in Thatcher gnomes, closed a year ago. Mr Peary was reluctant to discuss his experience but said: 'There were quite a few of us at the time went into self-employment. As far as I know there's none of us self-employed now.'</p>

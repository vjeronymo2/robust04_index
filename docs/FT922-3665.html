			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London COCOA market resumed its bearish trend yesterday afternoon, ending the day just above the lows although in routine volume. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the September cocoa price closed at Pounds 549 a tonne, down Pounds 11 on the day. Traders identified arbitrage selling and the uncovering of sell-stops in the US as the main reasons for the decline. 'We may have been affected by stops (stop-loss selling orders) going in New York, but London was looking weak even before that,' one trader said. Turnover in COFFEE futures picked up slightly in the afternoon and prices edged higher by up to as Dollars 4. But traders were not expecting any significant price recovery until nearer the first set of International Coffee Agreement negotiations on June 22-26. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices came under further pressure in spite of a fall in LME warehouse stocks. Dealers attributed the cash position's Dollars 20 fall to a 2 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,269.50 a tonne to investment fund liquidation. The price has now lost Dollars 40 in an uninterrupted 4-day slide. Dull fundamentals continued to weigh down the NICKEL market, in spite of Chinese buying. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] China's Civil Affairs Ministry is trying to sort out  a battle at one of its flagship propaganda publications in  Shenzhen which has been accused of revealing sensitive  information about political and social problems in large cities.  In the maelstrom, one of China's best-known modern poets, who  was working secretly for the publication, has been forced to  flee to a remote part of the country.    Street Magazine, a monthly which began in Shenzhen in March,  has been under pressure from city officials to reduce coverage  of controversial issues such as discontent over urban renewal  and the weakening ideological role of street committees in  China. The Civil Affairs Ministry has praised the magazine's  "serious style and high tone" and the Communist Party's  mouthpiece, People's Daily, voiced its approval of the  publication in mid-May. But complaints from provincial  officials have flooded in.    The chief editor, Xu Hao had encouraged the magazine's more  than 100 contributors to "find out things first hand" and often  despatched staff reporters and photographers to cities  throughout the country.    At a Shenzhen propaganda work meeting at the end of May, a  deputy party secretary, Lin Zuji, called for a shake-up at the  magazine, even though Beijing had not called for such a move.  Xu Hao was sacked two weeks ago. Also purged was one of  China's best-known underground poets, Meng Lang, who had worked  for the magazine since the outset.    Meng, 32, fled from his native Shanghai in February after  local police harassed him over his involvement in a U.S.-funded  literary journal.    In early May, Shenzhen authorities sent to investigate the  magazine discovered Meng's presence and reported it to Shanghai  police. "He was warned that he was not welcome in Shenzhen, so  he fled to Sichuan Province," a source said. Meng's sudden  disappearance raised alarm in China's dissident circles, where  many feared he had been arrested. The former factory engineer  was jailed for six weeks in Shanghai in 1992 for his involvement  in the banned quarterly Modern Chinese Poetry.    Recent moves suggest the Street Magazine mess could be  sorted  out soon. Senior party cadres in Beijing have now come to the  aid of Xu, a respected propagandist who formerly ran the Shaanxi  provincial party committee's theoretical journal.    Guangdong's civil affairs department, apparently on orders  from Beijing, last week reprimanded Chen Yushan, head of the  propaganda department of Shenzhen's Nanshan District where the  magazine offices are situated, since he carried out the sacking.  His plan to replace Xu with a deputy editor from Nanshan  district's daily newspaper is now on hold. Shenzhen's chief of  propaganda, Shao Hanqing, was also asked to explain her  behaviour.    "The matter is now being discussed between Shenzhen and the  central and provincial civil affairs authorities," one local  source said. "The civil affairs ministry sees no problems with  the magazine, so the hardline ideologues in provincial and local  governments have no grounds for tightening control over it."</p>

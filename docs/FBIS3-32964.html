			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the "Notes and Information" page: "A </F> Longstanding Misunderstanding"]    [Text] This will be an important week for Brazil to get a  clear idea as to how its relations with developed countries,  especially the United States and Germany, will go. It is true  that for many in Brasilia there are other issues of greater  strategic significance, such as the community of  Portuguese-speaking countries. This idea, which was conceived  by Ambassador Jose Aparecido, was put into motion on the evening  of 10 February at a dinner hosted by President Itamar Franco and  attended by representatives of Portuguese-speaking countries  from this continent and abroad. Similarly, the Workers Party  [PT] does not consider Foreign Minister Celso Amorim's trips to  Washington and Bonn to be important. The hints given by PT  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Lula to Japanese businessmen about  his foreign policy lead one to believe that he is going to seek  to replace trade and economic relations with the United States  with stronger ties with Andean Pact member countries. The  prevailing idea in other parties is that foreign policy is for  experts! These are strategic options, although strange ones!    It is within this backdrop of "circumstances" that Amorim  will be telling the Americans that Brazil is neither engaging in  unfair trade practices nor failing to protect intellectual  property rights, and the Germans that Brazil is not planning to  tread the path of nuclear proliferation. In Bonn, Amorim's task  will be easier in light of the Senate's approval of the  agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  which will allow him to ask for "time" for the Brazilian Senate  to approve the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty. In  Washington, however, his task will be tough -- and the public  must be prepared for a possible failure of his mission that will  affect the steel, paper, cellulose, and orange juice industries.    In his negotiations with the U.S. trade representatives,  Amorim will certainly try to undo some old knots stemming from  mutual misunderstandings, misinterpretations, unwarranted  jingoism, missionary concepts dating back to the time of the  gunboats, and dollar diplomacy. The U.S. administration must  tell the U.S. Congress whether U.S. commercial interests are  being respected in Brazil, while the Brazilian foreign minister  will seek to persuade his U.S. counterparts that the Brazilian  Government has adopted a foreign policy that in many cases  displeases the White House and the State Department because it  also has national interests to protect. For a government that  administers a GDP totaling trillions of dollars, it should not  be hard to understand that in a country administering a GDP that  amounts to a few hundred billion dollars, the concepts of  "commercial" and "industrial" are often confused with the  concept of "national." In fact, last week President Clinton was  able to note that this confusion exists even in Japan. All  things considered, however, the U.S. pressure stems primarily  from the fact that in Washington there is also confusion about  what is national and what is related to the private economic  sector. Looking at things coolly, Amorim may have been able to  succeed in his efforts had it not been for the many years of  frequent misunderstandings we have mentioned earlier.    In addition to other issues that are rather delicate but not  relevant, the Brazilian-U.S. dispute today revolves around the  patent draft law being studied in the Senate. We have time and  again said that had it been voted on on time, many of the U.S.  complaints would have been avoided. The irony of the whole  story is that the government of Itamar Franco will have to  endure the consequences of something for which it cannot be held  responsible (except for the laxity that has become its  trademark): It was during the tenure of Senator Fernando  Henrique Cardoso as foreign minister that the executive branch  made every possible effort to make the Chamber of Deputies pass  the patent law. The law includes points upholding Brazilian  interests that are unacceptable to U.S. pharmaceutical lobbying  groups. Amorim and Mickey Kantor, the U.S. trade  representative, will have their hands tied by that intangible  thing known as "national interest," which is always present in  diplomatic and commercial negotiations. An understanding would  be in the best interests of security in the hemisphere, but  unfortunately this is not the way things are seen in Washington  and Brasilia. We should thus prepare for a courteous but tough  dialogue that might yield predictable but undesirable  consequences.</p>

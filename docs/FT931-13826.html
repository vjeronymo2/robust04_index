			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring benefits push up Electron ELECTRON HOUSE, the Reigate-based distributor of electronic components which has undergone substantial restructuring in the last few years, yesterday reported a 44 per cent gain in interim pre-tax profits and is raising the dividend. Helped by higher sales and operating profits from continuing operations, and lower interest costs, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 595,000 to Pounds 854,000 in the six months ended November 30 1992. Earnings per share grew to 1.68p (1.03p) and the interim dividend is being increased by 5 per cent to 1.05p (1p) per share. Sales from continuing operations increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 29m) and generated Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 815,000) of operating profits. Discontinued operations added sales of Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 31.1m) and operating profits of Pounds 162,000 (Pounds 948,000). Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the results provided further evidence of the benefits of the restructuring and were 'particularly encouraging' given the prolonged depressed economic conditions. He said: 'These results demonstrate that we continue to increase market share while maintaining tight control of overheads. Every sector of the group increased its sales and profits in local currency over the same period last year.' He said six of the group's remaining eight companies improved their operating profit margins. Although the UK market for electronic components grew by about 4 per cent in 1992, with flat demand for passive and electro-mechanical components and a 6 per cent increase in semiconductors, Electron captured market share as component sales grew by 18 per cent. Component companies in Australia and New Zealand also performed well, although results in the first quarter were depressed in sterling terms by the weakness of the Australian dollar. Electron's two remaining systems companies, which both hold strong positions in niche markets, also increased sales although profit growth lagged expectations. The group completed the sale of its high volume, low margin Bytech computer wholesaling business in August. The purchaser paid Pounds 5m for Pounds 4m of net assets and assumed over Pounds 5m of bank borrowings. As a result, Mr Leigh said the group's borrowings had fallen to just under Pounds 4m and gearing had been cut from more than 110 per cent at the end of May to between 30 and 40 per cent. Interest costs in the first six months fell to Pounds 732,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Under new accounting rules the group recorded a Pounds 148,000 extraordinary item in the first half. That reflected the difference between the Pounds 750,000 remaining goodwill previously written off to reserves on the acquisition of the computer wholesaling group and the Pounds 602,000 profit after costs and tax on its disposal.</p>

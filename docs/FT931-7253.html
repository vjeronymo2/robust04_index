			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Mulroney resigns to lift party's poll hopes MR BRIAN MULRONEY, Canada's prime minister, announced his resignation yesterday in an effort to bolster the chances of his Progressive Conservative party in the general election due to be held later this year. 'I look forward to the enthusiasm and renewal which only new leadership can bring,' he said. Despite winning elections in 1984 and 1988, Mr Mulroney has become the most unpopular leader in recent Canadian history, battered by recession and opposition to government spending cuts. According to recent opinion polls, fewer than one in five Canadians would vote for the Conservatives. Mr Mulroney, 53, will remain in office until the Conservatives choose a new leader at a party convention, probably in June. The frontrunners to succeed him include Ms Kim Campbell, the defence minister, Mr Michael Wilson, who holds the trade and industry portfolio, and Mr Perrin Beatty, the communications minister. Uncertainty over Canada's political outlook pushed the Canadian dollar down sharply initially on foreign exchange markets, although it later recovered some ground. The currency closed at 79.38 US cents, against 79.80 at Tuesday's close. In a view echoed by many political observers, Mr Mulroney said in a letter to the party president yesterday that history's verdict of his years in office 'will be a supportive one'. His initiatives have included free trade agreements with the US and Mexico, privatisation of several Crown corporations and the introduction of a controversial sales tax. The Mulroney government twice achieved agreement among the 10 provinces on constitutional reforms designed to cement relations between francophone Quebec and the nine English-speaking provinces. Both agreements however, proved impossible to implement. The ability of his party to capitalise on Mr Mulroney's departure will depend largely on its choice of a successor. Mr Mulroney is a Quebecker and managed to command support both in English Canada and his native francophone province. His successor will almost certainly come from another part of the country. None of the present leadership contenders has established a strong following in Quebec. Mr Mulroney gave no hint of his future intentions. A lawyer by training, he was the head of the Canadian subsidiary of a US iron ore mining company before entering politics in the early 1980s. He was mentioned in 1991 as a possible candidate for United Nations secretary-general. Irish charm turns sour, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AWAKENING TO THE REALITIES OF BLACK LIFE  </P> <P> On his way back from the makeup trailer, actor Danny Glover paused momentarily  to let a small boy wearing a brightly colored warm-up suit run past his feet. A  few crew members nearby looked on unconcernedly as the child crashed into his  father, film writer and director Charles Burnett, and wrapped himself around  his father's leg.  </P> <P> Glover shook his head, smiling, and continued into the house to shoot his  scene.  </P> <P> "I think it annoyed some of the more experienced crew members who weren't used  to having kids running around on the set," said Burnett from the production  office of his film "To Sleep With Anger," which recently finished shooting in  Adams Heights, near Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard.  </P> <P> "One of them told me, 'This looks like a day-care center,' " he said.  </P> <P> That's because Burnett's grass-roots project is not a traditional Hollywood  production.  </P> <P> The low-budget dramatic film -- about three conflicting generations of a modern  black family who are pulled into the beliefs and influences of the past when a  mysterious old friend from the Deep South pays a visit -- is expected to be  completed for less than $2 million. The film features an experienced assembly  of cast members who are all working for scale wages. (In fact, Glover's  estimated salary for the current summer smash "Lethal Weapon 2" almost equaled  this film's total budget.)  </P> <P> "Outside 'The Color Purple,' working with an all-black cast is unusual to me,"  Glover said. "Certainly it's not new to me -- I've been around black people all  my life." He laughs. "But in this business, I haven't, you know?"  </P> <P> "I hope this film means there will be more allowment for these kinds of films,"  said the quiet, soft-spoken Burnett, who wrote and directed the project.  "There's always the concern that a film like this will not be commercial --  that was certainly the concern of the producers. That's why this film is so  hard to do. But I think you have to keep eating away at it. Each film like this  lays the groundwork for the next."  </P> <P> The shoestring budget for "To Sleep With Anger" is nonetheless a treasure chest  to Burnett, a 44-year-old film maker who has never worked with a budget of more  than $80,000. The UCLA film school graduate grew up in South-Central Los  Angeles. He won critical acclaim in 1977 for his self-financed $10,000  production "Killer of Sheep," a stark, black-and-white examination of social  values through the eyes of a black slaughterhouse worker.  </P> <P> "There's too many movies about shootings and stabbings, where the only interest  is to reduce human beings to butcher-shop byproducts," Burnett said. "It's  nothing in a film anymore to see a person get their head bashed in or blown  apart, and I think that's probably one of the reasons why there's so much  violence on the streets today. Film makers have to take a responsibility and be  accountable."  </P> <P> In 1984, Burnett wrote and directed his second feature-length film, "My  Brother's Wedding," and wrote several scripts for other independent film  makers. His work rarely played outside of film festivals and art houses, but  last year it caught the eye of the MacArthur Foundation, which awarded Burnett  a $275,000, no-strings-attached "genius" grant over five years. The money  helped the independent film maker to purchase medical insurance for his family  and move them out of a small apartment into a modest home.  </P> <P> Sony Video Software Inc., a film production arm of the Sony Corp., is financing  "To Sleep With Anger."  </P> <P> To keep production costs down, Burnett hired many crew members who had little  or no experience working on feature films. Several more-qualified workers  agreed to sign on for less because they believed in the project. In hiring a  mostly black crew, Burnett said he was offering blacks an opportunity that  Hollywood seldom presents.  </P> <P> A profit-participation plan will compensate key cast and crew members for their  lowered salaries, depending upon how well the film does at the box office.  Glover's considerable financial stake, via his vastly reduced salary, earned  him the title of co-executive producer in the film's credits.  </P> <P> "Because it was such a low budget and the salaries were so low, we didn't want  to embarrass anybody and ask them to work with us, unless they really wanted  to," Burnett said. "I had worked with some of the people before. The whole idea  was to build this team that really wanted it."  </P> <P> Burnett said that one of the most difficult parts of making "To Sleep With  Anger" was casting it, because there is such a tremendous amount of black  talent who don't get many chances to showcase their skills in major roles. The  casting call for the film attracted hundreds of hopeful black actors.  </P> <P> "There was one guy trying out for only one line in a scene," Burnett said, "but  looking at his resume -- I mean, the guy had years and years of schooling and  training in theater. And he was pleased just to play this one scene." The actor  got the job.  </P> <P> Unlike Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," about an escalating race riot in  Brooklyn, "To Sleep With Anger" is not about racism but about a family's  struggle to survive in a changing world. The film's cast is hoping that with  the help of film makers like Lee, the theater door has opened far enough to  permit a film starring a black family.  </P> <P> "Blacks usually play isolated roles in films, like the best friend, or the  criminal, or the musician, or an extra," said cast member Richard Brooks, who  was recently in the Vietnam film "84 Charlie Mo-Pic." "With a movie like this,  when there is an all-black or largely black cast, then I can play the son --  the kid with the normal problems dealing with my mother and father. Those  things are more real to me, as opposed to always being the loner, the outsider,  trying to swim across the current and move through the world."  </P> <P> When casting the lead roles, Burnett said he and his producers considered "just  about everybody in the business." Glover committed to the project first. Others  actors who followed: Mary Alice, Paul Butler, Carl Lumbly, Sheryl Lee Ralph and  Vonetta McGee.  </P> <P> In "To Sleep With Anger," Glover plays Harry Mann, who Burnett said is a  folklore character handed down over generations from the Deep South. As a  child, Burnett was told that if he went out to a wooded area alone, Harry would  steal his soul. In order to keep that from happening, kids have to learn to  out-wile him.  </P> <P> "I think those stories are traditionally kept alive more in the South," Burnett  said. "I remember when I was a kid my grandmother used to tell me a lot of  those stories. I don't know if that's happening as much today. I think there's  this concern about losing that oral tradition."  </P> <P> In his script, Burnett said, "the father, Gideon, tells his sons animal stories  to instill old values in his sons. One son embraces his father's world, while  his materialistic brother rejects it and chooses his own course. When Harry  shows up, through a series of trivial conflicts that lead to life or death, he  changes the whole nature of the situation."  </P> <P> "I like the kind of trust that Charles has," Glover said. "You can see his  silence and patience on the screen. He allows everything to unfold. It's like a  flower you can't rush. It has to blossom."  </P> <P> The producers of "To Sleep With Anger" say that they are taking a chance on a  film by a little-known director whose subject matter may be too narrow for  general audiences to find appealing.  </P> <P> "I think any film maker has to do films about his own experience, and if he's a  great film maker, then that will translate into a universal subject," said  co-executive producer Ed Pressman ("Wall Street"). Pressman is known for  producing the early commercial films of directors such as Oliver Stone ("The  Hand"), Brian De Palma ("Sisters") and Terrence Malick ("Badlands"). Last year,  he approached Charles Burnett to work with him.  </P> <P> "It would be crazy for Charles to do this subject and adapt it for popular  consumption. It wouldn't be real to him and it wouldn't be his vision. And  those are the things that make a film work," Pressman said.  </P> <P> "This film is not about a white family," co-executive producer Harris Tulchin  said. "I don't even know how you would fit a white person in here. What you  don't want to do -- which I've seen done in the past -- is try to fit white  people into a story about a black family just so you can say, 'Hey look, we  have a white star. We can get much better promotion. We can get more people in  theaters.' "  </P> <P> "There's always skepticism in these situations," said Mary Alice, whose  performance in "Fences" on Broadway won her a best-actress Tony. "When we  opened 'Fences,' nobody thought that a play about a black family would make it  on Broadway. But look -- the play was a smash. Night after night, the audience  was filled -- with whites and blacks."  </P></p>

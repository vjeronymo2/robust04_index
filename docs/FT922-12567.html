			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / EC strategy on CO2 levels meets problems THE European Community's strategy to meet its commitment to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the end of the century is running into problems, less than two months before the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Two draft directives to monitor energy use in commercial and residential buildings - accounting for an estimated 47 per cent of EC energy consumption  -were yesterday blocked in the European Commission, at a meeting of senior officials to review the strategy. New-found reluctance by Brussels to interfere in matters which should properly be handled by member states was said by one official to be the cause of the hold-up in this innocuous-looking, but critical, part of the Commission's anti-global warming strategy. Any weakening of such conventional means of limiting emissions could force a rethink of the entire strategy, a senior Commission environment official conceded yesterday. The part of the strategy which has drawn most attention, and criticism, is the carbon and energy tax which Brussels is poised to put forward next month. The Commission reckons the EC needs this tax because it could meet only three-fifths of its CO2 reduction target by conventional energy-saving measures. But while industry is up in arms about the implications of the tax for competition, it is the conventional part of the strategy which is beginning to unravel fastest. By the end of last month, for instance, only four of the 12 member states had submitted promised 'complementary programmes' to cut CO2 emissions. Nor are the EC's own energy conservation and renewable energy programmes yet on stream. Mr Andrew Warren of the European Association for the Conservation of Energy told a Forum Europe global warming seminar for industrialists on Tuesday that 'there is no urgency behind these programmes from the Commission. Nor is there sufficient urgency from most member states for their programmes. In their absence, the (energy) tax becomes omnipresent.' The two directives causing problems yesterday will come up again for discussion by the full Commission within two to three weeks. There may then be attempts to fold them into the centrepiece directive containing the energy tax. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment commissioner, had wanted to present a rounded strategy to a pre-Rio ministerial meeting of EC environment and development ministers on May 4. The Commission itself is now unlikely to make up its mind until May 6 or 13, leaving the environment ministers' meeting scheduled for May 26 as the last chance to formulate a greenhouse gas strategy to take to Rio.</p>

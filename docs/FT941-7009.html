			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Sun Life pegs some bonus rates - At a Glance Sun Life has held some of its with-profits reversionary bonus rates at 1993 levels, while cutting others, but terminal bonuses will generally be equal to or greater than 1993 rates. The maturity value of a 25-year with-profits endowment policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, will be Pounds 47,694 on April 1, a slight rise from Pounds 47,575 last year. However, this is still at the lower end of the scale compared to Sun Life's competitors, many of whom are paying more than Pounds 60,000 on similar policies. A 10-year unitised with-profits policy would pay Pounds 6,488.</p>

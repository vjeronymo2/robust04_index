			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arabs agree to more peace talks ARAB delegations yesterday agreed to continue talks with Israel until the end of next week, encouraged by the prospect of a meeting with US President Bill Clinton. Syria had earlier warned it would consider breaking off the current ninth round of talks on Friday, unless there were better prospects of progress. The White House has not yet confirmed that Mr Clinton will receive the delegations, but a senior Arab diplomat said yesterday that the symbolic significance of the US president becoming directly involved for the first time since the process opened in October 1991 was enough to ensure the delegations remained in Washington. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, warned however that continued Israeli violence against Palestinians in the occupied territories was damaging the atmosphere at the negotiations. She said that the killing of eight Palestinians during the previous 48 hours had caused a visible deterioration in relations. Mrs Ashrawi added she was also disappointed Israel had not yet announced the names of further Palestinian deportees who would be allowed to return to their homes. 'Israeli intentions must be judged by what they do on the ground, as much as by what happens in the negotiations,' she said.</p>

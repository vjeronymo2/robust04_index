			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 25/06/1994 -- "Many political  games surround the Gagauz problem," stated Nikolai Telpiz,  Gagauz deputy speaker, to BASA, commenting on the results of the  meeting between Gagauz legislators and the Socialist Unity  faction on the "Gagauz Eri" project. According to him, Comrat  representatives were surprised "to hear the proposal to discuss  a draft on special juridical status modified by the Moldovan  Parliamentary Commission and not the one previously drafted by  the Moldovan and Gagauz Parliamentary commissions." Valeriu  Senic, Socialist Unity faction leader, chatted on the Socialist  Unity faction representatives to support the modifications  proposed by the Moldovan Parliamentary commission. "The Gagauz  Parliamentary Commission sent a protest to the Moldovan  Parliamentary Commission which unilaterally modified the draft  law; the draft does not favor the Gagauz side and limits the  potency of the `Gagauz Eri -- Gagauzia'."</p>

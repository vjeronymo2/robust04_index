			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Theo Peters] </F>   [Text] Mexico City, 24 Mar (DPA) -- Following the initial  reaction of general dismay over the unexpected death of Luis  Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the ruling  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of Mexico, intense  speculation has emerged in local political circles as to whom  will replace the assassinated ruling candidate.    Once the period of national mourning over Colosio's death  has  passed, the PRI national directorate will hold a meeting in the  next few days to nominate a new candidate for the 21 August  presidential elections.    According to an unwritten rule in the Mexican political  system, the outgoing president, in this case Carlos Salinas de  Gortari, has the prerogative of personally choosing or, as it is  popularly known, "hand picking" the candidate who will replace  him as president.    The names of two PRI politicians were mentioned in the  beginning from among the possible candidates. The PRI  politicians along with four other contenders lost the nomination  to Luis Donaldo Colosio on 28 November: former Mexico City  Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis and former Education Secretary  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.    The other initial contenders, including Finance Minister  Pedro Aspe, may not run for office because the Constitution  specifies that a candidate cannot occupy a government post in  the six months preceding the elections.    Surprisingly, Camacho Solis excluded himself as a possible  candidate on Thursday when he emphatically declared that he does  not aspire to become president of Mexico after attending the  vigil for the assassinated candidate at a mortuary in the  Mexican capital.    Camacho Solis, former mayor, foreign minister, and current  peace commissioner in Chiapas thus reiterated what he said on  Tuesday before Colosio's murder when he publicly denied any  aspirations as a presidential candidate, thus ending extensive  speculation in that regard.    Nevertheless, Colosio's unexpected death revived rumors of  the subsequent appointment of Camacho Solis as the PRI's  substitute candidate. His rivalry with the murdered candidate,  however, increased the ruling party members' rejection of the  peace commissioner following the murder.    Given Camacho Solis' self-exclusion, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce  de  Leon now appears the most serious contender for the position  left open by Colosio. Zedillo was the murdered PRI candidate's  campaign manager.    Considered a "dark horse" in the PRI convention in November,  the 42-year-old Zedillo is known as a brilliant public official  who is extremely competent in economic matters. He holds a  doctorate from Yale University in the United States.    Salinas de Gortari appointed Zedillo programing and budget  minister on 1 December 1988, a post at which he successfully  transformed the budget deficit into a surplus and substantially  increased government social expenditures.    After his appointment as education minister in January 1992,  Zedillo became the center of a national controversy that forced  him to withdraw two new history text books after broad circles  rejected the revision of sensitive passages on Mexico's history  and present situation.    Although Zedillo has a great deal in his favor to be chosen  the new PRI candidate, the scarce popularity of this timid,  introverted man seems to work against his aspirations. His very  discreet public conduct has contributed to the enigma  surrounding his personality.</p>

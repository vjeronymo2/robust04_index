			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fan Likai [5400 4539 0418] and Li Shuben [2621 </F> 2885 2609]: "Daqing Solves a Problem in Developing  High-Water-Content Oil Wells, Yearly Output in Later Periods Can  Still Be Maintained at 50 Million Tons"]    [Text] A worldwide problem in oil field development that  urgently requires a solution, "submerged strata well logging  interpretation technology," has now been solved at Daqing Oil  Field.    Daqing Oil Field is now entering the late period of high  water content development and has an overall water content as  high as 80 percent, which poses a serious threat to Daqing's  ability to attain its objective of 50 million tons of sustained  and stable yearly crude oil output.    In early 1992, Daqing Oil Field Management Bureau organized  a  key attack to study the worldwide problem of submerged well  logging interpretation, and it has now made an important  breakthrough. They have now produced a feasible method for thick  strata residual oil saturation logging interpretation, thin  strata position determination, and high platform oil strata  submerged strata logging interpretation. After placing several  10 wells into operation for confirmation, the coincidence rates  were, respectively, 89.5 percent, 93.4 percent, and 85.3 percent.    Daqing Oil Field has now completed submerged strata  interpretation for 3,625 wells at an average interpretation  coincidence rate of 75.7 percent. The related technical  personnel have used the new "FJ3 submerged strata integrated  interpretation technology" to interpret 115 readjustment wells  for Daqing's No. 6 Oil Extraction Plant with a coincidence rate  of more than 80 percent.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bensons Crisps calls for Pounds 5.3m Bensons Crisps, the snack food manufacturer, is raising Pounds 5.3m net through a 5-for-4 rights issue at 58p to finance a planned factory in Kirkham, Lancashire. The shares fell 6p on the announcement to close at 66p. Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said the move was 'Bensons' bid to become significantly larger as the UK's number four manufacturer of snack foods'. He admitted that the timing of the rights issue, a week after the company reported pre-tax profits halved at Pounds 500,000, was poor. The group is switching from the USM to the Official List.</p>

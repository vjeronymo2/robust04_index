			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): Russia and Germany lead  -Corporate transactions are taking off in eastern Europe The past year has seen an acceleration in regulated buy-out activity in a number of countries across central and eastern Europe (CEE). The greatest numbers of deals are occurring in the Neue Lander (former East Germany) and Russia, though markedly different approaches are being used. By the end of June 1993, 2,364 buy-outs or buy-ins - 19 per cent of all privatisations in the German Neue Lander - had been conducted on the basis of a case-by-case negotiation of the transaction. Buy-outs were, however, relatively small, accounting for only 4.3 per cent of the total purchase proceeds, 3 per cent of the total promised investment and 8.3 per cent of promised jobs among all privatisations. Though large numbers of deals are being processed, the Treuhandanstalt (THA), the German state privatisation agency, closely scrutinises each transaction in an attempt to ensure that buy-outs are placed on a sound financial footing, and that deals are completed which can be successfully restructured. In terms of finance, problems with outstanding debts are resolved, venture capital introduced if deemed appropriate and use made of special equity support and investment grant schemes. Buy-out deals may be delayed until the THA is satisfied that restructuring has taken place to make the enterprise commercially viable. In the case of Holzindustrie Bienenmuehle, for example, unrealistic management forecasts led to a reduction of the firm's activities to two product lines and 50 employees. The much delayed deal was completed at the beginning of this year, and six months later employment had increased by a fifth. Where a buy-out is not a viable option, a number of related alternatives are available. A small number of buy-ins have been completed. At the end of December 1991, a programme to promote buy-ins was launched by the THA, but although 2,800 inquiries were received, a year later fewer than 20 deals had been completed. Parallel to this programme, there have been numerous other attempts to effect buy-ins. A management partnership scheme has also recently been introduced, which involves incentivising incoming managers to turn round groups of underperforming enterprises in the same sector prior to privatisation. A similar scheme is being introduced in Poland. In Russia, buy-outs are now taking place in large numbers, but without such close monitoring of the process. Indeed, it is becoming clear across CEE that, for privatisation to get under way, it is often necessary, in the absence of a complete legal framework, to progress with policy implementation with alternatives which are acceptable within the local context. For example, where ownership laws are not fully elaborated, long-term leases may be an acceptable means of enabling privatisation to progress. In the absence of such a pragmatic approach, the whole process of regulated transformation is likely to grind to a halt, with managers still having the ability to dissipate state assets. Two principal routes to effecting a buy-out in Russia are available. First, significant numbers of enterprises which were leased by their workers' collectives under the provisions of the 1989 leasing legislation are now exercising their option to buy-out the assets. Second, and following the introduction of the Russian privatisation programme in 1992, buy-outs have been effected through the use of vouchers. The second of the three privatisation variants permitted under the legislation allows managers and employees to buy-out, at face value, 51 per cent of the shares of their enterprise through a closed subscription, and by using their own individual vouchers in payment. After the closed subscription, the remaining shares are offered to an open auction, in which management and employees can also participate. For example in the privatisation of the Bolshevik Biscuit factory, management and employees had obtained a total of 70 per cent of the shares at the end of this two-stage process. Variants 1 and 3 of the law provide other means by which management and employees can obtain significant, but not majority, equity stakes. Up to September 1993, according to the Russian statistics bureau (Goskomstat), some 7,000 large and medium-sized enterprises, employing a total of 4m people, had been privatised under the Russian privatisation law, of which 80 per cent used variant 2. Elsewhere in CEE, the volume of buy-outs has been less spectacular. Poland has so far seen most activity. By the end of May, 2,217 privatisations had taken place, of which 1,716 were through the 'liquidation' route. within which 651 were buy-outs. As in Russia, buy-outs of formerly leased enterprises are an important element of the privatisation programme in Ukraine. To the end of December 1992, plans were approved for the privatisation of 168 enterprises to workers' collectives, which had earlier concluded contracts on leasing with the option to buy. In July, the state property fund of Romania announced that half of the 162 small enterprises in trade, food-processing, services and construction, which were to be privatised through worker-management buy-outs, had been sold. Other countries are effectively in the process of moving from pilot stages to mass implementation, or with actual large-scale implementation still being delayed in some countries because of continuing political problems. As buy-outs become established, evidence is emerging of how they have fared. As of February, 30 buy-outs in the Neue Lander were in receivership. Some estimates suggest that up to half of the buy-outs will fail, while the THA considers that about 70 per cent of buy-outs will be successful in the medium term. In Poland, a study by the Institute of Market Economies, in Gdansk, indicates that about half of buy-outs effected through lease agreements have trouble in paying their instalments. A survey of 1,300 buy-outs conducted by the federal ministry of economics in Germany, in 1992, showed that there had been insufficient consideration of the anticipated effects of the weakening economic situation, and that the main problem after buy-out was not a lack of equity capital but of know-how in the areas of corporate finance, marketing, management, planning and control, and rationalisation. Elsewhere in CEE, access to finance is of particular importance for longer-term survival, since buy-outs may not involve an injection of capital to meet investment needs. These observations suggest a pressing need to address post buy-out problems in terms of improving managerial skills and sources of finance, and highlight the continuing problem of the desperate need for  - but current absence of - real entrepreneurs. However, approaches such as voucher schemes, which effectively involve the 'give-away' of enterprises, while breaking through bureaucratic log-jams and enabling rapid decentralised privatisation to be achieved, may make it difficult to address these issues, as we make clear in a recent report*. In particular, while there has been enthusiasm to embrace widespread managerial and employee share ownership, the importance of control exerted by institutions or commitments to service external finance, as in buy-outs in the west, has been played down. The absence of some such forms of outsider control mechanism may mean that, while privatisation meets fairness objectives, efficiency is not sufficiently enhanced. There may be little pressure to improve efficiency, as financing commitments are low and widespread employee ownership may reduce managers' ability to undertake restructuring, even if they aim to do so. Finding individuals and institutions with the requisite monitoring skills is highly problematical. The private investment funds which are emerging may be driven by the need to achieve short-term improvements in dividend payments to their investments at the expense of long-term investment. Such funds are increasingly making attractive offers to employees to buy their shares, as in the case of Bolshevik Biscuit where the private investment fund Alpha Capital, having obtained 12 per cent of shares at the time of the privatisation, subsequently contacted all employees offering to buy their shares at a price equivalent to four times the nominal value of a voucher. Foreign firms may be reluctant to become involved, unless they obtain majority control, which management and employees are unwilling to cede. Having resolved the problems of privatising vast numbers of enterprises, corporate governance issues are becoming the next major policy problem in transforming the countries of CEE into effective market economies. The need to address employees' expectations of the extent and timing of the gains from holding shares is likely to be an important issue in this process. * Management and Employee Buy-outs in Central and Eastern Europe, EBRD/CEEPN Technical Note, published by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 1993.

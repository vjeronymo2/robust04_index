			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Markets uncertain RATES in the sterling cash market softened yesterday, but the market seemed unwilling to take firm positions against the uncertain backdrop for base rates and the UK economy. Those who are looking for a short-term cut in base rates will watch several events this week. One is the Bundesbank council meeting on Friday which may bring a cut in rates to compensate for the slowdown in the German economy. The other is the Labour conference in Blackpool: dealers wonder whether a politically-motivated rate cut could spike Mr John Smith's first conference as Labour leader. But other dealers argued that a rate cut was unlikely for three reasons. First, the combined efforts of the Bundesbank and the Bank of France have meant that the French franc has probably evaded devaluation, taking the pressure off the German central bank to cut rates. Secondly, German call money was at a low level of 8.75 per cent yesterday because of the huge number of D-Marks injected into the financial system by the Bundesbank's interventions, forcing the German authorities to cancel this week's 'repo' operation and making the case for a rate cut even less likely. The cost of living in Bavaria also climbed 0.2 per cent in the month to mid-September, creating a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent. Rates in the sterling cash market were softer on thin trade, with the 3-month rate closing at 9 1/16 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 9 1/4 per cent. 1-month money closed at 9 1/4 per cent. A market looking for a rate cut might have been expected to deal in 1 month money at around 8 3/4 per cent. Futures traders were much more bullish about the prospects for a rate cut: the December contract closed at 91.82, 4 basis points up from its previous close. Strictly speaking, this assumes that 3 month money in December will be at 8.18 per cent. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.15bn, the Bank of England purchased Pounds 1m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 960m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the forecast was revised to Pounds 1.15bn. The Bank purchased Pounds 175m of Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 20m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid: "War Broke the Unity"] </F>   [Text] One could ask: Will the one united Yemen become  two Yemens as it was four years ago?    I believe that that only required a declaration of  secession.    Could the secession become legitimate, considering that the  prerequisites for the unitary state had been fulfilled and the  president acquired legitimacy to govern?    Again, I believe that as the unity decision was a  free-choice  decision and not an arbitrary decision, the secession was also a  free-choice decision and any attempt to impose unity by force  would require a great miracle to be carried out and sustained.  That was the mistake committed by the Yemenis when they  resorted to force to settle their differences. The result was  complete divorce. The dispute could have continued for one or  two years without secession. Internal differences do occur,  particularly in a state still trying to speak the same political  common laguage.    We do not know of any political unity in contemporary Arab  history that was imposed by force. We exclude annexation and  occupation from this. That is why unity in Yemen would never  succeed if the parties resort to force because it would then  become a case of hegemony which the locals would resist with  force as they did in the past.    Some might ask: What about the guarantees offered previously  for the fulfillment of unity and reinforcement of the  foundations of the unitary state? What happend to these  guarantees and how could the Yemeni state's legitimacy be  torpedoed?    The legal argument is not always enough, and launching a  military war is the weakest legal argument. The unitary state  agreement was signed by the two leaders and the two presidents  personally, both of whom are still alive. Unity was then  approved almost unanimously in a public referendum. The third  phase came with the recognition of the unitary state by all the  states which had previously recognized the two independent  states, including the brothers and neighbors. That state took a  fourth step towards securing its legitimacy when it lodged its  registration papers with the United Nations as one state with  one flag, one representative, and unified laws.    The war, however, has broken the state's legitimacy and  weakened its legal value, regardless of the causes which  prompted the armies to act. We should here particularly keep in  mind that we are talking about a unitary state on paper. In  reality, the two states remained as they were before the unity,  with two armies, two currencies, and two regimes.    The two sides concentrated on the form, not the substance,  of  unity. That is why it has taken only two weeks of war to break  it, with undeniable popular support.    War within a state trying to be one state cannot be the  solution, rather a certain cause of division and enmity.    That is why we cannot understand why a war has been launched  without any logical political concept. War will not make the  victor popular because war between brothers would mean an insult  to the loser but it would not subjugate the loser because he  would see the victor as an occupation force and would therefore  resist him as such. War cannot be a cane used to break enough  heads to get revenge. War has broken unity, not rectified it.</p>

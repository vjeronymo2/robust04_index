			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, May 30-Jun 5 94] </F>   [Text] A Russo-Ukrainian joint stock society expected to be  set up in late 1994 to expand Ukraine's transit gas pipeline  network. A tentative agreement to the above effect was reached  as a result of negotiations in Kiev on 1-3 June involving  Russia's Gazprom and the Ukrgazprom.    The decision is probably in perfect harmony with the Russian  Gazprom joint-stock society's strategic program dubbed "Highly  Reliable Pipe-Line Transport," which was discussed in Moscow in  March with active participation of Ukrainian experts including  academician Boris Paton himself, president of the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences and the world's top-notch authority in the  domain of arc welding. Mr. Paton has been personally supervising  the program's major section, which involves anti-corrosion  agents and corrosion-resistant equipment (see UBN no. 14/1994).    In the meantime, on 27 April 1994, the Ukrainian State  Committee for oil and gas made a decision to set up the  Ukrgazprom (Ukrainian Gas Industry) joint-stock society, by way  of an experiment, based on the existent Ukrgazpromstroi  (Ukrainian Gas Industry Construction) and as the latter's  affiliate, through a merger of the industry's construction  enterprises in East Ukraine.    Obviously enough, Ukraine's jurisdiction over a part of the  former USSR's integral gas pipe-line system does not relieve  Russia, as the world's major natural gas exporter, from the  burden of troubles involved in maintaining the gas piping  system's technical standards and its improvement and expansion.    Russia's lawmakers continue hearings involving a law on  pipe-line transport, which reportedly has triggered considerable  controversy among the interested parties. Russia's strategic  program was drafted and basically approved by the former USSR's  government back in 1991. Its practical implementation started a  year later.    However, after the USSR's disintegration, it was approved by  both the Russian and Ukrainian governments on an governmental  basis, though its financing by the Ukrainian party virtually  discontinued, despite the fact that Ukraine accounts for the  bulk of theoretical, R&amp;D and feasibility studies involved in  the  program.    Nonetheless, Ukraine intends to finalize and implement on  its  own a national program, which has been dubbed Ukraine's Highly  Reliably Pipe-Line Transport, and which is based on recent  intergovernmental agreements.    The CIS's major pipe-line system is 220,000 km.-long. Its  compressor stations' aggregate capacity is estimated at 50  million kW. According to Russia's Gazprom, 138,000 km.-long.  pipe-lines are presently operational Russia-wide. Major  pipe-lines' wear and tear status poses as a major environmental  threat with 25 per cent of pipe-lines having been operational  for over two decades, 5 per cent for over the critical 33 year  period, and 38 per cent for periods between one and two decades,  and thus in bad need of repair and reconstruction.    According to the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas,  Ukraine's 35,800 km.-long pipe-lines are operational. Besides,  the Druzhba (Friendship) and Samara petroleum export pipe-line  systems are located in Ukraine, plus 70,000 km.-long pipe-lines  of Ukraine's domestic distribution system and about 5,000  km.-long petroleum and product pipe-lines (a total of five  systems including two exclusively export ones). Ukraine's 14  gas pipe-lines can transport 266 b. cu. m. of natural gas a year.    According to experts with the Ukrainian Research Institute  for gas piping, Ukraine's national major pipe-line network does  not require any sizable expansion. However, its domestic  distribution system and major pipe-lines' branches should be  developed to stabilize natural gas supplies primarily to  Ukraine's three large industrial regions, to wit, the Kharkov,  Donetsk and Transdnieprian regions. Besides, the existent  network is not an integrated system, which would allow to  optimally and efficiently redistribute fuel flows both within  Ukraine and intended for exports.    Experts with the Ukrainian oil and gas industry are  currently  drafting feasibility studies and relevant legislative acts for  the Ukrainian Pipe-Line Transport project.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Two cheers for Venezuelan growth plan: Joseph Mann and Stephen Fidler on reaction to a two-year economic reform programme Businessmen in Caracas expressed moderate optimism yesterday about a two-year economic plan unveiled by the Venezuelan government this week, but it was criticised by some as insufficiently ambitious and lacking detail. The most common criticism surrounded the plan's lack of precision about how the ambitious macroeconomic goals set for 1995 would be achieved and when controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions would be dismantled. The government said it would cut 1995 inflation to 25 per cent from this year's projected 65 per cent mainly by eliminating a stubborn fiscal deficit; achieve positive GDP growth in 1995 after two years of recession; and obtain Dollars 3bn or more from privatisations this year and next. It also indicated an intention to reform the system of employee severance benefits, a hindrance to investment, and to raise domestic petrol prices, probably in 1995. Mr Jorge Redmond, president of Conindustria, an industrial association whose members represent around 7,000 companies, called the plan 'a step in the right direction' and said it contained 'all the points required for economic recovery'. But he said: 'We still need to see the 'how' of the government programme'. Mr Francisco Vivancos, a professor of economics at the Andres Bello Catholic University, called the plan 'a good first step' and an integrated approach to the country's economic problems. There was, however, no 'explicit definition' of policies covering the exchange rate of the Venezuelan bolivar or exchange controls, and the role of an independent central bank was not discussed. He raised questions about the 'extreme emphasis' given to projected government revenues, a lack of reference to public sector spending cuts, and the 'moral risk' of refinancing the debt of troubled businesses rather than linking state credits to successful companies that increase productivity. Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, former minister of finance and ex-president of the central bank, asserted said the plan addressed 'the major objectives of economic policy', but worried that there was no 'reference to reducing government spending'. Analysts at Bear Stearns in New York said the plan 'fell short of the ambitious overhaul that we might have hoped for.' There were 'encouraging aspects' but the 'absence of concrete major reforms, combined with obstacles the Venezuelan government is likely to encounter in trying to reach its goals, leads us to stop short of upgrading our investment outlook for equities.' The Venezuelan government has decided to take full control of Banco Consolidado, one of the country's largest commercial banks, and several of its subsidiary companies. Consolidado began receiving government financial assistance in early August. The bank will remain open and will be run by government-appointed executives. The takeover means the government has taken over three of Venezuela's four largest financial institutions since the banking crisis began earlier this year. The government said Monday that 17 of the country's 50 banks remain in critical condition.</p>

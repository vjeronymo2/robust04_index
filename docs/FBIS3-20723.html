Vukosavljevic: "Guardians of Peace"] </F>   [Excerpts] The unit commanded by Captain First Class Jovan  Adamovic is one of the newly formed units in the Niksic  [Montenegro] garrison. Its task is to secure the [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] border with the neighboring republic of  Srpska [Bosnia-Herzegovina], which is 150 kilometers long, and  to train the soldiers it needs to carry out that assignment. We  visited this unit in mid-November 1993 and discussed with its  members the tasks they perform, work-related problems, and, of  course, training as one of their key activities.    Captain Adamovic stressed: "This unit's most important duty  is to prevent the spillover and expansion of the whirlwind of  war from the former Bosnia- Herzegovina to the territory of  Montenegro, i.e. the territory of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia. We have carried out this task in its entirety. We  have safeguarded peace and barred war profiteers, smugglers, and  others engaged in murky and dirty businesses." [passage omitted]</p>

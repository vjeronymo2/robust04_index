			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS BEAT DODGERS ON A BIG HIT BY LITTLE-KNOWN LAGA  </P> <P> There's a funny thing about baseball pennant races. They sometimes don't look  like pennant races.  </P> <P> Look closely enough and you will notice, pennant races sometimes look like guys  named Mike Laga. The Giants realized that Tuesday night in a 3-2 victory over  the Dodgers in front of 20,668 at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> Trailing, 2-0, in the fifth inning, the Giants loaded the bases with two out  against Orel Hershiser. To the shock of anyone who can count to four, Matt  Williams was removed for a pinch-hitter. This was the same Williams who has 16  homers and 43 runs batted in in just 74 games, including a grand slam against  the Dodgers last month.  </P> <P> The substitute? A 29-year-old career minor leaguer named Laga.  </P> <P> For a few moments, there was silence. Then there were cheers that Laga will  probably hear until October, as he drove a pitch by Hershiser against the  right-field wall for a double, clearing the bases and giving the Giants the  eventual victory.  </P> <P> The National League West leaders, maintaining a five-game lead over the San  Diego Padres with just 11 games remaining, have a magic number of seven. And  they have a magic man who celebrated the biggest hit of his career as if he  were a wide receiver in an end zone.  </P> <P> After being removed for a pinch-runner, Laga ran off the field pumping his  helmet into the air with his left hand. When the crowd wouldn't sit, he  reappeared and pumped his helmet again.  </P> <P> "I've never had a curtain call before," an embarrassed Laga acknowledged. "But  I've seen Kevin Mitchell and Will Clark do enough to know how."  </P> <P> In the other clubhouse, Hershiser shrugged.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of thing that happens in championship seasons," he said. "You  get big efforts from young guys and role players. I know because it happened to  us a year ago."  </P> <P> Although he has lost six consecutive decisions -- his last win was Aug. 8 --  this was a different night for Hershiser. For once, his loss was his own fault.  </P> <P> Staked to a two-run lead in the first inning -- more runs than the offense had  scored for him in his previous five starts combined -- Hershiser simply gave it  back. He started the fifth by giving up a leadoff single to pinch-hitter Ken  Oberkfell, who is hitting .313 in 72 games since joining the team from the  Pittsburgh Pirates. Then he walked Brett Butler.  </P> <P> A bad bunt by Robby Thompson forced Oberkfell at third, but then Hershiser  walked Will Clark, loading the bases. A big strikeout of Kevin Mitchell later,  Hershiser looked strong.  </P> <P> But Williams, two-for-17 lifetime against Hershiser, was summoned back to the  bench. Laga, who had been in the on-deck circle the previous inning until the  Giants' third out, was ready.  </P> <P> The batter and pitcher had never faced each other, but Hershiser, who fell  behind him 2-and-0, said it didn't matter.  </P> <P> "There's no creative way to pitch with the bases loaded, no matter who is up --  Will Clark, Babe Ruth or Mike Laga," he said. "Then when you fall behind  2-and-0, no scouting report will help."  </P> <P> Laga remembers only that he hit a sinker. The rest, well, "Let's just say I was  a happy camper," he said.  </P> <P> Of course, this being a pennant race, it isn't as if Laga hasn't won a game for  the Giants before. All four of his hits since his September recall have driven  in runs.  </P> <P> In his first at-bat as a Giant, Sept. 4 in Cincinnati, he hit a two-run homer  to begin a rally from an 8-0 deficit. He later drove in the winning run with a  single in a 9-8 victory that many have credited with being the start of the  Giants' stretch run.  </P> <P> He may not be feeling all that great in a couple of weeks, because he was  recalled from triple-A Phoenix Sept. 1 and won't be eligible for the playoffs.  But having jumped from the major leagues to the minor leagues for the last  eight years, he'll adjust.  </P> <P> "When you've always been behind somebody," he said, "you're grateful for any  chance to show what you can do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Giant starter Mike LaCoss (8-10), who allowed 11 hits in five innings, was the  winning pitcher -- his first win since Aug. 11 -- but was saved by four innings  of scoreless relief by Craig Lefferts and Steve Bedrosian.  </P> <P> Mickey Hatcher's season probably ended after he left Candlestick Park before  Tuesday's game with what was diagnosed by Giants' physician Will Straw as a  hernia. Hatcher probably suffered it while lifting furniture at his home.  Hatcher returned to Los Angeles this morning where he will be examined by  Dodger team physician Michael Mellman. Hatcher never fully recovered from a  strained left hamstring that sidelined him for 15 days in August. He was  batting .322 when he came off the disabled list Aug. 21, but since then, he had  gone 10 for 48 (.208) to drop his average to .297 in 91 games.  </P> <P> Mike Davis, who can pinch-hit but still can't play the outfield because of a  sore left knee, said he was considering playing for one of the two Dodger teams  in the Arizona Instructional League after the season. "I still can't sprint,  and I need to find some way to get this leg better for next season," said  Davis, who has no idea where he will play next season. His contract expires  but, because he was a free agent two seasons ago, he cannot be a free agent  unless the Dodgers release him. He said he will discuss the situation with  Dodger officials in a couple of weeks but hinted that he wouldn't want to  return unless he has a chance to play."Los Angeles is a great place to play,  with emphasis on the phrase, 'place to play,' " Davis said. "I've been sitting  for two years, and that's sad."  </P></p>

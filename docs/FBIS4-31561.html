			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Political parties and other Albanian  organizations in the Republic of Kosova continue to react to the  so-called secret Albanian-Serb talks in Belgrade held by some  unauthorized individuals who do not enjoy the mandate of the  Albanian people of Kosova. For more details, Mehmet Haziri  reports from Prishtina:    [Haziri] At a news conference held by the Social Democratic  Party of Kosova, its chairman, academician Besim Vokshi,  declared before correspondents that, under these circumstances,  it is very natural that secret or somewhat secret talks with two  or three intellectuals of ours with the Serbian side can arouse  curiousness, as well dissatisfaction and immediate revolt.    No one can represent the Albanian people if they do not have  the legitimacy of the people. The selection for talks of these  intellectuals by the Serbs is carried out due to the similar  option they have regarding the solution of the status of Kosova,  contrary to the referendum of the Albanian people, Besim Vokshi  stressed.    He said that the Social Democratic Party of Kosova condemns  the new wave of violence and imprisonments of the  representatives of the legal institutions in Kosova, by  assessing these actions as Serbia's attempts to stop the  activity of the Albanian political parties and oblige Albanians  to accept Serbia's option on the solution of the Kosova issue.    Through a press communique, the National Unity Party  condemns  the lunches and dinners, as it is said, with the enemies of the  Albanian nation. After criticizing the anti-Albanian backstage  of Belgrade and the architects of the anti-Albanian projects,  the communique condemns the presentation of several junior  vassals who are or have emerged from the Albanian political  parties and who have no mandates and speak about restructuring  the future of Kosova.    Albanian-Serb dialogue can be carried out only by those who  have the legitimacy of the Albanian people in the Republic of  Kosova, the press communique of the National Unity Party states.    Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of the Albanian  Christian  Democratic Party considers that Albanian-Serb dialogue can begin  only in the presence of an international body and legitimate  representatives of the Albanian people can participate in it,  i.e., President Ibrahim Rugova and his co-workers, who are  appointed by him only, but not the non-legitimate persons.    The Coordinating Council of the Albanian Christian  Democratic  Party examined other issues of interest for institutionalizing  life in Kosova.</p>

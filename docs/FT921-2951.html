			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rates remain firm THE money markets remained pessimistic about a cut in UK interest rates, closing slightly firmer in a day of quiet trade. The firmer tone followed an easier opening as the markets attempted to correct Friday's excesses - when traders swapped rumours of a six point lead for Labour in the April 9 election campaign. In the event, the sighs of relief were almost audible when the polls revealed a mere one point lead for Labour. Traders dismissed the prospect of a cut in the short term, and the rate as far out as one year was even nudging 11 per cent by the end of the day. The key three month inter-bank rate closed at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent. On the futures market, the June short sterling contract fell from an opening of 89.22 to 89.15 at the close. Day-to-day funding took encouragement from the Bank of England's early actions to stem the greater than expected shortage. Tax payments put heavy pressure on the system, with the Bank of England initially forecasting a shortage of Pounds 2.15bn, which was revised twice revised upwards to end at Pounds 2.3bn. In early operations, the Bank took out the bulk of the shortage with a Pounds 1.6bn repo at 10 7/16 per cent and a token amount in the cheaper band four bank bills at 10 5/32 per cent. Late morning brought a Pounds 512m purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band three bank paper at 10 3/16 per cent, band four treasury and bank at 10 5/32 per cent. Afternoon and late assistance totalled Pounds 200m. As a result of the Bank's generous morning help, overnight rates were being quoted as low as 8 per cent. However, little money changed hands at that level, with the bulk of the cheap money being traded at noon at levels of about 9 1/2 per cent. In Germany, the March tax deadline drained funds from the market. This pushed call rates slightly higher during the day from 9.50/60 per cent to 9.55/65 per cent. Traders said they expected rates to stay at or above 9.65 per cent during the tax period. The Federal Reserve injected temporary reserves into the US banking system, as funds had firmed to 4 1/8 per cent. The injection came in the form of an unfixed three-day repurchase agreement. This means that dealers can withdraw their collateral over the agreement's term. The presumed Fed target for federal funds is 4 per cent.</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Description of Uranium Mill Tailings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Uranium mill tailings are sand-like wastes that result from the processing of uranium ore. Tailings are stored in large surface impoundments, called piles, in amounts from less than one million tons to over thirty million tons, over areas that may cover hundreds of acres. Most piles are located in the Western United States, and all piles emit radon gas, a decay product of radium in the waste material resulting from the processing of ore to recover uranium at the uranium mills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To deal specifically with the risks associated with these tailings, Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) in 1978 (42 U.S.C. 2022, 7901&hyph;7942). In enacting UMTRCA, Congress found that uranium mill tailings may pose a potential and significant radiation health hazard to the public, and that every reasonable effort should be made to provide for the stabilization, disposal, and control in a safe and environmentally sound manner of such tailings in order to prevent or minimize radon diffusion into the environment and to prevent or minimize other environmental hazards from such tailings. See 42 U.S.C. 7901(a). Under UMTRCA, two programs were established to protect public health and the environment from the hazards associated with uranium mill tailings. One program (Title I) required the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct the necessary remedial actions at designated inactive uranium mill tailing sites to achieve compliance with the general environmental standards to be promulgated by EPA. These sites were generally abandoned uranium processing sites for which a license issued by the NRC or its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was not in effect on January 1, 1978. The other program (Title II) pertained to active sites, which are those that are licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State. Requirements for licensed sites include the final disposal of tailings, including the control of radon after milling operations cease. UMTRCA also required that EPA promulgate standards for these licensed sites, including standards that protect human health and the environment in a manner consistent with standards established under Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended. The NRC, or an Agreement State, is responsible for implementing the EPA standards at licensed uranium milling sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of NRC's 1982 authorization and appropriations, Congress amended UMTRCA on January 4, 1983. Public Law 97&hyph;415, sections 18(a) and 22(b), reprinted in 2 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 96 Stat. 2077 and 2080. As partially amended thereby, EPA was required to promulgate standards of general applicability for the protection of the public health, safety, and the environment from radiological and nonradiological hazards associated with the processing and with the possession, transfer, and disposal of byproduct material as defined under section 11e(2) of the AEA, e.g., uranium mill tailings. Requirements established by the NRC with respect to byproduct material must conform to the EPA standards. Any requirements of such standards adopted by the NRC shall be amended as the NRC deems necessary to conform to EPA's standards. In establishing such standards, the Administrator was to consider the risk to the public health, safety, and the environment, the environmental and economic costs of applying such standards, and such other factors as the Administrator determines to be appropriate. See 42 U.S.C. 2022(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As promulgated by EPA under subpart D of 40 CFR part 192 in 1983 and implemented by NRC pursuant to its regulations at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A, a Title II site licensed by NRC or an Agreement State, could indefinitely continue to emit radon at levels that could result in risks higher than allowed under the CAA. It was this possibility which compelled EPA to promulgate subpart T of 40 CFR part 61 under CAA section 112. In addition, the UMTRCA regulations prior to the recent EPA amendments called for an impoundment design that would achieve compliance with the 20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> -s flux standard for 1,000 years, or at least 200 years, but they did not include any requirement that monitoring occur to verify the efficacy of the design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

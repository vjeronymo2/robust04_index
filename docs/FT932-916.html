			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI down in heavy trading A SERIES of sell recom-mendations from leading UK and US broking houses, accompanied by profits downgrades, prompted another drop in ICI shares, which ended 18 lower at 663p, after 655p. Turnover was 10m shares, the biggest single day's business since the end of February. The stock has come under consistent selling pressure since the middle of this month, retreating from just over the 700p mark. That was the highest point since the all-time peak of 806p reached just before the great crash of October 1987. ICI shares were very popular among big US institutions following the Zeneca demerger, advancing from 636p when the demerger became official and peaking at 706p. Rumours of profits downgrades in ICI have been circulating since the middle of the month when there was talk that estimates were being lowered to Pounds 200m to Pounds 230m from previous levels of around Pounds 300m. These rumours have now become factual. A number of brokers are said to have been in contact with ICI recently and to have adjusted their forecasts. In the US, PaineWebber reduced 1993 earnings per share estimates from Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.40. In the UK, Kleinwort Benson Securities added ICI to its 'sell' list, describing the stock as 'too expensive' and saying estimates are too high. NatWest Securities issued a 'sell' note yesterday, adopting the view that 'signs from the chemicals industry are now pointing to cyclical recovery being delayed. Although we believe ICI could generate earnings per share of 80p by 1997, this does not make the long term price/earnings ratio exciting, nor does it suggest much more for dividend growth'.</p>

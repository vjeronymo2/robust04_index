			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): A shade greener Trial recycling projects have saved Virgin Atlantic Airways more than Pounds 500,000 in the past year. The British carrier now plans to extend the scheme. Green-clad flight attendants will tour cabins on some flights urging passengers to recycle in-flight disposables, such as cups and newspapers. Virgin will donate to local communities and institutions, such as prisons and youth centres, discarded items from on-board hand-outs such as socks and eye-shades.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santagadea  has told the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva military  courts will try the soldiers allegedly involved in the murder of  10 people at La Cantuta University. The minister has said if  Armed Forces members are indeed involved in this crime, their  sentences will show there is no impunity in Peru.    On another topic, Vega has also reported that 95 percent of  terrorist leaders are now in jail and that hope has been  restored in Peru. The shadow of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist  Communism no longer hovers over the country's future, the  justice minister has said. He added, however, the struggle  against terrorism and the state of emergency continued, and he  justified the validity of several measures geared toward  punishing and eradicating subversion.</p>

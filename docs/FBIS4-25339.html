			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Yuan Jianda (5913 1696 6671): "Some </F> Foreign-Invested Enterprises Correctly Handle Labor-Capital  Relations"]    [Text] This reporter learned from the Fujian Federation of  Trade Unions a few days ago that a number of foreign-invested  enterprises in Fujian had, over the last few years, correctly  handled labor-capital relations, operated and organized trade  unions according to law, and safeguarded workers' legitimate  rights and interests.    There is a Fujian Hitachi Television Set Company Ltd. in  Fuzhou, a Sino-Japanese joint venture established in late 1980.  In the early days of the company, it organized, at the Chinese  side's insistence, a trade union according to China's relevant  regulations and international practice. The trade union has  earnestly exercised its four social functions as required by the  central government and carried out various activities, focusing  on promoting democratic management of the enterprise, raising  economic efficiency, enhancing workers' moral standards and  professional competence, and promoting cultural progress, and  has achieved marked results. They set up China's first congress  of workers and staff of a joint venture in 1989, and then  established democratic managerial bodies at the team, workshop,  and factory levels. To institutionalize and standardize  democratic management involving workers and staff, the trade  union formulated regulations on the congress of workers and  staff and the trade union members' representative assembly so  workers and staff would really participate in democratic  management of the enterprise. The congress of workers and staff  has called 14 sessions since its founding to examine the  enterprise's major management decisions including the  enterprise's "annual management guidelines and objectives."    The trade union also regarded signing and honoring labor  contracts as its central task. After studying China's relevant  laws and regulations and conducting many investigations, they  worked out labor contracts acceptable to both the owner and the  workers of the enterprise. In the process of enforcing the  contract, the trade union played an active supervisory role so  that the contract was observed. In a certain year, the workers  were each entitled to a bonus equivalent to one or  one-and-a-half months' wages since they had fulfilled the  production quota, but the Japanese side only agreed to grant a  bonus amounting to half-a-month's wages. The trade union argued  strongly on just grounds on behalf of the workers, and finally  the Japanese side agreed to pay the bonus in full as stipulated  in the contract. Since labor-capital relations have been stable  enabling workers to bring their wisdom into full play, the  enterprise has grown with each passing day and has become an  important production and export base for television sets in  China.    China Fuwan (Fujian) Toys Company Ltd., is another joint  venture with distinctive features. This Chinese-Japanese  company has done a large amount of work in enforcing China's  laws and regulations on labor protection, exercising management  with civility, and ensuring workers' health.    In a visit to the company, this reporter found that the  workshops were spacious and bright and air conditioners were  installed in most. Electric fans were provided for some  workshops where air conditioners were unsuitable for production.  Every day workers had two 10-minute breaks during which they  were allowed to buy cold drinks and enjoy a chat with friends at  the small shop attached to the company. To stimulate the  workers' cultural life in their spare time, the company  authorized the trade union to establish a club, a reading room,  and a singing-and-dancing hall. They took special care of women  workers, giving them articles for sanitation every month, and  requiring them to have a physical check-up every two years. In  March this year, a women worker's house caught fire causing a  great loss for her. The trade union workers immediately rushed  to her place to express sympathy and solicitude and encouraged  other fellow workers to make donations. Again, they made a  claim to the insurance company for damages on her behalf so that  she would overcome her difficulties.    The Nanan Baoqun Shoe Company Ltd., wholly owned by a Taiwan  businessman, enjoys a good reputation in Fujian. Wang Kuo-hui,  the Taiwanese board-of-directors chairman, has enthusiastically  supported the trade union in its work and has taken good care of  workers' lives, arousing enthusiasm for production. Since the  trade union was set up, he has given it full support in matters  related to personnel allocations and workers' living expenses.  In light of the situation that the work force is mainly  composed of women, the trade union demanded the company provide  special articles for labor protection to women workers, and Wang  immediately acted as requested. In the hot season last year,  Wang fixed ventilation equipment in the workshops at the trade  union's suggestion and provided drinking water. On days off or  festive occasions, the company provides special funds to the  trade union for carrying out cultural activities or sports meets  or to send outstanding workers to a scenic spot in Xiamen to  spend their holidays. Wang also saw to it that the trade union  played a safeguarding role in the enterprise. In September last  year, when the company produced a new product involving more  complicated procedures, the workers demanded higher wages.  Based on investigations, the trade union considered the  workers' demand reasonable. The company, which fully valued the  trade union's advice, then agreed to grant additional wages.</p>

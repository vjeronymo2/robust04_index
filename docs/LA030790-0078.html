			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU COACH DIETZ HAS HEART TROUBLES  </P> <P> Jim Dietz, a self-admitted workaholic as coach/caretaker for the baseball  program at San Diego State, was diagnosed Tuesday as having an irregular  heartbeat, his wife said.  </P> <P> Carol Dietz said more tests are scheduled for today and might help determine  the severity of the problem.  </P> <P> Dietz, 51, missed Tuesday's game against the University of San Diego -- a 7-2  Aztec victory -- and has been told by his doctor to take it easy for a while.  </P> <P> Dietz had been complaining of chest pains for a couple of weeks and made an  appointment last Thursday with his physician, Dr. Charles Inman, Carol Dietz  said.  </P> <P> "I've been after him for a long time to slow down," she said. "It's unfortunate  it's taken something like this to do it.  </P> <P> "He's already commented that he's bored to tears."  </P> <P> Carol Dietz said she was surprised at the finding. "I thought they would say  'You're under a lot of stress, you work too hard, and you don't eat right.' I  thought they would say, 'Slow down and watch your diet.'  </P> <P> "Apparently, it's a little more serious than that."  </P> <P> Carol Dietz said her husband was prescribed medication and has been restricted  to four to five hours of activity a day for the time being. That did not stop  him from going to the office to do some paper work Tuesday night, she said.  </P> <P> Dietz could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Dietz is in his 19th year at SDSU and has a 780-430-15 career mark, 14th in the  NCAA in victories. He has built the Aztec program by often working up to 16  hours a day.  </P> <P> "As coaches, we're always doing things for someone else and sometimes neglect  ourselves," USD Coach John Cunningham said. "I'm not sure if Jim can work  four-hour days, but I'm sure if that's what it takes, he'll do it."  </P> <P> SDSU baseball has suffered financial cutbacks in recent years because of  athletic department deficits. Dietz was particularly worried before this season  about the program continuing on the level it has been.  </P> <P> "Jimmy doesn't sleep at night worrying how he's going to pay bills . . . The  guy is just stressed out," said Gary Kondratek, the Aztecs' pitching coach. "He  wants to run a legitimate Division I program, and he's just worked out."  </P> <P> Said Cunningham, "He needs some help from the administration. It's about time  someone else worried about saving the program."  </P> <P> As respected as Dietz is for his baseball knowledge, he is also known for  idiosyncrasies that include a diet seemingly built around fast food.  </P> <P> "Every time we see him, he's eating McDonald's," SDSU senior outfielder Anthony  Johnson said.  </P> <P> Aztec players learned of Dietz's condition before Tuesday's game at USD's  Cunningham Stadium.  </P> <P> "We were wondering where he was, because he's usually the first guy here,"  Johnson said.  </P> <P> Steve Dietz, a freshman infielder on the team, learned of his father's  condition before leaving for USD. He was at the game but did not play.  </P> <P> SDSU defeated USD in typical Dietz style. It produced seven runs on 10 hits and  five stolen bases and got strong pitching.  </P> <P> Second baseman Brian Grebeck continued his torrid hitting with a single and a  double, three walks, three runs and a run batted in. Grebeck has now reached  base 14 consecutive times (not counting a sacrifice fly) over the past four  games. Kevin Nielson (3-1) worked 5 1/3 innings for the victory, striking out  five. Rusty Filter got his third save, striking out seven of the 12 batters he  faced, including three in a row to end the game.  </P> <P> Rick Doane extended his hitting streak to nine games and lifted his average to  .456 with a home run and two singles for USD (7-11).  </P> <P> The Aztecs (11-6) play host to UC San Diego today at 5 p.m. at Smith Field.  They then travel to Nevada Las Vegas for a three-game weekend series. Kondratek  said Dietz is not sure if he will make the trip.  </P></p>

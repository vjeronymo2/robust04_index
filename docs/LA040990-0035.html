C., on 12 counts of  lying to the federal grand jury that indicted television evangelist Jim Bakker.  </P> <P> The Rev. Samuel Johnson is charged with lying when he said he could not  remember the source of $10,000 that became the initial payment to keep Jessica  Hahn from talking about her 15-minute sexual encounter with Bakker in 1980.  Johnson faces up to 60 years in prison. He will face Assistant U.S. Atty. Jerry  Miller, who won Bakker's conviction last October, and U.S. District Judge  Robert Potter, who sentenced Bakker to 45 years in prison.  </P></p>

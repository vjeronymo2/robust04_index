			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> i. Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents accompanying the statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show the amount and type of fee on the dated debit slip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Relation to Regulation E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Disclosure of fees in compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for fees related to electronic fund transfers (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(4) Length of Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions providing the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included in the period. For example, stating ``April 1 through April 30'' would clearly indicate that both April 1 and April 30 are included in the period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Opening or closing an account mid-cycle.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions must calculate the annual percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.7_Payment of Dividends <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Permissible Methods <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Prohibited calculation methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the account each day include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The ``rollback'' method, also known as the ``grace period'' or ``in by the 10th'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for the period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. The ``increments of par value'' method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g., a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. The ``ending balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. The ``investable balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. The ``low balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for any day in that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Use of 365-day basis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the dividend rate_such as 1/360 of the dividend rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Periodic dividend payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for a one-year term share account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal to 1/12 of the amount of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform monthly payments_each equal to roughly 1/12 of the total amount of dividends_and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total amount of dividends earned for the period). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Leap year.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will earn dividends for February 29.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Maturity of term share accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions are not required to pay dividends after term share accounts mature. Examples include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. During any grace period offered by a credit union for an automatically renewable term share account, if the member decides during that period not to renew the account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

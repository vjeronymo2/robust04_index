			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Move to simplify power trading THE ELECTRICITY industry will try to simplify controversial methods of trading power as part of a wide-ranging review of the electricity wholesale pool. The decision yesterday by the electricity pool executive will be welcomed by intensive energy users which say the trading system is understood by few and is open to abuse. In a three-pronged approach to reform, the executive, comprising representatives from the electricity generators and regional power companies, will also focus on 'demand-side participation' and transmission services. Supporters of demand-side participation argue that intensive users should be rewarded more for flexibility over when and how they take electricity. Examination of transmission services could include a look at whether pool participants should pay varying prices depending on where they are located. The reform of the pool was launched last year amid widespread complaints from intensive energy users that they were paying too much for their electricity following privatisation of the industry three years ago. The pool was set up during privatisation. In last month's white paper on coal, the government said it was considering whether to allow large users to bypass the pool. Some companies, including Imperial Chemical Industries, have been pressing to be allowed to buy electricity directly from generators. Other pool participants say the effect of this would be to put up prices for other consumers. The white paper also noted suggestions that demand-side participation should be introduced and said it would consult on whether this would be beneficial.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OVERSIGHT MAY COST CAMARILLO TITLE  </P> <P> Camarillo High violated a new state rule that limits a pitcher to 30 outs in a  calendar week during the Scorpions' 4-2 win over Chatsworth last Saturday in  the Blue Division championship of the Westside tournament at UCLA's Jackie  Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> Camarillo's Eric Raba pitched 14 innings, or 42 outs, last week. He pitched  seven innings in an 8-2 win over Notre Dame last Tuesday, then pitched a second  complete game in the victory over Chatsworth. The rule, which went into effect  this season, limits a pitcher to 30 outs from Monday through Saturday.  </P> <P> According to state rules, violation of the new rule results in a forfeit. But  Chuck Ice, the tournament director, said Monday that a decision regarding the  championship game will not be made until he contacts the Southern Section  office today.  </P> <P> Camarillo received commemorative T-shirts and a first-place trophy last  Saturday.  </P> <P> "The game stands until we verify that it (a violation) happened," Ice said. Ice  was a member of the baseball advisory committee that developed the new rule.  </P> <P> Camarillo Coach Jack Willard said it was an embarrassing oversight.  </P> <P> "I knew the rule, but my thinking was that Raba pitched Tuesday, had three days  rest, and was coming back on Saturday," said Willard, a first-year coach. "I  wasn't trying to be sneaky and trick somebody. I just didn't pay attention."  </P> <P> Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn, also in his first year, said he, too, was  unaware of the violation. Raba, a senior right-hander who would have been  limited to three innings in Saturday's game, silenced Chatsworth rallies in the  fifth and sixth innings.  </P> <P> Raba allowed six hits, three walks, and struck out seven. He also contributed a  run-scoring triple.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked, but they still executed and we didn't," Meusborn said. "They came  to play and deserved to win."  </P> <P> Willard said his players were understandably disappointed with Monday's news.  </P> <P> "It's their job to play, and my job to know those rules," Willard said. "It was  my mistake, and I take full credit for it."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--The Abu-Nidal group has applied to join a  Palestinian alliance opposed to the moderate strategies of  Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat,  and the factions in the Damascus-based coalition appeared to be  split over the issue, informed sources said Saturday [29  January].    The Abu-Nidal [group], formally calling itself Fatah  Revolutionary Council (FRC), renewed its bid to join the  alliance after the coalition named a 20-member leadership  council on Jan. 19, the sources said. An earlier FRC bid to  join the alliance, when it was first created as a loose umbrella  in September 1992, was turned down.    According to the sources, the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) of Nayif Hawatimah oppose any  membership for the Abu-Nidal group in the alliance. It is  citing the numerous attacks on PLO officials claimed or  attributed to the Abu-Nidal group and objecting its entry into  the alliance, they said.    "Abu-Nidal's hands are stained with Palestinian blood, and  he  has no place in a Palestinian nationalist group," according to a  senior DFLP official.    The DFLP also argues that the presence of the FRC in the  alliance would be insignificant in view of the small size of the  group. It is estimated that the Abu-Nidal group has less than  200 members scattered around in the Arab World, but mainly in  Lebanon.    The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, believes tht the FRC  should be given a chance to enter the coalition if it publicly  accepts the principles of the alliance and pledges to abide by  them, according to the sources.    Hamas, which claims to be the largest faction in the  10-group  alliance, also believes that any decision on the FRC bid for  membership should be decided by the leadership council, which is  scheduled to meet in early February in Damascus to elect a  president, they said.    Other leading groups in the alliance include the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP); dissident wings of  Fatah, the main-stream group of Mr. 'Arafat; the Communist Party  and the Palestine Liberation Front are also members in addition  to Lebanon-based factions such as Islamic Jihad-Palestine and  Hizballah- Palestine. Their views on the FRC bid were not known  immediately.    The leadership council is made up of two members each from  the 10 groups.    Abu-Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is one of the  most wanted men in the world. His group has been blamed for a  series of violent attacks in the Middle East and Europe,  including the 1986 attacks at Rome and Vienna airports which  killed more than 20 people.    Abu-Nidal was expelled from Syria in the late 80s. His group  was believed to have moved to Libya and stayed there for a few  years before the Tripoli government launched a crackdown on the  group in 1990-91.    Several leading activists of the group were reported to have  been killed in a bitter power struggle while it was based in  Libya.</p>

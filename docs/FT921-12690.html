			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Uneasy times in the retail sector - A variety of pressures affecting US stores SOMETHING, to coin a phrase, is rotten in the US retail sector. The question is, how quickly can the situation be repaired? Casual observers, noting a wave of post-Christmas announcements from the industry, have every reason to be confused. On the one hand, the former Campeau-owned chains - 11 in all, including high-profile names such as Bloomingdale's and Jordan Marsh - are poised to emerge from bankruptcy. Revco, a mid-west drugstore group with over 1,000 outlets, seems headed in a similar direction. But Macy's, the New York-based department store group, has been forced to delay post-Christmas payments to suppliers so that bankers' requirements can be met. Zale Corporation, the nation's largest jewellery retailer, last night filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors, while Seaman's, a prominent east coast furniture chain taken private in a leveraged buy-out three years ago, has succumbed, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 3. Woolworth - one of the country's biggest general merchandise retailers with over 9,000 outlets - has unveiled a big operational overhaul, including the shedding of certain specialty chains. Although a few rare retail stars, such as The Gap, a fast-growing fashion chain, posted double-digit same-store sales gains in December, even Wal-Mart, the stock market's discount darling, managed only 5 per cent. So what does it all add up to? For a start, the sector's problems need to be seen in perspective. No one doubts that demographics were very favourable to the retail industry in the 1970s and early 1980s. The 'baby boom' generation became wage-earners and more women joined the labour force. Personal debt levels also rose until the mid-80s - a reflection of the large youthful working population and general affluence. According to analysts at Salomon Brothers, this prompted shopping space to increase by over 200 per cent between 1972 and 1984. Population growth, however, was just 12 per cent. Now, as the 'baby boomers' begin to age and turn their attention to savings, some fundamental fizz must drain from the 'over-stored' retail marketplace. But other pressures weigh in, too. The most obvious is the recession, and the deterioration in consumer spending trends. Recent statistics have shown consumer spending for retail goods edged up by only 0.7 per cent in 1991 - the smallest increase since sales declined by 0.1 per cent 30 years ago. Since the figures do not allow for inflation, the 'true' picture suggests an underlying fall. At a more anecdotal level, most retailers point to the correlation between consumer caution and job fears - a worry which the announcement of 14,000 lay-offs at United Technologies only serves to perpetuate. Second, trends within US retailing have benefited certain segments of the industry at the expense of others. During the 1980s, for example, the notion of 'niche retailing' or 'specialty stores' took hold in formidable fashion, undermining the traditional department store concept. Discount retailing also acquired a new twist with the development of 'warehouse clubs' - out-of-town barns selling at rock-bottom to membership customers. Finally, there is the overhang of the 80s bid-frenzy and high levels of leverage which have developed within the sector. In common with airlines, retail chains were superficially well-suited to the 'leverage' scenario. In non-recessionary times, they combined tangible assets, in the form of property holdings and inventories, with strong cash-flows. Capital expenditure, meanwhile, could usually be pruned short-term to help meet interest expenses. In practice, the last problem has arguably been the simplest to solve. As soon as consumer expenditure fell away, companies with the most ambitious capital structures came unstuck. A string of bankruptcies - including Revco, Federated and Allied Department Stores (the Campeau-owned subsidiaries), Ames Department Stores, California's Carter Hawley Hale and Hills Department Stores - resulted. Since then, creditors have steadily bitten the bullet, and in most cases some form of financial restructuring - usually involving a debt-for-equity swap and some asset sales to provide a cash payout - is under negotiation. In the best situations, such as Federated/Allied, corporate purgatory is virtually over and an overhauled balance sheet in view. This process is not at an end. Many analysts reckon that some companies still need to resolve capital structure problems. But, that caveat aside, it is probably fair to assume the largest wave of retail bankruptcies has passed. The other factors prompting the sector's decline may be more difficult to resolve. There are predictions galore about the path of the US economy - but the consensus suggests only a slow upturn at best. 'We're still waiting to see signs of life in the US consumer,' comments Barbara Wedelstaedt, retail analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei, the high-yield specialists. 'I think we'd be looking for a very slow recovery in the sector next year.' For some retail groups, even this modest recovery may be hampered by consumers' increased attention to 'value' - a predictable recessionary trend  -and the new retailing techniques designed to satisfy this. 'I reckon profitability will still be tight,' commented one pundit. 'There's a switch to value, and consumers will look for lower initial prices and then discounting'. All of which points to the continued need to update systems and minimise costs. Perhaps one of the best things going for the retail sector, is the combination of record stock market levels and ultra-cheap debt, which makes investment funds more accessible. Retailers have not been slow to seize the opportunity. At the end of 1991, Salomon Brothers noted investment-grade retailers had raised over Dollars 3bn in the debt markets during the previous eight months - with four leading names, Dayton Hudson, JC Penney, May Department Stores and Wal-Mart accounting for 80 per cent of this money. Three others have tapped the equity markets - including K mart, via a Dollars 1.12bn issue of Percs, the latest financial product to hit Wall Street. It is a small break - in an otherwise discomforting picture.</p>

At the meeting, several views and remarks were presented  with  the aim of enriching the subject to find a sound treatment that  stands as the basic pillars for building the modern Yemeni  state, the state of law and order, and in a manner that assists  the judiciary in eliminating all adverse phenomena.    The meeting approved the formation of a committee to study  the paper presented by various parties on the principles for  building the state in order to work out a paper on the subject  and to present it to the PFDC at its forthcoming meeting.    The PFDC continued discussing the ideas presented by the  dialogue's parties, and through serious and responsible dialogue  and through sincere interaction the committee made decisive  decisions on the first point on its agenda, and approved a  number of procedures.    Concerning the media; television, radio, and newspapers; the  committee decided that no statements relating to officials which  speak about any political party or hint about a charge against a  party, parties, or individuals should be broadcast or published.  The media should refrain from becoming involved in issues that  fuel the crisis.    The committee called for expanding interviews and programs  on  the decisions on which the dialogue parties agree, and  emphasizing the programs, interviews, and seminars that call for  unity and integration of the national front, and which call for  rapprochement between political groups in the country. It  called for rejecting the statements, interviews, and speeches  from any party that condemn any party or individual in the  government with the aim of escalating the crisis and obstructing  the dialogue. It calls for refraining from leaking news to  foreign media on the crisis and for refraining from leaking  anything that fuels the crisis, escalates differences, harms the  national unity and thy unity of the internal front.    The committee decided that the officials should not make any  statements on the crisis in the country, and warned any Yemeni  correspondent or reporter for foreign media against publishing  false and fabricated news on the crisis and the dialogue.    As for those accused of security violations, the PFDC  emphasized that decisive measures should be taken to arrest  fleeing suspects involved in assassinations, assassination  attempts, highway robberies, and other cases of security  violations, and to immediately begin trying those arrested in  sabotage actions in legal and open trials.    The committee says anyone who provides shelter to a suspect  wanted by security organs, or anyone who hides a jail breaker  will be considered a violator of the law, and legal actions will  be taken against him.    The PFDC stressed the need to expeditiously issue a law on  bearing arms, implement it, and review the current law to make  it more strict to limit bearing arms and to curb their use and  trading in them. Investigations should continue to locate camps  or areas used to train people to commit violent acts and to take  the appropriate measures in this regard.    Regarding the security and military aspect, the PFDC decided  to remove all checkpoints inside and outside the cities  regardless of whether they are affiliated with the Defense  Ministry, the Interior Ministry, or both ministries.    The PFDC called for holding general reconciliation to stop  the bloodshed of the Yemenis. In accordance with this  reconciliation, no revenge will be taken, and anyone who takes  revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state  organs will be responsible for taking tough legal measures  against those outlaws. The PFDC decided to move the units from  the outskirts of some areas in the governorates of Ta'izz, Lahj,  Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib and to redeploy them  in areas agreed upon by an Armed Forces technical committee.  The Defense Ministry will take measures to implement this and a  decree to this effect will be issued within one week with  implementation to begin immediately afterward.    The PFDC decided that no military patrols should move in  cities or on roads. Police will be responsible for patrols in  accordance with security requirements.    The PFDC decided to withdraw the Armed Forces from the  cities  and to redeploy them within a period that does not exceed two  months in accordance with a central, scientific, and united plan  that prepares for their merger, organization, and straightening  out their affairs provided that their merger will not take more  than four months following the withdrawal from cities. The  military police's role will be confined to the security and  discipline of the military units. The military police are not  allowed to carry out activities or patrolling that conflict with  the authority of the public security. The Armed Forces  commanders and soldiers are also prevented from intervening in  the affairs of the government authorities, the local issues of  citizens, or the governorates affairs. They are also prevented  from carrying out any activity in their working areas that  conflict with the duties of the judicial, executive, or  political authorities. There will be no recruitment, arming, or  mobilization of any units, militias, border guards, popular  guards, or any similar groups and the formation of any new  groups shall be canceled. The PFDC decided to void all illegal  promotions that have been awarded since the beginning of 1993.</p>

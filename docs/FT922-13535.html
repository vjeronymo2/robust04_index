			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Hopes of disposal boost ICI TALK that ICI might be about to sell off one of its divisions was behind a good performance for the shares, which advanced 14 to 1273p. Analysts said the market believed that the chemicals company would soon announce the disposal of its fibres subsidiary, following a report in a leading US trade magazine. There is a feeling that US chemicals group Du Pont wants to buy the division to get a foothold in Europe and observers estimate that it could be worth around Pounds 350m to ICI. The latter said it never comments on market rumour. Mr Charles Lambert of securities house Smith New Court said the sale would be good for sentiment and could be worth some 30p on ICI's share price, but would not impinge heavily on the company's balance sheet. ICI said yesterday it had completed the sale of its rock salt and white salt businesses to a US-based investor group in a deal valued at about Pounds 40m. Forte pressured Hotel group Forte came under pressure on consideration of Queens Moat Houses' results, released on Wednesday, which pointed to continued poor hotel occupancy rates in the UK. Queens Moat, which derives around 40 per cent of its profits from continental Europe, reported UK occupancy rates for the first two months of the year below the level a year ago - a period when the hotel trade was hit badly by the Gulf war. Hoare Govett yesterday sounded a cautious note on Forte, pointing out that the group is heavily exposed to the UK market. The shares slipped a penny to 214p in busy trading of 1.3m. Queens Moat rose 2 to 73p, helped by a strong buy note from Paribas. Reuters slides Information group Reuters shed 20 to 1085p on turnover of 1.8m shares, heavy for the stock, as a result of what one analyst called 'Wall Street paranoia'. More than a third of Reuters shares are held by US investors and Wall Street has fallen sharply in recent days. Also, a couple of UK securities houses have turned cautious this week. However, Henderson Crosthwaite was a strong buyer yesterday and Mr Brian Newman, the firm's Reuters analyst, said: 'We think the stock is oversold and I believe that the launch date for its automated foreign exchange system Dealing 2000-2 is imminent.' Building group Amec saw its shares rise in spite of a loss of Pounds 9.9m against profits of Pounds 42.2m last year, with property write-downs the culprit. However, Amec's other markets appear generally solid, and the group is holding on to cash of Pounds 76m. One building analyst argued that given the fact that Amec's dividend is covered this year, and taking account of the company's strong cash position, a yield of 9.2 per cent - similar to Wimpey and Costain - is too high. He added that the shares should move to a lower yield of say 8 per cent, implying a price of around 170p. Yesterday the shares moved forward 11 to 149p. A buy note from Nomura helped Cable and Wireless rise 10 to 538p. The house liked the telecoms group's refocusing of strategy, although as in the case of others it is cautious over restructuring costs. Rumours of a late surge in support for the Conservatives made BT partly-paid the most heavily traded stock of the day with over 10m shares recorded. The partly-paid finished 6 3/4 ahead at 100 1/2 p. The ordinary shares gained 7 to 314p. Euro Disney remained friendless as the fall-out from this week's analysts' visit to the Paris site continued to pull the stock down. Further trouble for the theme park, which opens its doors to the public this weekend, can be expected next week when a number of analysts are likely to produce negative reports. The shares retreated 22 to 1433p. Rank Organisation, seen as a safe political hedge, continued its strong surge, ending 19 higher at 688p. BP recovered some of its recent fall as the effect of a buy recommendation from securities house Hoare Govett made itself felt. Hoare has changed its stance from a hold and argues that the bad news surrounding the company is already discounted. The shares gained 2 1/2 to 248p. If any sector was guaranteed to benefit from rumours about a late increase in support for the Conservatives it was the politically sensitive utilities. Hopes that the party responsible for privatisation of the electricity and water industries would hang on to power resulted in sharp gains by shares in both sectors. The Electricity Package rose Pounds 93 to Pounds 2453, after rallying Pounds 92 on Wednesday. Scottish power companies continued to recover some of their losses. Scottish Hydro improved 6 to 85p and Scottish Power 7 to 83p. Among water companies, Anglian gained 14 to 331p, Thames 15 to 344p and Welsh Water 16 to 356p. Politics were the main factor boosting stores, and not just speculation about a late swing to the Tories. County NatWest issued a note saying that a Labour government would not be as bad for the sector as sentiment suggested. Analyst Ms Kimlan Cook at County said that if the Conservatives managed to achieve an overall majority shares would surge anyway, but if Labour formed the next government prices would come off, representing good buying opportunities for the quality stocks. Dixons, up 12 at 210p, was identified by County as a particular buying target, partly because it is not as politically vulnerable as feared, and among other reasons the company's US operation is no longer a negative factor. Other selective buy recommendations from NatWest's investment arm were Argos, which appreciated 14 to 247p, Boots, ahead 12 at 419p, Marks and Spencer, up 10 at 301p, and WH Smith, 22 stronger at 415p. Traders marked up the price of Wellcome on news that former tennis star Mr Arthur Ashe is using its Retrovir drug to treat Aids. The shares closed 24 ahead at 1086p after unimpressive turnover. Speculation that new contracts would be announced with next week's interim figures helped Smiths Industries jump 14 to 276p. Construction equipment distributor and maker BM Group closed 12 down at 294p. A number of large holders of the stock are known to have sold out over the last few weeks as worries surfaced over the integration of Thomas Robinson, which it acquired in January. There is also concern about the company's exposure to the troubled building and construction sector. Worries about the financial health of Eurotunnel left the shares 10 weaker at 403p, making it one of the handful of FT-SE stocks to buck the market trend.

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Hanson bets on rebound in plastics: The UK conglomerate's bid for Quantum Anyone who thought Hanson was settling into sedate old age was swiftly disabused yesterday. Lords Hanson and White may be getting on in years. But as their Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.13bn) bid for Quantum Chemical shows, they are still good for a gamble. In bidding for Quantum, one of America's biggest bulk petrochemicals makers, Hanson is taking on a hugely indebted company in a wickedly cyclical industry. Bulk plastics prices have plunged in the recession. In the past two years, Quantum has made net losses totalling Dollars 411m. Its net worth is minus Dollars 471m. Hanson, with no previous experience of petrochemicals, is betting the cycle is about to turn up. If the gamble sounds heroic, Hanson is shortening the odds in three respects. First, it is paying Hanson shares for Quantum's equity, valued at Dollars 720m. Second, it will refinance Quantum's Dollars 2.5bn debt mountain at much lower rates. Hanson has worked this tactic before, in taking over the similarly over-borrowed aggregates and housebuilding company Beazer for Pounds 351m two years ago. Quantum, Hanson said yesterday, is paying rates of more than 10 per cent on its debt. 'We currently borrow at less than half that rate,' Hanson said. The net effect, it claims, will be a saving of Dollars 125m in the first year. Third, Quantum has just invested Dollars 1.6bn in new plant. This gives Hanson crucial breathing space. Highly capital intensive industries such as petrochemicals can generate cash even while recording losses. This is especially true if, as in Quantum's case, there is the prospect of an investment holiday for the next few years. But the real prize would come if the cycle turned up. Last year, Quantum made operating profits of just Dollars 61m on sales of Dollars 1.2bn. In 1988, at the peak of the cycle, it made operating profits of Dollars 760m. Hanson calculates that every cent per pound on the price of polyethylene adds Dollars 35m-Dollars 40m to profits. 'We know that patience is required,' Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries in the US, said yesterday. 'But we would rather get in while we have a chance to buy value.' Though Hanson is new to the world of petrochemicals, it has plenty of experience of the bulk chemicals cycle. In 1985 Hanson acquired the US conglomerate SCM, the world's third biggest producer of the chemical pigment titanium dioxide. Hanson bought SCM at the bottom of the cycle. It then sold off the rest of the company, thus getting the titanium dioxide business almost for nothing. Then the cycle turned up, and in the late 1980s Hanson profited hugely. What are the chances of pulling off the trick again? All plastics are suffering from over-capacity, poor domestic demand, rock-bottom prices and a collapse in export markets, in particular to Asia. The low density polyethylene (LDPE) sector, of which Quantum is the US's largest manufacturer, is probably the best placed of all plastics markets. The company has an annual capacity of about 717,000 tonnes and about 20.5 per cent market share. 'LDPE is profitable at the moment, and there isn't much additional capacity to come on stream,' says Mr Don Bari, a partner at Chem Systems, the specialist consultants. Supply and demand is not too badly out of shape, he says, with American LDPE capacity expected to be 3.7m tonnes next year and domestic production requirements at 3.43m tonnes. However, the outlook for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) is far grimmer. The two markets are closely linked because many US plants are capable of switching production from one to the other. Quantum is the second largest producer of HDPE, with capacity of about 776,000 tonnes a year, and about 14 per cent of the US market. It is also the third largest US manufacturer of LLDPE with capacity of about 300,000 tonnes a year and about 16.5 per cent of the US market. Analysts believe there is not a single manufacturer of HDPE in the US making money at the moment. From a peak of about 45 cents per lb in 1990, prices have plummeted to 28 cents. Recent attempts to raise them have been unsuccessful. The market is unlikely to recover until 1996 at the earliest. But it could be further undermined by two new plants due to come on stream in the next 12 months, a 250,000 tonnes a year plant owned by Formosa, and a 225,000 tonnes complex built by Himont. A further 650,000 tonnes of LLDPE is due to come on stream when a Unipol plant is completed in about 1995. New York analysts gave the deal their cautious approval yesterday. Mr Paul Raman, of SG Warburg, said: 'Fundamentally, this appears to be a good deal for both companies.' Hanson, he suggested, might float off the Suburban Propane business for Dollars 400m, sell the Texas ethylene plant for Dollars 700m and shed the rest of the non-polyethylene business for Dollars 625m. It would be surprising if Hanson has not done sums along these lines. But the key point remains the timing of the chemicals cycle. In buying Beazer, Hanson took a similar punt on the aggregates cycle in the US. So far, the results have been meagre. Given the higher stakes in the Quantum deal, there is less margin for error this time.

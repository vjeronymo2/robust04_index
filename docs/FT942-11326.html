			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: GATT director-general to visit Beijing Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will visit Beijing for six days next week to discuss negotiations on Chinese membership of the world trade body, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. During his visit Mr Sutherland is due to meet President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and top trade officials. There is widespread backing among Gatt members for China to be readmitted to the organisation, which it left in 1950, but most western governments are insisting on special terms and Washington's position remains equivocal.</p>

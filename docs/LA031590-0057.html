			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASING COMMUTER NIGHTMARES;  </P> <P> ATTENTION L.A.: ORANGE COUNTY HAS A BETTER IDEA  </P> <P> The railroad opened the West to settlers and now it can help open it up again  for commuters. No one way to travel can supply all the answers to relieve a  region's traffic congestion. However, in the mix of high-occupancy vehicle  lanes, buses and vans, the iron horse belongs on any list for easing Southern  California's mass transportation problems.  </P> <P> Each transportation decision made or not made affects the overall picture.  That's why it's heartening to see Orange County doing something to encourage  commuters to ride the rails and discouraging to see Los Angeles County stalling  on an opportunity to lay groundwork for its own rail system. Orange County's  choice shows foresight. Los Angeles County's does not.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission had been pushing for more than a  year to get a commuter train to ease congestion caused by the widening of the  Santa Ana Freeway. With hopes for future growth, county officials negotiated  with Amtrak for Southern California's first passenger- train service created  solely for commuters -- and tailored entirely to their schedules. Made possible  by a $1.8-million annual subsidy from the county, the train is scheduled to  begin runs in April between San Juan Capistrano and Union Station in Los  Angeles. There will be three stops: Santa Ana, Anaheim and Fullerton, with  future ones planned for Irvine and the City of Commerce.  </P> <P> Make no mistake: Getting people out of automobiles is a formidable task, even  with such foresight and planning. The mystical bond between commuters and cars  can be broken only with compelling incentives to change habits. The planned  fare subsidy of 20% for the new service is a plus. Still, for the idea to catch  on and grow, count on commuters to expect trains that are punctual and clean,  and stations that afford convenient parking. There already are concerns about  parking spaces at San Juan Capistrano that must be addressed.  </P> <P> As Orange County moves forward, opportunity to acquire some railroad rights of  way slides by in Los Angeles County. Southern Pacific and Santa Fe have five  little-used branch lines and some adjacent properties that could be in the  county's hands with some bargaining. All could be linked with Metro Rail or  light-rail lines and help the county recover a fixed-rail transit system.  </P> <P> Acquiring rail lines and running commuter trains are specific choices that can  help take cars off jammed freeways. To make sense, a regional transportation  system has to have elements that work together. But that won't just happen. It  takes planning and political will.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Union Station  </P> <P> Orange County's new commuter train will make three stops between L.A. and San  Juan Capistrano.  </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Abta attacks bond rules: Collapsed ski companies unable to meet liabilities to customers QUALITY SKI and Winter World, two ski companies which have collapsed in the past two weeks, had arranged bonds which were insufficient to meet liabilities to customers, the Association of British Travel Agents said yesterday. Abta said the shortfall of more than Pounds 800,000 would be covered by its reserve insurance fund, which contains more than Pounds 4m. Abta said the inadequacy of the two bonds demonstrated the weakness of new government regulations which allow companies to arrange their own insurance outside the framework of travel organisations. A third ski company, Euro Express of Burgess Hill, East Sussex, collapsed yesterday, but Abta said it believed the company's bond was adequate. Quality Ski, based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and which went into liquidation last week, said customers could take their holidays with Altours, which is not part of Abta. Mr Arthur Smith, Altours' managing director, confirmed yesterday that he had been a director of Quality Ski until last February. Mr Smith said Quality Ski customers travelling by air were protected by Altours' Civil Aviation Authority licence. He said, however, that Quality Ski customers travelling by coach with Altours were not protected by a bond. Mr Ian Pinder, Quality Ski's managing director, said 74 of the 80 groups booked to go to France, Italy and Austria during the half-term holiday had elected to travel with Altours. The rest were advised to approach Abta for refunds. Quality Ski's bond was for Pounds 500,000, but Abta believes that the company owes customers more than Pounds 1m. Asked whether he was aware that his bond was inadequate, Mr Pinder said: 'I haven't got a clue.' He said that complaints should be addressed to Abta. Winter World, based in Skipton, North Yorkshire, which collapsed last Thursday, is believed to have a bond of Pounds 700,000. But its liabilities to customers are also thought to exceed Pounds 1m. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta chief executive, said: 'Bonding is not an exact science. This is why we require the underpinning of an insurance policy.' Mr Dunscombe said bonding levels and the size of the back-up fund had been increased since ski company collapses two years ago imposed severe strains on Abta finances. Under new government regulations, companies have until March 31 to ensure customers are adequately protected. Non-Abta members can take out insurance policies. Mr Dunscombe said, however, that the collapse of the ski companies showed how difficult it would be to ensure travellers were adequately protected.</p>

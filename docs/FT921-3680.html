			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Multimedia show goes on the road NOTHING SENDS a seminar audience to sleep faster than another dull overhead slide presentation. But integrating computer graphics, video and sound has been costly and complicated. However, General Parametrics, the US group which made its name in the business presentations market, has introduced the VideoShow HQ, a fully-integrated, portable multimedia presentation system which is compact, simple to operate and relatively cheap. The system is built around a 3.6kg box of electronic tricks costing Dollars 6,765 (Pounds 3,850) in its basic configuration. It offers the impact of multimedia with full-motion video, live video, stereo sound, photographic images, animation and high-quality computer graphics. Its designers claim it is simple enough for anyone to use. General Parametrics: US, 510 524 3950.</p>

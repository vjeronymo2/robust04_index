			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Environment Minister Valdo Spini by </F> Guido Credazzi in Rome; date not given: "Spini: `PSI With the  Social Christians and AD'"]    [Text] Rome -- While the splinters of the PSI [Italian  Socialist Party] are scattering in every direction, there is  someone who would like to group together at least the forces  that have flowed into the progressive camp to go into the  elections, with proportionate shares, alongside the Christian  Socialists and the AD [Democratic Alliance]. That person is  Environment Minister Valdo Spini, always on the left of the PSI  in opposition to Craxi, and who one year ago was defeated in the  vote for party secretary by Giorgio Benvenuto.    [Credazzi] Why do you want this alliance? Are you afraid of  not getting the all-important 4 percent and being left out of  things?    [Spini] Maybe we will get it, but we could also stick on 3.9  percent. It is certain, however, that not everyone will get  through. If we were united, we would be able to win 8 or 9  percent and play a competitive role in opposing a very  aggressive center that is fighting its electoral campaign  against the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] (or as Berlusconi  himself says, the communists). The question is a political one,  however -- if there is a solid reference point then the numbers  will increase.    [Credazzi] Benvenuto and Ruffolo made the same offer to Del  Turco.    [Spini] I appreciate that very much, as I do any effort that  aims to bring the Socialists back together.    [Credazzi] So you have sided with Secretary Ottaviano Del  Turco? Officially, however, you have been "isolated"....    [Spini] In Tuscany I founded Socialist Action, which  anticipated the party's decision on the progressive choice. Now  Del Turco has invited us to the party's general meeting  tomorrow, and I will make the speech outlining our program. In  10 points I will say how we can move Italy from a sort of  communistic socialism with a moderate leadership to a liberal  socialism with a progressive leadership.    [Credazzi] What do you think those socialists such as Piro,  Sacconi, Boniver, and Ando who founded the Union for Democracy  and Socialism and who are lining up with the moderate pole, will  do?    [Spini] I can see little room for them because, I repeat,  the  socialists voters are progressive. However, they asked for it  by voting for straightforward one-round voting rather than the  two- round system. They, and Martinazzoli with them, thought  that the center would be the favorites, but at the last  elections we saw Fini and Mussolini in the runoffs.    [Credazzi] What do you think of Acquaviva and Covatta lining  up with Segni?    [Spini] It is an attraction toward the Catholic world they  both come from.    [Credazzi] They are accompanied by Laura Fincato and Mauro  Seppia...    [Spini] That is a different matter. They were close to  Giuliano Amato and they thought that Amato would make that  choice.    [Credazzi] Do you think that Craxi will stand?    [Spini] I do not think so, but I cannot be sure since I have  not seen him for quite a while.    [Credazzi] What stance do you take concerning the people  under investigation? Mattina maintains that they should not  stand...    [Spini] I agree. At the end of 1984 I asked for complete  transparency in the party and in the electoral campaign, and in  my speech on our program my first point will be about "clean  politics." I believe that if the institutions want clear  standards, the judges should only intervene in pathological  cases.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Now it's a floating gilt A government bond which pays a floating rate of interest might sound like a contradiction in terms, but the Bank of England is to sell Pounds 2.5bn of variable-rate, five-year gilts on Wednesday. UK government bonds (gilts) are regarded as the best fixed-interest instrument, allowing nervous investors to fix their income. So, how should they regard a gilt paying a variable rate, reviewed every three months, and with a yield which is fiendishly difficult to calculate? The Bank says the issue is being aimed more at the wholesale markets than private investors and, if the minimum bid is anything to go by, this certainly seems the case; it has been raised from the usual Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 50,000. Investors can, however, wait until after the auction and buy in much smaller denominations from a broker. The stock will pay interest gross, which will appeal to non-taxpayers, and will be sold at auction for a discount at a minimum of Pounds 99.50 for every Pounds 100 of stock. The interest rate will be set at  1/8 per cent below the London Interbank bid rate. For the first period, this works out at an annualised interest rate of 4.98 per cent gross to be paid on June 9. The most competitive building society rates are paying well above this on Pounds 50,000 and above (see Highest Rates table, page X) but the rate is competitive for less than Pounds 5,000, although dealing costs will reduce the real return. There are no plans to make the stock available through the National Savings Stock Register. James Higgins, of the independent adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'For the private investor, the simple answer is that the bond offers nothing that a straightforward deposit - other than absolute security - does not. There is no chance of an appreciable capital movement and the yield is, frankly, not competitive.' Jeremy Alford, investment director at gilts fund manager Whittingdale, has a similar view. He says one concern for private investors will be the liquidity of the stock; the last time the Bank issued a floating-rate bond in 1979, demand was poor. 'If you think interest rates will fall further, as we do, you are better off buying a conventional gilt,' adds Alford. Attractive gilts he cites include the 6 per cent Treasury stock of August 1999 with a yield of about 6.6 per cent, and the 7 per cent of 2001 yielding 7.1 per cent. Meanwhile, another instrument that usually operates only on a fixed rate has made a variable-rate issue - permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs). These are issued by building societies and normally pay a fixed rate on interest indefinitely, since they are irredeemable. Last week, Cheshire building society became the first in the UK to issue Pibs with a floating rate, although First National, the Irish building society, launched a similar venture earlier in the month. The yield on the Cheshire Pibs is set at 2.4 percentage points above the six-month London Interbank offer rate, now yielding about 7.6 per cent. Minimum denomination is Pounds 1,000. Simon Mozley, assistant director at Hoare Govett, broker to the issue, says 'We have seen huge capital growth in Pibs until February this year but prices have fallen since. A floating-rate Pibs will not vary in price as much as one with a fixed rate, and so it offers greater capital security.'</p>

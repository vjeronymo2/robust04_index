			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Inland Steel sees return to black INLAND Steel Industries of Chicago yesterday posted its best quarterly results in almost three years during the second quarter, and issued a bullish forecast, Reuter reports from Chicago. 'We are confident that Inland will return to profitability during the second half of the year,' said Mr Robert Darnall, chairman. Of the improved quarterly results, Mr Darnall said: 'We are finally beginning to see the tangible benefits of our turnround strategy. 'Our new facilities are progressing toward their design capabilities and our cost-reduction efforts are on target. Although new orders have slowed a bit in recent weeks, steel shipments this year will show their greatest year-over-year increase since 1983,' Mr Darnall added. Inland recorded a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 2.5m, or 30 cents a share, compared with a year-ago net loss Dollars 8.5m, or 53 cents. Sales advanced to Dollars 996m from Dollars 909m in the 1992 period. The company said both of its business segments posted improved operating results. Inland Steel Co achieved an operating profit for the second consecutive quarter, while Inland Materials Distribution Group doubled its operating profit from the year-earlier period. I/N Kote, Inland's newest joint venture with Nippon Steel of Japan, advanced on schedule and operated at 86 per cent of capacity during June, the company said. Mr Darnall said that the US International Trade Commission was scheduled to rule this month on the final phase of the industry's trade cases against imports of 'dumped' and subsidised steel from 20 countries. 'If that ruling is favourable, as we expect, it will significantly reduce the flow of unfairly traded steel coming into this country and provide a more stable environment for the company and our employees,' he added.</p>

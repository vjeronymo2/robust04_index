			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Akihiko Tanaka] </F>   [Text] Since a comparative exhibit has been made of the  disassembled parts from a Chrysler Neon and our company's parts,  let's cooperate in searching for items to be the target of VA  (value analysis)." A Japanese auto maker sent this invitation to  the parts manufacturers with whom they did business during the  middle of April.    At the exhibit, the parts of the Neon, which surprised the  industry by their low price, were displayed divided into two  sections, drive related and body related. The parts of the  sponsoring manufacturer's car also were displayed, and the plan  was to compare the differences in design of the two cars.    The parts of the Neon in front of their eyes gave a fresh  shock to the various parts companies of Japan. The president of  one parts manufacturer raised a voice of admiration, "This truly  is reengineering and it is hard to believe that the workmanship  is U.S. made."    For example, there is the muffler joint. It is a one-touch  slip-on type. The Japanese-made joint requires four bolts, but  bolts are unnecessary with this method. The attachment of the  gasoline tank is simple and it is said that "places that use  several parts in the Japanese-made section are held to a few. If  the bumper could be made a unit to this extent, it would reduce  the number of parts."    Of course, if analyzed from the professional standpoint that  "the underside of the car is rusted" or "there are gaps around  the various instruments," the defects also are conspicuous.  However, insofar as Chrysler says "we made it with the intention  of competing with Japanese carmakers," the Japanese frankly  admit "there are many things to study."    Efforts are under way to thoroughly investigate parts costs,  and the various Japanese companies now say in unison that  "design capability determines 70 percent of manufacturing  costs." The sluggish demand has been prolonged and in addition  to rationalization, the greatest task for the various companies  is "a fundamental review of design." Making use of "the cheap  dollar" in "design capability" which Neon symbolizes, the major  U.S. parts manufacturers are storming "the Japanese car market."  Cherry Corporation (Illinois; president, Grant Hollett), a major  auto switch company, established a Japanese branch in Yokohama  at the end of last year, and is pushing uniquely designed  switches to Japanese firms.    "Japanese carmakers will not touch them with the cost  superiority of a few percent for U.S. products. They will use  them for the first time when there is more of a difference  adding transport, evaluation, and design costs. Cost superiority  of some tens of percent will be necessary for that." The  eloquence of branch president Hoshino is backed by  self-confidence.    U.S. Cherry products are considered modules with the switch  base parts standardized, and a metal part called a "twist lock"  of the module runs electricity to the switch knob. It is a  unique mechanism of the company, soldering is not required, and  it can be connected with one touch. The module can be adapted to  any switch, and mass production of 1 million a month will be  possible.    The part that meets the needs of the individual client is  just the knob which corresponds to the switch contact part, and  it just has to be redesigned and again produced. According to  branch president Hoshino, Japanese parts manufacturers use some  common parts, but basically, the whole switch is designed for  the individual client. The more types of cars, the more they are  compelled to have many part types and small quantity production,  and it becomes a factor in increasing costs.    ITT Automotive (Michigan; president, Timothy Luriette), a  major U.S. parts manufacturer, points out that "So long as the  Japanese car maker's own company specs are satisfied, the  position of the supplier with cost superiority becomes clear"  (Tomokazu Ataka, manager, business development department,  Japanese office of the company).    Department manager Ataka discloses that "If procurement is  made within Japan, parts which are $200 each end up $80 each  when made by ITT."    This is the price when supplied in the United States, but  even if upgraded and exported to Japan, it can be supplied to  the Japanese market at $120. That calculates to 40 percent  cheaper than the Japanese-made part.    What is the strategy to counter U.S.-made parts which are  expanding with unique "design capability"? President Akio Ono of  Car Sonic hastens to instruct employees, "Let's design so that  they can be employed in light cars also." They only have some  dealings with Fuji Heavy Industry for light cars for the  aluminum radiators which are the forte of the company. President  Ono says, "Just being used in light cars will hold down price  and since we must handle it by conserving space, a change from  previous concepts is unavoidable." In the 1980's, U.S. carmakers  and parts manufacturers vied with each other in studying  Japanese cars and absorbing manufacturing know-how. Japanese  manufacturers one and all now are studying the "design  capability" of U.S. makers.</p>

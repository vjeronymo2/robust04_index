			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Events hand PM a chance History is made by accidents. Early this week, few MPs were willing to bet on Mr John Major's leadership. Yesterday it was difficult to find any parliamentarian who did not believe the prime minister would last the course. The death of John Smith appeared to wipe Mr Major's slate clean. True, there were still one or two rightwing Euro-sceptics who warned that nothing, not even the death of the opposition leader, would alter their determination to replace the prime minister. But they were in a minority. Most Tories felt that the positions of Mr Major and the government might be strengthened. A senior member of the 1922 backbench committee said: 'Luck appeared to be running out for the prime minister until the news of today's tragedy swept through the House.' In part, the analysis of Mr Major's strengthened position is based on the assumption that it would be folly to have a leadership election at the same time as the Labour party. Whether the race to succeed Mr Smith takes place at a special conference in mid-summer or in the autumn, it would still be uncomfortably close to the November deadline by which the Conservatives have to hold a leadership election if there is a challenge. With the media's attention fixed on Labour, Tories believe they ought not to create distractions. Many hope that the Labour election will bring out the divisions that Mr Smith so successfully masked over. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a senior backbencher, asked: 'Will the face of moderation outlive the sad death of Mr Smith?' Mr John Watts, another Tory backbencher, readily conceded that Mr Smith's great achievement had been to make the Labour party electable. But Mr Major's improved standing also owes much to the sudden decrease in support for Mr Michael Heseltine. Mr Smith's death was a vivid reminder of human mortality. Unfortunately for Mr Heseltine, most Tories no longer believe it prudent to elect someone who has already suffered a heart attack. Mr Heseltine is said to have made a full recovery from the attack last summer. But the same was said about Mr Smith after an attack in 1988. It was not just Mr Heseltine's enemies who were signalling the end of his ambitions. A significant number of his supporters were equally downcast. 'Regardless of Michael's fitness,' said one friend, 'I fear the party will never elect him. John Smith's death has transformed the situation.' Some supporters of Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, found it difficult to conceal their relief that the chances of a leadership election had receded. One parliamentary private secretary said: 'Labour's loss is John Major's gain.'</p>

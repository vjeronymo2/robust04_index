			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sainsbury stacks up The food retailers' nightmare of ever-decreasing margins has been at least postponed. Although J Sainsbury's margins were shaved last year as it responded to discounting elsewhere in the sector, the position has now stabilised. That adds weight to the argument that supermarkets have experienced a one-off downward adjustment rather than the start of a relentless squeeze. But it is too early to say the pain is over. If a competitor breaches the uneasy truce on margins, Sainsbury will have little option but to respond. By promising Pounds 65m annual cost savings - equivalent to 0.75 percentage points of net margin in supermarkets - the group has created some breathing space. It has also arrested the decline in sales which sent the shares into a spin following January's trading statement. Still, like for like sales growth of 0.5 per cent in the final eight weeks of the financial year is hardly a huge reward considering the cost of the essential-for-essentials campaign. Even allowing that new store openings are performing well, the market has good reasons for not chasing the shares higher. With its non-supermarket businesses performing well and its formidable capacity to generate cash, Sainsbury has the scope to look for growth elsewhere. If margins do indeed stabilise and capital spending continues to fall, it will soon look under-geared. Adding to Shaw's in the US would make good sense, as would building on the success of Homebase. Given its critical mass in UK supermarkets, though, it will take more than piecemeal expansion to re-establish Sainsbury as a growth stock.</p>

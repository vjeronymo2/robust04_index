			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Arts: The comic who fell to earth - Cinema MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY (PG) Woody Allen HEAVEN AND EARTH (15) Oliver Stone TOMBSTONE (15) George Pan Cosmatos CALENDAR Atom Egoyan HOUR OF THE PIG (15) Leslie Megahey BHAJI ON THE BEACH (15) Gurinder Chadha Manhattan Murder Mystery is Woody Allen's funniest film in years. Yet watching it I kept thinking of the space shuttle disaster. For this comedy is a kind of tragedy. A rocket falling travels through the same airspace as a rocket climbing and at much the same speed. To the casual eye it might be a replay of the same spectacle. Yet everything has changed. The energy of hope is now the energy of panic or the nullity of despair. The unity of purpose and construction is now a cluster of shellshocked fragments. In his new film Woody Allen plays a New York flat-dweller whose enigmatic neighbour (Jerry Rubin, doing a portly-ominous number a la Raymond Burr in Rear Window) may have murdered his wife. Woody is here rejoined - falling through the old career airspace - by Diane Keaton as his sleuthing spouse and by Marshall Brickman as his co-screenwriter. Together again] The trio who made comedy history with Annie Hall] Only this time the vehicle is a movie shuttle and it is going down not up. As for the noise from us watchers on the ground - we who loved Woody when he soared and have watched agonised as his name plummets through the Scandal Zone - well, is that laughter or hysteria? Probably bits of both. Here is the bug-eyed, mosquito-voiced Everymensch: flailing his arms, railing at life, remembering his first ill-fated date with his wife (they saw Last Year At Marienbad - 'Who knew they were flashbacks]?') and aghast when her friendliness to the elderly Jewish couple down the corridor turns into DIY detective work when the wife suddenly dies. He groans as she gets up at midnight to break into locked apartments. He urges her to start seeing her shrink again - 'You know how General Motors recalls defective cars?' But he finally gives up and joins her, plus Alan Alda (best friend) and Anjelica Huston (passing novelist), in tracking down the evildoer. The one-liners are beauties. Woody to Diane: 'Save a little craziness for menopause]' Woody after Die Walkure at the Met: 'I can't listen to that much Wagner. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland again.' Yet something is wrong, and it is the same 'something' that a falling space vehicle might sense. Deja vu. Captain, I think we have passed that cloud/sunbeam/bird before. Nothing in Manhattan Murder Mystery is new. The joke allusions to old movies (The Lady From Shanghai; Double Indemnity); the phobic fun with high culture (Huston's new novel 'makes Finnegan's Wake seem like airport reading'); the comedy of paranoia (who will get caught behind the wrong door?). Above all, the Woody dementia itself. He is still the endearing twit with the haymaking gestures and vertical take-off intonations. But this time the antic infantilism starts to look a bit ghoulish in a man we know to be nearing 60 and knocked about (offscreen) by things worse than being caught prying into the life of a suspect uxoricide. We do laugh, at times even guffaw. Yet we also sense a film of fragments without moment: a scrapbook movie. It is as if the heat-seeking tabloids have finally got to Spaceship Woody, or as if he has realised that they might. He has shrugged his shoulders, taken the safety-catch off the artistic auto-destruct button and prepared to head back for base, albeit in a last warming glow of nostalgic glory. Oliver Stone's Heaven And Earth, the last part of his Vietnam trilogy, has a different way of setting the screen aglow. Some war movies move us by their awful stoicism. The unsaid feelings of La Grande Illusion or Paths Of Glory speak louder than words or images. Other war cinema, including Stone's Platoon and the combat scenes in Born On The Fourth Of July, comes at us high on sound and visual fury, like fire-breathing monsters. Heaven And Earth takes two books of memoirs by Vietnam-born Le Ly Hayslip, who suffered in the war at both VC and US hands, and uses them as kindling matter for Stone's latest essay in agit-pyromania. We sense him setting things up in the credits sequence. Wide-screen vistas of a verdant valley - Southern Thailand playing Central Vietnam - are dunked in lush orchestral music plus choirs, much as a pile of wood is soaked in paraffin by an impatient bonfire-builder. Softened up by this inspirationalism? Then bring on the juddering angel-of-death helicopter, pixilating the landscape into an apocalyptic blur. Follow that with dream sequences in which Le Ly visualises young compatriots being hurled from Uncle Sam's choppers. Follow that with capture, rape and torture-for-all-tastes (electricity, snakes down blouses, ants on honey-smeared ankles). And then drag our heroine, after first orphaning her from her wisdom-spouting father (Haing S. Ngor of The Killing Fields), into the very engine-room of US imperialism by marrying her to Sergeant Tommy Lee Jones. With this actor, fast becoming America's leading psychotic, there is only ever one question. When will he crack up? He cracks up here back in America, after his shocked bride learns he plans to cash in his army stripes for an arms-trading career back in - yes] - Vietnam. Stone films these domestic corrida scenes with an intensity so fierce that they almost work. Jones's gnarled bullet-head, harbouring all America's tragic geo-political evils, creates a grand-guignol visual counterpoint with the melting, solicitous Le Ly, better played than the role deserves (as scripted) by newcomer Hiep Thi Le. These scenes suggest that if Stone could abandon his preachy overview of man's beastliness to man, he might find far more power - as any good artist finally does - in splitting the atom of personal encounter. Great drama grows in small spaces. Large spaces merely encourage gas-filled generality. On that theme, which of the following transatlantic films should you go for? The small Canadian film about identity, Atom Egoyan's Calendar? Or the large Hollywood rehash of the OK Corral story, Tombstone? No contest. Tombstone is two long hours in the Echo-chamber Elegiac mode, in which a handlebar moustache called Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) muses on life with dying Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) overacting Powers Boothe (as Curly Bill) and wheeled-in-for-a-cameo Charlton Heston. Sometimes guns are fired, but more in sorrow than in anger. And director George Pan (Rambo) Cosmatos directs as if his trigger finger is itching to shoot away all the phony weltschmerz in Kevin Jarre's screenplay. Calendar treats a terminal subject with teasing glee. The director of The Adjustor here revisits his ancestral Armenia, commissioned to take photos for a tourist calendar, and improvises a tale of marital break-up. Main characters: himself (often just a poignantly interrogative voice off camera), his Armenian-born wife and the local guide who becomes her lover. While a foreign sun shines on their bilingual imbroglios, flash-forwards depict Egoyan back in Canada trapped in the misery of serial dating and the miasma of memory. This film about time, space and emotional paradox is as bewitching and many-angled as its own leitmotif: the Byzantine churches that gaze timelessly, tauntingly, from the skylines. Finally, two British movies which sprawl amiably all over their subjects. Leslie Megahey's The Hour Of The Pig takes a just-fancy-that historical footnote - did you know that mediaeval French justice used to put animals on trial? - and gets carried away by its possibilities. Magistrate Colin Firth battles to save a black porker from a murder charge, while Nicol Williamson, Donald Pleasence and Ian Holm snarl, oink and sharpen their trotters in the background. A few moments of inspired battiness are not enough. In Gurinder Chadha's Bhaji On The Beach, Anglo-Asian Birmingham has a funny-disastrous day out in Blackpool. Four generations of immigrants find their problems coming to a head, as pregnant daughters, wife-beating husbands, lonely aunts and God knows who else find their trip turning into an awayday to Purgatory. The comedy is too soft-centred to make the teeth crunch on these themes as they should. But there is flavoursome charm in the performances and the seedy-photogenic setting.</p>

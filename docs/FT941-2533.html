			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Police armed Zulus, says judge A judicial commission of inquiry in South Africa yesterday published evidence showing that senior officers of the South African police helped supply weapons to the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, the clearest suggestion yet of security force involvement in political violence. The report, released yesterday by the prestigious Goldstone Commission, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, appeared to support longstanding allegations by the African National Congress that a 'third force' is involved in political violence between Inkatha and the ANC. The report said a special police unit was involved in the manufacture and smuggling of weapons to Inkatha and that Lt-Gen Basie Smit, police force No 2, Maj-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht, head of police intelligence, and Maj-Gen Johan le Roux, another senior police officer, had been aware of the unit's existence. President F W de Klerk said the three men had been suspended and an international task force would investigate their case. The commission's report alleged that senior police officers were involved in arms supplies to Inkatha since 1990. In 1992, the so-called Inkathagate scandal, involving government funding to Inkatha rocked the government of President de Klerk. At that time, he claimed he was unaware of the funding and insisted that all improper links between Pretoria and Inkatha had been severed. President de Klerk announced a purge of the senior ranks of the police force in late 1992 and appointed a respected officer of the South African Defence Force to conduct an inquiry into security force involvement in violence. This was never published and its recommendations were never made known. Yesterday's report said the men were involved in the manufacture of home-made weapons in the East Rand townships near Johannesburg which have seen some of the worst violence since political unrest increased dramatically four years ago. Meanwhile, in a move likely to increase the potential for further political violence, Zulu king Goodwill Zwelethini held a public meeting at Ulundi, capital of the Kwa Zulu black homeland to call on his supporters to boycott April's all-race elections. He urged them to fight to defend the sovereignty of the Zulu nation, which he said was under threat. 'I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to defend our freedom and sovereignty,' he told a crowd of 15,000 heavily-armed Zulu warriors. The ANC and government had hoped to persuade the king to endorse the election, despite the opposition of Inkatha, but this hope was dashed last night by the king's belligerent address.</p>

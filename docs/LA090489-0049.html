			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. EASING SANCTIONS ON CHINA;  </P> <P> 3 MONTHS AFTER MASSACRE, IMPACT OF CURBS LESSENS  </P> <P> Three months after the massacre of protesters in Beijing, the Bush  Administration is gradually finding ways to ease or limit the impact of the  moderate sanctions it has imposed on China.  </P> <P> Since June, the coordinated efforts by the United States, its European allies  and Japan have succeeded in isolating China to a degree that its leaders could  not have imagined before they ordered the June 3-4 assault on Tian An Men  Square by the People's Liberation Army.  </P> <P> Where once the heads of state of the world streamed to Beijing, these days even  a visit by the president of the African nation of Burkina Faso is a rare and  noteworthy event. U.S. officials now estimate that a decline in tourism will  cost China about $1 billion in foreign exchange this year and that China will  lose another $1 billion to $2 billion in foreign investment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'World Will Come Around'  </P> <P> Analysts here say that the Chinese leadership has decided to wait things out on  the assumption that the international pressure eventually will slacken.  "China's overall reaction has been to take the position that the world will  come around," said Harry Harding, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution.  </P> <P> There are indications that the strategy is succeeding. The Bush Administration  has already taken small steps to restore some ties with the Chinese leadership,  and several more such changes may be coming in the next few weeks:  </P> <P>  -- Although the United States and its allies forced the World Bank to suspend  $780 million in loans to China last June, bank officials say privately that  they believe the Bush Administration and the Europeans and Japanese will give  the green light within the next month to proceed with some of these loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baker Met Foreign Minister  </P> <P>  -- President Bush ruled out any exchanges between U.S. officials and the  Chinese government at the level of assistant secretary or higher. But in  August, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen in Paris, and sources say that the two men may talk again at the  United Nations this month. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Han Xu had  official meetings with Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Baker and National  Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft last month before ending his assignment in  Washington.  </P> <P>  -- Although the Bush Administration originally suspended all sales to China of  goods or technology with military applications, the Administration has since  begun to grant waivers clearing the way for a number of important items, such  as commercial planes and satellites.  </P> <P> The U.S. ban on military sales "hasn't done a thing really," observed one Asian  diplomat who keeps track of U.S. arms sales to China. "Virtually all of the  military equipment they (U.S. officials) wanted to sell had either already gone  or won't be ready for several years. And they will grant special exceptions for  the rest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought to Limit Change  </P> <P> The Bush Administration designed its response to the Tian An Men Square  massacre to limit the extent of change in U.S. policy toward China. Indeed, in  private, Administration officials express much less concern over the violence  and political repression in China than over the reaction to those events by  Congress and the American public.  </P> <P> One Administration official said recently that the "prevailing view" in the  Bush White House is that American television gave a selective, unrepresentative  portrait of events in China and that the significance of those events is being  exaggerated. Such claims parallel closely the arguments made by the Chinese  leadership itself since the massacre.  </P> <P> "Many, many more people were killed during the Cultural Revolution, at the time  when President (Richard M.) Nixon went to China," this U.S. official said.  </P> <P> Underlying the Bush Administration's China policy is the belief that the army's  assault on Beijing represents a short-term aberration for China and that  Chinese leaders such as President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng will not be  able to consolidate their control over the nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Factional Struggles Possible  </P> <P> "We don't expect the current crowd to last more than two years," said one  senior U.S. policy-maker. Some of the leaders eventually could be replaced  peacefully, he said, or there could be factional struggles within the top  leadership in which one side or another resorts to force.  </P> <P> Because the Administration is hoping for changes for the better in the Chinese  leadership, it has been trying to avoid any action against China that cannot be  quickly undone. After the massacre last June, the Administration was careful to  say that it was "suspending" -- rather than permanently severing -- military  sales and high-level political contacts with China.  </P> <P> Congress will act in the next few weeks on legislation that would write the  Bush Administration's China sanctions, and possibly some additional measures,  into law. A House-Senate conference committee will try to reconcile differences  between bills passed separately by the two chambers.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration probably will go along with this legislation as long as  it contains a broad waiver allowing the President to lift sanctions against  China whenever he thinks it would be in the "national interest" to do so.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assumptions May Prove False  </P> <P> But there are some indications that the assumptions on which Bush's China  policy is based -- that the Chinese leadership will soon take a turn for the  better -- may be false. One Bush Administration official acknowledged that he  is worried about what would happen if leaders such as Yang and Li consolidate  their power and if there are further crackdowns and repression in China.  </P> <P> China recently recalled most of its ambassadors from around the world to  Beijing for top-level meetings with leaders such as new Communist Party General  Secretary Jiang Zemin. Shortly afterward, the official party-controlled Chinese  press began to carry hints of a harder-line approach to foreign policy.  </P> <P> Some Chinese officials and newspapers began to resurrect the use of the term  "imperialism" in talking about the West. They also emphasized old themes such  as the fundamental "struggle" between socialism and capitalism.  </P> <P> "We should never turn a blind eye to the anti-communist and anti-socialist tide  in the Western world, which has always existed and has risen daily in recent  years," said the official Chinese magazine Liaowang on July 31.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Fond Dream'  </P> <P> " . . . The international bourgeoisie has never given up its attempt to  eliminate socialism. . . . The socialist system is superior to the capitalist  system. It is but a fond dream to predict that communism will thoroughly  collapse in the end."  </P> <P> Despite the Bush Administration's effort to minimize the changes in U.S. policy  toward China, U.S. officials acknowledge that the massacre at Tian An Men has  had some lasting effects on ties between the two countries.  </P> <P> Over the last few years, senior U.S. military officials had carried out a  series of visits and exchanges with top-level leaders of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army. In the wake of the army's assault upon Tian An Men Square,  these exchanges were suspended. Although some Pentagon officials are known to  be eager to restore contacts with the army, Administration officials say this  is unlikely to happen any time soon.  </P> <P> "I don't want to sound apocalyptic, but you have to assume that the military  relationship with the People's Republic of China, for the foreseeable future,  is defunct," said one Administration official.  </P> <P> More generally, another U.S. official observed, the events in China last June  and afterward have so seriously damaged China's credibility that they have made  it all but impossible for the Bush Administration to push any initiatives in  Congress regarding China.  </P> <P> At various times in the last few years, members of Congress have expressed  concern about China's sales of arms and missiles in the Middle East, its help  for Pakistan's nuclear-weapons program, its policies toward Hong Kong and  Taiwan and its strict enforcement of population control. Each time, U.S.  officials have relied on the verbal assurances of Chinese leaders that the  regime in Beijing had decent intentions and was not engaging in irresponsible  behavior.  </P> <P> Now, this U.S. official observed, the political dynamics have changed. Relying  on the words of Chinese officials will probably not work any more.  </P> <P> Each time the Bush Administration has moved to ease the impact of last June's  sanctions against China, U.S. officials have explained that their original  actions were being interpreted more broadly than was originally intended.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carefully Worded Sanctions  </P> <P> For example, after Baker met the Chinese foreign minister and he and other top  Administration officials saw the outgoing Chinese ambassador, U.S. officials  said that the sanctions announced last June had been carefully worded to cover  only formal "exchanges" in which a leader of one nation visited another.  </P> <P> The Bush policy was not meant to ban all high-level contacts or meetings  between the two nations, U.S. officials said then -- although that was the way  the policy was interpreted last June, and Bush Administration officials did  little to dispel that impression at the time.  </P> <P> "Clearly, the sanctions against China were announced in very broad, general  terms," observed Harding of the Brookings Institution. "And the Bush  Administration has chosen to interpret them loosely, rather than strictly."  </P></p>

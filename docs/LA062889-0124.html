			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> BABIES' NEW BASICS;  </P> <P> WHAT'S BLACK AND WHITE AND RED-HOT ALL OVER? CHIC TOTS' TOGS  </P> <P> What started as an elite designer statement in children's wear several seasons  ago now has a far broader appeal. Black, as a fashion color for kids, is no  longer considered depressingly Dickensian, too grown-up or too serious for any  but a few, special occasions. Black is even a baby basic, a chic color as  sought after for children as it is for their style-conscious parents.  </P> <P> "The time is right for black; people want to be unconventional," says Terry  Jajati, owner of Bloomers in Hollywood, a store for infants through preteens.  "They're having babies later, raising them differently, and these parents buy  for their kids what they like, not what tradition dictates."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Off Last Fall  </P> <P> It's not unusual anymore to find the most sophisticated black clothes, with  such grown-up labels as Gianni Versace and Franco Moschino, in children's  sizes, right next to more typical kiddie collections by such companies as Mrs.  Taki's Kids and Feeline.  </P> <P> There's plenty of black at Bloomers, and with it no mistaking that this is a  trend-setting store. Jajati says: "The black craze took off last fall. I  ordered a lot of it for spring and I'm almost out of it. There will be more for  summer. I know my customers. They wear black and so do their children."  </P> <P> If black is now acceptable for children after so many years when designers  struggled unsuccessfully to make it so, there is also enough variety in the  styling to give the clothes interest beyond their color. Looks for little  children range from just-like-mommy sportswear separates and just-like-Madonna  cotton/Lycra risque numbers, to more traditionally elegant and freshly innocent  messages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Look of Innocence  </P> <P> Los Angeles designer Malina Gerber and Italian master Gianni Versace represent  the latter. Gerber says: "I like to mix black with other colors so there is an  innocence about the look and children still look like children."  </P> <P> Versace takes on a more formal tone. "His approach is high quality and not  overloaded with frills," says Ute Pancer, owner of Belli Bambini, a West  Hollywood shop that recently held a Versace fall showing for children's wear.  Black velvet dresses with crisp white collars and delicate lace trims were  favorites as were black-and-white tweed coats trimmed in black velvet. Prices  range from $150 to $450 for school-age children up to Size 10.  </P> <P> Other designers blend grown-up trends, the color black and the innocence of  children's fashion. Los Angeles designer Enid Harris and Michael Sui of Mrs.  Taki's Kids are pacesetters in this field.  </P> <P> Harris' spring styles for girls sizes 2 through 8 include clean-lined, silk,  tiered dresses accessorized with silk roses. For dress-up, she shows a  basic-black chiffon, Empire silhouette "cocktail" dress. Sleek cotton/Lycra  separates are meant to be softened with little-girl-fantasy ballerina tutus,  flounce skirts and fluid jumpers worn on top.  </P> <P> Originally a television and movie costume designer, Harris started her business  a year ago as a panic reaction to the Screenwriters' strike. Now her flights of  fantasy, priced from $15 to $160, are carried in progressive children's-wear  stores such as American Rag Cie Youth and Bloomers. Even Maxfield, that  stalwart center of style that saturated adult fashion devotees with black a few  years ago, carries Harris' children's line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Twirlable Things  </P> <P> "I just can't see pink and blue anymore," she says. That's been done enough.  Black is beautiful on kids. Last week we did a photo shoot and all the little  girls went straight for the black. You can twirl in my things, they have little  petticoats or jewels or flowers -- that's what little girls like."  </P> <P> Before he became designer for the Mrs. Taki's Kids collections, designer Sui  learned the importance of black while working with New York ready to wear  designers Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein, and with Donna Karan.  </P> <P> Karan, Klein and Mrs. Taki's Kids are owned by Tomio Taki now. His wife,  Beverly, heads the childrens' line, now about a year old, and Adam, the  youngest of their four sons, provided the inspiration for it. Ironically, the  collection is now aimed largely at girls aged 7 to 14.  </P> <P> "I always use black as a ground color and contrast it with white or brights,"  Sui explains. "It's a Seventh Avenue influence filtered down to kids. Now  there's no time lag in fashion from adults to children. What makes black fun  for kids to wear are optical-effect details. Stripes, bright prints and  separates. That's where the individuality comes in so kids can create their own  looks."  </P> <P> </P> <P> European Influence  </P> <P> For spring, black and white was Mrs. Taki's Kids' predominant color story, in  easy pants, swing skirts, print shirts and T-shirts. For fall, add a  salt-and-pepper tweed toggle coat, a black gabardine dress with pleated skirt  and white, Puritan collar, or a Chanel-type suit complete with quilted leather  handbag. Prices range from $20 to around $100 at stores, including Nordstrom,  Neiman Marcus and I. Magnin.  </P> <P> "The influence stems from Europe but the feeling is much broader than that,"  Sui notes. "There's an instinct now to get back to basics, back to traditional  values and to break the rules a bit. People also want quality and longevity.  Black is the color that represents all of that."  </P> <P> But black is not just for school-age kids. Even infants are being dressed in  the classic color, and baby experts support the trend, just as they approve of  black-and-white toys, bedding, furniture and learning tools for infants. Among  new parents who favor the trend are Spago owner-chef Wolfgang Puck, and his  wife Barbara Lazaroff. And the visible proof came in the form of no fewer than  11 black-and-white baby showers for Barbara, held this spring. She specified  her preference for the two basic colors when asked about gifts.  </P> <P> Like other savvy parents, Lazaroff says, she understands the benefits of black  and white for infants. Always known as a fashion plate, she also admits that  she simply liked the look of black and white Holstein cow patterns, and  decorated her new baby boy's nursery entirely in that bovine motif.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Far Will It Go?  </P> <P> Where is all of this infatuation with black fashion for children leading?  Designers, retailers, parents and baby experts agree that early exposure to  various stimuli determines later behavior. Retailers translate the notion to  matters of style, of course.  </P> <P> "If a child learns taste, quality and individuality early, they will relate to  it more as adults," says Pancer of Belli Bambini. "I think modern parents  learned it and are continuing to teach it to the next generation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guide for Children's Basic Black  </P> <P> Agnes B., 100 N.

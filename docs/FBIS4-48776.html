			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Commission on Human Rights has appointed a  human rights special investigator to Rwanda. Mr. Rene  Degni-Segui of Cote d'Ivoire has been appointed to investigate  the massacres in Rwanda and report to the UN secretary general.  The UN Commission on Human Rights, sitting in Geneva on 24 May  1994, condemned what they called the silence of the government  in Rwanda on the massacres that have been going on.    What the UN Commission on Human Rights failed to pronounce  is  that the illegitimate government in Rwanda did not keep quiet  about the massacres in Rwanda, but the government directed the  massacres. The president and the prime minister of the  illegitimate government in Rwanda have been using Radio Rwanda  and Radio RTLM [Radio- Television Libre des Mille Collines] to  instruct the Rwandan Government forces and the Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militias to kill  all the people of Tutsi ethnic groups and everybody who does not  support the self-imposed government. This government has said  that whoever is not ready to kill the political opponents of the  government should be killed.</p>

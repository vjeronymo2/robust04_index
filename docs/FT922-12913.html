			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: Plans for treasury and investment hide series of stern tasks THE PLANS for the treasury and investment banking operations of Hongkong Bank and Midland Bank appear on the surface a model of simplicity. In practice, however, rationalising these parts of the two group's operations is likely to be among the most difficult tasks facing the new management. The treasury businesses will be run as a single, worldwide operation with a significant presence in London, Tokyo and New York, according to yesterday's offer document from Hongkong Bank. The combined market presence of the two groups, and the capital strength of Hongkong Bank, would give the treasury additional muscle and would offer economies of scale. Investment banking, on the other hand, would be run almost as a series of cottage industries, by several brand names. On the one hand, that would involve James Capel and Wardley, the Hongkong Bank's UK securities house and Far East investment bank; and on the other, Samuel Montagu and Greenwell Montagu, Midland's merchant bank and UK government securities specialist. The proposed new group's structure, and recent changes to each group's investment banking operations, suggest that this simplistic model may prove difficult to follow. Attempts to manage treasury at a global level may encounter difficulties, given the organisation of the group into separate banking operating companies in different centres. Transfer pricing - the process of allocating profits between different centres, already one of the main problems for the management of global treasury operations - would be complicated by this. In London, the merging of the two treasury businesses also highlights a strategic difference: Hongkong Bank runs treasury as part of its branch operations, while Midland has located the business in Midland Montagu, its investment banking arm. Such differences permeate the two groups: Hongkong Bank, for instance, runs all its fixed income businesses through the main bank, while Midland has the successful Greenwell Montagu, part of Midland Montagu. Fitting together other investment banking operations may also cause difficulties. There is a clear split between the corporate finance businesses of Wardley and Samuel Montagu, which operate in the Far East and Europe respectively: each could remain under the control of its current parent bank. However, James Capel, the London-based securities arm of Hongkong bank, does not fit the pattern. Steps have been taken to integrate it progressively into Hongkong Bank, which suggests that the collection of independently run companies envisaged in the offer document may not be the final outcome. Capel would logically fit under the Midland umbrella, since it is based in London. Midland has nevertheless tended to look askance at the equities business, Capel's main base, since it pulled out of equities itself after London's Big Bang in the mid-1980s.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHARP DROP IN CRIME PROMPTS POLICE TO LIFT SOWETO CURFEW  </P> <P> Police today lifted a 10-day-old, nighttime curfew in the black township of  Soweto because a sharp drop in political violence and crime no longer made the  restrictions necessary.  </P> <P> Police imposed the 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew Sept. 25 in Soweto and other nearby  townships to halt black factional fighting around Johannesburg that has claimed  800 lives in the last two months.  </P> <P> Only scattered incidents have been reported in recent weeks, and Law and Order  Minister Adriaan Vlok said serious crime in Soweto had dropped by about  two-thirds compared to the 10 days before the curfew.  </P> <P> Vlok praised residents in Soweto for "outstanding cooperation" with the police.  </P> <P> The curfew will remain in effect in several other townships, police said.  </P> <P> The African National Congress, the leading black opposition movement, had  opposed the curfew, saying it was implemented to weaken the normal  organizational activities of the ANC.  </P> <P> In other developments today, Nelson Mandela and other ANC officials met leaders  of five black homelands at Mandela's home in Soweto. However, Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu homeland and head of the conservative Inkatha  movement, declined to attend.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luc Demullier: "Spitaels Makes Strong </F> Counterattack -- Agusta Case"]    [Text] The Senate Judicial Affairs Committee will decide  today about lifting the parliamentary immunity of Guy Spitaels  [Walloon Minister-President] and Guy Mathot [Walloon Regional  Minister]. The committee met yesterday for the first time. At  no time could the debate be labeled "calm." For example, after  his appearance before the committee, Guy Spitaels calmly  distributed the written defense he had submitted to the  committee members. Committee President Roger Lallemand, who  realized too late what Spitaels was planning, tried to stop him,  but already journalists were leafing through the document.    In this detailed document, Spitaels denies all of the  accusations Ancia made against him. He has had no meetings any  of Agusta leaders, no responsibility for the financial  transactions carried out by the Liege branch of the PS  [French-speaking Socialist Party], and has not intervened to  influence the Agusta purchase decision in a favorable sense.    But this is not all. In his defense, Spitaels calmly makes  accusations against Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was  then transportation minister, and against Deputy Prime Minister  Claes, who was then economic affairs minister. Spitaels quotes  a comment Georges Cywie made about Claes: "The Flemings were in  favor of the French helicopter. Therefore we had to `buy' the  Flemings. And therefore we `bought' Claes." End of quote. What  is probably meant is that Claes was "bought" with the promise to  set up a factory in Lummen as economic compensation.    In a second document Spitaels makes a particularly strong  attack against investigating magistrate Ancia. VLD [Flemish  Liberal Democrats] Committee member Leo Govaerts, who complained  about the working methods imposed on the committee, called this  "the fact of the day." As of now, no investigating magistrate  will be able to draw up a case without risking the accusation  that he has been "bought." In the second document, Spitaels  also says his immunity simply cannot be lifted so that he could  be questioned: "What questions would I be asked? Questions  about discussions in the Cabinet? But these discussions are  confidential."    Only today will the Judicial Affairs Committee issue its  advice to the Senate on whether the immunity should be lifted.  Normally such advice is unanimous and the Senate follows it  without public debate. But since the discussions in the  committee have been made public, it is very likely that members  of the committee will vote politically. The PS members are  making an effort so as not to lift Spitaels' immunity. It is  less clear what they are planning to do with Mathot, who  received some criticism from Spitaels.    If the votes are divided in the committee, then a public  debate is to follow. That would be unique in the political  history of the country.    After the Senate it is up to the French Community Council  and  the Walloon Regional Council to vote on lifting the immunity.  What is to happen if these three assemblies contradict one  another? Yesterday no politician dared to consider this real  possibility.</p>

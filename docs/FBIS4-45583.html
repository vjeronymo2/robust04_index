			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ben Ukwuoma] </F>   [Text] Various types of narcotic drugs and psychotropic  substances weighing 8,811.4874 kilogrammes with an estimated  street value of N1.3 billion were seized from 453 suspects, last  year by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).    These figures, according to Mr. Abiodun Adesola, the Acting  Press Secretary of the Agency, do not include the massive haul  of a special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes with a  conservative estimate of N1.2 billion ($300 million) imported  from Bangkok, Thailand. The cargo was intercepted at the Apapa  Wharf, in Lagos last December.    "A cursory look at the figures showed that the number of  arrests and the quantity of seizures were far more in 1993 than  the previous years," Adesola stated in a statement yesterday.    He attributed the arrests and subsequent seizures to the  takeoff of two additional zonal commands at Warri and Maiduguri  which began operations last year.    According to him, marijuana, cultivated locally, with a  total  seizure of 7,461.744 kilogrammes maintained the number one slot  on the list of hard drugs seizures made last year.    This was followed by cocaine, 1,308.6697 kilogrammes,  heroin,  39.2862 kilogrammes and other psychotropic substances, 1.825  kilogrammes.    On quarterly basis, the fourth quarter of the year was the  period the highest number of arrests were made, 145 suspects in  all. Next was the first quarter with 121, followed by third and  second quarters with 100 and 87 suspects.    Adesola said the agency recorded her highest number of  arrests within the year under review in March with the arrest of  55 suspects. October and November followed with 52 and 47  arrested suspects.    However, the largest drug haul was recorded in February with  2,724.896 kilogrammes of hard drugs seizure.    This was followed by the 1,647.2515 kilogrammes seizure in  October while November of the same period under review was next  with 1,419.3283 kilogrammes.    "One striking observation made in the Agency's operations,  last year was the seizure of psychotropic substances like  Amphatamines and pemoline, a development which may be attributed  to renewed vigilance on all types of hard drugs covered in the  mandate given to the Agency instead of only concentrating on  cocaine and heroin trafficker," he added.</p>

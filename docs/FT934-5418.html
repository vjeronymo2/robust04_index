			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Toil and trouble: Nasa needs to repair its public image, as well as the Hubble telescope The space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral tomorrow morning on what Nasa calls a routine servicing flight - and critics say is a risky make-or-break mission for the troubled space agency. The objective of the 11-day flight is to service and repair the Hubble Space Telescope, a Dollars 2bn orbiting observatory which caused Nasa huge embarrassment after its launch in 1990, when it turned out that the instrument's 2.4 metre mirror had been ground to the wrong shape. Three hundred miles above the earth's obscuring atmosphere, Hubble should have enabled astronomers to see seven times further into the universe than ever before; instead, the faulty mirror produced fuzzy pictures only slightly better than the most powerful ground-based telescopes. The mission is routine only in the sense that Hubble was designed for maintenance in orbit every three to five years. No one had imagined when it was launched that so much would need to be put right now, nor that Nasa would be so desperate for a spectacular success to reverse the steady deterioration in its public image after a catalogue of disasters - most recently the loss of the Dollars 980m Mars Observer craft. Nasa has picked a crew of seven space veterans, with an average age of 46, for what is sure to be the most complex and challenging of the 59 shuttle flights undertaken so far. The senior member is Dr Story Musgrave, 58, who has been an astronaut since 1967. On Friday the Swiss flight engineer, Mr Claude Nicollier, will use Endeavour's robot arm to pull the bus-sized Hubble on to a special stand in the cargo bay. Then the mission plan includes five days of space walks, each lasting six hours, during which the astronauts will work in pairs to put right as many as possible of Hubble's defects. The single most important job will to fit 'spectacles' to correct the telescope's short-sightedness. An instrument called Costar (for corrective optics space telescope axial replacement) will slot in behind the famous flawed mirror, containing 10 small coin-sized mirrors ground to compensate optically for the defect. But there are 11 other items to repair or replace. They include faulty electronic components, three failed gyroscopes and Hubble's solar panels, which have been disturbing its delicate instruments by juddering in response to temperature changes whenever the craft passes from sunlight into darkness. Indeed, changing the 12-metre solar arrays  - made by British Aerospace as part of the European Space Agency's 15 per cent contribution to the project - may turn out to be the most delicate operation of all. The schedule is bound to change 'as events unfold', Mr Nicollier said last month. 'There will be surprises, of that we can be sure. We therefore have to visualise the unforeseeable.' To prepare for unexpected events, the astronauts have trained longer and more intensively for the Hubble repair mission than for any previous shuttle flight. They have spent 700 hours rehearsing for their 11 days in space, including 400 hours under water in a huge tank built to simulate weightlessness at the Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama. 'I may have been in the water hundreds of hours, I may have been in the clean room hundreds of hours (getting to know Hubble's replacement parts),' Dr Musgrave said at the end of training, 'but, like the Olympics, it boils down to a few seconds. You've got one shot at it. It's got to go right.' As the astronauts know only too well, far more is at stake than their ability to make Hubble work to its original specifications - and possibly give astronomers a view of the distant universe good enough to set off a scientific revolution like the one after Galileo's first use of a telescope 400 years ago. The future of Nasa could hinge on the Hubble mission. A success would begin to shore up public and political confidence in the once-proud agency, which has been undermined by a string of failures since the 1986 Challenger explosion. In particular, it would show that shuttle-borne astronauts can carry out a complicated series of manoeuvres of the sort that will be needed to assemble and use the planned Space Station Freedom, due to go into operation early next century. A failure would feed ammunition to congressional budget-cutters, who succeeded recently in killing the US's other big science project, the Dollars 11bn Superconducting Super Collider, and are keen also to shoot down the multi-billion dollar space station. Its cancellation would leave Nasa without a clear future in manned space flight beyond the ageing shuttle programme - and could lead to the agency's dismemberment. Mr Daniel Goldin, who was appointed Nasa administrator by former President George Bush early last year and has been kept on by President Bill Clinton, put on a brave face when he appeared before the Senate science, technology and space subcommittee this month. 'We are not afraid,' he said. 'If we fail (in the Hubble mission), we will dust ourselves down and do it again.' But Mr Goldin pleaded with the senators not to cut Nasa's budget any more. The Bush administration reduced its five-year spending plan from an original request of Dollars 106bn in 1991 to Dollars 96bn; since then, this had been cut to Dollars 78bn - and it could fall to Dollars 71bn, according to the latest proposals. With everyone's attention focused on the space-walking astronauts and the implications for Nasa of their success or failure, the astronomers - for whose scientific benefit the repair mission is supposedly being undertaken - are feeling rather left out. 'Although some people felt it was an outrageous waste to spend Dollars 2bn on the original Hubble project, because so much money would have given far better returns to science if it had been spent on earth-based observatories, most of us welcomed Hubble because it brought in extra funds that would not otherwise have been spent on astronomy,' said one European astronomer. 'The same is true of the repair mission. Some astronomers were getting good results from Hubble, faulty as it was, and they didn't want to risk spending Dollars 620m to ruin it, but most of us recognise that Nasa has to try to repair it for political reasons.' Even if the Endeavour mission appears to be a spectacular success over the next 11 days, it will not be clear for at least a month whether the astronauts have repaired Hubble and Nasa's reputation. It will take several weeks to remote-test all the new equipment, before Nasa can send the telescope instructions to start observing. Few pictures in history will be awaited with such anticipation.</p>

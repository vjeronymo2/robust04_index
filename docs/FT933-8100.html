			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Hussein to change Jordan's voting law KING HUSSEIN last night announced a controversial amendment to Jordan's election law, paving the way for the country's first multi-party elections since 1956, writes James Whittington in Amman. In a televised speech, he said the elections, due on November 8, would be based on one-person, one-vote. This is widely seen as an attempt to curb the success of Moslem fundamentalists, who won 30 out of 80 seats at the last elections in 1989. Under the now defunct election law, each voter cast more than one vote, depending on the number of seats in a constituency - up to eight in some cases. This was viewed by the government as favouring large groups, such as the Islamists, who were able to field a number of candidates in each constituency.</p>

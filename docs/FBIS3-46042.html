			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, January 25 (XINHUA) -- French-Sino relations  should have a fresh start after the publication of the joint  communique on January 12, a French senior official said today.    Alain Peyrefitte, president of the France-China Friendship  Society of the French National Assembly and former minister with  the government of General de Gaulle, made the remarks in an  interview with XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and the French-language  monthly magazine "CHINA EXPRESS."    The former minister praised General de Gaulle who moved to  establish diplomatic relations in the 1960s with the People's  Republic of China and recognised it "as the representative of  the Chinese nation."    China has offered many trade favors to France since the  establishment of diplomatic ties in 1964. And France has become  the third biggest trade partner of China by 1992, only after the  U.S. and Japan.    However, France's share in the Chinese market has diminished  after it decided to sell arms to Taiwan, for which France has  lost business contracts of estimated six billion francs (1.2  billion U.S. Dollars) in China.    "After the normalization of relations between France and  China, the French industries will invest again in the market at  full steam," said Peyrefitte.    He noted the Chinese are ready to make "a big jump towards  market economy" and their economic development has great  potentials.    Peyrefitte said France can make use of its "considerable  advantages" in transport, telecommunications and energy in  cooperation with China and expand its export and investment in  other Asian countries through joint-ventures and transfers of  technology.    In conclusion, he said, "all foreign investors are actively  involved in China's modernization drive, and it is in the  interests of France to join them."    The former French minister is leaving for China Wednesday to  participate in the ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the  establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries  and prepare for the coming visit by French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMAPPING PLAN COULD DISPLACE SCHABARUM;  </P> <P> POLITICS: HE WOULD BE PUT INTO A PREDOMINANTLY LATINO DISTRICT UNDER A PROPOSAL  THAT SUPERVISORS ARE PRIVATELY STUDYING.  </P> <P> A redistricting plan that would force Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete  Schabarum to run in a new, predominantly Latino district is privately being  reviewed by the Board of Supervisors as a possible settlement to a federal  lawsuit.  </P> <P> The plan would radically change the political representation for hundreds of  thousands of county residents.  </P> <P> It is the first realignment of district boundaries prepared by the county's  political consultant since supervisors last week voted to explore a settlement  of a federal redistricting lawsuit. The trial has been postponed indefinitely  to allow settlement talks.  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department and two civil rights groups last year filed suit  accusing the all-white board of drawing its districts in such a way as to  weaken the political clout of the county's 2 million Latinos. The suit contends  that the board split up Latino neighborhoods among three districts in violation  of the federal Voting Rights Act.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both sides met privately in U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's  chambers Tuesday, but afterward refused comment on the status of negotiations.  Diane Palmiotti, a spokeswoman for the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, said the new county map was not distributed or referred to at  the meeting. Another meeting was set for next week.  </P> <P> Schabarum said he had not seen the newly proposed redistricting plan and would  not comment on it. He said he has not decided whether to seek reelection in  June.  </P> <P> Asked if being placed in a Latino majority district poses political problems,  Schabarum said, "Not if you do your job . . . being a Hispanic such as I am  anyway."  </P> <P> A Schabarum aide said the supervisor's grandfather was a German miner who  married a Mexican woman. Schabarum was born in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Schabarum would keep some of his political base in the San  Gabriel Valley, helping his chances of holding onto his seat, if he decides to  run.  </P> <P> The map presented to supervisors this week was drawn by Joe Shumate, a  political consultant hired by the county.  </P> <P> According to a memo sent to the supervisors by County Counsel DeWitt Clinton,  the map represents an "updated analysis" of a plan "previously furnished and  reviewed by several board offices."  </P> <P> Shumate said the map is new and not a simple revision of a map he prepared for  the supervisors when he was hired as a consultant in 1981. Shumate said he  would not comment further on the new map under orders from the county's  attorneys.  </P> <P> "I think the majority of the board might go for it," said Mas Fukai, chief  deputy to Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, pointing out that the plan provides  political security for a majority of board members.  </P> <P> Clinton's memo said the map was prepared at the request of Supervisors Deane  Dana and Ed Edelman to facilitate discussions "which could lead to a potential  compromise" in the dispute.  </P> <P> Dana's willingness to work with his ideological opposite Edelman is a strong  sign that a settlement might be in the offing. Only three votes are required  for approval of a settlement. Dana already has broken ranks with his  conservative colleagues in supporting settlement talks.  </P> <P> Dana and Edelman refused to comment on the new map.  </P> <P> Tom Silver, an aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said the board is "at a very  preliminary stage. We will be looking at several different configurations" of  new district boundaries before the process is completed.  </P> <P> But one source close to the negotiations said the supervisors do not have long  to develop a plan.  </P> <P> One board source said Clinton told the supervisors that they have only another  week or two to submit a plan to the judge, or the Justice Department will drop  efforts to negotiate a settlement and proceed with the trial.  </P> <P> Under the plan now being circulated among supervisors, Schabarum would be  placed in a predominantly Latino district extending from East Los Angeles to  growing immigrant neighborhoods in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> "He's the sacrificial lamb," said one Latino political adviser familiar with  the redistricting fight. "Schabarum is the one who is expendable to both sides"  of the board, he said, pointing out that Schabarum's combative ways have cost  him support even among his conservative colleagues.  </P> <P> A MALDEF spokeswoman declined to offer an opinion on Schabarum's claim to be of  Latino descent. "The issue is that Hispanics have good representation, and we  would not see Schabarum as someone representative of the Hispanic community,"  the spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Edelman, though losing East Los Angeles from his existing  3rd District, would retain his Westside political base while picking up Malibu  and a bigger part of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Antonovich and Dana would still represent conservative-voting districts.  </P> <P> Hahn's heavily black South-Central Los Angeles district would be largely  unchanged.  </P> <P> All the supervisors, except for Schabarum, will be "pretty safe," said Silver,  adding that the plan makes Antonovich "even safer." Antonovich's 5th District  would become even more heavily Republican under the latest Shumate map.  </P> <P> "For purposes of comparison," Clinton also provided supervisors with an  alternative redistricting plan prepared by the Justice Department. That plan,  made public last month, would carve out a new, predominantly Latino district by  moving Edelman's district east of the Harbor Freeway, costing the supervisor  his Westside base of political support.  </P> <P> The lawsuit against the county is similar to one filed by the Justice  Department against Los Angeles in 1985. In order to settle that lawsuit, the  City Council redrew its district lines to create a new Latino district, and two  Latinos presently serve on the 15-member council.  </P></p>

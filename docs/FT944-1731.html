			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: The glories of the Khmers - An hour to spare / Paris You are in Paris, with an hour between meetings. What to do? The suburb of Passy seems a long way from Phnom Penh. But here, safely preserved in the Musee Guimet, is the greatest collection of Khmer sculpture outside Cambodia - and one of the least trumpeted art treasures of Paris. The Musee Guimet holds a kind of cultural litmus paper up to France's far eastern colonial past, but its glories are the outstanding Khmer carvings, displayed in just three ground-floor galleries. The Khmers seem to have originated in southern India and to have imported and adapted their native religion and culture, establishing themselves during the ninth century as the dominant power in Indo-China for half a millennium. Their legacy is a complex of temples encompassing five centuries and some 75 square miles. While Angkor Wat, the funerary monument, holds its head high beside the great Gothic cathedrals of northern Europe, the sculpture of Chartres pales beside the bas-reliefs and free-standing sculpture of Angkor. An exquisite red sandstone lintel from Banteay Srei, carved with scenes from The Ramayana, illustrates the vigour and originality of the Khmer artists, even in the 10th century. A glorious horse-headed deity is a version of Vishnu, the stone of his torso and head polished to a satin silvery grey. All around, benign deities cast enchant-ing enigmatic smiles and voluptuous asparas (dancing girls) leap gracefully in bas-relief. Theatrically spotlit in an inner sanctum is the sculpture in the style of the Bayon, the temple built by Jayavarman VII (1181-1201). Jayavarman, a late convert to Buddhism, believed himself the Buddha incarnate, and his image smiles down from the victory gateway and the 54 peaks of the bayon. The Guimet has a head of this serene god-king. It is a work of enormous subtlety and beauty. If you have time for nothing else, this is the place to stop. Musee Guimet, 6 Place d'Iena, Paris</p>

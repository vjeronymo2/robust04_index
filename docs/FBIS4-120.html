			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Hundreds of kwaZulu civil  servants in Umlazi near Durban have vowed not to return to work  before the kwaZulu government addresses their demands for their  pensions to be paid out, SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation] radio news reported on Thursday [31 March]. The  civil servants, some of them from places outside Umlazi, have  been meeting at a stadium outside the township since the  beginning of the week.    Meanwhile, the launch of an African National Congress  election campaign for Umlazi pupils has been cancelled by the  Congress of South African Students after school principals  refused to allow the pupils to attend a meeting on Thursday.  School principals are reported to have said that pupils were  busy with their quarterly examinations.</p>

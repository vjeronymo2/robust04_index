			<p>BFN     [Text] Bordeaux, France, April 11 (AFP) -- A bomb alert  that turned out to be a false alarm was reported Monday [11  April] on a commercial jet carrying French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, airline officials said.    The French domestic airline Air Inter said the Airbus 300  carrying 306 people was halfway between Paris and Bordeaux when  an anonymous caller to Paris' Orly airport said there was a bomb  on board.    The pilot decided to continue the flight, and all the  passengers were evacuated as soon as the jet landed in Bordeaux  in southwest France.    A search of the aircraft turned up no bomb.    Juppe was traveling to Bordeaux to inaugurate an  organization  designed to boost trade between regional companies and  international firms.</p>

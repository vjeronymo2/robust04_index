This has been the hardest blow dealt to drug  trafficking this year.    Judge Juan Jose Galeano headed an operation conducted in  Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, during which police found more  than 50 kg of cocaine that had been "artistically" hidden inside  five wooden doors that had been carefully constructed for this  illegal act.    This operation led the Federal Police to raid the "Buenos  Aires" warehouse in the Pompeya district, where they found 15  similar doors with dozens of bricks of cocaine inside.    According to Police Inspector Norberto Ruiz, who was in  charge of the operation, the "merchandise" had been brought from  Jujuy in a station wagon belonging to the freight company "La  Sevillanita."    Ruiz reported that neither those responsible for the  warehouse nor the freight company managers were apparently  involved in smuggling the drugs.    The operation was the fruit of "four months of  investigations," Ruiz pointed out. He added that the agents  assigned to the operation hadn't slept for 48 hours.    According to reports the merchandise kept at the "Buenos  Aires Warehouse" was to have been picked up by a drug trafficker  identified as Adrian Flores. This name, however, could be false.    Judge Galeano said he was "very satisfied" with the results  of the investigation, and praised the policemen's performance in  helping solve the case.    When the policemen took apart the doors they realized that 8  kg of highly pure cocaine were hidden inside each door, though  some doors were heavier than others.    The court officials pointed out that more raids and arrests  will result from the operation, because the gang probably has  connections in Jujuy Province and in other regions of the  country.</p>

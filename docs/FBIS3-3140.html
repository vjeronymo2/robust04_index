			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- People of all  nationalities in the Tibet Autonomous Region are now  concentrating their efforts on economic development at a time  when Tibet enjoys political stability, economic development,  social progress, national unity and improved livelihood for  local people.    Raidi, chairman of the standing committee of the regional  people's congress and a deputy to the National People's Congress  (NPC), made the remarks here today at a press conference called  by the Tibet delegation at the current session of the Eighth NPC.    Raidi, who used to be a serf in old Tibet, said that Tibet  is  an integral part of China and Tibetan nationality is a member of  the big family of the Chinese nation. Any attempts at  separatism and any activities aimed at creating the  "independence of Tibet" are doomed to failure and will be firmly  opposed by all the Chinese people including Tibetans.    Asked about his comment on the Dalai Lama, Raidi said that  the Dalai Lama has engaged in activities aimed at separatism and  sabotage of national unity since he began to live in exile after  the 1959 rebellion.    The central government's attitude towards him has always  been  explicit, hoping he will abandon separatism and return home to  contribute to the country's construction.    In response to a Hong Kong reporter's question on the state  of human rights in Tibet, Losang, a neighborhood committee  director of Chengguan District of Lhasa city, said, "I'm most  qualified to answer this question since I used to be a serf. In  old Tibet, my grandfather, my father and I were all serfs. We  suffered hardships and beatings with no right to speak of."    "It is only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist  Party that we Tibetans enjoy real human rights. We are now  masters of the country, enjoying equality with other  nationalities, and economic equality and equality between men  and women and fully enjoying freedom of religious belief,"  55-year-old Losang said.    "Without knowing well the historical background, it is hard  to understand things now," he added.    Raidi chipped in, saying that the claim that 105 "peaceful  protesters" were jailed in prisons in Tibet was groundless. "I  do not know how the list is compiled," he added.    Asked whether Tibet enjoys full freedom of religious belief,  Losang Gyaincain, vice-president of the Buddhist Association of  China, said that the policy of freedom of religious belief  adopted in Tibet is protected by the Constitution.    "We have the freedom of religious belief and also the  freedom  of not believing in religion and the freedom to choose religions  or religious sects," Gyaincain said.    Gyaincain, also a living Buddha in Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery in  Xikaze, told reporters that in recent years Tibet has invested  200 million yuan in renovating temples. Now the region is home  to more than 1,400 temples which basically satisfy needs of  local religious believers.    Answering questions about relations between Han and Tibetan  nationalities, Raidi said Han and Tibetan people have lived in  peace and harmony and enjoyed equality since the peaceful  liberation of Tibet in 1951. Han and Tibetan people have forged  close friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet.    "Thus they have shared a common fate and can never be  separated from each other," Raidi added.    On the claim of "emigration" of Han people to Tibet, Losang  Toinzhub, mayor of Lhasa, said, "that's a sheer nonsense." He  cited Lhasa, capital of Tibet, as an example. Among its 400,000  population, Tibetans account for 87.21 percent and Han, 11.9  percent. Among the Han people, some came to help with Tibet  construction and some came to do business.    Toinzhu called economic exchanges "inevitable" in the course  of reform and opening up. People from inland areas can go to  Tibet and Tibetans can go to interior areas to do business  there. "Why cannot people do so?" he asked. "The flow of  people is not necessarily a bad thing and the most important  thing is whether it is conducive to the development of Tibet.  When Americans were opening up the West, weren't there many  immigrants there?" he said.    Gyalcan Norbu, chairman of the Tibet regional government,  disclosed at the press conference that, of a total population of  2.28 million in Tibet, Tibetan people account for more than 96  percent and, Han people and people of other nationalities less  than four percent.</p>

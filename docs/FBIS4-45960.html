			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Alfred Artamonov, Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Izhevsk May 16 TASS -- "The state will fulfill its  commitments to the defence industry," said First Vice-Premier  Oleg Soskovets during his visit to the "Izhmash" plant today.  "After the budget is endorsed, in the near future this might  become a reality," he said.    According to Soskovets, the state intends to boost the  development of more advanced technologies for the armed forces  and advocate a liberal approach to the realisation of military  exports. Soskovets pointed out that exporting weapons, the  government will take into account political interests of the  state, and the liberalisation of exports will be beneficial for  manufacturers.    Soskovets pointed out that the government will offer defence  enterprises an opportunity to independently work for exports.  "However, the state does not intend to sell a number of military  hardware constructed on the basis of absolutely new high tech,  which affects the country's defence," Soskovets said.</p>

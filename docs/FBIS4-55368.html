			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- During their meeting today,  Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and his Slovenian  counterpart Lojze Peterle signed a cooperation agreement  covering education, culture and science, they told journalists.    They also talked about the Stability Pact to be signed at  the  coming meeting of European foreign ministers in Paris and looked  at questions of bilateral trade, they said.    Trade between the two countries, which have signed a free  trade zone agreement, has been growing rapidly, with Czech  exports to Slovenia in the first eight months of last year  valued at $78 million and Slovenian exports to the Czech  Republic over the same period amounting to $33 million.    Peterle, who started his official two-day visit to the Czech  Republic today, also met President Vaclav Havel and Parliament  Chairman Milan Uhde. He will be visiting a Prague Castle  exhibition about Josip Plecnik, Slovenian architect who worked  in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars and designed  alterations to the Castle and its gardens.

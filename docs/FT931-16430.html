			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Spain's reserves rebound after currency turmoil SPAIN'S reserves, which were hard hit in the battle to secure the peseta during the currency turmoil last year, improved by nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) last month to finish the year at Dollars 50.4bn, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. Although Spain holds a relatively large volume of reserves by European standards, the end-of-year figure represented a net fall in 1992 of Dollars 15.7bn. This was the first annual drop since 1985. According to provisional figures released by the Bank of Spain, reserves fell from Dollars 71.2bn at the end of August last year to Dollars 47.5bn at the end of November. The peseta was devalued by 5 per cent on September 17 and by a further 6 per cent on November 21. It now appears to be comfortable at its new parity within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.</p>

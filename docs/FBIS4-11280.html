			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, Unit No. 4 of the Carlos Manuel de  Cespedes power plant in Cienfuegos, with a generating capacity  of 158 megawatts, had to be taken offline due to a rupture in  one of the unit's boiler pipes. This situation will cause  greater outage problems than those that took place over the past  weekend.    Jorge Carballo of the Electric Union pointed out that this  unit should be repaired within the next 72 hours. He added that  workers are now waiting for the boiler to cool down to begin  repairs. When this unit goes back into service, units No. 1 of  Santa Cruz del Norte and No. 6 of Diez de Octubre will be taken  offline for maintenance.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ACCOMPLICE IN KILLING OF MIGRANTS PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> On the eve of his murder trial, a 20-year-old San Diego man pleaded guilty  Thursday to two counts of voluntary manslaughter in the hate-crime slayings of  two unarmed Mexican migrants.  </P> <P> Dennis Bencivenga, a one-time security guard and convenience store clerk from  Rancho Bernardo, entered his plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge William  Mudd, who remanded him to County Jail.  </P> <P> In a plea bargain, Bencivenga could be sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in  state prison and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine.  </P> <P> Authorities have said the two victims, shot down along an isolated San Diego  roadside on the evening of Nov. 9, 1988, were killed solely because they were  Latino. Their bodies were riddled with 11 rounds from a semiautomatic rifle.  </P> <P> The triggerman in the slayings, Kenneth Kovzelove, 18, also of San Diego,  pleaded guilty in October to two counts of first-degree murder. Judge Mudd,  calling Kovzelove a "cold-blooded killer," later sentenced him to 50 years to  life in state prison and ordered him to pay a $20,000 fine.  </P> <P> Mudd scheduled sentencing for Bencivenga on May 4.  </P> <P> The case has received extensive publicity in Mexico, where it has fed a  widespread perception of abuse of expatriate workers in the United States.  </P> <P> Bencivenga, like Kovzelove, could have also faced up to life in prison on the  original murder charges. But authorities agreed to the lesser manslaughter  charges, weighing Bencivenga's critical cooperation with investigators, his  expressions of remorse, and the fact that he was the driver of the vehicle  involved in the slaying, not the actual murderer.  </P> <P> Bencivenga, apparently remorseful, admitted his involvement in January, 1989,  to an Army recruiter, who notified police. The case had previously stumped  investigators. Bencivenga then cooperated with investigators.  </P> <P> The two friends were arrested in March, 1989. Kovzelove was apprehended at Ft.  Benning, Ga., where he was training as a paratrooper -- a job he sought because  it would afford him the opportunity to kill legally, according to prosecutors.  </P> <P> "We all felt from the beginning that if he (Bencivenga) had not come forward,  Kovzelove would have killed somebody else," said A. David Stutz, the deputy  district attorney who prosecuted the case, in a telephone interview Thursday.  "When it came down to it, I don't think Bencivenga would have pulled the  trigger. Kovzelove did, and would have done it again. . . . He was the  psychopathic killer."  </P> <P> In statements to police, authorities say that Kovzelove -- a fair-haired,  slightly built teen-ager whose physical appearance contrasts with that of the  husky, dark-haired Bencivenga -- admitted firing on the two unarmed men.  Kovzelove acknowledged that he shouted "Kill!" "Kill!" as he shot at the men,  police say, and that he later felt exhilarated by the experience.  </P> <P> In his statements to police, Bencivenga acknowledged that he was driving on the  night of the killings, and that he had furnished the South Korean-made assault  rifle. Authorities say Kovzelove, crouching and wearing military fatigues,  fired from the bed of a pickup stopped along semirural Black Mountain Road,  near San Diego's northern city limits, in an area frequented by migrant  workers.  </P> <P> Before and after the killings, Stutz said, the two men scouted the San Diego  area in search of other Latino targets. Kovzelove has admitted a hatred for  Mexicans, whom he accuses of taking jobs from U. S. citizens and whom he  resents for not speaking English, Stutz said.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind that, if there had been five men along Black  Mountain Road that night, Kovzelove would have killed all of them," said Stutz,  who added that the triggerman suffers from a "classic Rambo syndrome."  </P> <P> Kovzelove was 17 at the time of the murders but was tried as an adult by a  Juvenile Court judge.  </P> <P> Mudd has the option of sending Bencivenga to the California Youth Authority  until age 25, then to an adult prison to finish the sentence.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Bencivenga hugged his mother and other friends and relatives  before entering court to plead guilty. Bencivenga's mother told her son, "God  bless you."  </P> <P> Bencivenga's bail was revoked after his guilty plea. Bencivenga will probably  serve at least half of the maximum 14-year prison term before qualifying for  parole, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The victims -- Hilario Castaneda Salgado, 22, a native of the Mexican state of  Guerrero, and Matilde Macedo de la Sancha, 19, a native of the state of Mexico  -- were homeless farm workers who occasionally lived in the brush near the site  where they were gunned down.  </P> <P> Through Michael D. Padilla, a San Diego attorney, the victims' families filed  civil wrongful death claims against the two killers, but the claims were  dismissed when it was learned that neither assailant had any financial  holdings, said a spokeswoman for Padilla.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] By a decree of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Deputy  Defense Minister Grigor Khandzhiev has been relieved of his  post. The date of his release is 20 May 1994.    The dismissal is on the basis of Article 328-A, which states  that the labor contract of a person who has a responsible post  can be discontinued when this is in the best operational  interest. This was reported by reporter Khristo Khristov, who  will try to learn more details about this rather surprising  dismissal of the deputy defense minister.</p>

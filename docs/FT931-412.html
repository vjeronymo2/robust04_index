			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holmes Protection halts placing HOLMES Protection, the US security group quoted in the UK, has been forced to cancel a small share placing after an un-named overseas investor failed to honour its agreement to pay for 1m shares. The group, headed by a new management team led by Sir Ian MacGregor, credited a turnround in its year-end results reported last month to the successful completion of a three-month debt restructuring programme. The 1.08m share placement was announced at the same time as the year-end results. Yesterday the company said sufficient placing commitments had been received, but that the placing in its present form was being cancelled because of the problem with the un-named overseas investor. The group added that it has started legal proceedings against the investor. The shares were unchanged at 64p yesterday ahead of the announcement.</p>

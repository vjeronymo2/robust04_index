He admitted that the main difficulty continues to be the  search for a formula for a political settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "A meeting between five leading powers --  Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany --  is not the only possibility, and we have already proposed other  options for the cast of participants," Churkin reported,  avoiding more detailed explanations.    Answering a question about the degree of mistrust which the  Muslims feel toward the officers and men in the Russian  peacekeeping battalion, the deputy chief of Russian diplomacy  said: "I raised this question myself in a conversation with  President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I think I  was able to convince him that our military are not an  anti-Muslim force in any way." Churkin emphasized the amicable  tone of the talks with Izetbegovic, noting: "We are proceeding  from the official statements of the Bosnian leadership, and not  paying attention to the irresponsible Muslim activists who want  war rather than peace."    Following the 12 December elections, AFP circulated a report  to the effect that the Russian battalion in Croatia, part of  which is now redeployed in Sarajevo, voted almost to a man for  the communists and Zhirinovskiy's party. In that case, can we  count on the impartiality of these people? Vitaliy Churkin gave  the following answer to this question: "AFP did not count up  the votes. We have secret ballots, and everyone is free in  making his decision. I know the servicemen in the battalion.  They are highly professional and disciplined officers and men.  Today they are standing in the line of fire, preventing both  the Muslims and the Serbs from being killed."    The president's special representative is convinced that the  Kremlin's initiative has saved not only Sarajevo, but also  NATO's prestige. In his opinion, air raids would have led to an  escalation of war on the entire territory of Bosnia, because  they may have created the illusion among some of the Muslims of  an easy victory, which in actual fact would have been  unattainable. "Following the bombings, the North Atlantic bloc  would have had to take the next logical step -- that of  bringing ground forces into Bosnia, which would have dragged  Europe into the quagmire of a long and futile war," Vitaliy  Churkin believes.</p>

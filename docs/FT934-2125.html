			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sheriff shows strong advance to Pounds 1.7m Sheriff Holdings, the Nottingham-based independent plant hire company, saw annual profits advance strongly as it benefited from both organic growth and acquisitions. On turnover ahead from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12.8m, including Pounds 846,000 from acquisitions, and after interest charges reduced to Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 312,000), pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-September amounted to Pounds 1.71m (Pounds 686,000). Mr Richard Dunn, chairman of the USM-traded company, said the performance had been aided by strong cash generation which would also enable it to carry out investment plans in the current year. Gearing at September 30 was 18 per cent, down from 48 per cent a year earlier. A recommended final dividend of 2.5p lifts the year's total by 88 per cent to 3.75p (2p), payable from earnings of 11.5p (6.7p).</p>

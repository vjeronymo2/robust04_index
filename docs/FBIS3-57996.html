			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French General Philippe Morillon, former </F> commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia, by Jacques Cordy  in Paris; date not given: "On Belgian General Francis  Briquemont's Departure From Bosnia"]    [Text] [Cordy] General Briquemont will soon be leaving  Sarajevo and giving up his command of the blue helmets, as you  did six months ago. Has anything changed in Bosnia since then ?    [Morillon] He would no doubt be better able to speak of the  present situation than me. He took over a situation, the  consequences and difficulties of which I had analyzed. Remember  that in June 1993 I expressed the fear that the UN mission in  the former Yugoslavia would become impossible if things  continued to develop as they were. General Briquemont has  assessed on the spot the elements on which his decision was  based.    [Cordy] He is making his decision at a very particular time.    [Morillon] Yes, at a very important period: International  pressure on the parties involved in the drama must be stepped up  on the eve of the NATO summit in Brussels. It was to be  expected that the situation would deteriorate. If General  Briquemont has chosen such a course of action, then I have every  confidence in him.    [Cordy] You left, and nothing changed. He is now leaving.  What can change? Is his departure not really a rather  meaningless gesture, as was your own?    [Morillon] I do not believe that you have to interpret it  like that: I was replaced because there was a change of  mission. His departure, under the present conditions, marks a  new development in the crisis. Perhaps not the final one, but  one which I hope will prove useful. Let it be a shock which is  well understood, both by public opinion worldwide and above all  in the field. There must no longer be any pretexts for delaying  peace. Any gesture which helps speed up a solution in favor of  peace is worth making.    [Cordy] It is said that General Briquemont is a friend of  yours.    [Morillon] Absolutely. I know him very well. We studied  together at the Ecole de Guerre here in Paris, and I regard him  very highly.    [Cordy] But what can he -- or someone else -- achieve?    [Morillon] First of all, the international community must be  agreed on the principles. The first principle, in my view, is  not to be party to the pursuit of a policy of "ethnic  cleansing." And I am told that this is included in the draft  Constitution. Belgrade is now asking for economic sanctions to  be lifted. As the European Community ministers have indicated,  this is something which cannot be negotiated on the basis of  good promises, but on concrete acts and behavior. Starting  perhaps with the implementation of the resolutions on safe areas  and -- as a matter of priority -- Sarajevo. The Serbs must make  a real gesture to show their genuine commitment to peace, which  is at present still in doubt. The agreements on the  demilitarization of Sarajevo (and other Bosnian towns), in order  to place them under UN protection, have already been prepared.  As, indeed, they already had been at the time that I left my  command. I am sure that General Briquemont has tried to  continue working on this. This is a first step which I feel  must be demanded in return for any kind of negotiation  whatsoever.    [Cordy] In the meantime, does the double-dealing not  continue  ?    [Morillon] This is of course intolerable. The positions  taken by General Cot and General Briquemont correspond  completely to what I always said and thought when I was  responsible on the spot.    [Cordy] As regards the West, do the politicians still make  the decisions?    [Morillon] This has always been the case. I have defended  the prime importance of political negotiation in this matter, as  in the case of any use of the armed forces. Once again, I  believe that the Brussels NATO meeting should be very important  in this respect. This is why it is good for public opinion to be  made aware of this problem which was no doubt tending to be  forgotten as other crises came along.    [Cordy] You have just published (with Grasset) a book  entitled Believing and Daring. What is there left to  believe in today?    [Morillon] The need for and the usefulness of this mission!  That has always been the very basis of the action of our men and  the maintenance of their morale. The sacrifices made in the  former Yugoslavia are not useless, because we can see every day  how human lives are being saved. Believing that this mission is  necessary, but at the same time knowing that it is not enough:  We are all perfectly aware of this.    [Cordy] And the priorities ?    [Morillon] I have sought to give public opinion certain  keys:  We must not confuse the United Nations' priority mission --  which is to help these populations to survive -- with what is  the accompaniment to the diplomatic and political measures which  are being negotiated in Geneva. We must not confuse Geneva with  Sarajevo. First of all there is the rule of law. Then, the  military there is to uphold the law. But it is not because  peace is late in coming that we should cease to try to relieve  the suffering.    [Cordy] Humanitarian aid is arriving in dribs and drabs?    [Morillon] And depending on good or bad intentions. This is  nothing new: Long and humiliating negotiations have always been  needed. The UN force must not be totally impotent, its action  totally ineffective, but this is a matter for the military  chiefs. To return to the title of my book: We must believe and  dare in order not to be purely passive, because it is passivity  which is ignominious. This means that a military chief cannot  hide behind the rules in order not to act. And General  Briquemont most certainly cannot be accused of that! I remain  convinced that the most worthwhile task to be undertaken in that  country is to avoid despair. As long as an international  presence remains, there will also remain a glimmer of hope.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / North-south divide seen to narrow Most UK regions prospered more than London and south-east England in 1993, narrowing the north-south divide, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. In its first review of UK economic output and income by region in 1993, the CSO reported that gross domestic product per head grew strongest in Wales and the southwest while the north-west, Northern Ireland, and Yorkshire and Humberside also performed better than average. Because of slower growth, Greater London and the south-east saw their GDP per head fall relative to the UK average for the fourth successive year while the east Midlands also lost ground in the two years to 1993. Scotland and Northern Ireland maintained gains won in the previous two to three years mainly at the expense of the south-east. Greater London's share of GDP fell 0.2 percentage points between 1987 and in 1993 to 14.9 per cent while the share of the rest of the south-east fell more sharply to 20.6 per cent in 1993 from 21.1 per cent in 1990. But Greater London and the south-east remained by far the most prosperous UK regions. At Pounds 11,528 and Pounds 10,215 respectively, GDP per head in London and in the rest of the south-east was 24.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent higher than the UK average. The south-east including London contained about 30 per cent of the UK population in 1993 but accounted for more than 35 per cent of GDP. South-east GDP per head, at Pounds 10,728, was 16 per cent above the UK average of Pounds 9,248. By contrast, GDP per head in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were all below the UK and English averages. While Scotland came close to the UK average with GDP per head of Pounds 9,104, Wales and Northern Ireland trailed with Pounds 7,831 and Pounds 7,574 respectively. Marked differences in industrial structures explained some of the variation. The east Midlands were hit by coalmine closures in 1993 while increased oil activity boosted Scottish output. Manufacturing output in Wales and Northern Ireland grew at rates well above the national average in the year while Northern Ireland also reported above-average growth rates in the distribution, hotels, catering and repair sectors.

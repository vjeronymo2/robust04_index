			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hafnia fall-out spreads across Continent THE fall-out from the Hafnia debacle in Denmark spread from the troubled Nordic bourses to other continental equity markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT lost its early gains after Deutsche Bank Research downgraded its forecasts for Commerzbank in view of the latter's loan exposure to Hafnia, the Danish insurance group which suspended payments on Wednesday. DBR dropped its 1992 Commerzbank EPS by DM3 to DM22, and 1993's by DM2 to DM25. Commerzbank shares dropped DM15.80 to DM220.50. Other analysts said that it was unlikely that Commerzbank would lose all of the DM300m implied by these calculations but remembered that its recent performance includes exposure to the embattled Canadian property developer, O &amp; Y. The DAX index came back from an intraday high of 1,536.05 to 1,513.06, down 1.66 on the day. Dealers were looking for a good day with M3 in line with expectations and bond futures looking good, but they said that the bears seized on the bad news to extend their short positions. Sectors which suffered most yesterday were construction, regarded as still highly priced, and engineering and steels which stayed weak on their association with Mannesmann which dropped another DM7.20 to DM227, bring its fall this week to DM45.50. PARIS sank further into its depression as a broker downgrade in the oil sector and worries about the forthcoming referendum on Maastricht took the CAC-40 index down by 10.03 to 1,724.18. Turnover was larger than usual at FFr1.8bn. Dealers said the excessive falls in share prices following negative comments from brokers this week showed how nervous the market was. Total dropped FFr12.70 or 5.6 per cent to FFr212.50 in relatively heavy volume of 1.1m shares after Merrill Lynch downgraded it buy from neutral ahead of first-half results due in late September. A spokesman for the oil company said that the bourse had overreacted to the broker's analysis. In the same sector, Elf dropped FFr10.10 to FFr312.80 ahead of its interims, due on Monday. Elsewhere, UAP fell FFr11.90 or 3.1 per cent to FFr374 on worries about the consequences of its 6 per cent stake in Hafnia. Among smaller stocks, Valeo slipped FFr34 to FFr715 as Paribas adopted a more cautious stance on the automotive sector. MILAN was temporarily shaken out of its August torpor by a newspaper report which revived an old rumour that a group of investors, led by Mediobanca, was interested in buying Iri's 57 per cent stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI). The Comit index rose 3.72 to 404.90 in turnover estimated at L50-55bn. Brokers found the price-tag of between L3.5 and L4 trillion - around L6,000 a share - mooted in the report as too high, considering BCI's fundamentals. They also pointed out that if Iri sold its 57 per cent stake in the bank to another party, this would trigger the new Opa law designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders. BCI shares gained 6.8 per cent or L159 to L2,499 volume of just over 4m shares. Mediobanca was also strong, rising L276 to L11,475. The state telephone company Sip was the most heavily traded stock on the screen, falling L28 to L1,101 in volume of 4.6m shares. Dealers said renewed rumours of a rights issue weighed on the stock. ZURICH turned lower after a sudden drop in the dollar, some banks falling as the SMI index fell 22.2, or 1.3 per cent to 1,753.5. SBC fell SFr5 to SFr231 and Swiss Volksbank by SFr30 to SFr760. STOCKHOLM saw a rise in Sweden's key marginal lending rate, aimed at stemming the outflow of capital from the country, and the Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.3 to 791.1. Ericsson B eased SKr1 to SKr113 in spite of a better-than-expected first-half profit of SKr59m. Newspaper reports estimated the size of S-E-Banken loans to Hafnia at between SKr450m and SKr1.4bn and the bank's stock fell to a new 12-month low of SKr17.50, down SKr1. OSLO dropped another 3.5 per cent, the all-share index closing 11.66 lower at 327.97 with Den norske Bank A down DKr1.2 to a new low of DKr2.0 and Uni Storebrand by DKr0.4 to DKr15.5. HELSINKI's bank and finance index fell 5.8 per cent as Moody's put two Finnish banks, KOP and Okobank, under review for a possible ratings downgrade. The Hex index closed 14.4, or 2.4 per cent lower at 634.3. Pohjola, the insurer, saw its B free shares fall FM5.1, or 17.5 per cent to FM24 following Wednesday's Hafnia announcement. The insurer has a 10 per cent stake in the Swedish insurer Skandia, of which Hafnia holds some 15 per cent. AMSTERDAM ended lower in quiet trading, as the CBS Tendency index fell 0.6 to 111.3. VIENNA ended firmer, boosted by the expiry of August options contracts. The 18-share ATX index gained 13.52 to 745.7 and the bourse index rose 2.24 to 356.29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 20                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open   10.30am   11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1035.70  1035.50  1033.48  1031.28  1031.07  1031.88  1031.66  1030.83                Day's High  1035.89    Day's Low  1030.41          Aug 19     Aug 18      Aug 17     Aug 14       Aug 13         1033.91     1035.74    1045.00     1042.13     1035.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

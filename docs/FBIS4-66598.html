			<p>CSO     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 23 (PTI)--The dollar value of trade  between India and China almost doubled in the course of 1993, to  $673 million, according to Chinese customs statistics.    While overall bilateral trade grew by 98.9 percent, India's  exports to China expanded by an even larger margin, that is 170  percent, from $181 million in 1992 to $417 million in 1993, the  Chinese figures showed.    The figures include trade through Hong Kong. China  selectively includes or excludes the Hong Kong figures depending  on its need to play down its own massive surplus vis-a-vis other  countries and highlight an occasional surplus enjoyed by some of  them.    The United States, west European countries, Japan and others  regularly complain of deficits running into tens of billions of  dollars annually in their trade with China.    India had for more than a decade and a half suffered a wide  deficit in its trade with China but the sale of iron ore and  steel needed by China's burgeoning construction industry over  the past couple of years altered the situation. Indian imports  from China last year grew by 63 percent, from $158 million in  1992 to $259 million, the Chinese figures showed.    Bilateral trade is keeping to an `encouraging upswing',  diplomatic sources here commented, pointing to a 7.28-percent  increase in 1991, 28.6 percent in 1992 and 98.9 percent last  year, as per Chinese figures.    There is good reason to hope that Sino-Indian trade value  will cross the $1-billion mark, they said. However, that figure  will still remain a fraction of 1 percent in China's total trade.    China has bid for launching an Indian satellite and, if it  succeeds, that will significantly boost the payments accruing to  it.    While iron ore has, for many years, been a significant item  in India's sales to China, steel emerged as an entirely new  item, and the largest one, last year, amounting to $177.5  million.    Although China's construction industry is trying to cool its  over-heated growth, the demand is expected to continue growing  though at a slower rate, the sources said.</p>

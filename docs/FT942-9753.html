			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Regional markets vary as Nikkei remains firm The Nikkei 225 average stayed above 20,000 yesterday, share prices moving higher on late buying of laggard sectors by foreign investors, and on technical purchases by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index traded narrowly, gaining 74.11 at 20,224.24 after a low of 20,118.72, and high of 20,260.35 just before the close. Volume came to 270m shares, against 344m, as most domestic players remained inactive due to the prevailing uncertainty on the currency markets. 'Whether the yen's easing is sustainable or not is uncertain,' said a trader. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.52 to 1,644.56 and the Nikkei 300 put on 1.49 at 301.08. Gainers led losers by 629 to 370, with 185 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 1.67 at 1,344.15. Traders said that with potential sellers above the 20,000 level, investors had little incentive to buy stocks at current prices. Real estate companies, regarded as laggards, were traded actively. Mitsubishi Estate firmed Y10 to Y1,280 and Mitsui Fudosan Y30 to Y1,300. Construction stocks were also firm, with Shimizu appreciating Y12 to Y954 and Kumagai Gumi Y17 to Y488. Railroads, too, advanced on the laggard stocks theme, with Tobu Railway up Y22 to Y686 and East Japan Railway ahead Y12,000 at Y500,000. Steels gained on foreign buying: NKK, the day's most active issue, rose Y8 to Y266 and Nippon Steel put on Y1 at Y353. Profit-taking depressed some high-technology companies, which had rallied on Wednesday. Fujitsu shed Y10 to Y1,030 and Sony Y50 to Y5,840. Speculators looking for quick profits targeted Mazda Motor, which climbed Y24 to Y573, and Brother Industries, Y13 stronger at Y690. In Osaka, the OSE average added 45.93 at 22,373.49 in volume of 31.3m shares. Roundup The region's markets showed wide variations in performance. Bombay and Jakarta were closed for holidays. HONG KONG fell slightly following the previous day's 4 per cent gain: the Hang Seng index finished down 27.30 at 8,878.86. 'Sentiment remains cautious if not bearish,' said one trader. 'Many funds would rather stay on the sidelines pending opportunities, while others have turned to the futures, trying to make the most out of the choppy spot market.' Among the actives, HSBC dipped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 84 and Cheung Kong lost 75 cents to HKDollars 36.50, but there was selective buying of other blue chips and second line stocks. Chinese Estates was the session's strongest performer, advancing HKDollars 1.00, or 15 per cent, to HKDollars 7.50. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 4.5bn (HKDollars 5.2bn). SINGAPORE fell back in light trading as investors took profits on selected blue chips following gains over the previous two sessions. The Straits Times industrial index slipped 10.81 to 2,250.41. Natsteel dropped 44 cents to SDollars 4.36 in heavy turnover on expectations that it would soon announce disappointing results. Shipbuiders came under pressure after recent gains: Sembawang receded 20 cents to SDollars 13.00. SEOUL maintained its momentum as the market rose for the seventh consecutive session, the composite index firming 3.54 to 952.45. Turnover was Won793.8bn. TAIPEI was pulled lower late in the session on profit-taking, and the weighted index, which had earlier seen the 6,100 level, closed off 20.09 at 6,004.38. Turnover rose to TDollars 87.4bn from TDollars 61.9bn. Construction and electronic issues went against the trend, with Tatung up TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 61.50. Formosa Chemical Fibre lost TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 37.50. MANILA was generally softer but for a gain in PLDT, which added 30 pesos at 1,890 pesos after a slight rise on Wall Street overnight. The composite index eased 3.11 to 2,952.27. Turnover was 906.8m pesos. Traders noted that many investors were refraining from buying in anticipation of three IPOs later in the month. KUALA LUMPUR eased as sentiment was affected by Bank Negara's announcement that it was to raise the reserve requirements of banks and finance companies. The composite index dipped 11.75 to 996.92. Tenaga weakened 40 cents to MDollars 13.30 on expectations that the power group would announce poorer than expected results next week. BANGKOK ended slightly lower after moving in a narrow 10-point range. The SET index lost 3.04 at 1,232.72 in thin turnover of Bt3.8bn. Investors focused on construction materials in the expectation that first-quarter results, especially among cement manufacturers, would show an improvement. The heavily weighted Bangkok Bank put on Bt1 at Bt161, limiting the index's fall. SYDNEY, which had lost ground in the afternoon, firmed shortly before the close. The All Ordinaries index finished 6.8 ahead at 2,041.4. Turnover was ADollars 527.8m. Foster's Brewing fell 11 cents to ADollars 1.19 on brokers' downgrades, while positive opinions helped BHP to a gain of 36 cents at ADollars 17.04. WELLINGTON followed its own instincts. Strong buying was seen in the major blue chips and the NZSE-40 capital index advanced 29.66 to 2,093.50. Air New Zealand shares received a boost after announcing that second-half profits were likely to exceed the first half's NZDollars 88.1m. KARACHI strengthened on institutional buying. The KSE 100-share index rose 38.03, or 1.7 per cent, to 2,227.22.</p>

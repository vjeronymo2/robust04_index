The article goes on:    In South Korea the population are deprived of even their  freedom to see, hear and speak as they please, to say nothing of  the freedom of ideological choice and political activity, and  not only their material and cultural life but their right to  live are ruthlessly trampled upon.    What matters in the human rights situation in South Korea  is,  above all, that the repressive legal system and machines are not  only maintained but further mal-revised [word as received] and  supplemented. The Kim Yong-sam group not only has maintained  the legal and institutional devices including the "National  Security Law" which the preceding military fascist regimes had  made the foundation of their existence, but also has expanded  and strengthened the functions and role of such repressive tools  as the "Security Planning Board" and "secret affairs command",  the headquarters of evils, in a crafty way and drastically  reinforced the puppet police to ruthlessly suppress the  righteous struggle of the people at any time and in any place.    The human rights situation in South Korea offers a problem  also because not only those who conduct patriotic, democratic  activities but the workers, peasants and other labouring masses  who champion their right to existence and even dissident  democratic organizations are suppressed, branded as "leftist  violent forces".    The fascist clique had arrested more than 200 students,  intellectuals and others by invoking the "National Security Law"  by October last year. This is 2.5 times the figure of those  arrested in the initial corresponding period of the No Tae-u  fascist clique's tenure.    What must not be overlooked is that the fascist clique is  mercilessly cracking down on the workers and peasants who call  for their right to live.    Grave human rights abuses by the Kim Yong-sam group are  found  in the fact that brutal tortures remain unabated, with a large  number of patriots and guiltless people ruthlessly killed by  tortures or punished on false "charges". Brutal tortures of all  descriptions are inflicted on any detainees, whether they be  aged and sick, women and even pregnant women, once they are  arrested, in order to wrest false confessions.    Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam regime is, indeed,  a  regime destroying human rights under the "civilian" veil.    The reality apparently confirms that the human rights  problem  in South Korea cannot be solved unless the Kim Yong-sam fascist  regime is toppled.</p>

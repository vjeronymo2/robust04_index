			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Policy does not address the appropriateness of approving anticipated bypasses through NPDES permits in advance outside the CSO context.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Implementation Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The permittee should include all pertinent information in the long term control plan necessary to develop the construction and financing schedule for implementation of CSO controls. Schedules for implementation of the CSO controls may be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon WQS and designated uses, priority projects identified in the long-term plan, and on a permittee's financial capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction phasing should consider:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Eliminating overflows that discharge to sensitive areas as the highest priority;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Use impairment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The permittee's financial capability including consideration of such factors as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Median household income;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Total annual wastewater and CSO control costs per household as a percent of median household income;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Overall net debt as a percent of full market property value;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. Property tax revenues as a percent of full market property value;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. Property tax collection rate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi. Unemployment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vii. Bond rating;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Grant and loan availability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Previous and current residential, commercial and industrial sewer user fees and rate structures; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Other viable funding mechanisms and sources of financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Post-Construction Compliance Monitoring Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The selected CSO controls should include a post-construction water quality monitoring program adequate to verify compliance with water quality standards and protection of designated uses as well as to ascertain the effectiveness of CSO controls. This water quality compliance monitoring program should include a plan to be approved by the NPDES authority that details the monitoring protocols to be followed, including the necessary effluent and ambient monitoring and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessments, whole effluent toxicity testing, and sediment sampling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Coordination With State Water Quality Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> WQS are State adopted, or Federally promulgated rules which serve as the goals for the water body and the legal basis for the water quality-based NPDES permit requirements under the CWA. WQS consist of uses which States designate for their water bodies, criteria to protect the uses, an anti-degradation policy to protect the water quality improvements gained and other policies affecting the implementation of the standards. A primary objective of the long-term CSO control plan is to meet WQS, including the designated uses through reducing risks to human health and the environment by eliminating, relocating or controlling CSOs to the affected waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

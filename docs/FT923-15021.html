			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Targets mystery Sir, Your report ('Whitehall aims to protect tea ladies', July 2) that Mr William Waldegrave is to publish a table showing how far government departments 'have met the targets for market testing their functions' is most curious. On June 2, at a meeting with civil service union general secretaries, Mr Waldegrave repeated and categorically denied that any such targets existed. The official minute of the meeting confirms that denial. The minister said that not only were there no targets but confirmed that neither he nor any of his officials had given an off the record briefing that there were. Surely, in the name of the open government that the minister has repeatedly said he supports, he should make it clear whether they exist or not. We have asked him to deny the existence of targets as openly to the press as he did to us. We await developments. Elizabeth Symons, general secretary, Association of First Division Civil Servants, 2 Caxton Street, London SW1H 0QH</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Zhu Fu (4376 4395) "Treasure the Opportunity, </F> Dare To Pioneer and Try, and Seek Greater Development in the  Course of Reform"]    [Text] Leading personnel, including Wang Qun, secretary of  the autonomous regional party committee; Qian Fenyong, deputy  secretary of the autonomous regional party committee; and Shen  Shuji, vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's  government; carried out investigation and study in Baotou city  from 4 to 16 December.    Wang Qun and the leading personnel respectively held forums  with leaders of Baotou city, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company,  the First and Second Neimenggu Machine-Building Plants, the  Neimenggu Aluminium Plant, and a number of city level  enterprises. They also visited township enterprises in the  suburban township of Houyingzi.    Wang Qun pointed out: We should apply the spirit of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  spirit of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping in educating cadres and the masses at present to  enable them to discern that the establishment of socialist  market economic systems represents a profound and great  revolution, that the road in this regard must be followed, that  the regression to the old ways of a planned economy is out of  the question; and that we can not get ahead through the  capitalist road. While it is natural for us to take risks in  developing the market economy, we will encounter a "blind alley"  and even greater risk and will "subjugate the party and the  country" if we fail to conduct reform and to achieve  development. There are many difficulties which enterprises are  currently encountering and will encounter in the future in the  course of achieving a large change. Only by overcoming these  difficulties can they have a brilliant future. The state will  issue a large number of measures for reforms in the year of 1994  and the issuance will have important and crucial significance on  the establishment of the socialist market economy system. We  should educate cadres and the masses to clearly discern the  situation and to correctly deal with relations between reform  and development and between reform and stability; relations  between the central authorities and localities, the state and  enterprises, staff members and workers, and immediate and long-  term interests. The opportunity we face has not changed. After  15 years of reform and development, the national and  international environments are now extremely favorable for us.  It can be said that "everything is ready and all we need is an  east wind". "An east wind" entails having the leadership at all  levels dare to make efforts to pioneer and to display the spirit  of pioneering the road of advance and if they do not, it entails  their inability of paving the road to deepening reform, the  turning of the quickening of development into empty talk, and  losing the opportunity.    Wang Qun stressed: Our enterprises should conduct their  development along the road of modernization, market,  internationalization, and grouping. Large and medium-sized  enterprises should take the lead in this regard, base themselves  on international markets, gain ground in market competition, and  seek self development. They should push forward reform as a  whole and make a breakthroughs in the key aspects. The  departments of governments, banks, industry and commerce, labor  affairs, and insurance should cooperate with the quickening of  reform. The emphasis of reform should be placed on enterprises  and in large and medium-sized enterprises in particular. The  orientation of enterprise reform is to establish modern  enterprise systems and the current emphasis should be placed on  conducting reform in the three internal systems. Leadership at  all levels should integrate the spirit of the central decision  with the principle of "three advantages" and grasp the essence  of the "decision's" spirit. We should resolutely implement the  spirit of "the decision" and proceed from reality in adopting  ways and styles for reform. We may apply any method as long as  it conforms with the "three advantages." Ways that prove  effective in reforms should be popularized among localities. By  no means should we always remain these ways in the period of  "experimentation conducted by specific units."    Leading comrades including Wang Qun urged the leading organs  and enterprises to pay attention to making scientific and  technological progress, to pay special attention to studying  managerial knowledge, to learn about markets, to master markets,  and to upgrade their capability of controlling markets. In the  final analysis, market competition means the competition of  scientific and technological personnel and means that efforts  should be made to upgrade the technological content of products  and to join in the competition with high-quality and high-grade  products.    Wang Qun said: In the historical change of establishing the  systems of market economy, it is imperative to enhance the  party's leadership; to strengthen the ideological work and the  enforcement of discipline; and to bring our political strong  points into full play. He also urged leading cadres to enhance  their professional ambition and their sense of responsibility  and their concept of the whole situation and to continuously and  somehow create something or make progress in leading the program  of effecting great change.    Wang Qun, Qian Fenyong, and Shen Shuji also put forward  specific opinions on the practical problems encountered by  enterprises.</p>

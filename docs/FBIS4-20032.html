			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sha"-signed report: "Companies Remain in Waiting </F> Position"]    [Text] Hamburg -- German companies seem to be waiting for  the outcome of elections in South Africa. Direct investment in  South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM]  since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association,  is content if German investors are able to keep their position  at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW,  Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth  transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300  German companies, that is about half of all German investors in  Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of  36,000 staff.    According to the Africa Association, the fact that German  exporters could maintain their business with the continent's  most important trading partner "in spite of the reform process"  is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion,  German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to  DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South  Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and  other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East.    The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union  [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about  African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome  Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy,  and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not  cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier  South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert  Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg.  Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the  amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the  Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP  and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also  doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a  developing country.</p>

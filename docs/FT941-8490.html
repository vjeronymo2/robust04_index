			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Dublin demands stronger plan for co-operation Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, will today tell Mr John Major that the British government must strengthen its proposals for greater cross-border co-operation in order to achieve a political settlement in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds will indicate to his British counterpart, during a planned one-hour meeting in Downing Street, that Dublin is likely to make clear its own ideas on the north-south relationship within about a month. This month Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, gave Dublin a check-list of outline proposals for renewed talks aimed at a settlement and asked for the republic's response. Today's meeting comes a week before Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, holds its annual conference near Dublin. With signs that the Irish government remains more optimistic than London of a positive response to the peace proposals, Mr Reynolds is expected to urge Mr Major to be cautious in his efforts to step up pressure on Sinn Fein to renounce violence and take a place at the negotiating table. Downing Street was yesterday playing down the significance of the meeting, saying that no formal statement was expected. One official said it could be seen as 'a visible demonstration of the desire of both governments to be relentless in putting pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to declare their hands'. Mr Reynolds is keen to give the meeting more prominence however, and has interviews planned later with the media at the Irish embassy in London after the England and Ireland rugby match. There appears to be a conviction in Dublin that, while a breakthrough may not be imminent, there are nevertheless indications that an IRA ceasefire may be forthcoming soon. Significantly, it is the belief at the highest levels in the Irish government that Sinn Fein and the seven-man army council of the IRA are willing to accept the joint declaration. Last week Mr Reynolds responded by letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, for his request for 'clarifications' of the joint declaration. There have since been further communications via intermediaries, and according to officials in the republican movement Sinn Fein views the Irish government's stance positively. The problem appears to be that lower echelons in the IRA are not willing to go along with the declaration and a permanent ceasefire without further assurances from the British government.</p>

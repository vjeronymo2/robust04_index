			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For three years, on March 21, 1991, March 16, 1992, and March 22, 1993, the Commission approved, on a one-year pilot basis each time, amendments to the rule which permit a specialist to stop stock in a minimum variation market (generally referred to as an ``1/8th point market''). <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange sought these amendments on the grounds that many orders would receive an improved price if stopping stock in 1/8th point markets were permitted. The amendments to Rule 116.30 permit a specialist, upon request, to stop individual orders of 2,000 shares or less, up to an aggregate of 5,000 shares when multiple orders are stopped, in an 1/8th point market. A specialist may stop an order pursuant to a specified larger order size threshold, or a specified larger aggregate share threshold, after obtaining Floor Official approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 1991, 1992 and 1993 Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 12, 1993, the Exchange requested that the Commission grant permanent approval to the amendments to Rule 116.30. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  At that time, the Commission staff requested that the Exchange extend the pilot for an additional year to allow the Commission more time to consider the Exchange's request to make the amendments to Rule 116.30 permanent. The Commission staff has again requested that the Exchange extend the pilot for the same reason. Therefore, the Exchange is now proposing to extend the effectiveness of the amendments to Rule 116.30 for an additional year through March 21, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange's proposal to extend amendments to Rule 116.30 is consistent with these objectives in that it permits the Exchange to better serve its customers by enabling specialists to execute customer orders at improved prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;06 and should be submitted by April 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b)(5) <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  and section 11(b) <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  of the Act. The Commission believes that the amendments to Rule 116.30 should further the objectives of section 6(b)(5) and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum variation markets, under limited circumstances that provide the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78k (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a description of NYSE procedures for stopping stock in minimum variation markets, and of the Commission's rationale for approving those procedures on a pilot basis, see 1991 Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. The discussion in the aforementioned order is incorporated by reference into this order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its orders approving the pilot procedures, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  the Commission asked the NYSE to study the effects of stopping stock in a minimum variation market. Specifically, the Commission requested information on (1) the percentage of stopped orders executed at the stop price, versus the percentage of such orders receiving a better price; (2) market depth, including a comparison of the size of stopped orders to the size of the opposite side of the quote and to any quote size imbalance, and including an analysis of the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer; (3) whether limit orders on the specialist's book were being bypassed due to the execution of stopped orders at a better price (and, to this end, the Commission requested that the NYSE conduct a one-day review of all book orders in the ten stocks receiving the greatest number of stops); and (4) specialist compliance with the pilot program's procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 13, 1992, November 5, 1992, and October 15, 1993, the Exchange submitted to the Commission monitoring reports regarding the amendments to Rule 116.30. The Commission believes that, although these monitoring reports provide certain useful information concerning the operation of the pilot program, the NYSE must provide further data, particularly about Rule 116.30's impact on limit orders on the specialist's book, before the Commission can fairly and comprehensively evaluate the NYSE's use of the pilot procedures. To allow such additional information to be gathered and reviewed, without compromising the benefit that investors might receive under Rule 116.30, as amended, the Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program until March 21, 1995. During this extension, the Commission expects the NYSE to respond fully to the concerns set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the October monitoring report indicates that approximately half of eligible orders (i.e., orders for 2,000 shares or less) stopped in minimum variation markets received price improvement. The Commission, therefore, believes that the pilot procedures provide a benefit to investors by offering the possibility of price improvement to customers whose orders are granted stops in minimum variation markets. According to the latest NYSE report, moreover, virtually all stopped orders were for 2,000 shares or less. In this respect, the amendments to Rule 116.30 should mainly affect small public customer orders, which the Commission envisioned could most benefit from professional handling by the specialist. During the pilot extension, the Commission requests that the NYSE continue to monitor the percentage of stopped orders that are for 2,000 shares or less. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

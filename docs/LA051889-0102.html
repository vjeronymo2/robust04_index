			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PEPPERDINE COACH THINKING OF COMEBACK  </P> <P> Dave Gorrie, who retired as Pepperdine's baseball coach last May, will be  inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Assn. Hall of Fame at the group's  national convention in San Francisco next January.  </P> <P> But he is not quite ready to be put on a shelf. He said that he is a candidate  to succeed Stan Morrison as the athletic director at UC Santa Barbara, his alma  mater, where he was the head baseball coach for 19 years. Morrison was recently  named head basketball coach at San Jose State.  </P> <P> Gorrie, who coached for 10 years at Pepperdine after leaving UC Santa Barbara,  said he may also return to coaching some day.  </P> <P> Gorrie said he retired because he "needed time off to sort things out."  </P> <P> "After 29 years you cease to see the forest for the trees; you get bogged down  in details. When one season melts into another year after year, I think you  sometimes cease to have improvement or growth."  </P> <P> He said that his year off from coaching has been "a very valuable period. I've  learned a lot of things. I've talked to other coaches about how to do things,  and I discovered I was doing some things very well and other things not well  enough. I also discovered some things about myself. So it's been good -- and  very refreshing."  </P> <P> Gorrie, 58, who still teaches physical education at Pepperdine and looks as  trim as anyone in his classes, said he is still "physically able to coach."  </P> <P> And he hasn't really been far away from baseball. Far from it.  </P> <P> He has been teaching hitting and pitching at a baseball school in Agoura,  advising coaches Gary Adams of UCLA and John Herbold of Cal State Los Angeles  and speaking at clinics.  </P> <P> He "might go back to coaching some place, sometime." But not at Pepperdine and  maybe not as a head coach.  </P> <P> "When you give up your position, that's it," he said. "Pepperdine has a very  fine young coach (Andy Lopez, former coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills) and a  good program."  </P> <P> He said that his return to coaching would probably be "at the college level. It  depends on the opportunity, but I'd make somebody a good assistant. I know what  he (would be) going through."  </P> <P> Gorrie has gone through plenty.  </P> <P> Born in Olney, Tex., he moved to Pasadena as a youngster and played baseball at  Pasadena High with Bob Lillis and Dick Williams, who became major league  managers.  </P> <P> He attended Pasadena City College and later UC Santa Barbara where he was a  star outfielder and top running back. A member of the UC Santa Barbara Athletic  Hall of Fame, he posted a slugging percentage of .688 in the 1953 season, still  a school record.  </P> <P> After college he spent three years as a Navy officer.  </P> <P> He began playing minor league ball in 1958 for the San Francisco Giants  organization. He was released by the Giants and caught on with the Athletics,  then in Kansas City. He played three seasons at Seminole, Okla.; Crowley, La.;  Columbia, S.C., and Rochester, Minn.  </P> <P> He said he was offered a contract to play with Portland in the Pacific Coast  League but decided that he was too old to reach the majors. And when UC Santa  Barbara offered him the job of head coach, he accepted.  </P> <P> "You always would like to know whether you could have done it (played in the  major leagues), but there were a limited number of jobs at the top and progress  was slow."  </P> <P> He said he hurt his chances of going to the majors by playing for UC Santa  Barbara until he graduated and then spending three years in the Navy. "I cut my  own throat."  </P> <P> Still, he was more than satisfied with college coaching. " You may not make as  much money as selling real estate or stocks and bonds, but it's been a helluva  good life."  </P> <P> Being a college baseball coach proved to be a helluva good life for him. At UC  Santa Barbara, his teams had a record of 355-397, and the Gauchos won a Pacific  Coast Athletic Assn. championship in 1972.  </P> <P> The good life got better at Pepperdine where his Waves were 409-202 in 10  seasons and earned six berths in National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  tournaments. His 1979 team went furthest, advancing to the College World Series  and winning three of four games before being eliminated by Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Baseball sometimes thinks of itself as a changeless sport, but it has changed  -- and not always for the better. Gorrie has seen the introduction of the  designated hitter, synthetic playing surfaces and aluminum bats, and he hopes  someone will do something to change aluminum bats so that they are less a  danger to pitchers.  </P> <P> A couple of seasons ago one of his pitchers, Tony Lewis, was seriously injured  when hit in the face by a line drive off an aluminum bat. Balls hit with  aluminum bats have more velocity and force than those hit with wooden bats.  </P> <P> Gorrie said Lewis suffered multiple fractures of his cheekbone. Although Lewis  recovered and played minor league ball last year, Gorrie said the pitcher "was  not very far from death" after being struck.  </P> <P> Gorrie said aluminum bats, used mostly at amateur levels of baseball, are "an  economic fact of life." Wooden bats crack easily; aluminum bats last almost  forever.  </P> <P> "But I hope (the aluminum type) will be adapted, purely from the standpoint of  the safety of pitchers." He said metal bats can generate such force that "it's  like a doggone shooting gallery sometimes. We don't want to get anybody killed  out there.  </P> <P> "If an aluminum bat were more like a wooden bat in weight, you couldn't  manipulate it as easily and generate all that speed. Players would have to  learn to become better hitters, and pitchers would have half a chance."  </P> <P> Gorrie thinks that college baseball has changed. "I'm not sure the best teams  are any better than the ones of years ago, but I know there are more and more  good teams."  </P> <P> Players are generally better, he said. "They have more of an opportunity to be  better; they are playing more.  </P> <P> "They have more access to good coaching, and there is so much more sharing of  information. They have the opportunity to be stronger because of weight  training. They can see themselves (in action) with the advent of videotape.  They have every reason to be better."  </P> <P> Gorrie thinks that the one thing that hasn't changed in baseball is the  attitudes of players.  </P> <P> "I don't notice any difference at all. Some players know it all; some are very  receptive -- and that's the way it's always been. I know society has changed to  a degree, but I don't think human nature has changed.  </P> <P> "I find the players as enjoyable to work with as they were 29 years ago."  </P></p>

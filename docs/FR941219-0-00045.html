			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat for the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt is justified even though the 1992 and 1993 summer tow-net and fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> midwater trawl abundance indices show increased abundance levels. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the best available information, the delta smelt has not recovered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and remains vulnerable to a variety of threats. Delta smelt were listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as threatened because the species was likely to become an endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of its range. A species has recovered if the status of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (50 CFR 402.02, 424.11(d)(2)). Listing remains appropriate under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act until long-term population abundance indices remain at high levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the population is widespread throughout the Estuary for a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. One or two years of high abundance levels is not sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure recovery of an annual species such as the delta smelt. Specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery criteria are being developed in the recovery planning process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 19:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned with the Service's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``single species approach'', whereas other individuals were worried that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's water quality standards, having been based on eight estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicator species, were too broad because species other than the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt would benefit from the standards. There was concern how delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt recovery would be coordinated with the recovery of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened and endangered estuarine fish species (e.g., winter-run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chinook and Sacramento splittail), the salt marsh harvest mouse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reithrodontomys raviventris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), California clapper rail ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rallus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longirostris obsoletus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Suisun Marsh management in general, and with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other species outside the Estuary area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of critical habitat and identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent element for protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the delta smelt may incidentally benefit other native estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Providing variable salinity regimes will facilitate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of the Estuary to its natural state. The Service does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this critical habitat designation, or due to the implementation of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Delta smelt recovery will be coordinated with the habitat and water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality needs of other fish and other marsh and wetland species in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team was formed in 1993 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the Estuary native fishes in general. The recovery team will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the population decline of delta smelt and other native Estuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishes that ultimately may require active management to restore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sustainable populations. The recovery team has developed a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recovery Plan that has analyzed the needs and recommended management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions for the delta smelt, longfin smelt, Sacramento splittail, green  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sturgeon, spring-run chinook salmon, late fall-run chinook salmon and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> San Joaquin fall-run chinook salmon. Winter-run chinook salmon also was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in recovery planning for the delta smelt, using recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed by the Winter-run Recovery Team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies that propose projects that may affect the salt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marsh harvest mouse and the California clapper rail, both listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered under the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts, must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult with the Service under section 7 of the Federal Act. All listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species have equal protection under the State and Federal Acts and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service cannot develop solutions for one species that may jeopardize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 20:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter claimed that the Service misrepresented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1992) by stating that delta smelt grow faster in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixing zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is puzzled by the assertion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1992) was misrepresented in the revised proposed rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt critical habitat. The Service stated: ``[w]hen the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone is located in a broad geographic area with extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meters), high densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including delta smelt, grow rapidly.'' (Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992, Sweetnam and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stevens 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1992) stated ``[T]he mixing currents keep the larvae  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulating with the abundant zooplankton also found here [in the mixing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zone] (Orsi and Knutson 1979; Siegfried  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1979; Stevens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985).

The Service has not knowingly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misrepresented information, and does not believe any misrepresentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred in this instance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 21:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One respondent commented that delta smelt spawn north  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Suisun Bay in Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough and their tributaries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and believed this fact contradicted the Service's assertion that delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt spawn upstream of the mixing zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough, and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tributaries are upstream of the area where mixing between freshwater and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salt water occurs in wetter water years. In dryer water years, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone may move upstream as far upstream as the City of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento in late summer, and these sloughs may become saline. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt were to spawn late (i.e., July or August), they would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably seek areas other than the sloughs to spawn in freshwater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 22:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters at the public hearings suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Service use hatcheries to produce enough delta smelt to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the population stable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service believes using hatcheries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagate fish, including delta smelt, should not be a substitute for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat protection and restoration. Dr. Moyle presented testimony in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (Natural Heritage Institute 1992) summarizing the work of Hilborn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1992), which explained several reasons why hatcheries are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial to the long-term maintenance of fisheries. His points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included (1) though initially successful, hatchery effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreases after a few years; (2) hatchery fish often do poorly in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wild; (3) artificial production poses a threat to the maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wild fish; (4) hatchery fish dilute the naturally adapted genes of wild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish; and (5) hatcheries provide an excuse for habitat loss. Assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hatcheries could be used to stabilize delta smelt populations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propagated fish would require an environment that provides ample food,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low levels of toxic compounds, and low entrainment losses (Moyle and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Herbold 1989). Reliance on hatcheries would not adhere to one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary purposes of the Act, which is to conserve the ecosystem(s) upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which listed species depend (16 USC 1531(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 23:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked why the Service stated that delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt are more likely to be entrained in river channels than when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, when there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no relationship between salvage and subsequent delta smelt abundance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter noted that entrainment also occurs in Pacific Gas and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric (PG &amp; E) cooling water diversions downstream from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confluence of the two rivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He was  sent to Minnesota's triple-A affiliate in Portland, Ore., in July and was not  recalled.  </P> <P> Hill and Venable have until Dec. 19 to accept or reject arbitration. If they do  not accept it, the Angels may negotiate with them until Jan. 8. If they do not  sign by that date, they would be unable to re-sign with the Angels until May 1.  HELENE ELLIOTT  </P></p>

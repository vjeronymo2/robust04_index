			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Irish PM's pay increase raises issues of state The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, yesterday came under attack from opposition politicians over a proposed 17 per cent pay rise which, they said, would make him the second-highest paid head of government in Europe while he has one of the smallest countries to run, Reuter reports from Dublin. The row broke out shortly after the resolution of a parliamentary dispute over top legal appointments between Mr Reynolds's Fianna Fail party and its junior Labour party coalition partner. The dispute had briefly raised the prospect of an early general election. The attack on Mr Reynolds's pay increase was headed by Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party. 'We have a situation where our prime minister is the second-highest paid in Europe, while we are one of the smallest countries. He is now paid more than (the British prime minister) John Major, who has a job which involves dealing with a population between 15 and 20 times as big as the one for which Mr Reynolds is responsible.' The pay increase would give Mr Reynolds, whose country has a population of 3.5m, an annual salary of around IPounds 100,000 (Pounds 99,240), compared with the DM442,000 (Pounds 181,000) earned by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, head of a nation of 75m people and Europe's best-paid political leader. Mr Bruton tabled a motion calling for the pay increase to be postponed but it was unlikely to be adopted by parliament, political sources said. Earlier, the Labour party leader, Mr Dick Spring, had raised the prospect of an election, barely two years after the ruling coalition was formed, by objecting to the naming of the attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. However, the government said, a few hours before parliament was to end a 103-day summer recess, that it would legislate to change the way top legal appointments are made. This row had been seen as a trial of strength between Labour, whose popularity has been slipping in opinion polls, and its dominant government partner which might have held up an Anglo-Irish campaign to bring peace to Northern Ireland. Mr Spring had said that the Labour party wanted to be consulted and involved in such top appointments. It had put forward alternative candidates whom Mr Reynolds refused to accept. The dispute was smoothed over when it was announced that the government had accepted the recommendations of a parliamentary committee set up to mediate in the crisis and had said legislative changes would be needed. The statement said a new High Court president would be named when the changes had been brought into law, but gave no further details. The announcement ended weeks of wrangling over the appointment, which had raised Fine Gael's hopes of ending Fianna Fail's grip on power.</p>

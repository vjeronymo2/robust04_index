			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nestle wants bite at Polish firm NESTLE, the international confectionery and foods company, has offered to pay Dollars 40m for an 80 per cent share in Poland's last state-owned chocolate producer. Nestle's move, which includes a promise to invest a further Dollars 30m in the Goplana plant in Poznan, is designed to block the establishment of a joint venture between the state and E. D. &amp; F. Man, the UK sugar and cocoa broker. This venture, which is awaiting a go-ahead from Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, would see E. D. &amp; F. Man putting in Dollars 37.5m with the state contributing the Goplana plant. This would leave both sides with 47 per cent of the equity. The balance would be owned by the Goplana workforce. E. D. &amp; F. Man and Elite Industries formed a joint marketing company with Goplana in 1991, designed to smooth the way for the merger.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Delors urges democracy on Africa MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called on African leaders to support democratic principles which he said could provide an engine for change in developing countries. Speaking to Senegal's national assembly in Dakar, Mr Delors said further democratisation was essential if African countries were to meet the economic challenges ahead. Mr Delors is on his first visit as commission president to sub-Saharan Africa. Commission officials see the four-day trip as an opportunity to reaffirm the links between the EC and Africa now that the potential for confrontation between superpowers on the African continent is diminishing. The end of the Cold War has also allowed leading donors such as the EC to link development aid more explicitly to democratic and macro-economic improvements. Like IMF and World Bank aid programmes, the EC's latest five-year Ecu12bn (Pounds 8.34bn) aid package for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states includes structural adjustment funds. That element of the programme, which began last year, ties donations to economic developments in ACP countries. But Mr Delors sought to distinguish the EC structural adjustment fund from IMF and World Bank aid by stressing the human element of what he called the 'new conscience of development'. Economic initiatives such as privatisation were important, he said, but they should not be pursued at the expense of public services.</p>

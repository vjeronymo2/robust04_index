Claudio Signorile, Biagio  Marzo, and other PSI [Italian Socialist Party] deputies and  leaders in Puglia are convinced that they have been, and some of  them are talking about "red Khomeynism" and "Stalinist methods,"  threatening to take the matter to law. One curious,  paradoxical, and in its own way ruthless, aspect is that the  person who drew up the dossier against Signorile and passed it  on to the disciplinary board was Fabrizio Cicchitto, [PSI  Secretary] Del Turco's board member in Puglia, for many years  Signorile's most faithful ally on the party's left wing.    The affair arose out of the setting up, by Signorile and  company, of the Federative Socialist Union, which Cicchitto  claims is a front for an attempt on the part of many of those  involved to stand for the forthcoming election in a deal with  the center and Forza Italia, against the progressive alliance  that the PSI has joined. Cicchitto maintains that this  "automatically" places them outside the party.    Menchinelli, chairman of the PSI disciplinary board,  emphasizes, however, that there is no question of expulsion.  The reason is simple: Those concerned have not applied to join  Del Turco's born-again PSI, and "As long as they consider  themselves de facto outside the party, no action can be taken  against them."</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Perilous ascent from the pit: After last month's economic battering, the Amato government is coming to grips with Italy's problems Quite suddenly the government of Prof Giuliano Amato has recovered its nerve after being so rudely battered by last month's lira devaluation. The language of disaster has receded as the floating lira has stabilised amid calmer foreign exchange markets. The 1993 budget, essential for the government's international credibility and commitment to tackle Italy's public finances, has passed its stiffest test in parliament, and the fragile four-party government coalition is holding. In response, the Bank of Italy lowered the discount rate 1 percentage point to 14 per cent on Monday, and the exceptionally high rates charged by the banks to industry have begun to ease. 'We have been right at the bottom of the pit,' says Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian Treasury minister. 'Now we are grappling our way out and are just holding onto the edge.' As a professional banker, he is too cautious to believe Italy's financial crisis has been resolved. The overall economic backdrop of Italy struggling to meet the targets of convergence laid down by the Maastricht treaty remains uncertain. No date has been fixed for the lira's re-entry into the European Monetary System; the inflationary effects of the September devaluation (at present 15 per cent against the D-Mark) will take time to filter through the economy; and the worst of recession may still come. However, an important turning point has been reached. The 54-year-old Socialist prime minister has devoted all his energy during his four months in office to formulating economic policy and getting it accepted by parliament. The emphasis now shifts towards the execution of this policy, while fleshing out the complex details of the government's ambitious privatisation programme. This may be a more leisurely challenge, but no less difficult. All the more so because both the government and the political establishment have to address the three other priority areas outlined by Prof Amato when he took office - electoral and institutional reform, cleaning up public morality and the fight against organised crime. While attention has focused on Italy's financial crisis, the country has been going through some profound changes. The postwar structure of political parties is breaking up and new alliances are in the air. The Christian Democrats and Socialists, the two principal partners of the present four-party coalition, risk disintegration if they fail to re-establish their credibility. The unity of the Italian state is being challenged by a revolt in the north, championed by the populist Lombard League which opposes paying taxes to support what it views as corrupt government in Rome and an unproductive south. At the same time, the role of the state is set to undergo a sea-change: welfare benefits are being cut while the public sector is about to be slimmed down, partly through privatisation, and removed from the ravages of political patronage. 'Economic reform is moving faster in this turbulence than political change. This is because everyone has been forced to confront the problem of our national debt,' observes a leading Italian economist. Indeed, debt has been at the root of the current turmoil. At more than 10.5 per cent of GDP, it is nearly three times the European Community average. Interest charges this year will be the equivalent of the entire 1992 budget deficit, now projected at L160,000bn (Pounds 74bn). From the outset Prof Amato has said bluntly that there is no alternative to austerity and a fundamental shake-up of public spending, whatever the complexion of the government. His message has sunk home. The political consensus on the broad lines of economic and financial policy is much greater than might appear from the statements of those outside the government. The absence of credible alternatives has enabled an otherwise weak government to survive with a 16-seat majority in the lower house of parliament. Proposals to reform pensions, health, local administration and the civil service were approved last week in record time. Although the government resorted to votes of confidence to accelerate the debate, the opposition was centred far more on the limits placed on the legislative role of parliament than on the content of the reforms. Together, these reforms will provide a third of the extra L93,000bn needed to hold the public sector deficit in 1993 at its current level. According to Prof Franco Reviglio, the budget minister, this is the first attempt to incorporate structural changes in spending into the annual budget. The success of the reforms will depend on an improvement in Italy's poorly motivated and exceptionally bureaucratic civil service. More immediate will be the impact of increased income, corporate and property taxes, spending cuts and the freeze on public sector employment expected to be approved by parliament within the next two weeks. These measures will account for the bulk of the remaining revenue in the 1993 budget. The most controversial reform is the government's move to crack down on tax evasion by the 6.1m people classified as self-employed by taxing them on computerised estimates of real earnings. The move would, on average, double the earnings on which the self-employed would be liable for tax. To make the point, the Finance Ministry has leaked details of a study of 62,000 tax returns of which 90 per cent were shown to be unacceptably low. One-third declared taxable income of less than L7.2m. The proposed 'minimum tax' has provoked outraged protest from those affected. But wider public sympathy could be limited at a time when everyone is being asked to make sacrifices. The revolt against the minimum tax has thrown a further unpredictable element into the fortunes of the two main parties in government, the Christian Democrats and Socialists. The degree of their public discredit and internal division is profound and accelerating. The worst damage has been done by the eight-month-old investigations of Milan magistrates into municipal corruption on public works contracts, which has sparked a countrywide drive to uncover illegal funding of political parties. Now at least 70 members of parliament, mainly Christian Democrat and Socialist but also members of the former Communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and Republicans, are under investigation for corruption and bribe-taking. The picture which is emerging is that of systematic corruption at the local, regional and national levels, whereby a high percentage of all public works contracts over the past decade were handed out on the basis of rigged deals, with 5 per cent commissions going into the pockets of the main political parties. Political commentators estimate that L4,000bn a year is being raised in this fashion, supporting some 80,000 bureaucrats in the infrastructure of the main parties. The corruption investigations will increase pressure on the parties to find more transparent forms of finance, to reduce radically the numbers on their payroll and to curb patronage politics at the state's expense. Equally important has been the confirmation by Palermo magistrates of what has long been suspected - the Christian Democrats have enjoyed close links with the mafia, tacitly permitting organised crime to flourish in southern Italy in return for votes. The discredited nomenklatura of the Christian Democrat party, epitomised by stalwarts such as Mr Arnaldo Forlani and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister and supreme deal-maker for three decades, has been forced to the side lines this month. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the new secretary-general, has promised to clean the stables and find a new direction. But the party's perennial appeal as an anti-communist front has evaporated with the end of the cold war. Mr Bettino Craxi still clings to the leadership of the Socialists but he has been seriously weakened by the corruption scandal in his fiefdom of Milan. He is being challenged by Mr Claudio Martelli, the ambitious justice minister and Craxi's former protege. The party could split at any moment. Both parties were savaged by voters in last month's regional elections in the northern city of Mantua. Voters there gave more than a third of their support to Mr Bossi's Lombard League. The league is still riding the wave of anti-Rome sentiment in the north despite some erratic gestures, including an unsuccessful call for its supporters to boycott the purchase of Treasury bills, which the party sees as financing irresponsible public spending. Some politicians such as Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican party, believe the only way to counter the Lombard's appeal in the north and centre of the country is to form a new alliance or alliances across the traditional parties. This is already beginning to take shape in talks involving Mr Mario Segni, the reformist Christian Democrat, Mr Martelli and his Socialist supporters, elements in the PDS and the Republicans. Mr Segni and Mr La Malfa, both sons of prominent politicians, are among the most visible of the new generation of Italian politicians. Their claims to lead the next government depend in good measure on the success or failure of Prof Amato. Once the 1993 budget is finalised next month, the extent to which political alliances have shifted could become clearer. But the real problem confronting Italy's politicians is how long the present government, which relies on two discredited parties, should be allowed to remain in office. On his own admission, Prof Amato sees his as a transitional administration with a twofold task: to establish a framework for restoring Italy's finances, allowing convergence with the rest of the EC; and to initiate reform of the unworkable system of proportional representation. A 60-strong commission, made up of members of the two houses of parliament, has begun working on proposals for electoral reform, but these will not be ready before next April. The pace is being forced by the prospect of a series of referenda on electoral reforms which will go ahead next year if approved by the constitutional court. To hold elections before the reforms are in place makes little sense. Equally, the parties have no funds at present to fight elections. However, the longer the Amato government stays in power, the more it risks seeing the base of its political support - the Christian Democrats and Socialists - fragmenting. For this reason there is likely to be an increasing emphasis on political change in the coming weeks.</p>

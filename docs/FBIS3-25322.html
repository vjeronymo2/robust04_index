			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazilian General Lelio Goncalves da Silva,  commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Mozambique, has  described as absurd, unfounded, and unjust the remarks made by  Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo]. Ngonhamo has said that the United Nations  will be to blame, if war resumes in this country.    Gen. Lelio da Silva told NOTICIAS that the United Nations  was  invited by the government and Renamo to supervise the  implementation of the Mozambican peace process, so Gen.  Ngonhamo's remarks make no sense whatever. On 7 February, Gen.  Ngonhamo said that a resumption of the war would have to be  blamed on the United Nations, and in particular on UN Special  Representative Aldo Ajello, who has not known how to be  impartial when he has mediated in a bid to settle certain  differences.</p>

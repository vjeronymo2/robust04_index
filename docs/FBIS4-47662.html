			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the RPF in Mulindi on 30 April] </F>   [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, brings to the  notice of the press and the international community at large the  following:    1. That the massacres currently going on in Rwanda are  designed to exterminate a certain section of the population of  this country. The massacres are carried out by a clique of  murderers constituted of extreme groups like the Presidential  Guard, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic], MRND  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development]  militias and some elements in the government army. In less than  three weeks, since the accident of the 6th April 1994, the  murderous clique has killed more than 200,000 people of  different ethnic groups.    2. That the massacres have been long planned by the  high-ranking government officials of the then Habyarimana  government, the training and arming of CDR and MRND militias  were clear signs of the plan. This plan was known by people  inside and outside the country even before the signing of the  Arusha peace agreement.    3. That during the Arusha peace negotiations the extremist  clique was busy [words indistinct] confusing innocent citizens  as the murderous group was busy planning activities, including  the restoration of radio [word indistinct] for propaganda  purposes. At the same time, the group was making it impossible  for the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions  (?agreed on under) the Arusha agreement.    4. The RPF appeals to all countries that have been following  and are assisting to carry out the Arusha peace negotiations to  condemn openly and without reservations the massacres in Rwanda  and to refrain from giving any attention or assistance to the  self-imposed [break in transmission] instead, such countries  should give assistance to the (?threatened) innocent people.    5. The RPF has noted that some countries and nongovernmental  organizations have already given assistance to the victims of  war. Some others have not. It is sad to note that the French  Government has (?responded) and given audience to the  self-imposed government in Rwanda. Does this mean that the  French Government is supporting the killing done in Rwanda, and  by the people who make up this government?    6. The RPF wishes to remind the international community of  the following:    a. That the international community has obligations and  responsibilities toward human beings and life should not be  destroyed to this extent while the international community keeps  quiet about it;    b. the RPF condemns any country or organization that [words  indistinct] or recognition to the self-imposed government in  Rwanda and condemns anything done by any country to promote the  interests of this government as regards international relations;    c. The RPF appeals to the international community to  dissassociate themselves from this government and even to extend  asylum to those who took part in the killings [as heard];    d. The RPF requests the international community not to lose  hope because of the open threat that the killers will continue  to murder and kidnap people;    e. the RPF wishes to extend its sincere thanks and  appreciation to all countries, international organizations and  individuals who have shown concern for the plight of the  Rwandese people during these difficult times.    Done at Mulindi this 30th day of April 1994.    Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, chairman of the RPF.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Big fines for Paris insider trading FRANCE'S biggest insider trading trial ended yesterday when a Paris court imposed fines of up to FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) on seven businessmen and confiscated FFr30m in illicit profits from Pechiney's 1988 purchase of Triangle, owner of American National Can. But the court acquitted Mr Alain Boublil, a former aide to the late prime minister Pierre Beregovoy, giving him 'the benefit of the doubt' that he tipped off others to the fact that state-owned Pechiney, the metals and packaging group, was about to make its US purchase. The court concluded that Mr Samir Traboulsi, a Lebanese-born financier, on whom it imposed a two-year suspended sentence and a FFr25m fine, had other contacts with France's socialist establishment that could have made him the chief conduit of the leak. Mr Traboulsi is to appeal, as is Mr Max Theret, founder of the FNAC record and book shops, who received a similar two-year suspended sentence, a fine of FFr2.5m and confiscation of FFr8.5m in profits that he and an associate made on the deal. The judgment comes on the eve of France's large-scale programme of privatisation. The candidates include Pechiney, whose management was never implicated in the 1988 affair. The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the watchdog of the Paris stock exchange, has held up the Pechiney investigation as a model of co-operation among international regulators. The US Securities and Exchange Commission detected a wave of foreign purchases of Triangle shares in mid-November 1988, when the US stock was trading at around Dollars 10 a share and just before Pechiney, with the knowledge of Triangle's top executives, launched a Dollars 56 a share bid. US regulators passed their suspicions to the COB, who also drew on information from the London Stock Exchange authorities. In all, some FFr45m in illicit profits were estimated to have been made. Mr Beregovoy, who was finance minister at the time of the Pechiney-Triangle deal, took the unusual step of making the COB dossier public in February 1989 before transferring it for prosecutors to act on. Last May Mr Beregovoy shot himself, shortly after he lost the elections and after he had appeared, in private, before Pechiney investigators. One of the main beneficiaries of the Pechiney-Triangle dealing was the late Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat who died in 1989 after being indicted for insider trading. A key element in the prosecution case was a lunch on November 13 1988 at a well known Lebanese-run restaurant in Paris which was hosted by Mr and Mrs Beregovoy to celebrate their wedding anniversary and to which Mr Pelat, Mr Traboulsi and Mr Boublil were all invited. In his defence, Mr Traboulsi maintained that he would not be so stupid as to jeopardise, by trading on his own account, his FFr60m commission from Triangle for acting as official intermediary between Pechiney and Triangle. However, the court said it was 'certain' that Mr Traboulsi had tipped off a Swiss-based Lebanese financier, Mr Charbel Ghanem, who was himself stripped of FFr21m of his profits, as well as getting a suspended prison term and a fine.</p>

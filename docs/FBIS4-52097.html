			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Over a hundred protesters  gathered outside the Japanese Embassy Friday to demand the  immediate dismissal of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano.    "Apologize, Repent," chanted demonstrators belonging to the  Association of Pacific War Victims and Families.    A letter from the group delivered to the embassy said  Nagano's comments revealed the Japanese Government's two-faced  view of history and constituted a threat to peace in Asia.    The just-appointed justice minister with a long career in  the  military enraged Japan's Asian neighbors when he said his  country was not the aggressor in World War II but a party  dedicated to freeing Asia from European colonialism.    He also said he didn't believe the massacre of Chinese by  Japanese soldiers in "the rape of Nanjing" was true.    The comments instantly touched a nerve in South Korea, which  still chafes at more than three decades of Japanese colonial  rule before liberation came at the end of the Second World War.    "Retract Nagano's comments and immediately fire him," the  association said in a statement, adding that Japan should  suspend its attempts at remilitarization through constitutional  revision and clear up all questions about its past by 1995.    "If these terms are not fulfilled, we will start with our  neighbors in Southeast Asia who suffered from the Pacific War a  campaign against buying Japanese products," the statement said.    The dissident-led National Alliance for Democracy and  Unification in Korea issued a similar statement, demanding legal  and systematic compensation for victims of the war.    "Nagano's words reflect the Japanese Government's political  intention to abort its admission of war crimes and legal,  systematic compensation measures," the alliance said.</p>

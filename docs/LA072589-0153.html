			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OIL FIRMS ACCUSED OF USING ALASKA SPILL AS EXCUSE TO INCREASE PROFITS  </P> <P> Major oil companies took advantage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska to  increase profits, Massachusetts Energy Secretary Sharon Pollard said today in a  report investigating a 36-cent per gallon wholesale gasoline price hike.  </P> <P> But the Massachusetts Petroleum Council insisted that the price increases  stemmed from higher production costs that had been working their way through  the system since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries production  cutback of November, 1988. The council also said that changes in the gasoline  formula mandated by environmental officials also played a key role in the price  increases.  </P> <P> Pollard's 38-page report, based on a series of public hearings, charged that  the March spill of millions of gallons of crude oil in Alaska's Prince William  Sound did not cause a supply disruption sufficient to justify the rapid and  sudden gasoline price hike.  </P> <P> It charged that retail service station operators generally did not share in the  profits from the soaring gasoline prices. And the report charged the new  environmental standards were responsible for at most an additional 1 to 3 cents  per gallon.  </P></p>

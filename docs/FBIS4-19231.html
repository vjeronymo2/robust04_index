			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by </F> Edith Heller; place and date not given: "Above All, I Expect  Partnership"]    [Text] [Heller] Is your German visit to be considered an  expression of the continuity of Poland's German policy?    [Pawlak] I think one must always seek ways of expanding  cooperation. The trade deficit with our biggest trade partner,  Germany, has been causing us problems lately. Balanced  cooperation is very important to us, and we hope the necessary  balance will be achieved not through restrictions, but through  new forms of cooperation.    [Heller] In Brussels, you suggested a "Partnership for  Development" as a parallel to Partnership for Peace. What do  you expect from the Germans?    [Pawlak] Above all, partner-like relations and an active  search for common interests. Balanced advantages on both sides  help overcome obstacles and bring the two countries' economies  closer together. In this way, Poland's maneuvering space in the  process of rapprochement between our countries also becomes  bigger. On the other hand, as soon as a greater imbalance  occurs, problems begin.    [Heller] Apart from a trade deficit, the Polish statistics  also reveal an increase in the Polish National Bank's foreign  currency reserves. If every German who visited Poland last year  had spent 100 German marks, the deficit would have been quickly  paid off.    [Pawlak] I trust the European Union's [EU] statistics, and  these show a clear deficit. But that can be compensated by a  reasonable level of trade between border areas. However, it is  an oversimplification to suggest that everyone who crosses our  border should spend so many marks. Instead, we should  concentrate on those enterprises that actually determine the  economic situation. Specific consideration and activity can  easily form the nucleus of our economic cooperation. Therefore,  this cooperation is useful because it permits direct contacts  between any people, and thus creates a climate of practical  cooperation.    [Heller] It is a well-known fact that as head of the Polish  Government, you drive a Polonez car. During your visit here  have you shown an interest in other makes of car?    [Pawlak] I am really an auto engineer. I was interested in  cars long before I was interested in politics. My side trip to  Stuttgart will also be a reminder of my first long trip to  Germany. Generally speaking, we are interested in cooperation,  especially the kind of cooperation that involves investments on  Polish territory. Investments by large significant firms, such  as Volkswagen in Poznan, show that it is worth investing in  Poland. I think a similar investment by Mercedes is also  feasible. We are concerned about creating new jobs, and already  have tried-and-tested contacts that make it easier to sell  Polish products on third markets.    [Heller] Waiting times on the German-Polish border are  getting longer and longer because of the increased goods and  personal traffic. Can Poland afford to be so difficult to enter?    [Pawlak] If that were merely a Polish-German problem, we  would have surely solved it already. But we are dealing with a  peripheral EU border, as well as heavy transit traffic toward  the East. In the immediate future we will concentrate on  developing two transit routes -- the  Swiecko-Poznan-Warsaw-Terespol route, which continues via Minsk  to Moscow; and the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow route, which connects  Saxony and Ukraine. Accordingly, as far as goods traffic is  concerned, we are going to expand the border crossing points at  Swiecko (Frankfurt-Oder) and Zgorzelec (Goerlitz), and later the  one at Olszyna (Forst). The modern terminal in Swiecko should  be ready this year. But there is also visible progress at those  crossing points used for local border traffic. The  modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin railroad line should also be  completed this year. Despite all the economic problems, these  projects are very important for us.    [Heller] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel wants to offer  the Baltic countries association agreements with the EU similar  to the one Poland has already concluded. How does Poland view  this matter?    [Pawlak] Poland wants to play an active role in this part of  Europe. The inclusion of the Baltic countries in the European  integration process is of major significance to us. Following  the admission of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland to the EU,  general interest in the Balkan region will increase, and Poland  will lie in the center of this new EU zone.    [Heller] Will the treaty on good-neighborly relations with  Lithuania also contain a guarantee that Lithuania will receive  support in its efforts to join the EU?    [Pawlak] The treaty with Lithuania concerns our mutual  relations, and has nothing to do with multilateral agreements.  It is the last link in the chain of basic treaties with all our  neighbors. There were a few problems with assessing our common  past, but these have been overcome.    [Heller] Do you fear the emergence of a new Berlin-Moscow  axis? How else can one explain Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy's  proposal to expand the "Weimar Triangle" by including Russia in  it?    [Pawlak] If one looks at the map, one sees that Warsaw lies  on the line between Berlin and Moscow, and it seems quite normal  to me that we are interested in being included in these  contacts. There are exciting prospects here, especially in the  economic sphere, for example the gas pipeline that will lead  from Russia to Germany via Poland. Such enterprises show that  one must seek concrete new solutions, without adhering to  symbols. The problems that have to be solved lie in the  economic, legal, and financial spheres.    [Heller] Do you think it really lies in Poland's interests  to expand a structure like the "Weimar Triangle," that joins  Warsaw to Bonn, by including other partners in it?    [Pawlak] I will let others deal with such purely political  concepts. I am interested in practical aspects. We have so  many problems that we can employ a really large number of people  in solving them. Political contacts are important, but lasting  foundations are laid by means of economic cooperation and  interpersonal contacts.    [Heller] Your voters expect a lot of changes in Poland.  Other people fear the opposite, a return to the old  relationships. What has changed since your Peasant Party and  the Democratic Left Alliance took over the government?    [Pawlak] Our economic performance for the first quarter of  1994 is very significant. Inflation has reached its lowest  point in seven years, and output has risen by 10 percent. That  shows that the resolutions we adopted at the end of 1983 are  correct. The first decision we made was to concentrate on the  economy and give up political rhetoric. The second decision was  to concentrate social aid on those groups of people with the  lowest incomes. That led to an increase in income tax. At the  same time, we introduced tax concessions for investments.    [Heller] These changes represent a shift in emphasis rather  than an adjustment of policy.    [Pawlak] Basically, we have drawn conclusions from the  development of recent years. We want an evolutionary  development, without shocks and sudden changes. It is also  important for us to expand the social framework of the reforms  by easing the burdens and supporting the lowest income groups.  In addition, we want to include the broadest possible  cross-section of society in the process of change. Only in this  way will it be possible to implement the changes in a democratic  way. My government's third concern is to rationalize the use of  the resources at our disposal. An example is the draft law on  the duty to invite tenders when spending public funds. All in  all, our objectives are democracy, a social market economy, and  a respectable position for Poland in the family of free peoples.</p>

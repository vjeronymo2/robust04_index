			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Snags for Italian poll reform LAST - MINUTE changes by both Italy's senate and chamber of deputies threaten to disrupt carefully agreed proposals for electoral reform. Both houses have worked with unusual speed to approve new electoral reform laws and so enable legislation to be in place before the summer parliamentary recess at the beginning of August. But this week, first the chamber of deputies and then the senate endorsed unusual proposals which risk being considered unconstitutional  - or being rejected when the laws are sent from one house to another in parliament for endorsement. In both cases the unexpected proposals could cause a delay, as the senate has to approve the chamber's laws and vice versa in a parliamentary process where both houses possess equal powers. The unexpected proposal from the senate was for a limit of three legislatures, or 15 years, on the time that any one person could remain either a deputy or a senator. If passed in both houses, this would disqualify a high proportion of the best known figures in every party and would remove 94 Christian Democrats alone. More polemical has been the majority decision in the chamber of deputies to allow Italians overseas to have parliamentary representation with 25 seats in the lower house. Some saw this as an astute attempt to sabotage the reform law introducing a first-past-the-post-system for 75 per cent of the lower house. Since agreement was reached on partial introduction of an British-style voting system, a number of deputies have had second thoughts on the wisdom of excluding a second round of voting where no candidate has achieved an absolute majority. Encouraging the senate to pick holes or make changes in the chamber of deputies' proposals would allow the debate to be reopened. As it is, a sizeable portion of parliament is happy to see the electoral reform process slowed in order to prevent elections in the autumn. Constitutional lawyers are arguing in any event that the introduction of the principle of overseas members of parliament is unconstitutional. The neo-fascist MSI, which sponsored the idea, claimed this was a genuine attempt to give a parliamentary voice to Italians abroad. At present 2,020,551 are registered as living abroad, 1.3m of them in Europe. But the overall figure eligible could be double this. It is unclear whether the 25 seats would be added to the existing 630 in the chamber or found from the 473 allocated for the new first-past-the-post system. The remaining 157 seats will be won on the basis of the old proportional representation system. The reform proposals being sent to the senate envisage voters with two slips  -one for the majority vote and the other for the 25 per cent proportional representation. For the latter, the electorate will be allowed to vote for a party list and state one preference candidate.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Poor marks for EC external trade practices  -William Dullforce analyses Gatt's report on the European Community THE GENERAL Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's review of the European Community's trade policies, released yesterday, finds a striking contradiction between the EC's internal and external behaviour. Internally, the Community is eliminating discrimination. It is creating a single market, in which the free movement of goods, services and capital will be assured and internal barriers to trade will disappear. Externally, in contrast, the Community has been pursuing highly discriminating practices, according to the Gatt secretariat. It complains that the EC has put in place a 'complex hierarchy' of preferential trading arrangements and built up a network of bilateral agreements with other countries, which introduce 'strong elements of discrimination' into the multilateral trading system. In the most outspoken report it has published since it started reviewing national trade policies in 1989, Gatt also raises several questions about the Community's institutional framework. One concerns the transfer of national power to Brussels, specifically to the EC Commission. Gatt points to the lack of a statutory independent body at the Community level to act as a watchdog in trade matters, and it notes that the European parliament plays only an advisory role in trade policy. The system under which the Commission proposes and councils of 12 ministers dispose favours 'sector-specific views' against overall economic or trade considerations, when policies are formulated, the Gatt secretariat says. Coal, steel, cars and semi-conductors are cited as examples of the EC's penchant for pursuing individual industries' interests separately. But the most glaring case has probably been in agriculture, where decisions by the 12 farm ministers effectively prevented the Uruguay Round international trade liberalisation negotiations from ending on schedule last December. The Round has demonstrated the difficulties EC member states experience in coming to a common negotiating position and the inflexibility inherent in its decision-making system once a common position has been agreed, Gatt says. Summing up its findings, Gatt considers that, as the world's largest exporter and importer, it is time that the EC matched its internal integration with 'a parallel lifting of its external barriers and closer adherence to the fundamental principles underlying the multilateral trading system'. The Gatt report is by no means totally disparaging about EC external policies. The Community is defended against the charge that its drive towards a single, internal market is creating a 'fortress Europe'. Brussels has not raised protectionist barriers overall in the last three years; its trading partners are sharing in the stimulation given to internal economic growth through the spillover into import demand. Tariff barriers against imports are moderate at a trade-weighted average of 5.1 per cent and almost all industrial tariffs are 'bound' by an undertaking not to increase them. However, Gatt considers that the value of these tariff bindings has been eroded by the EC's propensity to strike bilateral agreements 'targeted against the most competitive foreign suppliers' among its trading partners. EC textile and clothing manufacturers are shielded by 19 bilateral agreements under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and by 'self-restraint' deals with exporters in Mediterranean countries. Some 50 bilateral export restraint accords are in place. The most notorious concern Japanese exports of cars, machinery, electrical and electronic equipment to the EC but South Korea now appears to rank second with agreements on frozen squid, footwear and video-tape recorders. The EC Commission told the Gatt that it was 'not aware' of some of these measures. Information about the parties involved, the trade covered, the degree of restriction, the duration or regional application of these agreements within the EC is limited, Gatt says. The accords reduced 'transparency' in the multilateral trading system and they tended to become entrenched, indicating that they were delaying rather than promoting structural adjustment in the EC industries concerned. Brussels rarely resorts to the safeguard action allowed under Gatt rules to provide temporary respite for industries badly hit by foreign competition. EC officials told the Gatt that they regarded selective restraint agreements with major exporters as less contentious and more efficient. To conform with Gatt, safeguard measures must be temporary, applied to all exporters of the products concerned and restriction on imports in one sector must be compensated by liberalisation in other areas. A German safeguard measure pinpointed in the Gatt report restricts coal imports. Dating back to 1958, it holds the Gatt record for longevity. Reproaching the EC for preferring 'pragmatic solutions', such as bilateral restraint arrangements or anti-dumping measures, Gatt warns that continuing with this approach would offer 'a major threat' to a multilateral trading system founded on principles of non-discrimination, transparency and undistorted competition. The report notes with approval that the EC Commission has recently argued strongly against the selective approach. Another target of Gatt criticism is what it describes as the Community's multi-layer system of trade preferences towards other countries. The EC accords preferences under free trade agreements with the six countries of the European Free Trade Association and Israel; under association arrangements with Turkey, Malta, Cyprus and 69 African, Caribbean and the Pacific countries; and under co-operation agreements with eight Mediterranean countries. Similar deals are under negotiation with east European countries and members of the Arab organisation, the Gulf Co-operation Council. About 60 per cent of EC imports derive from countries participating in preferential schemes but the Gatt secretariat claims that the benefits are frequently only partial, show disparities in treatment and, again, raise the question of discrimination.</p>

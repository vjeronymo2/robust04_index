			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS GROUP REJECTS MCENROE APPEAL  </P> <P> John McEnroe's appeal of his disqualification from the Australian Open and  $6,500 in fines was rejected Friday by the International Tennis Federation.  </P> <P> Federation spokesman Ian Barnes said all the evidence surrounding McEnroe's  fourth-round disqualification in Melbourne, Australia, had been studied by  Grand Slam tournament administrator Bill Babcock.  </P> <P> Under federation rules, any player accruing fines of $7,500 within a 12-month  period automatically is banned from the next Grand Slam event.  </P> <P> Barnes emphasized that Friday's decision applies only to Grand Slam events.  McEnroe still could accrue fines at regular Assn. of Tennis Professionals  tournaments, and not have to miss any of the Grand Slam events. The next Grand  Slam event will be the French Open, beginning in May. Wimbledon begins in June.  </P></p>

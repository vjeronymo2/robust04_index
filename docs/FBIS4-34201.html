			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) --  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Costa Rican  President Jose Figueres stated today that they respect but do  not share the opinion of their colleague Fidel Castro, who  reproached the participants of the Ibero-American Summit for not  saying "a single word" about the U.S. embargo against Cuba.    "I respect the opinion of President Castro, but do not agree  with it, nor do I agree with his concept of what democracy is,"  de Leon told a group of newsmen. The Guatemalan president added  that he does not feel he was recriminated by Castro at the  summit. Castro also complained that the summit has not  recognized the fact that Cuba is the Ibero-American country  which has achieved the most in social aspects.    Asked about the same topic, Figueres responded that the  Cuban  president's statements "are his opinion, but not those of the  other presidents," and that he respects all opinions. The Costa  Rican president also said the political situations of Cuba and  Haiti, which will be broached today by the chiefs of states and  governments and their foreign ministers at a closed-door  meeting, complicate the continent's integration processes.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: French groups turn in lacklustre sales THE sluggish state of the French economy was yesterday highlighted by the announcement of lacklustre interim sales figures from a number of big industrial groups including Poliet in construction and Roussel-Uclaf in chemicals. Poliet mustered a negligible increase in turnover to FFr9.92bn (Dollars 1.98bn) for the first half of 1992, compared with FFr9.87m during the same period of 1991. Last year's figures were restated to allow for the sale earlier this year of Ciments Francais, the cement business, to Italcementi of Italy. The announcement of static sales from Poliet followed a series of similar disclosures last week from other French construction groups, including Bouygues and Fougerolle, all of which have been affected by the slowdown in the economy and the problems of large European building projects, notably Eurotunnel. Roussel-Uclaf, a in the chemicals group, reported a modest 3.2 per cent increase in sales to FFr7.3bn in the first half. This means that it just managed to keep sales ahead of inflation, which is now running at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in France. Chargeurs, one of France's largest textile groups, saw sales rise more slowly than inflation at 2.65 per cent to FFr5.42bn in the interim period. Textile turnover rose 8.6 per cent to FFr4.15bn.</p>

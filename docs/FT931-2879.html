			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mixed year for Indonesian pulp INDONESIA'S pulp and paper companies had a mixed 1992, with two of the top three reporting sharply lower-than-anticipated net profits as they finalised plans to raise new finance. Although no figures have officially been released, executives of Indah Kiat, the largest integrated pulp and paper producer in south-east Asia, say the company made a net profit last year of Rp121bn (Dollars 58.6m), down from Rp159.9bn in 1991. Tjiwi Kimia, the country's leading paper manufacturer, has indicated a net profit in 1992 of Rp60bn, down from Rp81.7bn in 1991 and below broker's forecasts. The best results come from Indorayon, the country's second-largest pulp producer, which has told brokers it made a net profit of Rp92bn last year, up from Rp69.9bn in 1991. The company plans to increase pulp production 41 per cent this year to 240,000 tonnes and to bring on stream a 30,000 tonne a year rayon plant. Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia, both majority-owned by the Sinar Mas conglomerate, plan a financial restructuring. Tjiwi Kimia is close to securing a Dollars 110m syndicated loan, led by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private sector arm. The loan should ease the company's debt burden - last September, it had bank loans and long-term debt of Rp822bn and a 218 per cent debt to equity gearing - by replacing high-interest Indonesian rupiah loans with lower-interest foreign loans. Brokers say a rights issue to provide the IFC with an equity stake is also being considered. Indah Kiat, which last June had bank loans and long-term debt of Rp691bn and gearing of 48 per cent, intends to raise up to Dollars 100m through a private offshore placement of bonds with institutional investors, brokers say.</p>

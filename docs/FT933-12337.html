			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency turmoil moves Paris closer to 2,000 level CURRENCY speculation in France, massive corporate deals in Germany, and personal tragedy in Italy moved bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS endured another day of drama in the money markets, which was reflected in equities by a strong gain in the CAC-40 index, closing the day 29.32 higher at 1,995.04, up 1 per cent on the week. Turnover was impressive at FFr3.7bn on the last day of the account as many market participants continued to speculate that the franc would be devalued, enabling interest rates to be cut. The day's excitement began with the Bank of France raising its overnight lending rate to 10 per cent from 7.75 per cent. The CAC index immediately rallied and looked set to break the 2,000 level, but it shied just short to record a day's best of 1,998. Devaluation hopes lifted interest rate-sensitive sub-indices, with consumer durables adding nearly 2 per cent. Among financials, SocGen gained FFr23 to FFr628 for a week's advance of 7.5 per cent and Paribas FFr12.40 to FFr439.90. FRANKFURT concentrated on special situations as the DAX index closed 7.30 higher at 1,830.83, up 1 per cent on the week in turnover up from DM7.9bn to DM9bn. Viag climbed DM23.50, or 6.1 per cent to DM410 after the state of Bavaria offered it the bulk of Bayernwerk, Germany's third largest electricity generator, for 'at least' DM1bn and a Viag stake of 25.1 per cent. Analysts said this was cheap at the price. Other utility groups like RWE, up DM3 at DM413.50, and Veba, up DM4.40 at DM408.20, rose in sympathy and Viag itself hit DM422 in the post-bourse, up 9.2 per cent on the day. Deutsche Babcock also rose by 6.1 per cent, or DM11.20 to DM194.70 on a big Swiss order and the company's perceived ability to benefit from federal funds released to build and refurbish energy plants in eastern Germany. In metals, Metallgesellschaft, recently volatile, climbed DM16, or 4.5 per cent to DM385 on a similar rationale. Allianz, the insurer, did not react to a DM2bn convertible or warrant bond issue, and an equity rights issue which could raise around DM400m more. The shares closed DM2 higher at DM2,288. MILAN was shocked by the death of Mr Raul Gardini, former chairman of Ferruzzi. But prices picked up later, although the mood remained uncertain, and the Comit index finished 2.40 lower at 550.17, a 1.1 per cent decline on the week. 'The news about Mr Gardini came as a complete surprise,' said Mr Guiseppe Bonini of Intersim in Milan. 'People are wondering what can have been behind it and they are becoming really worried about what is going on.' Ferruzzi shares, which lost 8 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the news, finished L23.5 or 5.5 per cent down at L406.5. Montedison, down 4 per cent in early business, edged L1.5 higher to L703.5 in heavy volume of almost 14m shares. ZURICH picked up from a quiet start with the arrival of renewed foreign demand and the SMI index rose 10.0 to 2,350.5, for a weekly fall of 1.9 per cent. Nestle, under pressure earlier in the week, gave up most of an early SFr13 rise to finish SFr1 ahead at SFr1,026 on first-half results in line with all but the most optimistic expectations. Sulzer fell SFr17 or 2.3 per cent to SFr713 in response to a forecast of unchanged profits for 1993. AMSTERDAM showed a modest gain, the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.4 to 118.0, unchanged on the week. KLM, which launched a Fl 250m commercial paper programme, rose 30 cents to Fl 334.10 for a week's gain of 2.4 per cent. Royal Dutch added Fl 1.60 to Fl 178.40. MADRID's turnover rose again, with an estimate of Pta20bn against Pta18.4bn as the general index rose 1.41 to 260.40 on interest rate speculation, up 0.9 per cent on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 23                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open     10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1222.37   1223.62    1223.77    1224.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1279.17   1279.51    1280.70    1281.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1225.18   1225.68    1223.99    1224.42 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1282.41   1282.69    1280.54    1279.96  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 22    Jul 21    Jul 20    Jul 19    Jul 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1217.14   1212.75   1224.85   1235.43   1234.37 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1275.93   1266.97   1275.46   1283.54   1281.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1225.86; 200 - 1283.16 Low/day: 100 - 1222.19  200 - 1278.89.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The mission of the People's Army to advocate, defend, and  complete generation after generation the great leader's  revolutionary cause can be realized only under the party's  leadership.    Leading the cause of military building to victory is not a  matter that can be fulfilled by anyone. This can be carried out  only by a military commander who is possessed with a great  military ideology and extraordinary leadership.    Our People's Army grew up to become an invincible  revolutionary armed force and walked a proud road of victory and  glory. This cannot be thought about without the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il's trait in which he is leading the  revolutionary armed force by having both profound ideology and  theory and tremendous practical capability of a great military  strategist.    Being possessed with a great military ideology is the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding trait as an  extraordinary military commander.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is brilliantly  succeeding, developing, and enriching the great leader's  chuche-oriented military building ideology. He elucidated the  fundamental cause of military building in which the master of  the military work is the Army and masses and the result of the  military work is decided upon according to the strength of the  Army and masses.    Based on this, along with the principle of self-defense of  defending our country with its own strength, the dear comrade  leader bestowed a decisive significance in the soldiers'  ideological consciousness; carried out all military work by  enhancing their role of ideological consciousness; and motivated  the soldiers and masses and presented principles to solve  military problems in accordance with their country's concrete  situation.    In various historical works of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il such as "On the Chuche Idea," "On Improving and  Strengthening the Propaganda and Agitation Work Within the  People's Army," and "Let Us All the More Strengthen the People's  Army Into Invincible Ranks," he all the more clarified the  mission and duty of our revolutionary armed force and elucidated  the strategic and tactical principle of the revolutionary armed  force building. In addition, based on the great chuche idea he  newly elucidated systematically and on a full basis all military  problems such as the viewpoint on war, revolutionary armed force  building, national defense construction, military strategy, and  the art of commanding the Army.    The method of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea  occupies an outstanding position in the dear comrade leader's  military building ideology. The dear comrade leader put forth  modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea as a  chuche-oriented Army founding program which the People's Army  must adhere to. He elucidated the essence of modeling the whole  Army after the chuche idea.    Modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea is to arm all  the soldiers under the great leader's revolutionary ideology to  foster them to become a chuche-oriented revolutionary fighter  and carry out the revolutionary armed force building and all  military activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche  idea.    By presenting the outstanding strategic method of modeling  the whole Army after the chuche idea by the dear comrade leader,  the road to highly uphold the leadership of the party and leader  with loyalty and to guarantee to the end with force the chuche  revolutionary cause have been clearly elucidated.    Through the dear comrade leader, who is developing and  enriching the great leader's military building ideology and  theory, all theoretical and practical problems arising in  military building, including the fundamental principle of  military building and military building program, were wholly  elucidated. Therefore, a firm guiding principle was provided in  carrying out the revolutionary armed force building and military  activities in accordance with the demand of the chuche era.  Also, it was possible for our revolutionary armed force to grow  into an invincible rank that can defeat any kind of enemy and  defend ever so strong the party, the leader, the fatherland, and  revolution.    Outstanding and tested leadership is one of the most  important traits of a commander, and the commander's leadership  can be said to determine the might of the revolutionary forces.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius  who  has boundless military insights, limitless boldness, extensive  military knowledge, and political insights. He is also a great  commander who has an art of military operations with which he  commands all Armed Forces of the country in a unified manner and  makes them act like one.    The dear comrade leader presented a clear struggle slogan  that the revolutionary Armed Forces must adhere to as a motto  and noble mission and has strengthened and developed the  People's Army into a powerful chuche-oriented Army and  invincible revolutionary Army.    The dear comrade leader personally called in a People's  Armed  Forces Ministry official on 1 January 1976. With a serious look  on his face, he told the official that we had many things to do  in the new year and stressed that it is important to  continuously and persistently carry out the work to build the  party's unitary ideological system in the military. He also  said: Your basic mission, comrades, is to make all soldiers,  shock brigade members, and do-or-die unit members  unconditionally carry out any order issued by the leader  [suryong] -- by even risking their lives. Therefore, you,  comrades, must better indoctrinate soldiers under the slogan  "Let us fight for the great leader by even risking our lives!"    This slogan presented by the dear comrade leader impressed  People's Army officers and men. This immortal slogan is  imprinted at any guardpost in the frontline, coast, and  mountainous areas; command posts on warships, aircraft cockpits,  and guardposts at major facilities and vigorously inspires  People's Army soldiers into the single road of loyalty and  heroic feats.    The outstanding leadership with which one presents a slogan,  builds the entire Army into a powerful rank, and leads the  entire Army to fulfill a single purpose is a leadership trait  that only the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il possesses.    Nothing is more fortunate to an army than having a commander  who has an outstanding art of military operations. Upholding  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander is  a boundless honor and the highest privilege to our people and  People's Army.    Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an outstanding  commander who takes charge of the entire Armed Forces of the  country in a unified manner, makes the entire Army act like one,  has a good understanding of everything from operational tactics  to equipment, and is well versed with all Army, Navy, and Air  Force branches.    The dear comrade leader personally visited the training  field  of a unit one day in October 1980. After watching soldiers in  combat training with satisfaction, the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il said proudly that our People's Army's combat capability  has been strengthened beyond comparison. He added: If our  people see the invincible spirits of our People's Army, they  will be very pleased, but, if the enemy sees them, it will be  (?horrified).    He also gave a great lesson, which is a leading guideline in  strengthening the People's Army's combat capability.    Even professional functionaries could not have imagined  that the most important question of war victory lies in the  seemingly ordinary logic set forth by the dear comrade leader.    The great military genius, dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il,  was the only one who gave answers to the victory of war after  closely analyzing and comprehending all aspects of nature and  characteristics of modern war from a new angle. His  extraordinary strategy is a comprehensive reflection of the  sagacious general's military wisdom, peerless courage, and  scientific insight. These qualifications and traits can only  been seen in a veteran of many battles.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a military genius  and  matchless sagacious general who long time ago smashed into  pieces [sansanhi chitpusida] the enemy's reckless war maneuvers  with wisdom that foresees all troubles and adapts to any  circumstance.    An (?example) was seen a few years ago, when the enemies'  Team Spirit joint military exercise reached its highest, he  organized the mobilization of the Korea People's Army [KPA]  units to one focused place and the enemies were chaotically  confused. This made the most important part of the exercise  useless. At another time, the enemies came at us saying they  would make a preemptive strike. The dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il seized the initiative with one single tactic and  frightened them away.    In March 1993, when the enemies resumed the Team Spirit '93  joint military exercise, which the enemies had decided to  suspend temporarily, and drew dark clouds of nuclear war to this  land, he unsparingly smashed [chitpusida] the war aggression  maneuver of the enemies, who ran wild without discretion, with  an order in the name of the supreme commander.    Each time the military functionaries see the frosted-pumpkin  look of the rascals in those right-on-target cases, they could  not resist admiring the outstanding military sense and brightly  shining extraordinary strategy of the dear comrade leader, who  changes adverse circumstance to favorable one all at once by  gaining supremacy over the enemies with one single blow.    Our revolutionary forces' supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il, is a great military genius who always leads our  revolutionary armed forces to the single road of victory with  outstanding military ideology, military wisdom that foresees a  thousand ri ahead, and extraordinary military training skill,  and an indomitable sagacious general who grips the enemies in  one catch and tosses them around with fantastic strategies and  tactics, and unique war method.    His respected name is indeed a brilliant symbol of spirit,  dignity, hope, and victory of the ever-victorious invincible  people and the People's Army. Endless is the glory of our  people and the People's Army because we have the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il as the supreme commander of our  revolutionary armed forces. Wide open is the road of glorious  and brilliant victory for our people and the People's Army  because of his leadership.</p>

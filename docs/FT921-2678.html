			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Kohl flying to Washington in bid to save Uruguay Round CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany flies to Washington on Friday for talks with President George Bush, convinced that a last-minute breakthrough is still possible in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of world trade talks. The German Chancellor hopes he will be able to persuade Mr Bush to make a key concession, by accepting a freeze on future US exports of cereals substitutes to the European Community. In return, he believes he can promise a European readiness to accept quantity restrictions on EC farm exports, which until now has proved a crucial sticking-point in the negotiations. Failure by the US and EC to agree on farm trade has put in jeopardy the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, launched by Gatt in 1986 to reform a wide spectrum of world trade. Mr Kohl believes he has the backing of the European Commission, UK premier John Major and Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, along with, significantly, President Francois Mitterrand of France for the concession. Mr Kohl will meet Mr Bush at Camp David on Saturday. 'The proposed compromise makes clear again that here in Europe and Bonn there is a firm will to conclude the Gatt Round in April,' an official said. '(Chancellor Kohl) can tell Mr Bush that the French president, the European Commission and the Portuguese presidency (of the European Council of Ministers) all agree we want a conclusion, and that the Europeans are ready for a sensible compromise.' The German compromise would protect the European farm market from a flood of US cereal substitutes, mainly corn gluten feed, citrus pellets and tapioca, once EC agricultural reform starts to cut home-based production. German officials believe that if the US compromises on that question, EC resistance, above all in France, to quantity curbs on European exports would fall away. German officials have welcomed the intervention of Mr James Baker, US secretary of state. It is understood Mr Baker proposed last week a 'safe box' system to allow future income support for EC farmers to be kept on over an extended period.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Stylo deficit cut to Pounds 1.9m STYLO, which owns the Barratts chain of shoe shops, announced a 30 per cent reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds 1.9m for the six months to July 31. The company was worried about speculation that the budget would impose VAT on children's wear, or even increase the tax from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent. 'We are deeply concerned about how people will be able to afford that extra money,' said Mr Michael Ziff, managing director and father of three. Between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of Stylo's sales are children's footwear. The group reported an 8.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 50.7m, although improvement had been patchy. Rationalisation and new product ranges are expected to return Stylo to profit this year. Analysts are forecasting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m (losses of Pounds 746,000). A Pounds 2m reduction in stocks to Pounds 23m helped to bring interest down by Pounds 360,000 to Pounds 2.4m. Debt, at about Pounds 41m, represented 50 per cent of shareholders' funds, against 58 per cent last year. As in the past the group did not recommend an interim dividend. Losses per share improved from 13.22p to 9.43p.</p>

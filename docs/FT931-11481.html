			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tapie close to selling his stake in Adidas MR BERNARD Tapie, the controversial French industrialist and politician, is on the verge of concluding a deal to sell his controlling stake in Adidas, the German sporting goods group, to a consortium of investors led by Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group. The consortium, which also includes Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance company, is expected within the next few days to finalise negotiations to buy Mr Tapie's 78 per cent stake in BTF, the German holding company that owns 95 per cent of Adidas, according to a report in that appears in today's edition of Les Echos, the French financial newspaper. Mr Tapie, who recently returned to the French cabinet following the collapse of a fraud case, has for months been trying to sell his Adidas stake to reduce the debts of Bernard Tapie Finance, his holding company. An earlier attempt to sell the stake to Pentland, the UK consumer products company, collapsed last year. Last autumn, Mr Tapie instructed Credit Lyonnais to sell the BTF shares for FFr2.08bn. Les Echos suggests that Credit Lyonnais, AGF and Banque Worms, another French bank, will raise their current combined 20 per cent stake in BTF with Mr Louis-Dreyfus taking between 3 per cent and 7 per cent of the shares. Mr Louis-Dreyfus, the heir to a French banking fortune, made his name in the business world as chief executive of Saatchi where he orchestrated a financial restructuring that saved the group from collapse. He announced last year that he was leaving Saatchi in mid-1993 to pursue new interests.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Taylor tinkers Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays new chief executive, deserves a round of applause for setting his sights firmly against rights issues. The old tendency to distribute too much by way of dividends and then go cap in hand to shareholders when more capital is needed is discredited. The corollary is that dividend cover must be high enough to permit a decent level of retained earnings. At first sight Mr Taylor's suggestion that dividends should be at least twice covered looks pretty tough. Barclays has not managed that since 1988, and its latest dividend is only 1.3 times covered. Look again, though, and the target may actually be rather lax. With only minimal effort Barclays should be able to pay large dividend increases as bad-debt provisions come down. Provisions could fall by half and still be around 1 per cent of weighted risk assets. But Barclays would have another Pounds 950m of profits which equates to almost 40p of earnings. Its 15.15p dividend could then double before the target was breached. The assumption that Mr Taylor was implicitly promising large dividend increases helped push the shares higher yesterday. The worry is whether Barclays would be retaining enough earnings to finance growth over the longer term. Barclays may think this does not matter while inflation stays low. It could also improve the mix of its business rather than expand its balance sheet. That might bring higher operating profits for a while, but it is a tough challenge when all banks are scrambling for high-return, low-risk business. Poor prospects for operating revenue have hurt Lloyds' share price despite its eye-catching returns. It has underperformed the sector by 40 per cent over the past couple of years. Barclays must hope that BZW's dynamism will help it escape a similar fate.</p>

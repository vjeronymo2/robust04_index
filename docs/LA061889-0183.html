			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER OFFENSE CONTINUES TO SPUTTER IN LOSS TO BRAVES  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda had seen enough.  </P> <P> The Dodger manager raced from the third-base coaching box to confront plate  umpire Mike Winters after Eddie Murray struck out swinging to end the sixth  inning in Saturday night's game against the Atlanta Braves.  </P> <P> "All I wanted to do was talk to him," Lasorda said.  </P> <P> But Winters didn't want to talk to Lasorda.  </P> <P> Winters ejected Lasorda, who first moved in close to Winters at the plate, then  continued to rage at third-base umpire Bob Engel.  </P> <P> The confrontation concluded with Lasorda making a gesture at Engel with his  right hand as he walked to the dugout.  </P> <P> Lasorda's outburst was the biggest Dodger explosion on a night when they lost,  2-1, to the Braves.  </P> <P> Lasorda was still seething after the game.  </P> <P> "When the hell has there been a rule that you can't go talk to the umpire?"  Lasorda asked. "He threw me out before I came down to talk to him. Go ask him  why he threw me out."  </P> <P> Winters said of Lasorda: "He said a few things about balls and strikes."  </P> <P> Lasorda had other worries, namely the Dodgers' anemic offense.  </P> <P> A Dodger Stadium crowd of 42,940 saw Brave starter Pete Smith and relievers  Paul Assenmacher and Joe Boever limit the Dodgers to seven hits as Atlanta beat  Los Angeles for the second straight night.  </P> <P> Murray continued to slump, striking out three times before drawing an  eighth-inning walk. And leadoff hitter Kirk Gibson went hitless in four  at-bats.  </P> <P> "They've got to start hitting, that's what they've got to do," Lasorda said.  "They've got to start scoring runs. It's very simple."  </P> <P> Mariano Duncan lit the Dodgers' only offensive fire, lining a pinch double to  left field with one out in the eighth inning. After Gibson flew out to short  left, Willie Randolph drove in Duncan, lining a double off the left-field wall  over the leaping Lonnie Smith. But Boever struck out pinch-hitter Franklin  Stubbs to end the threat.  </P> <P> Trailing, 2-1, in the ninth, Duncan came to the plate with runners on first and  second and two out. But Boever struck out Duncan to earn his 10th save of the  season.  </P> <P> After breaking out of a slump in their five-game winning streak, the Dodgers  have returned to form, scoring just two runs in losing the first two games of a  three-game series against the Braves.  </P> <P> Dion James gave the Braves a 1-0 lead when he homered into the right-field box  seats to open the fifth inning.  </P> <P> James' home run was the only mistake made by Dodger starter Mike Morgan, who  brought a league-leading 1.59 earned-run average into the game. But once again,  the Dodger offense failed to support its pitchers.  </P> <P> The Dodger defense also failed in the eighth as the Braves scored an unearned  run off Morgan to take a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> After Bruce Benedict opened the inning with a double to left, shortstop Alfredo  Griffin botched Lonnie Smith's grounder as Benedict moved to third. Jeff  Treadway, who homered in the Braves' 6-1 victory over the Dodgers Friday night,  then drove in Benedict.  </P> <P> Smith, sidelined with a sore right shoulder since losing to the Dodgers June 5,  struck out five before leaving after the sixth inning when he felt a twinge in  his right elbow.  </P> <P> "(Smith) had his best command of his pitches," Atlanta Manager Russ Nixon said.  "Tonight, he did a lot to build up his confidence."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Outfielder Mike Marshall, eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday,  will not accompany the Dodgers Monday when they leave on a six-game trip.  Marshall, who was put on the 21-day disabled list May 31 because of back  spasms, is still undergoing rehabilitation. Dr. Robert Watkins met with Manager  Tom Lasorda, General Manager Fred Claire, Marshall and other Dodger officials  before Saturday night's game to review Marhsall's treatment. "I'm hopeful that  we will have him the second half of the season," Claire said. . . . Claire said  the Dodgers aren't working on a trade to acquire outfielder Dan Gladden of the  Minnesota Twins, who said he hopes to play in Los Angeles. "If (Gladden) says  he's coming here, he knows a lot more than I know about it," Claire said. . . .  Dodger left-hander John Tudor, still recovering from shoulder and elbow  surgery, is scheduled to make his second rehabilitation start tonight for the  Bakersfield Dodgers gainst San Bernardino in Bakersfield. He pitched five  innings in his first start June 7 in Vero Beach, Fla. . . . Mickey Hatcher,  sidelined since June 3 with a strained left hamstring, hopes to come off the  disabled list Monday. Hatcher tested his hamstring by running in the outfield  before Saturday night's game. . . . The Dodgers end their home stand today when  Fernando Valenzuela (2-5) opposes Zane Smith at 2 p.m. The game will be  preceeded by an old-timers' game featuring players from the Dodgers' six World  Series championship teams.  </P></p>

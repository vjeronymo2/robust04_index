			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / US investor group set to buy Heron A group of investors led by Mr Steven Green, the US businessman, was yesterday selected by Heron International as the preferred buyer of Mr Gerald Ronson's property company. The bid from HNV Acquisition would give Mr Ronson and the Heron management team a continuing role. Mr Green, chairman of Astrum International, the US company which owns the Samsonite brand, and of Auburndale Properties said yesterday that he planned to retain the group's assets and to develop it into a larger European property company. HNV is a limited partnership and includes as investors Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News International, Mr Terry Semel, chairman of Warner Brothers, Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications, and trusts of Mr Michael Milken's family. Mr Green said he had been watching Heron for some time and invested in its bonds a year ago. He believes Heron's problems stem not from its selection of properties but from the impact of recession on asset values. 'The exact role that Mr Ronson and his team would play is not structured, but I would hope we will have an opportunity to deal with them and to use their knowledge and their expertise on these assets. I would look to a relationship that would be longer than an interim basis,' he said. Heron had been in talks with a short list of six bidders, but the offer from Mr Green's group was understood to be the highest. Heron said it would notify the other parties that it would be 'terminating discussions with them with immediate effect'. Although yet to be finalised, the offer from HNV will enable lenders to the Heron group to convert their debt into equity and so retain an interest. A cash alternative will give an exit for other lenders, and HNV will take a majority of the equity. Lenders expect to receive offers reflecting the last prices at which the group's debt and equity traded. That would give holders of senior debt around 45p in the pound, substantially higher than the proposal from a consortium led by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which is believed to have been under 35p. Heron is reckoned to have asset backing of 70p in the pound for its Pounds 300m of senior debt, although in a receivership senior lenders might expect to get 30p. Junior bondholders might expect to be offered around 6p in the pound, while equity holders have seen their shares quoted at around 1 1/2 p. HNV is being advised by Swiss Bank Corporation, while Heron's adviser is UBS. Renewed link, Page 34</p>

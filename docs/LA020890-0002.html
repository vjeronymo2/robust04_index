ED HERSCHLER  </P> <P> Ed Herschler, 71, a country lawyer who became Wyoming's only three-term  governor, died of cancer in Cheyenne on Monday.  </P> <P> He was 71.  </P> <P> A Democrat in a predominantly Republican state, Herschler remained popular  after leaving office in 1986 but declined to seek a fourth term.  </P> <P> Herschler, who guided Wyoming through a boom in the energy industry, entered  state politics in 1961 when he won a term in the House of Representatives after  eight years as a county prosecutor. In 1970, Herschler lost his House seat, but  returned to claim a surprising victory for governor four years later.  </P></p>

Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has described the  matter as of the highest security significance to Australia and  the region, renewing an appeal to North Korea to cooperate with  international inspection requirements to nuclear facilities.    In the national Parliament in Canberra, Mr. Keating said  Australia had been most concerned by North Korea's statement  last Monday threatening to set aside an earlier promise not to  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. He said any  proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would  pose a grave threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region.  It would also profoundly complicate Australia's security  planning and that of other countries in the region, Mr. Keating  said, adding it also risked the spread of such weapons to other  presently nonnuclear states:    [Begin Keating recording] Australia remains committed to  dialogue and negotiation to resolve this problem, Mr. Speaker,  but the international community cannot permit continuing North  Korean intransigence. If no agreement is reached before the  meeting of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Board  of Governors later this month, the matter is likely to be  referred to the United Nations Security Council. It should be  clear that under those circumstances, Australia would support  any action imposed by the Security Council, including sanctions.  [end recording]</p>

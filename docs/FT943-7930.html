			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Contracts with Algiers at risk, warns Islamic Front The main Islamic party battling to take power in Algeria warned foreign governments and companies yesterday that contracts signed since the January 1992 general election may be at risk. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was denied certain victory in the election when the government cancelled the poll, warned violence would worsen if the Algiers government did not open a dialogue. Mr Rabah Khebir, spokesman for the FIS, said in an interview with the Financial Times that all contracts signed since the election could be considered illegal if FIS came to power. Agreements amounting to billions of dollars would be reviewed. Mr Khebir added, however, that it was in Algeria's economic interest to remain open to the west. But western governments also carried a heavy responsibility for the future course of events in his country, where Islamic militants have recently stepped up attacks on foreign nationals. The FIS spokesman, who fled Algeria two years ago, said western governments could help establish a dialogue with the Algiers government, but ruled out the participation of France 'because of its attitude'. France has recently clamped down on members of FIS and other Islamic activists. He claimed that FIS had always denounced the killing of foreigners (59 have died), and said the leadership had done all it could to dissuade its supporters from carrying out acts of sabotage against oil and gas installations. Exports of hydrocarbons should be worth about Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) this year and provide Algeria with 97 per cent of its foreign income. But as the overall level of violence increased, the risks of such acts occurring could only get greater, Mr Khebir said. 'The regime would be well advised to talk to us,' he added. At least 10,000 Algerians are estimated to have died in political violence since the beginning of 1992 and diplomats estimated that the death toll is running at about 300 a week.

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Electricity companies Since Reuters has dignified the idea of handing excess capital back to shareholders, it is worth casting about for other possible candidates. Strong cash inflows, low debt or net cash and limited growth opportunities within a stable business are the main criteria needed. One group which clearly fits the bill is the regional electricity companies. By the time the important distribution review is completed next summer most will have minimal borrowing. They will also have dividend cover around 3 times, and annual cash flow per share averaging 112p. Already they are trading at a premium to net assets of about 50 per cent. Such basic utility businesses should have much higher gearing and lower dividend cover. The electricity companies justify the excess equity on the grounds of diversification and regulatory risk. Yet the companies have not been over-endowed with credible diversification ideas. And even the most draconian tightening of the price cap next year would only make them cash neutral. Besides, the regulator may take a dim view if the companies operate with too much equity and thus an unnecessarily high cost of capital. Far from waiting until after next year's review has established a medium-term regulatory framework, they may be wise to address the issue as part of that process. They could propose that they take on debt to finance a share buy-back for the benefit of shareholders, while customers might get a one-off lowering of electricity prices. Those boards which try to skate around the issue of excess capital for fear that they may get harsher treatment from Professor Littlechild are only deluding themselves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek has rejected  draft legislation in the United States which would require  European members of NATO to pay 75 percent of the costs of  keeping U.S. forces stationed on their territory.    The proposed law was approved by the U.S. House of  Representatives last month, but still has to be passed by the  Senate. Under the law, Washington would pull a large part of  its troops out of Europe if the NATO allies were not to agree to  pay 75 percent of the costs.    In Washington, the Dutch defense minister told U.S.  Secretary  of Defense William Perry he found the proposals unacceptable.  Minister ter Beek said the planned burden-sharing was anything  but fair.</p>

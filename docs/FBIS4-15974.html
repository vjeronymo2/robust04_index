			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- The government of the  people's trust and the Constitutional Court of the Republic of  Chechnya has called on all social and political forces of  Chechnya to begin a dialogue aimed at achieving national  reconciliation. The text of the appeal was communicated to  ITAR-TASS.    Appointments for interviewing prime minister of the Republic  of Chechnya government of the people's trust can be fixed by  telephone: 278-62-74. Please, ask for Sergey Moyseyev.    "The fate has once again given a chance to the Chechen  people, perhaps, the last. Russia in the person of the State  Duma has for the first time rejected a solution to the "Chechen  problem" by using force, and has proposed peaceful means for  settling mutual relations. Missing this chance will be a crime  in the eyes of the people and history. Our progeny would not  forgive us for this. But it is quite reasonable not to take  advantage of the prospects opening before us under the  conditions of a confrontation between political forces and  movements of Chechnya," the appeal stated.    The appeal is signed by Prime Minister of the Government of  the People's Trust Y. Mamodayev and Chairman of the  Constitutional Court I. Gerikhanov. It contains proposals how  to take first steps towards practical reconciliation. It asks  the president of Chechnya, as a guarantor of rights and  liberties to citizens, together with the parliament,  constitutional court, lawful prime minister, and with the  participation of the masses to take measures for achieving  national reconciliation, and also prepare a programme for  holding a political dialogue with Russia.    The appeal assumes that during the talks with Russia a  moratorium will be imposed on all conflicts between parties,  movements, different branches of power, state leaders, religious  and social workers and individual citizens (in the form of blood  feuds, disputes over land, etc.) for the sake of an equal and  mutually acceptable treaty with Russia. It also asks for  suspending decisions adopted by state power bodies of Chechnya,  which can become a subject of talks between Russian and the  Republic of Chechnya.</p>

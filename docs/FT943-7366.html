			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Tidal wave of roubles engulfs tiny Caucasus 'offshore zone': Russian companies are queueing to enter Over the past few weeks television screens across Russia have been flooded with a shadowy image of a group of weary businessmen discussing their difficult encounters with Russia's demanding taxman. Then a door flies open and light streams into the room. 'Your tax problems are over,' a reassuring voice croons. 'Register your company in the republic of Ingushetia and you will be freed from taxes.' At a time when Russia's airwaves are crowded with the mellifluous but empty promises of dream merchants, this remarkable offer is actually genuine. A presidential decree which came into force on July 1 has given the republic of Ingushetia, a small region in the Caucasus next door to war-torn Chechnya, the right to become an 'ofshornaya zona', the newly coined Russian term for offshore tax haven. Only fully privately-owned companies may register in the offshore zone, but for those who do the benefits are tremendous: companies legally registered there pay no local or regional taxes, only 20 per cent of federal taxes and just half of regular import and export tariffs. These benefits have not been lost on Russian businessmen, who are making their way in droves to a group of gleaming white marble buildings set in a grove of fir trees on the outskirts of Moscow. These are the booming headquarters of the Bin Financial Corporation, the sole company empowered by the Ingush government to register companies in the offshore zone. Sitting on a soft leather sofa beneath pink chandeliers, Mr Mikhail Gutseriev, the 36-year-old president of Bin and architect of the offshore scheme, cannot quite believe his luck. He came up with the idea two years ago when, in what has become standard practice for Russian businessmen, he set up an offshore company in Cyprus. 'I thought to myself, why should these offshore zones, where me and my friends were putting all of our money, exist only abroad?' said Mr Gutseriev, an ethnic Ingush who fled the embattled Caucasus two years ago to make his fortune in Moscow. 'I thought, why not create one here in Russia?' For Russia's leaders, already facing a huge shortage of revenue and struggling to prevent capital flight, making it simple and legal to avoid taxes seems incredible. However, permitting the Ingush republic to establish itself as an offshore tax haven presents a clear political advantage for the Kremlin. Ethnically related to the Chechens, whose successful and stubborn assertion of independence over the past two years has been a thorn in the Russia's side, Ingushetia has become one of Moscow's scarce allies in the unstable Caucasus region. '(Russian President) Yeltsin and (Russian Prime Minister) Chernomyrdin saw that this off-shore zone could help to stabilise the Caucasus,' Mr Gutseriev explains. 'Its time for everyone there to stop running around with machine-guns and start running around with money.' This principle seems to have been taken to heart by the Russian and foreign companies beating a trail to Bin offices in Moscow and several other cities in Russia. 'The demand is absolutely unlimited,' Mr Gutseriev claims. 'We get between 500 and 600 phone calls a day from all parts of Russia.' The zone is bringing in about Dollars 100,000 a day just from the Dollars 4,000 registration fee companies must pay. However, that registration price - paid so far by more than 1,200 companies, half of them in Moscow - is just the first part of the financial windfall for the Ingush republic and Mr Gutseriev's company. Those federal taxes and customs duties paid by companies in the offshore zone do not go into the Kremlin's coffers; they belong entirely to the tiny, impoverished Ingushetia. Over the next two years, Mr Gutseriev estimates that registration fees and taxes will produce at least Dollars 1bn. About 10 per cent of that goes to Bin, which is also prospering thanks to another provision of the scheme. To benefit from the offshore zone's tax breaks, registered companies must do all their banking through the Bin bank, which is part of the Bin group of companies. This clause is bringing in so much money that Mr Gutseriev can hardly contain himself. Racing over to his desk, he produces the bank's daily balance sheet. 'Rbs23bn (Pounds 6.9m at the market rate) flowed into our accounts today alone,' he says. 'And its like this every single day. We have so much money I don't know what to do with it any more. Perhaps you have some investment suggestions?' Mr Gutseriev's main concern is that Bin and the Ingush offshore zone will become victims of their own success. His voluble account of his scheme's progress is occasionally interrupted as he reminds himself: 'Maybe I shouldn't be telling you all of this, because if people discover how much money we are making we will be in mortal danger from the mafia.' His other fear is that, as more and more companies register, other regions will lobby for the same privilege, and political pressure will mount to stem the flow of money out of the federal treasury. 'It's absurd,' commented one western businessman. 'If this is allowed to continue, pretty soon all of the Russian economy will be registered offshore and no one will formally be left doing business in Russia itself.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing April 14 TASS -- The Russian Defence  Ministry attaches prime importance to the development of  relations with the Armed Forces of China. We remember that we  are linked by the common border stretching for 4.5 thousand  kilometers. My generation remembers periods of confrontation,  including military, particularly in border areas. Russia and  China have worked out a common position -- relations between the  two countries and their armies must become good-neighbourly and  fraternal in character -- Russia's Chief of Staff  Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS today.    During his visit to China, which ended today, General  Kolesnikov had talks with his Chinese counterpart Zhang Wannian  and Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Council of the  Chinese People's Republic Liu Huanqin.    In the course of the talks, General Kolesnikov said, "The  two  neighbours conducted a frank exchange of views. We stick to the  policy of further rapprochement between the armies of the two  countries and regard China as an equal partner. We have what to  share [as received] with China, including in the  military-technical sphere", he said. General Kolesnikov  explained that he means deliveries of different kinds of  armaments and military equipment, in which China is interested  and sending Russian military specialists to China to help  partners in making proper use of the deliveries, and the  training of Chinese officers in Russian higher schools, up to  the General Staff Academy. China expressed the desire to  continue negotiations on further interaction along all these  lines on a regular and planned basis.    General Kolesnikov said he had a frank exchange of views  with  Chinese colleagues about the Korean peninsula nuclear problem.  "Our viewpoints are quite close. Russia and China, two of the  officially recognised five nuclear powers, are categorically  against any proliferation of nuclear technologies", he said.    According to the Russian general, the situation in Northeast  Asia is further complicated by "the unfairly tough pressure"  that is being brought to bear on Pyongyang by international  organisations, including the United Nations and the  International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as the United  States. On the other hand, he said, North Korea is sticking to  "a tough and inflexible stand". Both sides should be more  yielding if they want a solution that would suit all, General  Kolesnikov said.    As concerns his impressions from visiting Beijing and  Shanghai, General Kolesnikov stressed that radical economic  reforms are being carried out in China in conditions of  political stability, and the country looks "like one large  construction site".</p>

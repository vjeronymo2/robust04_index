			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Hope and Glory" (1987), directed by John Boorman. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13.  </P> <P> War from the perspective of an awe-struck youth, a 7-year-old London boy  roaming like a terrier, sniffing out fresh shrapnel to add to his collection,  escaping his basement shelter to see the bombs exploding -- the best fireworks  ever. Yet Boorman never turns war into something flip or trivial. MARK CHALON  SMITH  </P></p>

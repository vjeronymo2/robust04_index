			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Group of Welsh Labour MPs call for Jones resignation A GROUP of Welsh Labour MPs yesterday called for the resignation of Mr Gwyn Jones, the former chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, as BBC governor for Wales. In an early day motion the MPs, including Mr Rhodri Morgan (Cardiff West), and Mr Win Griffiths (Bridgend), condemned 'the disastrous catalogue of mismanagement and worse' which was revealed in the report by the Commons public accounts committee on the agency. Their motion notes that Mr Jones is chairman of the board of BBC Wales, as well as being a governor representing Wales. The motion says: 'The evidence of his defective stewardship of the affairs of the Welsh Development Agency from 1988 to 1993 renders him an unfit person to hold the same responsibility for the BBC in Wales.' The motion, in the names of nine MPs, calls on prime minister Mr John Major to demand Mr Jones' resignation from the post. Mr Jones made it clear yesterday he had no intention of resigning from his BBC post. Friends said that Mr Jones planned to make a full statement soon on all the criticisms made about the agency during his stewardship. It is understood that Mr Jones will be interviewed for BBC Wales and a number of newspapers.</p>

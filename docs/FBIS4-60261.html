			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F> correspondent Noureddine Bouziane; place and date not given;  from the "Afrique Midi" program --recorded]    [Text] [Dembri] The political dialogue in Algeria is  progressing steadily and as expected. That is, all the  political and social forces of the country have been consulted  and have been associated with this effort aimed at setting up  transitional institutions to reach a national consensus on the  resumption of the electoral process of course, and to build the  new Algerian society. I do not think it is appropriate to speak  of government versus opposition. I think this concept is  completely false. There is a state and a government that are  trying to organize, to the best of their ability, the  transitional period, and a political elite that has its own  interpretations, something that is normal in a democratic  regime. The aim is to achieve this consensus around the key  points included in the transitional platform, which should  guarantee the continuity of the Algerian state, the continuity  of the republican order, the defense of individual rights and  freedom, as well as respect for the elements constituting our  national character and the rejection of violence as a means of  obtaining power and keeping it.    The democratic process has never been interrupted in  Algeria.  This is in fact why we can still see parties pursuing their  activities freely. The press is also free. We should not  forget that not long ago in Europe, these problems of transition  were experienced by at least two countries. In Spain, the  Moncloa Pact had to be signed to manage the transition toward a  multiparty system and the emergence of a republican state. In  Portugal, it took no fewer than four transitional governments,  if I remember correctly, to form a constitutional government.  The issue here is the transition from a system of partisan  democracy to a democratic multyparty system.    [Bouziane] Minister, how do you assess the relationship  between Algeria and France?    [Dembri] Good on the whole. We are pleased at this moment to  see that there is a great understanding of the Algerian  situation on the part of French political circles. Some  worst-case scenarios are entertained by some editorials of the  French press, but on the whole, it is obvious that putting the  problems of Algeria within the Mediterranean framework at the  moment is, beyond the confines of any relationship, good for  joint development. This joint development will force us to look  at the problems of the future in terms of solutions that we  should find together to everything that concerns the economy and  movement of persons and property, etc.    [Bouziane] At the diplomatic level, Minister, we have  recently noticed Algerian diplomatic activity particularly  concerning Mali, with the signing of the National Pact, and  Niger. What is the future of a settlement of the Tuareg problem  in these two countries?    [Dembri] Listen, we are doing what a neighboring country  should do: aspiring to build a prosperous community. At the two  levels of cooperation and security, we have built a  Sahelian-Saharan community, which we hope to see integrated and  homogenous.    [Bouziane] Does this mean that Algeria will soon organize  direct negotiations between the Niger Government and the Niger  Tuaregs?    [Dembri] This does not matter. There are three mediators in  this conflict. There is the Burkinabe mediator, the French  mediator, and the Algerian mediator. The meetings -- and a few  of these will be held -- should take place on a rotational basis  in the different countries involved. A meeting has already been  held in Ouagadougou. Our mediators recently met the two parties  to these negotiations. A meeting is secheduled to take place in  Paris, I suppose, on 15 June, and we will try of course to  contribute positively, as always, because we have to guarantee  peace, security, and development in all this Sahelian-Saharan  region.</p>

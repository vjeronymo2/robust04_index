			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's review of the Ozone SIP during 1987 and 1988 revealed that the intent of the requirement for RACT for major non-CTG sources had not been met. EPA tentatively identified several stationary sources which should have applied RACT since 1982, but were as yet unregulated. Reg 7 contained no mechanism for requiring control of these sources, other than a ``General Emission Limitation,'' for sources not specifically regulated by Reg 7, of 450 pounds per hour or 3000 pounds per day. This general limitation allowed sources to have actual emissions of up to nearly 550 tons per year before control was required. This provision clearly did not meet the 1982 SIP requirement, which was reiterated in the May 25, 1998, Appendix D Clarification document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address this concern, the State revised Reg 7 to delete the existing ``General Emission Limitation'' and to require RACT for stationary sources with potential emissions of VOC of 100 tons per year or more, under certain conditions. Section 7.II.C. applies this new RACT requirement to sources not specifically covered by the regulation as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Sources with actual emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs must apply RACT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Sources with potential emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs, but with actual emissions of less than 100 tons per year, may avoid having to apply RACT by obtaining a federally enforceable permit to limit production or hours of operation to keep actual emissions below 100 tons per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Sources with potential emissions of 100 tons per year or more of VOCs, but with actual emissions of less than 50 tons per year on a 12-month rolling average, may avoid RACT and permit requirements by: (1) Submitting a report each year demonstrating that the 50 tons per year threshold has not been exceeded; and (2) maintaining monthly records of VOC usage and emissions to enable the State to verify these reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State developed this approach to regulating 100 tons per year non-CTG sources after receiving comments on the proposed Reg 7 revisions from several industries in the Denver-Boulder area. These sources indicated that their processes involved a number of non-CTG category operations that are performed infrequently (such as painting letters on four production units per year), resulting in low actual emissions, but which would result in large potential emissions when calculated on an 8760 hour per year basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is approving section 7.II.C. of the State's rules for its strengthening effect on the SIP. The submitted rule is stronger than the pre-existing non-CTG RACT rule because it specifically applies to sources that have a potential to emit more than 100 tons per year of VOCs and that are not yet covered by a CTG. The rule requires those sources to adopt RACT on a case-by-case basis. The previous rule, which was a commitment of the State and did not directly affect non-CTG sources, only applied to those sources for which EPA subsequently issued a CTG. Therefore, the submitted rule strengthens the SIP because it applies to major sources not covered by a CTG. It should be noted that EPA is not addressing whether this rule establishes RACT for major stationary sources not subject to a CTG. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Denver-Boulder metropolitan area is classified as ``transitional'' for ozone under the CAA. This means that the area is legally designated as an ozone nonattainment area, although it did not experience violations of the ozone NAAQS during the 1987&hyph;1989 period used to classify areas under the 1990 CAA amendments. Therefore, the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area is not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement of Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the transitional ozone classification, EPA must review the available ambient air quality data and make a determination whether the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area has, in fact, attained the ozone NAAQS. In a letter dated October 22, 1992, from Jack McGraw, EPA Region VIII Acting Regional Administrator, to Governor Roy Romer, EPA Region VIII advised the State that EPA had reviewed ambient air quality data which had been entered by the State into the Aerometric Information and Retrieval System (AIRS) national database. EPA further advised that these data indicated that the Denver-Boulder metropolitan transitional ozone area, as defined in the November 6, 1991  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.306), had not violated the ozone NAAQS during the period beginning January 1, 1987, and ending on December 31, 1991. EPA's October 22, 1992 letter was not a determination that the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area had met the CAA's Section 107(d)(3)(E) criteria for redesignation to attainment, but rather served as an affirmation that no violation of the ozone standard for this area was found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 29 Jan (EFE) -- Manuel  Camacho Solis, government commissioner for peace and  reconciliation, today revealed seven points proposed by the  government to start a peace dialogue with the rebel Zapatista  National Liberation Army (EZLN). The government, Camacho Solis  said, accepted the agenda proposed by the rebels that consists  of seven points: economic demands, social demands, political  demands, democratic progress, an end to the hostilities, an end  to violent confrontations, and the establishment of guarantees  for the two parties.    At a news conference in the colonial city of San Cristobal  de  las Casas, about 750 km southeast of the Mexican capital,  Camacho Solis pointed out that the conditions for peace are  present, but he added that it is not known whether negotiations  with the rebels will start soon. The commissioner admitted that  the Indians are facing "serious living conditions" besides  racism and isolation and promised to open "legal opportunities  for the participation" of the armed rebels in society.    To end the hostilities, the commissioner proposed  "negotiation, agreements, declaration of a definitive end to the  hostilities, disarmament with guarantees for the two parties,  reconciliation, and return to work and open participation in  political life by the rebels." The commissioner said that "only  facts will create new conditions and added that they (the  rebels) must define their positions and be consistent with  them." Camacho Solis said that the nation is headed for  political change and added that the 21 August presidential  election will be held in peace.    "We either settle the problem in Chiapas correctly,  promptly,  seriously, and honestly, or a conflict bringing only  destruction, greater poverty, and isolation will take root," he  added. The commissioner pointed out that "there are no  middle-of-the-road points here; we either attain peace or  Chiapas will not achieve economic modernization and social  tranquillity. We need to reach peace through democracy and  determination."    Although Bishop Samuel Ruiz, official mediator of the  conflict between the government and the rebels, announced that  Camacho Solis and the EZLN command would meet "very soon," the  commissioner said he does not know when this meeting will take  place or "if it will take place at all." He added that the peace  negotiations should establish an agile mechanism to apply the  recently created Amnesty Law for freeing the rest of the  hostages and prisoners, reach agreements on the sentences that  are applicable to the Indians who participated in other social  struggles, and establish ways to apply the pardon.    Camacho Solis said that he sent a note to the rebels on the  points that were complied with for the release of former Chiapas  Governor Absalon Castellanos, who the insurgents want to  exchange for jailed EZLN members. Finally, Camacho Solis asked  the media in San Cristobal de las Casas to choose a group of 15  reporters from the most representative media to cover a possible  meeting.    In the past days Camacho Solis exchanged numerous  communiques  with the rebels in an attempt to start peace negotiations as  soon as possible. The population is awaiting these negotiations  "with anxiety," the local media reported.    The EZLN rebelled against the government on 1 January in the  State of Chiapas and clashed with the armed forces during the  first 10 days of the conflict. This produced an official toll  of 108 dead and thousands displaced.</p>

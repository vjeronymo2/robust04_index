			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Capital gains and the UK's balance of payments constraint 'GLOOM as trade deficit doubles'. Last Friday's Daily Mail headline, following a provisionally estimated current account deficit of pounds 794m in January, carried many echoes of the past. 1991's estimated current account deficit was 1 per cent of gross domestic product, down from 4 per cent in 1989 and 2.8 per cent in 1990. But if January's level were to continue, the deficit would be over 1 1/2   per cent of GDP this year, recession notwithstanding. Is the balance of payments about to disturb the sleep of British policy-makers once more? Not necessarily, suggests a monograph by Cliff Pratten of the Department of Applied Economics, Cambridge University, who concludes that over the course of the 1980s the UK enjoyed real capital gains of pounds 50.4bn (at end-1989 prices) on its net holdings of foreign assets.* What might Mr Pratten's numbers have to do with the balance of payments constraint? 'The implication of the current balance-of-payment deficit,' writes Mr Pratten, 'is that Britain's net overseas assets are falling; but this is not necessarily the case, because of changes in the value of Britain's assets and liabilities - that is capital gains (or losses).' Net gains in the real value of assets can allow the residents of a country to spend more than their conventionally measured income, without getting any poorer. Most of Mr Pratten's monograph is devoted to showing why official estimates of the UK's net international wealth (and changes in it) have been too low, the main reason being the valuation of direct investments at book value. His conclusion, shown in the table, is that between 1979 and 1989, UK residents became very much richer in their net holdings of international assets, even though the officially reported current account deficit was pounds17.2bn. Mr Pratten's work suggests that over a run of years the inflation-adjusted current account deficit would have to exceed around pounds 5bn in 1989 prices before the net international wealth of UK residents would deter-iorate; and it would also take a long time for UK residents to become net external debtors. So far, so comforting. But the analysis does take one only so far. Caveats include: Asset price instability. Official estimates show a decline of pounds 57.3bn in the gross value of UK resident's foreign assets in 1990 alone. Any home-owner who planned to finance consumption by borrowing against the increase in the value of his house knows too well what that means. Asset illiquidity. Many assets are illiquid, either because they are physical assets or because of how they are held. Pension funds, for example, cannot be liquidated to finance current consumption. False aggregation. Assets enjoyed by some UK residents are not at the disposal of others, be they private individuals, companies or the government. The country could suffer from a shortage of creditworthy borrowers, while still a net creditor. Governmental irresponsibility. Behaviour of the government may so frighten both domestic and foreign investors that capital flows out, regardless of the external asset position. Adverse payments trends. The growth in net borrowing over time may undermine people's willingness to lend to UK residents. The last problem is suggested by the chart (whose semi-logarithmic scale means that changes in slopes show changes in trends). The UK current account deficit has declined sharply since its peak in 1989. But this is largely because the volume of imports has fallen. Export performance has deteriorated, despite the recession. It is not difficult to envisage an explosion in the current account deficit when demand growth resumes. If so, this would provide a stern test for the now conventional view that the balance of payments need have no bearing on prospects for domestic growth. *Cliff Pratten, Overseas Investments, Capital Gains and the Balance of Payments, Research Monographs 48, Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: BALANCE OF PAYMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade figures are given in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

----------------------------------------------------------------------- All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 BRITAIN'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, 1979-89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Official estimates   Revised estimates In nominal terms              (pounds bn)          (pounds bn) Net assets at the end of 1979    +12.4               +19.5 Less the current account deficit during the 1980s ............... -17.2               -17.2 Add the balancing item during the 1980s .......................... +26.0               +26.0 Add the allocation of SDRs .....  +0.3                +0.3 Add capital gains during the 1980s .......................... +62.2               +82.3 Net assets at the end of 1989 .. +83.7              +110.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             At end 1979 prices  At end 1989 prices                             Official  Revised       Revised                             estimates estimates     estimates In real terms             (pounds bn) (pounds bn)   (pounds bn) Net assets at the end of 1979 ...............     +12.4       +19.5         +38.2 Net overseas investment     +11.4       +11.4         +22.3 Capital gains .........     +19.1       +25.8         +50.4 Assets at the end of 1989   +42.8       +56.7        +110.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cliff Pratten  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

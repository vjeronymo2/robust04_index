			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): A simple way into global bonds - Unit Trusts / Recessions are traditionally a good time to buy IT HAS become something of an old saw that, for unit trusts, 'past performance is no guide to future prospects'. Managers who specialise in international bonds, however, are only too pleased to tell this to clients, because performance in this sector has historically been poor, and was particularly bad in 1990. Nevertheless, a number of management groups, including Mercury, Barings, Newton and Fidelity, launched new global bond unit trusts earlier this year. The unit-trust international fixed interest sector dropped by an average of 6.2 per cent during 1990, according to Micropal. The sector has shown an increase of only 20.2 per cent over the last five years on Micropal's estimates. Over the last 10 years, it ranks 12th out of 19 sectors. Bond trusts also consistently under-perform the market as represented by the JP Morgan Government Bond Index. In the last five years, the index has returned 24.97 per cent - 4 per cent better than the average bond unit trust. In the last 12 months, the index has lost only 1.74 per cent, out-performing by almost 5 per cent unit trusts, which are weighed down by management fees. Financial advisers have retained some hostility towards the trusts, because of the high fees. Alan Torevell, of Torevell Mahon Granville, says that exchange-rate risks have been understated by managers; while Peter Smith, of Hill Martin, baulks at the front-end fees - he suggests buying bonds via European banks. However, trusts still provide the most practical way for small investors to tap international bonds. This is because several bonds need to be held in order to gain a 'spread' of risk, and deals are usually made in massive amounts - for example, French government bonds normally change hands in units of FFr10m (around Pounds 1m). The need to hold currency reserves - made considerably less important by the UK's full entry into the European Monetary System - in order to hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations also makes it difficult for a private investor to get involved. Bonds are still not good long-term investments, as the BZW gilt-equity study makes clear - Pounds 100 invested in gilts in 1918 would now be worth Pounds 47.30, while the same amount invested in equities would be priced at Pounds 8,039.20. But the same survey shows the best annual price increases in UK gilts all followed the trough of a recession: 1932, when prices rose 35.6 per cent; 1977 (30.6 per cent); and 1982 (36.2 per cent). Recessions are traditionally good times to buy bonds. Interest rates are now high, and the best time to buy into the bond market is when rates are about to fall. When interest rates are high, investors need a high rate of return, or 'yield', from bonds to tempt them away from other investments. As the amount paid out each year is fixed, this can only be done by cutting the price. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise again. This explains recent increased interest in UK gilts. David Rosier, managing director of Mercury Asset Management, put it this way: 'It was exactly this scenario that we had in 1982. Economic activity was absolutely flat. The gilt-edged market in 1982 returned 52 per cent, whereas the All-Share index returned about 30 per cent.' Nicholas Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says: 'Where we are now, with real yields very high, the Anglo-Saxon economies in recession, and inflation falling, we think it's a very attractive environment for the global bond investor.' He adds that 1990 was a bad year for bonds, because the German government issued debt in order to finance reunification, and raised interest rates. So prices fell. There are strong arguments for investing in foreign government securities, and not UK gilts, thanks to the UK's relatively high rate of inflation. Inflation reduces the 'real yield' received by the investor. Mr Rosier explains: 'If you look at inflation in this country, it is 9.5 per cent. The yield on gilts is 10.5 or 11 per cent, so you are getting about 1 per cent real yield. 'French inflation is about 3 per cent, but the yield on French government bonds is about 9 per cent. We think the opportunities for capital gains are greater in international bonds, because of the real yields available.' Paul Sheehan, manager of Newton Investment Management's fund, puts real yields from French bonds at 9.2 per cent, and from Dutch bonds at 9.3 per cent. He, like most of the other fund managers, will be concentrating on European bonds. He also notes that, since October, bond prices have already risen by 10 per cent in the US, and by 15 per cent in Japan. European bond prices have yet to start increasing. Hambros Bank's model suggests that the optimum time for investing in bonds may already have passed. This certainly seems to be the case in the Anglo-Saxon economies, while European markets will not offer such good value for much longer. Mr Henderson admits that bonds have never outperformed equities over a 10-year period, and does not see this happening in the future. However, he does see bonds as an ideal alternative to cash over a medium-term perspective of two or three years, when equities may still be in poor health. Over this time-scale, global bonds trusts could provide one of the few routes to a substantial gain, along with a welcome degree of security.</p>

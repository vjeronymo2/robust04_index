Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this visit will be a good  opportunity to confer with Syrian officials. He emphasized that  current important developments make such exchanges of views  necessary.    'Abd-al-Majid said he met with U.S. Commerce Secretary  Ronald  Brown yesterday, Thursday, and discussed with him several issues  connected with the peace process, regional economic cooperation,  and the Arab boycott of Israel.    Asked if agreement was reached during his meeting with the  U.S. commerce secretary to end this boycott, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  announced that the direct boycott will not be ended because the  reasons for it still exist. He said he hoped these factors will  soon disappear.    He added that what happened was that the U.S. secretary of  commerce asked him to consider the possibility of terminating  the indirect Arab boycott of Israel in view of its effect on a  large number of U.S. companies which are being boycotted by the  Arab countries because they deal with Israel.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Gas-fired station may be delayed THE GOVERNMENT is considering delaying for two years the construction of a Pounds 2bn gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd. The delay would jeopardise the development of four offshore oil and gas fields which are to supply the station. Any move against gas would spark a storm of protest and possibly legal actions against the government, which has previously shown strong support for diversification out of coal-fired electricity. The government is struggling to find a way of preserving enough of the 31 threatened coal mines to satisfy backbenchers. Difficulties in negotiations with the main power generators appear to have prompted Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to reassess previously rejected options for expanding the market for domestic coal. These include restricting the operation of new gas-fired power stations and tinkering with arrangements under which Britain imports nuclear-generated electricity from France. The government's problems have delayed publication of a white paper on the subject, which was originally due to appear last month. The cabinet committee dealing with coal is understood not to be meeting for the time being. Whitehall sources say the government has decided that it will allow PowerGen, the electricity generator, to go ahead with the Connah's Quay project. But it may want a two-year delay in construction, initially planned to start this year. This would mean that the plant would start producing electricity in 1998, when the coal contracts now under discussion expire. Connah's Quay will have the capacity to produce 1,350 MW, the equivalent of 4m tonnes of coal a year. PowerGen has told the government that a delay would be unacceptable to it and to Hamilton Oil and Gas, Monument and Lasmo, developers of the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field which will supply Connah's Quay. Mr Charles Howson, external affairs manager at Hamilton, said a two-year delay could 'jeopardise the whole economics of the project'. The project's partners have invested more than Pounds 70m in preparing for development of the offshore fields. The project would create some 4,000 jobs in the depressed north Wales area. Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director of Monument, said government interference in the project would place a question mark over the economics of oil and gas investment in the UK. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, has promised to raise the matter with Mr Heseltine following repeated requests from Mr Barry Porter, Tory MP for Wirral South.</p>

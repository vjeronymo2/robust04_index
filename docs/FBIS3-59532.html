			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Viola: "Companies: Goodbye Research. </F> Funds Remain Unused"]    [Text] Crisis reigns in applied research laboratories.  The difficult economic situation has forced companies to cut  back on expenditure and revise investment plans. Likewise R&amp;D  programs: Applications for funding submitted to the IMI [Italian  Institute for Financing Real and Personal Property] (pursuant to  Law No. 46 of 1982) over the past 10 months have almost halved  compared to 1992. That is not all: Around 30 firms have even  withdrawn projects submitted some time ago, and which were  finally approaching their funding goal.    Research therefore is undergoing a crisis. Although the last  budget law provided for an allocation of 150 billion lire for  1994, 250 billion for 1995, and 300 billion for 1996, to  supplement the IMI fund which had not received any contributions  since 1988, companies are now tightening their belts. The 393  requests for funding totaling 2.6 trillion lire submitted in  1992, have dropped to only 203 projects for a total of 1.25  trillion in 1993 (October figures). The drop mostly involves  independent programs, those performed by large and State-owned  corporations: 194 in 1992 and 77 in 1993. Even the EUREKA  [European Research Coordination Agency] internation research  projects have fallen from 34 to 15.    "I believe this decline to be a natural consequence of the  present economic situation," remarked Giuseppe Colona, head of  the applied research division at IMI, "and I do not think it is  a result of lack of resources or other basic problems. For over  a year now, after the sudden rise in interest rates in 1992,  firms have had to tackle serious financial problems and  therefore revise all investment plans." He added: "An analysis  of the projects presented over the past year has also shown that  the amount requested for each one has risen slightly. This  means that preference is being given to more useful research  rather than marginal topics."    Therefore, which experiments which have been abandoned and  which are being continued? "It would be highly risky for firms  to abandon research that is closely linked to production needs,  since this could automatically exclude them from the market,"  explained Gianni Cozzi, industrial innovation research director  at IEFE-Bocconi. "I feel that the cutbacks refer to  nonstrategic research. I also believe that the drop in funding  applications is related to privatization of some State-owned  firms which made large use of the rotating fund in the past."    If the current economic situation is indicated as being the  main cause for abandoning research, responsibility should also  be shared with the lengthy funding mechanism. On average, a  funding application takes three years to be fully approved by  the IMI and the Ministry of Research as required by law. This  is sufficient for an innovative project to become dated.    "Firms are losing interest in funding granted by the IMI,"  said Roberto Ciarlone, in charge of industrial policy at  Confindustria [Italian Manufacturers' Federation], "slow  procedures and the lack of resources which have plagued the fund  for years are no incentive. This is in addition to the fact that  entrepreneurs are required to provide substantial financial  guarantees, albeit not a legal requirement, and impossible for  small firms."    In the meantime, urged by Confindustria, the IMI, and  universities, the Ministry for Scientific Research has  reexamined the old project to amend Law No. 46. "We have  planned a long series of amendments," explained Scientific  Research Minister Umberto Colombo, "to streamline the law and  toughen up the controls it contents. We will allocate funding  after only eight months' reviewal, but we want the research  funded to be truly applicable to production and markets."    The first amendments, aimed at speeding up procedures, have  been adopted through a circular from the ministry that is now  awaiting the go-ahead from CIPE [Interdepartmental Committee for  Economic Planning]. However, a bill has already been prepared  for a more extensive reform: systems for monitoring and  controlling the work of the companies financed, regulation of  the government's rights over national research programs, and  procedures adapted to small production units.</p>

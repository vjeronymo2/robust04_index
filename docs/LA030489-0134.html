			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THEY SEE;  </P> <P> IS WHAT YOU GET  </P> <P> The Gypsy fortuneteller relaxed on the sofa, looking decidedly unexotic, even  with her long, white, lacquered fingernails.  </P> <P> She curled against a pillow, chatting easily about the psychic trade, as if she  was a peddler of ice cream. A pearl necklace hung loosely around her throat.  Her piercing brown eyes were warm and comforting.  </P> <P> Diane Adams most definitely is not the Transylvanian-accented crone of TV and  movie legend.  </P> <P> No incense-choked storefront shop. No heavy shawl drawn close around the  shoulders. No low lights or flickering candles either.  </P> <P> There was even a whiff of disinfectant in the tidy room, as if some compulsive  hygienist had only moments before sprayed the place.  </P> <P> "I feel (my powers are) my gift from God," said Adams, proprietress of Psychic  Readings by Diane in Fullerton. "It just comes naturally, like the way you see  or breathe. Most of the people I read for are hesitant at first, because they  don't know about it. But once they come in and understand, there's no fear  whatsoever.  </P> <P> "It's the unknown" that frightens them, she said.  </P> <P> People are bothered by the unknown, no doubt. But one of the lingering  mysteries to many in modern times remains these olive-skinned Gypsy women who  purport to see the future. Her mother had the psychic gift too, Adams said,  "and I know one of my daughters will get it. It has never really failed. My  mother, grandmother, great-grandmother. It just carries on."  </P> <P> Unlike many Roma -- as Gypsies prefer to call themselves -- Adams is not at all  reluctant to claim her heritage from this clannish group with its origins  centuries ago in northern India.  </P> <P> They are a people who have remained almost fervently aloof from the non-Gypsy  -- or gadjo -- world around them, shunning publicity. Theirs is a history of  persecution and moving on. And some traditions, such as secrecy, die hard.  </P> <P> (One fortuneteller refused to allow a tape recorder in the room or to have her  picture taken. "It takes away the energy level," she said. "It weakens the  power.")  </P> <P> But it wasn't the past that concerned Adams recently as she led a visitor to  her reading room past an oddly out-of-place pay telephone. It was the future --  specifically, my future.  </P> <P> Nailed above the reading room's door was a horseshoe, a gift from a frequent  client, Adams said. Then she laughed: "I'm not too superstitious."  </P> <P> A picture of Jesus stared down from the wall. On a bureau stood a white candle  from Germany carved with a likeness of John the Baptist. A statue of St.  Nicholas flanked the candle.  </P> <P> After seating me at a glass-topped table, Adams asked me to think hard of two  wishes, cradling my palms in her hands. I was told to repeat the wishes aloud  before she began. Curiously, they were never mentioned again.  </P> <P> She read my palms, making a prediction, then pausing to hear my reactions to  it. "What does that mean to you?" was a question she asked often, encouraging  long and thoughtful replies.  </P> <P> It is an entrancing experience, having one's life described by a stranger -- an  exercise as seductive as looking at a photograph of one's self. At the very  least, what a visitor buys here for $20 is an attentive listener and guilt-free  self-absorption.  </P> <P> And isn't that the function, at its heart, of analysts, psychiatrists and  psychologists? Isn't it possible that what we have here is the poor man's  analyst? Armed with skepticism, or informed superstition, is the  fortuneteller's client really worse off, contrasted with analysis?  </P> <P> In visits to four randomly selected county fortunetellers and in telephone  conversations with several others, some as a declared journalist and others  incognito, I found nothing particularly shady or suspicious -- nor anything  more enlightening than what could be found in a fortune cookie.  </P> <P> "You have a winning way. Keep it," said the cookie from a Chinese restaurant.  </P> <P> "You try to comfort people," said Diane Adams.  </P> <P> Just as a jumble of cookie fortunes pulled from a hat might reveal some  astonishingly precise and concrete perceptions about a person, so too will a  half-hour interview -- especially if the interviewer is a lifelong student of  human behavior, as most fortunetellers are.  </P> <P> Studying human behavior is, after all, their job. Adams said she began as a  small girl in her mother's fortunetelling shop.  </P> <P> But the fortuneteller's advantage over a cookie, other than lack of calories,  is not so much prophetic powers as personal contact with the visitor. How many  people enjoy the undivided attention of another sympathetic person for up to an  hour? To a skeptic, that seems to be the psychic's most tangible service.  </P> <P> "It's like getting motherly advice without your mother," one psychic's client  confided in Seal Beach.  </P> <P> So long as a visitor knows not to leave a bag of money behind to be exorcised  of any curse -- an old scam of unscrupulous fortunetellers -- a little  introspection seems the only consequence.  </P> <P> "Sure, some people are fakes," Adams admitted. "And there's good psychics and  bad psychics, just like any business."  </P> <P> But as to comparisons of her "powers" with psychoanalysis or therapy, she just  smiled.  </P> <P> In keeping with the county's emerging cultural diversity, Adams' year-old shop  in Fullerton shares a one-story office building with Tseng's Acupuncture Total  Health Center.  </P> <P> Like many fortunetellers in recent years, she is a relative newcomer to the  county.  </P> <P> Of course, fortunetelling has probably existed here since the first Europeans  arrived, but for many years much of it was illegal. Some sweeping local  ordinances even prohibited foretelling the future, even at no charge.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles lawyer Barry A. Fisher argued in a landmark 1985 case before  the California Supreme Court that such bans were unconstitutional violations of  freedom of speech and religion.  </P> <P> Many fortunetelling laws were so broad that they could be construed to include  Bible readings, newspaper horoscopes and even weather forecasts, he said.  </P> <P> Fisher, who frequently represents Gypsies and fortunetellers, prevailed. The  court's ruling ended longstanding bans on fortunetelling in many California  cities. Among those whose bans were struck down were Laguna Beach, Fullerton,  Brea, Yorba Linda, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "Look at Nancy Reagan," said Fisher, recalling the court ruling. "She is not  alone. Astrologers, palmists in touch with the spiritual world, it all goes  back to the beginning of time.  </P> <P> "In a more sophisticated sense, people consult their religious leaders --  prophets living and deceased. People go to church and try to live their lives  based on prophecy. It gets to the heart of what church and religion are about."  </P> <P> Even people who go to fortunetellers simply for the entertainment value, Fisher  added, are exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech.  </P> <P> It didn't take a clairvoyant to predict that business in the spirits would pick  up after the court ruling, even as some cities redrafted their laws to require  permits and even photographs and fingerprints.  </P> <P> "I think cities recognize today that you can't prohibit the activity," Fisher  said. "They are licensing the activities in increasing numbers."  </P> <P> Indeed. Fisher's client in the 1985 Supreme Court case out of Azusa, Fatima  Stevens, has since resettled in Anaheim. She advertises herself as "The World  Famous Mrs. Stevens" in the telephone directory. Apparently preferring a less  famous media profile these days, Stevens declined an interview.  </P> <P> In some areas of the county, the clairvoyance competition is heating up and  even turning nasty. A Gypsy family moved into Newport Beach from Texas 2 years  ago and created quite a stir in the already-entrenched Romany circle working  the waterfront spiritual trade. Rebuffed, the newcomers complained in a civil  suit of harassment and threats to their shops. The case is pending.  </P> <P> The financial stakes in crystals and Tarot cards can be high. A north county  seer motors around in a new Cadillac with a cellular telephone and a vanity  license plate that reads PALMRDR.  </P> <P> One Anaheim psychic advertises a shuttle bus service to her parlor from  Disneyland and convention-area motels.  </P> <P> None of the fortunetellers interviewed for this story, however, were willing to  disclose their incomes.  </P> <P> Diane Adams of Seal Beach Psychic -- who is not related to Diane Adams of  Fullerton -- shook her head no when asked if her work pays for her stylishly  decorated shop with its crystals and huge ceramic palm in the display window.  </P> <P> "My husband is in real estate," she said with a broad grin. "This is part-time  work."  </P> <P> (There seemed something supernatural in the name coincidence. The mystery only  deepened when both women -- who do not resemble each other -- also said they  prefer to go by the first name of Ann. But secular curiosity got this visitor  no closer to an explanation.)  </P> <P> Based on an unscientific Times survey, it appears that most psychics charge  similar rates for similar services. The cost increases depending on how far  backward or forward one wishes to look.  </P> <P> No one hesitated to quote a price over the telephone. In fact, fortunetellers  prefer that clients call ahead to make an appointment.  </P> <P> As things can be with the ethereal world, it is best to be flexible in trying  to schedule an appointment. One clairvoyant could not be reached for a week,  her husband said, because she was meditating to restore her powers.  </P> <P> Anyway, a typical palm reading runs about $20 in the county. With that, one  buys a look at what's supposed to happen in the coming months, sometimes up to  a year. Palmistry would appear to be based on fairly concrete rules of reading.  Life, fate and prosperity lines are set in the flesh.  </P> <P> Each of the four fortunetellers I visited told me to expect two children, that  I would live into my 80s and that I would be prosperous and marry twice. That  latter detail was a little distressing to my first and only wife. Even though  any insurance actuarial chart has about the same expectations for anyone my  age, she plans to have her own reading. Alone.  </P> <P> Of course, one can buy any of dozens of books on palmistry to try at home. The  illustrated pages make it all seem easy, but in fact it's a lot like reading an  automotive repair manual to fix a carburetor: The pictures and text are all  there, but somehow the pieces don't fit back together. Without the mechanic  present, one never knows what went wrong.  </P> <P> Prices escalate when cards, crystals and tea leaves are called upon to reveal  their secrets. Tarot card readings cost $30 to $45. Psychometry or psychic  readings go for $35 to $60 (here the seer holds a frequently handled item such  as keys or a watch, things that supposedly radiate the client's energy).  </P> <P> Crystal balls, those ubiquitous glass orbs that Hollywood favors, are generally  the most expensive readings. They can cost $150 and more, telling the visitor  of things to come 10 years away. Crystal balls also reveal stories of other  people in one's life, or so the psychics claim.  </P> <P> "If a person wants to know a lot of things, a palm or psychic reading is not  enough," said the Seal Beach Adams. "Most people who come in know what reading  they want. Most come for the crystal ball. They like to know a lot of things."  </P> <P> Fortunetellers also follow certain unwritten rules. For example, they generally  ask before a reading whether a client wants to hear bad news too.  </P> <P> "But most people say don't hide anything," Adams said.  </P> <P> Also, they never tell their own fortunes, "because when you're psychic, you're  supposed to use it for others," she said.  </P> <P> And they do not pick the daily double -- at least not for customers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. HOLLYWOOD TO ALLOW APARTMENT CONVERSIONS;  </P> <P> PLANNING: COUNCIL SAYS HOTELIER CAN CONVERT HIS BUILDINGS TO HOTELS IF HE PAYS  $4.9 MILLION OVER 20 YEARS.  </P> <P> After softening a series of strict conditions imposed by a city commission, the  West Hollywood City Council voted Monday to allow hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy to  proceed with a plan to convert several apartment buildings to hotels in  exchange for $4.9 million paid to the city over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> Although city officials said Ashkenazy is likely to accept the compromise  agreement in the long-running dispute, not everybody was happy to see the  restrictions loosened.  </P> <P> "I think the City Council thinks with a happy, warm feeling that they went  along with the Planning Commission. Unfortunately, they did not go along with  the spirit of the whole thing the Planning Commission had done," said Jeanne  Dobrin, an opponent of the hotel agreements.  </P> <P> Mayor Abbe Land said the restrictions will protect the surrounding  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "We worked together very hard to try and address the many concerns we heard. We  did try and incorporate the planning commission recommendations," Land said.  </P> <P> The agreement reached between the city and financially troubled Ashkenazy  Enterprises Inc. last December would allow the company to convert the buildings  to hotels in exchange for the payments, including $1.2 million in delinquent  hotel occupancy taxes and penalties.  </P> <P> In June and July, the city Planning Commission substantially restricted the  proposed conversions after irate neighbors denounced the agreements as a  sellout by the city and complained that the hotels would be an unwanted  commercial intrusion into residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission denied liquor permits to the proposed hotels, imposed  restrictions on parking, delivery traffic, noise, and the hours and types of  parties that would be allowed at the hotels. The commission also denied plans  to add on to Ashkenazy's Bel Age hotel.  </P> <P> On Monday, the council overturned the commission's severe restrictions,  allowing a liquor permit at one site and partial liquor permits at two others.  Among the new conditions, the council agreed to limit the number of people  allowed at hotel parties to 50, make it illegal for tour buses to park with  engines running at the hotels and mandated that there be adequate free parking  for hotel guests.  </P> <P> Councilman Paul Koretz, the only member to consistently oppose the plans  Monday, criticized the settlement.  </P> <P> "I'm not completely satisfied. While Ashkenazy is not the ogre many have  portrayed him as, he has not been a particularly good neighbor," Koretz said.  "The council obviously chose to give him his settlement. . . . It worked to  Ashkenazy's convenience."  </P> <P> Dobrin, who led an estimated 40 speakers opposed to the hotel plan at Monday's  public hearing, said public pressure was not wholly unsuccessful, however.  </P> <P> "We did win a lot of points," Dobrin said. She said opponents may consider  future steps but had not yet made any decisions.  </P></p>

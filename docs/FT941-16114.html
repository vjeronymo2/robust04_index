			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Corrupt plot over Sizewell admitted A former procurement manager with NEI Thompson Kennicott, the engineering company taken over by Rolls-Royce in 1989, yester-day pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court in London to a charge of conspiracy to corrupt, John Mason writes. Mr Robert Wilcox, of Colchester, Essex, admitted conspiring to receive gifts in connection with contracts awarded to NEI by the Central Electricity Generating Board for its Sizewell B power station. Two other men, Mr Donald Richards, the head of Donnar Services, a marketing company, and Mr Colin Read, another former NEI project manager, in September admitted a similar offence of corruption. All three have been released on bail and will be sentenced later. Mr Wilcox's guilty plea ends a series of prosecutions by the Serious Fraud Office over cases of corruption in tenders for big projects. The previous investigations centred on contracts awarded by BP and Shell in their North Sea oil operations and Transmarche Link for the Channel tunnel.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Ashdown sets out sovereignty stance Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday said he did not believe in the sovereignty of parliament. He said the Liberal Democrat party was the only one willing to let the British people decide their future in the European Union and he offered a referendum in the event of a further shift of power from Britain to Brussels at the 1996 inter-governmental conference. Mr Ashdown said in an interview with GMTV: 'There is this great theory that sovereignty lies in parliament. I do not believe in the sovereignty of parliament. I never have. I believe in the sovereignty of the people.' He said he would have wanted a referendum on a single European currency but the decision had already been taken that this should be decided by a future parliament. 'But if (the single currency) were to come I cannot see any circumstances it would be in British interests to be outside it,' he added. Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats could well recommend a change in the balance of power between Westminster and Brussels because 'it gives us more security and better cost-effectiveness for money spent on defence'. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said: 'Paddy Ashdown keeps letting the rat out of the bag - and the British people should take note. 'The Liberals are wholly committed to a centralised European superstate. Only the Conservatives stand for a strong Britain at the heart of a strong and diverse Europe.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 26 (AFP) -- Palestinian  "ministers" held the first meeting of the new authority on the  Gaza Strip on Sunday [26 June] to review progress in self-rule,  officials said.    International Cooperation and Planning Minister Nabil Sha'th  chaired the talks at the old Israeli administration building in  Gaza City.    The session was to be followed by a meeting with  representatives of the World Bank on the disbursement of  international aid to the Palestinians, who have criticized the  lack of readily available funds since autonomy was launched on  May 4.    Sha'th, who negotiated the Cairo agreement which launched  autonomy, said Saturday that Israel and the PLO would resume  talks on Tuesday on outstanding questions involving self-rule.    These would include the size of the self-rule enclave of  Jericho and the fate of thousands of Palestinian prisoners as  well as the spreading of autonomy across the West Bank.    But the venue for the negotiations has not been settled and  Israel, which has suggested Cairo, has not officially announced  any meeting.    Among those attending Sunday were West Bank Fatah leader  Faysal Husayni, Local Government Minister Sa'ib 'Urayqat and  Tourism Minister Ilyas Frayj.    A press conference was due to be held later in the day.</p>

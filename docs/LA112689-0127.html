			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NITTANY LIONS WIN AND BRING HOLIDAY CHEER  </P> <P> A kicker named Ray Tarasi brought some holiday smiles to men dressed in red  jackets Saturday when he made a 20-yard field goal with 13 seconds left to give  Penn State a 16-13 victory over Pittsburgh at Pitt Stadium.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, Penn State Coach Joe Paterno accepted an invitation from  Holiday Bowl officials to bring his Nittany Lions to San Diego. It will be Penn  State's first Holiday Bowl appearance.  </P> <P> Penn State (7-3-1) will play the Western Athletic Conference champion Brigham  Young Friday, Dec. 29, at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Tarasi's field goal prevented Penn State from going winless in its final three  games, something no bowl official likes to contemplate for one of its  participants. In its previous two games, Penn State lost to Notre Dame (34-23)  and tied Maryland (13-13).  </P> <P> "I don't know why these guys in red coats were so concerned," said Penn State  Athletic Director Jim Tarman, referring to bowl officials. "Joe said we'd go to  the Holiday Bowl with seven wins."  </P> <P> Penn State's three losses this season have been to Notre Dame, Virginia (14-6)  and Alabama (17-16).  </P> <P> Holiday Bowl officials have looked at Penn State since the first weekend they  were allowed to scout teams in mid-October.  </P> <P> "We started bearing in on them pretty hard then," said John Reid, executive  director. "You look at the teams they've lost to and they've had a pretty  incredible season."  </P> <P> Said Paterno: "I've been to San Diego several times, and I'm anxious to have my  squad go out there and see what a great city it is."  </P> <P> Paterno said he never seriously considered another bowl bid.  </P> <P> "No, when it looked like this thing was starting to firm up, I told Jim  (Tarman) to call John Reid and see if they wanted us when it was the  appropriate time to make the bid. I said we'd really be interested."  </P> <P> Penn State has never played BYU.  </P> <P> "I don't think the score will be 16-13," Paterno said. "LaVell (Edwards, BYU's  coach) might take it easy on me because I'm his buddy. He is a very special  friend of mine.  </P> <P> "We'll make a deal -- we'll throw the ball and he'll run the ball and we'll  have a very dull game."  </P> <P> The Holiday Bowl has guaranteed each team $1 million, an increase from its  payout of $907,613 apiece last year.  </P> <P> The Holiday Bowl is sold out, the earliest sellout in the game's history. It  will be televised by ESPN.  </P></p>

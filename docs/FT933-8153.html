			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's dairy marketers prepare for a shake-up - Battle lines are being drawn ahead of deregulation THE PONDEROUS and still incomplete reform of the UK system of milk marketing has had rather less appeal than watching a vat of cheese curdle. Progress over a period of three years has been painfully slow and it has often seemed that after every step forward the industry negotiators have slipped two back. Some tardiness was inevitable, as deregulation of the milk market was forced on the UK by the European Community because of the monopoly powers of the marketing boards. Most dairy farmers, together with the elected milk-producing members of the boards, resent the loss of an organisation that has served them and their fathers well since the 1930s. But some momentum is beginning to build, albeit at a stately pace. Late last month, the Agriculture Bill permitting the winding-up of agricultural marketing boards received the royal assent. Sometime next month the Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales will publish its proposals for reorganising itself into a co-operative called Milk Marque. By November, it is hoped, Milk Marque will have issued contracts to farmers to supply it with milk; and sometime between April and October 1994 the new organisation will begin trading. The latest delay is caused, apparently, by the need for Brussels bureaucrats to agree the terms under which Milk Marque can keep some of its subsidiaries. These include the one that runs the present board's cattle breeding services; National Milk Records, which is exactly what its name implies and provides management advice based on herd yields recorded by board staff; and Quality Testing, a laboratory service that assesses milk purity and freedom from bacteria. It has already been agreed that the board's main subsidiary, the milk processor Dairy Crest, will be floated on the stock exchange with dairy farmers being issued with most of the shares. Meanwhile, although Milk Marque has said it hopes to purchase 80 per cent of the milk produced in England and Wales, other would-be players in the game after deregulation are beginning to jockey for position. One of the first to express interest in buying milk direct from farmers was the Co-operative Wholesale Society. It has been holding meetings with dairy farmers for the past two years to tell them what a good buyer it would be, but has not come up with a positive proposal so far. Last January, Northern Foods launched the Northern Milk Partnership together with disillusioned ex-milk board vice-chairman Mr Richard Smith. The partnership, it is explained, would act as the procurement agency for the milk required by Northern Foods. The declared target was for 18 per cent of present production, or 2bn litres of milk a year. Last week, Northern Foods said that it had commitments for 75 per cent of the total. Nestle was the next to go public with a proposed contract, released last spring, although the company made it clear that it was only interested in producers close to its processing factories, implying a limited demand. Danish-based MD Foods also entered the ring this summer, indicating that it wanted to buy milk direct from UK farmers and the company sent a caravan round some agricultural shows to try to drum up interest. Irish dairy company Avonmore has declared that it expects to be another buyer of British milk from British farmers. In addition Unigate, CPC Ambrosia and the newly-independent Dairy Crest are expected to want to purchase direct from farms. Whether all will eventually secure the contracts they seek is open to conjecture. But as they battle for their share of the new free milk market, it is reasonable to assume that they will be prepared to pay keen prices for supplies and that this may continue for a year or two, until the shape of the market becomes established. Moreover, the managing director designate of Milk Marque, Mr Andrew Dare, has already said that he expects his new company's price for milk to be among the three highest in Europe. This was clearly a shot across the bows of his likely competitors and they will equally clearly be forced to match such prices if they want to stay in the game. So milk producers can probably look forward to a short-term boom. But the background to all this anticipated activity in a sector that accounts for 20 per cent of UK farm production is that it has been losing its share of the home market, mainly to European competition. According to Mr Bud Wendover, head of strategic development for Food from Britain, the UK farming industry's promotional agency, the country's total dairy trade deficit increased last year by 35 per cent to a record Pounds 609m, with the balance of trade with other EC members worsening by 38 per cent. The root of the problem, he said, was that 'much of our home-based production is still focused on products of low value in declining markets, while we import higher value products. This cannot be in the interests of either producers or processors'. For while UK sales of liquid milk continue to decline, sales of cream, yoghurt and some cheeses are steadily increasing - and many of those added-value milk products are being imported. The main reason for Britain's failure to respond adequately to changes in the market mix is historical. Prior to the introduction of milk quotas in 1984, UK dairy farmers were being encouraged by the government to produce as much milk as they could, irrespective of demand. It was denied at the time, as was the possibility of the introduction of quotas, but it was clearly an attempt to enable Britain to qualify for as big a production entitlement as possible. But that milk had to be disposed of and the only markets guaranteed by the EC at the time were for butter and skimmed milk powder, which were sold as surpluses to EC intervention stores. Plants to process those low-value products were established and most continue to operate. The present growth area, however, is the market for fresh chilled dairy products such as prepared desserts, yoghurts and soft cheeses. European dairy companies have been quick to recognise this fact and are cashing in. For the good of UK Ltd as well as a dairy farmers, therefore, it is important that whoever eventually purchases milk from British farmers should position themselves to exploit growth opportunities on our doorstep, rather than leaving them to be filled from abroad.</p>

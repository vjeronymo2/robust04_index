			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Royal Ordnance purchase cleared The sale of British Manufacturing and Research, a munitions manufacturer, to Royal Ordnance, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, will not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Department of Trade and Industry announced. British Manufacturing was sold for about Pounds 8m by Cork Gully, the receivers of Astra Holdings, in April this year. The purchase gave BAe ownership of the two largest munitions factories in the UK. The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation into the deal after failed rival bidders complained that they had made higher offers, and that Cork Gully had withheld financial information about the company. The competition implications of the deal were also considered.</p>

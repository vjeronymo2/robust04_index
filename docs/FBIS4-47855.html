			<p>BFN     [Text] With just over 66 percent of the provisional  national votes now known, the ANC will be the dominating party  in the National Assembly with 251 seats, compared with the NP  [National Party] with 88, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] with  34, and the Freedom Front [FF] with 11 seats. The DP  [Democratic Party] should have seven seats, the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] six, the African Christian Democratic  Party [ACDP] two, and the African Moderates Congress Party  [AMCP] one seat. This means that eight parties could take their  seats in the National Assembly. Until now none of the other  smaller parties has obtained enough support for a seat in the  assembly. According to the latest provisional results the ANC  has 64.8 percent of the national vote, compared with the NP's  20.5 percent.</p>

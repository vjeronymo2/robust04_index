			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIANO WORKS BY WUORINEN, RAVEL, BEACH  </P> <P> Romantic late-19th Century Lisztian rhetoric and abrasive late 20th-Century  motorism make an odd pairing. But the combination worked convincingly when Alan  Feinberg played at the Arnold Schoenberg Institute on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The American pianist, making his third appearance at the USC facility, offered  Charles Wuorinen's complex, belligerently atonal and hyperactive Third Sonata  (1986) to end his recital, then immediately followed it with an encore in Mrs.  H.H.A. (Amy) Beach's "Dreaming," a Schumannesque nocturne of stunning beauties  and virtuosic bent, written in 1892.  </P> <P> Feinberg's versatility, already proven in the earlier part of this program --  when he played three pieces by Ravel, surrounded by works of George Edwards,  Robert Helps and Iannis Xenakis -- made this juxtaposition seem natural. He  gave each composer his/her due, made the appropriate stylistic differentiations  and delivered each musical dialect in the right accent.  </P> <P> Wuorinen's sonata, written for Feinberg -- and which the pianist described as  "a little bit of New York . . . 20 different people speaking 20 different  languages, all rushing to get in the subway" -- is a construct of nervous  hostility, in its outer movements a perpetual motion of urban dissonance. Mrs.  Beach's ballade-like Opus 15, No. 3, deals in an earlier sophistication, but  one ostensibly foreign to Wuorinen's. The two composers share only their  earnest Americanness.  </P> <P> The New York-based pianist made the most of his opportunities here, as well as  in Edwards' provocative "Suave Mari Magno," which Feinberg translated as "Over  Calm Seas." He also gave satisfying attention to Helps' "Trois Hommages" and to  Xenakis' brief, disturbing and delightful "Hommage a Ravel."  </P> <P> His playing of the French composer's "Menuet Antique" Prelude (1913) and  "Ondine" suffered only from a lack of the coloristic variety that another piano  might have been able to provide. It is time the Schoenberg Institute got  another keyboard instrument, preferably one with another brand name.  </P></p>

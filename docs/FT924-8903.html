			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Confidence in UK economy falls to lowest level CONFIDENCE among business leaders about the UK economy has fallen to its lowest level since the Gulf war, Andrew Taylor writes. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said that only 10 per cent of directors questioned for a survey last month felt 'more optimistic' about the economy compared with 50 per cent in a similar survey in June. Mr Morgan said confidence was only two percentage points above the figure during the Gulf conflict in February last year.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS IN TOURIST GARB SUSPECTED IN ARAB DEATH  </P> <P> Gunmen dressed as tourists, down to the wearing of shorts and the carrying of  cameras, shot dead a Palestinian stone thrower and wounded three others  Saturday, Arab witnesses said. The incident appears to be the latest chapter of  a covert war where participants in the Arab uprising are assassinated on the  spot.  </P> <P> Also Friday, the body of an American-Palestinian was found in a field near the  West Bank town of Al Birah, the apparent victim of torture and a shooting,  family members said. The U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem has asked for an  investigation.  </P> <P> Residents of Bethlehem said that between six and eight gunmen, who were seen  carrying knapsacks and tourist maps, loitered near St. Mary's Syrian Church at  the top of a staircase that leads down to Manger Square, the traditional site  of Jesus' birth.  </P> <P> As happens almost every morning, masked youths and young men taunted soldiers  who were stationed below until the troops began an armed pursuit. As one such  group threw stones at approaching soldiers, at least two gunmen pulled  revolvers, shooting one stone-thrower in the chest and three in the legs. The  dead victim, Radi Mahmoud Salah, was from the village of Dar Salah on the  outskirts of Bethlehem.  </P> <P> For more than a year, Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents have used a  series of disguises -- from Arab dress to journalistic credentials and  apparently now tourist garb -- in order to close in on Palestinian protesters  and stone throwers.  </P> <P> The use of civilian dress by Israeli soldiers and the Shin Bet security service  and the stalking of Palestinian rebels have brought up uncomfortable parallels  with tactics common to so-called dirty wars in countries like Argentina and El  Salvador.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shot Them in Cold Blood'  </P> <P> "I could not believe my eyes," said a druggist who witnessed the shooting in  Bethlehem. "They grabbed them and shot them in cold blood."  </P> <P> Residents viewed the use of such cover as endangering foreigners in Bethlehem,  a place where the Arab uprising and pilgrimage have been carried on side by  side. Leaders of the uprising had told their followers to avoid throwing rocks  at tourist buses entering the city or parked in Manger Square.  </P> <P> "We like tourists here. We never bother them," said a bread salesman who also  witnessed the killing. "But now, we must suspect them, too."  </P> <P> As he spoke, an eight-year-old pointed aggressively at two unwary tourists from  Bethlehem, each carrying a camera, and yelled in English: "No good, no good."  An army spokesmen said only that the stone throwers were shot by security  forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arab-American Slain  </P> <P> The shootings in Bethlehem coincided with the grisly discovery of the body of  14-year-old Amjad Hussein Jibreen in Al Birah, north of Jerusalem. Jibreen, who  was born in Denver and maintained American citizenship, was shot in the chest,  and his body showed signs of a beating and cigarette burns, family members  said.  </P> <P> Residents of Al Birah say the boy was last seen leaving a mosque in Ramallah  last Wednesday, two days after youths in the city threw firebombs at a car  carrying four Israeli tax collectors. Two of the passengers were badly burned.  </P> <P> Family members said they were told that the boy was held by the army. The army  spokesmen denied it.  </P> <P> The U.S.-based Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee demanded an investigation  into the killing of Jibreen.  </P> <P> Jibreen's cousin, Ayman, said the body was discovered Saturday morning by a  shepherd in the hills near Al Birah and was quickly buried.  </P> <P> Ayman said he saw the body after it was discovered and that it appeared that  his cousin was shot at close range. "There were burns on his body, some of his  teeth were knocked out, and there was a bullet in his chest," he said.  </P> <P> Amjad Jibreen moved to his mother's hometown of Al Birah in 1983. His father,  Wathak, lives in Miami.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discovery Sparks Rioting  </P> <P> The discovery of the body set off rioting in Al Birah, and the army sealed off  the town. Troops also piled sand high on the road to the Jibreen household to  keep reporters and mourners away.  </P> <P> More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers during the  20-month uprising. Palestinians have killed another 80 of their own people  suspected of collaborating with Israel. Thirty-five Israelis and two foreigners  have died at the hands of Palestinians.  </P></p>

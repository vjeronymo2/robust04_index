			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas held back by C-17 side DESPITE improvements in most of its government aerospace programmes, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas reported 1992 full-year earnings well below those of 1991 because of large loss provisions for its controversial C-17 military transport programme and lower earnings from its commercial aircraft segment. Company executives forecast stronger cash-flow in 1993, with Mr Herbert Lanese, chief financial officer, stating that cost-cutting and previously-announced asset sales would generate Dollars 1bn in cash flow next year. The company's total aerospace debt fell to Dollars 2.77bn at the end of 1992, down from Dollars 2.86bn on September 30. 'Most of our businesses are now getting good competitive returns by industry standards,' Mr John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas chairman said. 'We expect the C-17 programme to be profitable in 1993, as we complete the transition from development into production. Except for the C-17 programme, our government aerospace programmes, as a group, had their best earnings in corporate history.' The news boosted McDonnell Douglas stock, which was trading up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 56 1/2 at close of trade. Before special charges and additions made for a new benefits accounting rule, McDonnell Douglas reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 86m or Dollars 2.20 a share, compared with Dollars 211m or Dollars 5.50 a share in 1991. The 1991 results included earnings of Dollars 74m or Dollars 1.93 a share from discontinued operations and a gain of 83 cents a share from a tax settlement. For the full year, the company had earnings of Dollars 161m or Dollars 4.15 a share, down from Dollars 423m or Dollars 11.03 in 1991. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 4.62bn, compared with Dollars 4.68bn last year and full-year sales were Dollars 17.3bn, compared with Dollars 18.0bn a year ago. The company's order backlog on December 31 was Dollars 24bn, against Dollars 30.4bn a year earlier.</p>

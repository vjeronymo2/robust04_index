			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Setback for Bush on two fronts: California and right-wing pundit send warnings to White House PRESIDENT George Bush's struggling re-election campaign was hit by more bad news from the west and from the right yesterday. A Field Poll in the state of California found Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by 62 per cent to 28 per cent. In the survey's 45-year history, this is the largest margin at this late stage of a presidential race. In previous hypothetical match-ups, Mr Bush usually held a comfortable edge over Mr Clinton, though both trailed Mr Ross Perot before he pulled out. Republican candidates have carried California in five of the last six presidential elections. The rest of the west, where Mr Clinton has been campaigning hard in the past few days, has been less solid. It now looks even more fragile if another state poll, in Washington, is any guide. It found Mr Clinton ahead by 56 to 32 per cent. The discontent from the right, already patent, came yesterday in the shape of a newspaper column by George Will, probably the country's best known conservative pundit, whose fulminations against Mr Bush have been growing ever more thunderous. Calling Mr Bush 'a figure of genuine pathos' and his administration 'tired and arrogant', Mr Will in effect called on the president to give up the re-election ghost. 'For Republicans,' he wrote, 'the grim paradox is that the reason he should not run is the reason he will. He should not, because he has no reason to, other than an ambition eerily disconnected from any agenda. But he will run because he regards a public purpose as ornamental, as a mere filigree on a quest for office.' If Mr Bush pulled out, Mr Will went on from his Washington pulpit, 'two things would happen. The intellectual claustrophobia of this city and the Republican party will be instantly dissipated. And the Clinton-Gore bandwagon would be eclipsed until after the Republican convention ends on August 20.' Mr Will did not say who should succeed Mr Bush as Republican candidate. Nor did Mr Al D'Amato, the Republican senator from New York, who also said earlier this week that the president might well not run again. Mr D'Amato, it was thought, was merely trying to put a little distance between himself and the president so as to help his own re-election campaign. It has been very fashionable on the right to say that the real problem with the Republican ticket is not the vice-president, Mr Dan Quayle, whose future has been the subject of speculation, but the president himself. Some have been arguing that it would be better for the conservative movement for Mr Clinton to make a mess of things as president rather than to have four more years of drift under Mr Bush. The Bush campaign has been trying to shore up the conservative base. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, will now probably get a speaking slot in Houston, as may Mr Pat Buchanan, the early primary challenger. The former president, Mr Ronald Reagan, is to kick off the convention with an opening night keynote address on foreign policy.</p>

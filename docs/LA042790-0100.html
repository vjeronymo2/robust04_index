			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFF-PRICE SAFEWAY SHARES FIND BUYERS;  </P> <P> RETAILING: ANALYSTS SAID THE 10 MILLION SHARES WERE PRICED WELL BELOW WHAT HAD  BEEN ANTICIPATED.  </P> <P> Safeway Inc. found a ready market Thursday for the 10 million shares that it  sold at a discount in its first public offering since its leveraged buyout by  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in 1986.  </P> <P> The shares, representing 10% of the company, were priced at $11.25, sharply  below the selling range of $13 to $16 anticipated when Safeway announced the  offering two months ago.  </P> <P> All 10 million shares were placed with institutional subscribers to the  offering at $11.25. The first trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday  morning was at $11.625. By the 4 p.m. close in New York, the per-share price  had risen to $12.375, with more than 2.1 million shares trading hands.  </P> <P> Safeway, a 1,117-store supermarket chain based in Oakland, was converted to  private ownership by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in 1986. KKR made an  investment of only $175 million but heaped $5.8 billion worth of debt onto the  retailer in a so-called leveraged buyout.  </P> <P> Since then, Safeway has sold off inefficient operations, reduced its debt to  $3.1 billion and steadily improved its operating performance. Operating profit  as a percentage of sales rose to 3.2% in 1989 from 2.3% in 1986. Sales last  year were $14.3 billion. However, the company still has a negative net worth as  a result of the debt load.  </P> <P> The past few weeks have been tense for Safeway officials and underwriters  attempting to drum up interest in the offering. They encountered resistance  from institutional investors disenchanted with KKR and leery of companies  overloaded with debt.  </P> <P> Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the lead underwriter, was forced to slash the price  late Wednesday to $11.25 a share.  </P> <P> The reduced price made the offering more palatable, analysts said.  </P> <P> "What it reflects (is that) it's not adequate in today's market to provide the  stub of an LBO and expect investors to value it at a premium in anticipation of  de-leveraging the balance sheet and (having good) earnings four years down the  road," said John B. Kosecoff, an analyst with the First Manhattan Co.  investment firm in New York.  </P> <P> "The alternative would have been to not make the offering at all," Kosecoff  said. Reducing the price was viewed as preferable.  </P> <P> The brisk trading "sure shows that there's a large buying interest from  someone," said Suzanne McGrath, an analyst with Black &amp; Co., an investment  firm in Portland, Ore. The offering came in a little low, she said, "but not  massively so."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, she added, "We think it's worth quite a bit more than that."  </P> <P> Safeway said in its prospectus for the offering that it plans to use the  proceeds to make capital improvements, such as remodeling or opening new  stores. However, the money raised in the offering is only a fraction of the  $3.2 billion the company has said it plans to spend on capital improvements  through 1994.  </P> <P> A successful offering was seen as crucial to help mend the tattered reputation  of KKR, which has been damaged of late by declines in the market for  high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, used in many of its buyouts.  </P> <P> Neither KKR nor Safeway executives, who bought shares initially for $2 each,  are selling stock in this offering, but they will be free to sell shares on the  open market in 180 days.  </P></p>

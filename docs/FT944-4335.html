			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fear of interest rate rise unsettles equities Wall Street US equities zig-zagged in negative territory yesterday amid new signs that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again in the near term and worries about the implications of Orange County's declaration of bankruptcy, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.43 at 3,735.52. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.88 to 451.23, the American Stock Exchange composite receded 1.82 to 429.19 and the Nasdaq composite was 6.96 weaker at 734.27. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 285.6m shares. The Dow hit its low for the day as Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Congressional panel that he continued to be concerned about the inflationary pressures on the economy. Although consumer prices have held steady so far this year, Mr Greenspan said he believed that producers would try ultimately to pass increasing prices on to consumers. Mr Greenspan justified the Fed's six interest rate increases this year as a means to stamp out both inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations and gave no indication that he believed either had been completely stopped. The closely watched Beige Book, released yesterday in advance of the December 20 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, reported economic activity continuing at the strong pace of recent months and said rises in raw and intermediate material costs were being passed through to the prices of some final products. The Fed's report also said early holiday season retail sales were strong in nearly all regions of the US. Most economists believe that the Fed will boost rates again in the next two to three months, but few place high odds on a rate increase after the upcoming open market committee meeting, because of the proximity to Christ-mas. The market is concerned that another interest rate increase would slow demand and deter corporate borrowing, causing an erosion in corporate earnings. Also troubling the market was the announcement after Monday's close that Orange County, California, had filed for bankruptcy protection after sustaining Dollars 1.5bn in unrealised losses in its investment portfolio. Shares of Merrill Lynch - one of the county's largest lenders - fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 on worries over exposure to the bankruptcy. Steel companies gained ground following unconfirmed reports late on Tuesday that USX-US Steel Group had achieved a favourable contract with General Motors. News of the contract which, it was reported, allows a 16 per cent price increase over two years, sent the USX price forward Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 . Other steel suppliers gained after a Lehman Brothers analyst upgraded the companies on the basis of the USX reports. Bethlehem Steel firmed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 , Inland Steel Industries rose Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 34 3/8 , WHX put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 3/8 and Geneva Steel was up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 13. Continental Corporation, the holding company for Continental Insurance, jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 18 3/4 after news that it would be acquired by CNA Financial for Dollars 1.1bn in cash. Shares in CNA increased by Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 63. Price/Costco relinquished Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 14 1/4 on news that the discount retailer would pull out of its joint venture in Mexico. The company's chief rival south of the border, Wal-Mart Stores, gained Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 22 1/2 on the news. Canada Surging gold shares masked what was otherwise a day of fairly broad-based losses on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The TSE 300 index ended virtually unchanged, up 0.34 point at 4,079.78, on a day when there was little good news to support markets. Orange County's bankruptcy filing in the US and the opening salvo in Canada of the separatist Parti Quebecois's sovereignty campaign reverberated across currency, bond and equity markets. Declines outnumbered advances by 420 to 330 after volume of 54.3m shares valued at CDollars 671m. Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were down, led by financial services, oil, conglomerate and transportation stocks. Gold, real estate, pipelines, industrial products and utilities made gains. The golds index jumped 3.70 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo finished 0.5 per cent firmer in light trade after the privatisation of aircraft manufacturer Embraer, and on continued position-squaring ahead of the futures index and option markets settlements on December 14 and 19. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares gained 242 at 45,972. Earlier, Brazil's government sold a 55.4 per cent controlling stake in Embraer for RDollars 154.1m (Dollars 182.4m), up just 0.3 per cent from the RDollars 153.7m minimum price. Embraer preferred plummeted after the auction to close 17.2 per cent down at RDollars 65.40.</p>

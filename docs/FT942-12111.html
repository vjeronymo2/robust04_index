			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Management (The Growing Business): Spotlight falls on invisibles contribution Correction (published 10th May 1994) appended to this article. Raffo, a designer for the packaging industry, has just won its first significant export order - a six-figure contract with Snapper of the US for a new design of bottle cap. The Chester-based group already spends half its marketing budget in continental Europe and expects to have raised orders from outside the UK to more than 50 per cent of sales in 1996. Raffo is part of an army of small and medium-sized companies exporting a huge variety of services from the UK - published and recorded music, education, management consultancy, design - all contributing to job creation and the invisible trade surplus. Anecdote suggests these small exporters are increasingly successful. More than 20 per cent of the companies receiving the Queen's Awards for Exports last month were selling services abroad. Many were smaller companies. But economists have only the vaguest idea of how important smaller exporters of services are to the economy. The UK's invisible export effort is dominated by the City of London which earned a net Pounds 18bn at the last count in 1992 from fees, commissions, interest, property returns and dividends. 'Clearly, the City is very important but it is by no means the whole story,' says Jan Hall, chairman of the small firms committee of the British Overseas Trade Board which is looking at how DTI export initiatives can be tailored for service companies. One attempt to identify the invisibles contribution of smaller companies has been made by Robert Pringle, of consultants Graham Bannock &amp; Partners. Pringle starts with official Central Statistical Office estimates which suggest that 39 per cent of invisible earnings from consultancy (management, engineering, surveying, architecture, advertising and property consultancy) comes from companies with turnover of less than Pounds 2.5m. Pringle then makes the somewhat heroic assumption that the same pattern is repeated across all small business, education and leisure service companies. He concludes that these small service companies probably produced invisible earnings of about Pounds 5bn in 1992. To put this in perspective, Pringle says the City's real service exports were Pounds 4.3bn - a figure he arrives at after deducting interest, property income and overseas dividends which he says are not derived from true services. The analysis is crude, because of the lack of hard data, but makes a valid point. 'In the past you have had a picture of invisible earnings dominated by the City,' says Pringle. 'The techniques of trade promotion should take into account this crucial sector.' At the moment almost none of the Department of Trade and Industry's export promotion activities specifically targets service companies. But there are signs that it is considering such a focus to be worthwhile. The DTI is trying to recruit executives with exporting experience from the private-sector service industry to promote invisible exports. Officials at the DTI are also responding. April 25 saw 21 DTI country desk officers visiting a new grouping of design consultants, the British Design Initiative, whose members demonstrated how they were trying to sell British design abroad. Maxine Horn, managing director of the BDI, says her company represents a range of designers, in product, packaging, corporate identity and retail interiors. The group was set up because no one else helped promote the export of design. Pringle says any further growth in the invisible trade surplus is unlikely to be led by the City of London but by Britain's smaller companies. This is debatable. But there is a strong case for the DTI and trade organisations to improve their support for the many companies already exporting their services. CORRECTION Raffo Design is designing a mechanical garden product for Snapper of the US and not a new bottle cap as described on last week's Growing Business page.</p>

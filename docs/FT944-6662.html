			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Malaysian politician on trial A leading member of Malaysia's dominant political party appeared in court yesterday on corruption charges. Mr Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, until recently chief minister of the state of Malacca and head of the youth wing of the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), was charged with abuse of power and corruption in relation to land deals in his state. In a case which caused widespread controversy in Malaysia, Mr Rahim was forced to resign from his official posts last month after it had been alleged that he had sexually abused a 15-year-old girl. The attorney general subsequently ruled that, although there was a strong suspicion about Mr Rahim in the case there was not enough evidence to bring charges. Mr Rahim had been considered a close ally of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>

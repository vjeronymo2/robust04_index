			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY DETAILS  </P> <P> I read with displeasure The Times' Night Stalker jury story ("Distraught  Alternate Named to Stalker Jury," Part I, Aug. 16). I take exception to  printing the personal histories and experiences of the remaining jurors on the  case.  </P> <P> These people are not politicians who should come under public scrutiny. They  are people who have been drafted to serve the county for a pitiful $5 a day and  deserve some privacy and respect.  </P> <P> JOSEPH L. SADDLER  </P> <P> Bellflower  </P></p>

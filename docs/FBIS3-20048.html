Stability is looking increasingly remote."    He added: "The Burundian Government must no longer have to  bow to the dictate of the Army. I still believe that the  presence of the 180 OAU troops could partially ensure the  maintenance of a democratic system."    Mr. Claes, who recently visited Rwanda and Burundi, again  said in substance: "I have warned the Burundian authorities  that their attitude toward the Army, which clearly refused to  accept a democratic solution, would lead to fresh  confrontations." [passage omitted]    According to the latest news from Bujumbura, calm seems to  have returned to the northern districts of the capital on Friday  morning after violent clashes between Hutus and Tutsis.</p>

"We used to depend on farming alone, and our lives improved  only slowly," said Shen, secretary of the township committee of  the Communist Party.    Encouraged by the government, the township has set up 160  enterprises in the fields of leather, light and textile  industries, hardware and machinery, and building materials in  addition to food-processing, chemicals and electronics over the  past decade.    As a result, the township's industrial output value rose  from  180 million yuan in 1991 to 260 million yuan in 1992, and to 508  million yuan last year, Shen said.    While boosting rural industry, the local government has  encouraged farmers to arrange agricultural production and  diversify the economy in line with market demands.    According to the latest statistics, Xinjiang turns out  between 8,000 tons and 10,000 tons of grain a year.    Last year its gross output value reached 565 million yuan,  sales income 910 million yuan, profits and taxes 59.34 million  yuan and financial revenue 12.75 million yuan last year -- all  records.    Its farmers' incomes averaged 2,060 yuan per capita in 1993,  also a record.    With more money in hand, farmers have built two- and  three-story buildings to replace their single-story houses.    Most farmers have equipped their households with color  televisions, refrigerators and cassette recorders, and some have  even bought hi-fi sound systems and motorcycles. Many of them  have a considerable amount of savings deposits in banks.    A provincial official in charge of agriculture said Xinjiang  township is a typical example of townships across the province,  which is leading farmers toward a comfortable life.    According to a rural development plan, the annual income of  farmers in the province will reach 1,600 yuan per capita by the  end of 1995, and 2,200 yuan by the end of this century.    The provincial government has conferred the title "townships  with strong economic development" on 103 townships including  Xinjiang.    Experts in rural development agree that the purpose of the  rural economic reform is to promote the development of the rural  commodity economy and gradually replace the traditional  self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy with modern farming.    According to statistics, the past five years were a high  point for the overall development of Zhejiang's rural economy.    Zhejiang's gross output value of farm, forestry, animal  husbandry and fishery products last year reached 39.36 billion  yuan, an increase of 18.7 percent over 1988.    Its rural industrial output value rose from 54.275 billion  yuan in 1988 to 255.2 billion yuan last year, accounting for  two-thirds of the gross provincial industrial output value.    Farmers' incomes climbed from 1,000 yuan per capita in 1990  to 1,590 yuan last year.    Economists here analyzed that the increase comes mainly from  the diversified economy instead of only from growing grain.</p>

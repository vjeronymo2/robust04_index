			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arkadiy Borisovich Morin: "Project 1123 Cruiser </F> Helicopter Carriers"]    [Text] The prototype of a fundamentally new  class--the cruiser helicopter carrier, the principal armament of  which consisted of ASW helicopters, the latest missile systems  and electronic equipment, entered the composition of our navy in  1976. Having relatively low displacement, it had no equals in  foreign fleets of those times in terms of the effectiveness of  searching for and fighting submarines.    Following publication of the article "Cruiser Carriers"  (see MORSKOY SBORNIK, No 7, 1991) by Captain 1st Rank V. Kuzin,  which contains brief information on these cruiser helicopter  carriers, the editor's office received many letters requesting  more details on them. Therefore, we offer the reader the  recollections of a participant of its planning, Arkadiy  Borisovich Morin, who at that time was the chief of the planning  division of the TsKB-17 [Central Design Office No 17]--the  principal executor of efforts to create our first cruiser  helicopter carriers (presently the Nevskoye Planning and Design  Office).    The scientific and technical revolution that began soon  after  World War II had a great influence on development of naval  equipment. It universally brought on fundamental changes in  views on the role of naval fleets in the new conditions. The  United States of America, which was the undisputed leader among  sea powers at that time (and even now), was the first to  reexamine the priorities of its navy's missions. It was then  that use of the world ocean as a "launch pad" for ballistic  missiles carrying nuclear warheads, launched from  nuclear-powered submarines (SSBNs) and targeted chiefly on the  most important objectives in the USSR as its main enemy, assumed  first priority.    At approximately the same time, the Soviet Union decided to  create a nuclear missile ocean-going navy capable of carrying  out the entire complex of missions at sea to defend the  interests of the state and counter possible aggression against  it from the seas and oceans. One of the necessary components of  a balanced navy was recognized to be presence of effective  antisubmarine warfare (ASW) forces within its composition,  including nuclear-powered and diesel torpedo submarines,  shore-based and ship-borne ASW aviation, and surface ships of  various classes equipped with submarine search and destroy  resources.    Creation of surface ASW forces began with modernization and  improvement of the armament of destroyers and patrol escorts in  the navy at that time, and refitting of some first-generation  missile ships into ASW ships. Then began planning and  construction of specialized ASW ships. However, the advent of  American SSBNs carrying Polaris-A1 missiles (with a range of up  to 2,200 km) raised the issue creating ASW ships for our navy  that could operate in the outer ASW zone and would satisfy high  requirements on armament, navigability, range and endurance.    In its search for an optimum direction of solving this  problem (optimum according to the criteria of combat and  economic effectiveness), the TsNIIVK [Central Scientific  Research Institute of Military Shipbuilding] (presently the  Central Scientific Research Institute No 1 of the RF Ministry of  Defense) conducted comprehensive research jointly with other  naval and air force institutes as well as the TsNII-45 [Central  Scientific Research Institute No 45] and the TsKB-17 of the USSR  State Committee for Ship Building (GKS), later transformed into  the Ministry of Ship Building Industry. Their results  persuasively demonstrated that successful combat with  nuclear-powered submarines, chiefly SSBNs, required wider use of  ship-based aviation. A continuous search for submarines over  vast and remote regions over the course of several days and  integrated operations against detected submarines jointly with  other naval forces had to be provided for.    Basing itself on the results of this research, the TsKB-17  wrote up, and submitted in 1958, technical proposals on  designing two classes of helicopter carriers--small (based on a  special design) and large (based on mothballed hulls of  unfinished project 68-bis artillery cruisers awaiting  "resolution of their fate"). Defense Minister R. Malinovskiy  gave his support to both variants, and they received approval in  the government.    The project requirements, which were approved by naval  commander-in-chief S. Gorshkov on 31 January 1959, defined the  purpose of such a ship: "Seeking and destroying the enemy's  SSBNs and multipurpose submarines in the outer ASW zones within  the composition of a ship hunter-killer group and in  coordination with other naval ships and ASW airplanes." The  objective was to "provide for continuous 24-hour searching for  submarines by not less than two helicopters during the ship's  entire cruising time." On the basis of the project requirements  and with regard for results of rough plans drawn up on their  basis, with the participation of a number of naval and air force  institutes, the TsNIIVK prepared the draft preliminary  specifications for the design of a ship with minimum  displacement carrying eight helicopters. (This corresponded to  views of higher organizations upon which creation of the new  ships depended).    Concurrently, the TsKB-17 established the need for designing  a ship of greater effectiveness and ability to resist the enemy.  Considering the real limits placed on use of helicopters in  strong winds, the office proposed reinforcing the ship's  submarine detection and strike resources by including in the  preliminary specifications a long-range sonar system, an  antisubmarine missile system, torpedoes and mortars, and air  defense resources. Supporting the TsKB-17 the TsNII-45 raised  the question as to the suitability of increasing the number of  helicopters aboard. The navy and the GKS also insisted on basing  10-14 helicopters aboard the ship.    After the initial studies were carried out to determine the  principal ship building elements more specifically, and after  the specifications were coordinated with the GKS, on 25 January  1960 the naval commander-in-chief approved the preliminary  specifications for the design of the ship, which was code-named  project 1123. However, when he forwarded the assignment to the  TsNIIVK, G. Kozmin, chief of the navy's Main Ship Building  Directorate, emphasized: "Considering that attention is being  turned at many levels of government to the standard displacement  of a ship, the work of the TsKB-17 and supervision by the navy  should be oriented on arriving at a more sensible solution to  all design problems and implementing all measures to reduce the  displacement (7,000-8,000 tonnes) indicated in the preliminary  specifications." For the same purposes, the GKS received  conceptual designs submitted on a competitive basis by both the  TsKB-17 and the TsKB-53.    A. Savichev (1904-1983), who formerly led the designing of  project 68K and 68-bis artillery cruisers, was appointed chief  designer of the ship at the TsKB-17. V. Fedin became the chief  observer from the TsNIIVK. A. Fisher, who was the chief designer  of the project 30-bis and 56 destroyers, was put in charge of  the conceptual design at the TsKB-53.    The project was carried out at the TsKB-17 in close  cooperation with the OKB-938 [Special Design Office No 938] of  the State Committee for Aviation Equipment (GKAT), headed by N.  Kamov (who designed the Ka-25 helicopter), and specialists of  the air force's Scientific Research Institute No 15 supervised  development of the ship resources of the ASW helicopter system.  The office submitted eight variants of the ship offering  different propulsion units and different armament packages, to  include in a catamaran scheme. During the search for new  technical concepts, and particularly to reduce displacement, a  variant with an aluminum-magnesium alloy hull was additionally  developed on the initiative of the chief hull designer A.  Marinich (1909-1989), but it did not enjoy any support.    Studies showed that the prescribed displacement could be  obtained with a steel-hulled ship by equipping it only with a  gas turbine propulsion unit. However, this variant was rejected,  as was the plan developed by the TsKB-53. The final decision was  to continue the planning on the basis of a variant calling for a  boiler and turbine propulsion unit, similar to the main  propulsion unit of the "Groznyy" class guided missile cruiser  (project 58), which made it possible to increase displacement to  8,500 tons.    The main elements of the preliminary specifications were  approved by a government decree almost at the end of work on the  conceptual design, on 29 September 1960, while the conceptual  design itself was completed on 1 December of the same year. Of  course, the office was instructed to carry out additional  studies to improve the helicopter technical maintenance  conditions, to foresee the possibility for basing progressive  [perspektivnyye] helicopter models on the ship at sea states of  up to 6 points inclusively, reduction of the crew to 300-350 (by  extensively introducing automation), reduction of displacement  by combining personal-service systems and other devices,  accommodation of personnel according to submarine, escort vessel  and destroyer norms, and exclusion of redundancy in technical  resources, posts and so on. As a result, another 16 variants of  the project appeared, and out of all of them, what was referred  to as variant 23 with a displacement of 9,300 tons was approved  on March 1961 as the basis for the detail design, though with a  general orientation on reducing its displacement.    It should be noted that the work of designing the ship's  principal armament--the ASW helicopter system--encountered  serious difficulties due to the absence of approved  "requirements on grouped basing of helicopters aboard ships" at  that time. The TsNIIVK began developing such requirements only  concurrently with work on the cruiser's plan. However,  immediately after approval of the conceptual design, the air  force institute suddenly reported that "its new manning  structure did not foresee the function of supervising the  planning of ships with helicopter armament in industrial central  design offices, for which reason the group of observers is being  disbanded, and beginning in 1961 observers will not be appointed  to ship projects." Numerous appeals by the navy and the GKS to  the air force command regarding the need for reinstating  supervision produced no results. In addition, the air force and  the GKAT were late in providing the basic data on progressive  ASW helicopters, mentioned in the government's decision, as a  result of which development of the ship's detail design was  based on data from the OKB-938. But when the detail design was  nearing its completion, the air force reported that "the Ka-25  helicopter adopted by them cannot be said to be sufficiently  progressive in terms of its performance characteristics and the  composition of its equipment and armament." It became necessary  to convene an expert commission.    The detail design that was submitted for examination was for  a ship of standard displacement of 9,000 tons and a speed of 29  knots. The number of ship personnel was determined at 370. In  its conclusion on the project the TsNIIVK proposed increasing  the crew by 31. The naval commander-in-chief ordered the Main  Staff to examine this question. With regard for the requirement  of maintaining a three-shift underway watch at the main battle  stations during a length sea cruise, the latter substantiated  the need for a manning level of 497 persons. During joint  examination of the justifications the TsKB-17, the TsNIIVK and  the naval Main Staff compromised on a crew of 415.    Detail design 1123 was approved on 25 January 1962. A number  of amendments and supplements were of course once again  introduced into it, to include: the possibility for landing 14  progressive Ka-25 and Mi-8 ASW helicopters on the ship,  increasing crew size, changing the composition of radio  communication resources, and raising the ship's navigability at  a sea state of 6-7 points-- which made it possible to increase  its standard displacement to 10,600 tonnes, with the  corresponding decrease in speed and cruising range. The TsKB-17  was instructed to make the corrections to the project by May,  and to transfer the first set of working drawings on the hull to  the plant, so that the prototype could be laid down in that same  year, 1962.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-25A>      Diagram of the General Arrangement of Weapons and Armament Aboard the Cruiser Helicopter Carrier </FIG>     Correction of the detail design revealed that in order to  accommodate the progressive helicopters aboard the ship, the  hangar volume would have to be increased by 81 percent, a second  hangar for two helicopters would have to be set up on the top  deck, and the area of the flight deck would have to increased by  77 percent. This evoked major changes in the main dimensions and  in the theoretical outline of the hull. As a result, the ship's  standard displacement grew to 10,750 tonnes, while speed dropped  to 28.5 knots.    Designing of the ship was seriously complicated, besides by  several changes in the initial data on the helicopters, by  presence of considerable quantities of experimental and  prototype armament still in the design stage. Consequently, the  office's designers had to work with the technical data and even  the conceptual designs of these models.    One other thing should be noted. Construction of a ship of a  fundamentally new class, which required a complex cooperative  effort in delivering armament, equipment and materials, was  complicated by reorganization of the country's industrial  management system on a territorial principle beginning in 1957.  As a result, the TsKB-17 had to draft the government decree "On  Approving the Basic Elements and Providing for Construction of  the Prototype of an Outer-Zone ASW Ship." It foresaw  participation of around 200 enterprises and organizations of  five sector state committees, two RSFSR ministries, the  All-Russian Council of the National Economy, and republic and  territories councils of the national economy in designing the  cruiser helicopter carrier. This also necessitated additional  work and coordination of the supply plan with the executors and  higher organizations.    In the course of planning the ship, the office and its  contractors successfully solved a number of new troubling  problems in practically all specialties with the participation  of naval and air force specialists for the first time in Soviet  ship building experience. Special attention was naturally  devoted in this case to resources of the ASW helicopter system.  Items developed as part of these resources included: a  helicopter transport system that was semiautomated (providing  for longitudinal and transverse towing in the hangar) and  mechanized (using tractors on the flight deck); helicopter  elevators making the most economical use of hangar space  possible; fuel, oil, nitrogen and hydraulic systems, and  helicopter electric power supply.    The flight deck (with the main hangar beneath it) was  foreseen in the aft part of the cruiser helicopter carrier as  being the best protected from wave action in the presence of  strong winds.    That left the fore part to accommodate the ship armament  systems. Because of this the ship acquired such an unusual  architecture that it was jokingly named a "half a steamship."  Another characteristic feature of the cruiser helicopter carrier  was presence of a high-power, long-range sonar system (employed  for the first time on surface ships not only in our country but  even abroad!). Owing to its considerable dimensions, its  acoustic system was installed inside a retractable faring  beneath the keel (with dimensions of 21x6.5x9 m), which had a  raising and lowering device of unique design. An entire series  of special measures had to be developed and implemented aboard  the ship in order to reduce acoustic interference during  operation of the sonar system and in order to support its  prescribed range.    There were many other unique design features as well. Thus,  much attention was devoted during planning of the hull to making  it resistant to hits by enemy missiles and torpedoes, and the  top deck above the hangar (with an area of around 2,000  m[.sup]2[/]) was built with a unique design requiring a  minimum number of supports. The following were located aboard a  ship for the first time: an automated system for controlling  water systems; electric systems for automatic or remote control  of impulse valves, ventilation covers, fuel receiving and  transfer fittings, and water protection; a fast-acting  firefighting equipment activating system. A new anchoring device  making it possible to weigh anchor without requiring personnel  on the top deck was developed during the planning. Basing of the  helicopters required development of special devices: fire  curtains in the lower hangar, doors to the upper hangar, and an  automated collapsible railing on the flight deck. Controllable  fin stabilizers were used as roll stabilizing devices, as being  the most reliable and effective in comparison with active and  passive stabilizing tanks.    The project 58 guided missile cruiser adopted as the basis  for the main propulsion unit was modified and improved. The  productivity of the main boilers was raised in connection with  the increase in steam consumption. Auxiliary boilers and  automated desalinization and evaporating units were designed  anew. The ship's electric power supply system foresaw the full  volume of automation of both power plants. New models of  electrical equipment were developed on instructions from the  office: automated turbogenerators and diesel generators,  synchronous generators with an amplitude-phase compounding  system, automatic starting switches, and so on. In the course of  planning the electric power system, with the participation of  the Naval Academy, the office solved a number of complex  technical problems in order to provide for:     -  reliable, lengthy parallel operation of generator units  equipped with different kinds of primary engines and with speed  governors having different dynamic characteristics;    -  the needed  quantity of electric power in the presence of major consumers  which additionally imposed sharply pronounced pulsed and cyclic  load requirements;    -  the necessary dynamic and statistical  stability of generators.        At the same time, the fight to reduce displacement was very  much complicated by the need for creating good living conditions  for the personnel. Considering the ship unsinkability  requirements and protection against mass destruction weapons,  portholes had to be rejected in the main hull. Nonetheless, the  design foresaw one-and two-man cabins with an area of 5-6  m[.sup]2[/] for officers, four- and six-man cabins with an  area of 6-12 m[.sup]2[/] for warrant officers and chief petty  officers with the beds arranged in two tiers, and, for the crew,  mess decks with a space norm of 2.1-1.2 m[.sup]2[/] per  person and with beds arranged in two tiers. A ventilation and  air conditioning system and soundproof partitions were  installed, soundproofing and noise suppressing devices were  employed, a maximum amount of plastic furniture was introduced,  and thought was given to the architectural and interior design  and color scheme of living and public spaces. A ward-room was  foreseen for officers and chief petty officers, and two messes  with a centralized dishwashing facility were foreseen for the  crew.    [Sentence incomplete in original]...after the TsKB-17 sent  the planning documents and orders to the manufacturing plant in  June 1972 together with the initial working drawings for the  hull. In July the corrected detail design was approved, but as  it turned out, the drama surrounding the designing of the ship  did not end with this. During N. Khrushchev's visit to the  Northern Fleet (in summer 1962) the navy and the GKS were  instructed to "significantly increase the endurance of warships  and widen their sailing region." After this, the main developer  of surface-to-air missile systems submitted a proposal to the  naval command and to the leadership of the corresponding sector  state committees to increase the ammunition reserve aboard ships  by reexamining the design of the surface-to-air missile storage  and delivery system, as a result of which instructions were  given to carry out the corresponding studies, to be followed by  instructions to study installation of a radar station aboard the  ship that was more powerful than the present one. These and  other instructions necessitated development of 26 variants of  particular changes for examination. And later on, during  publication of the working design documents, consideration had  to be given to new decisions and orders of the navy and the GKS  (Ministry of Ship Building Industry), changes in standards and  the minutes of technical meetings.    When it published the design documents, the TsKB-17 devoted  great attention to checking the ship's weight distribution. On  instructions from B. Chilikin, the chief of the TsKB-17 and its  chief designer (1905-1967), each week the planning division  submitted a summary of the current loading conditions (with  regard for published drawings) and the position of the ship's  center of gravity for his approval. He also made the final  decisions when approved weight limits and their moments (on  three coordinates) were exceeded.    In late 1965 the TsKB-17 carried out test calculations of  the  ship's stability and its ability to remain afloat when damaged,  and tested dangerous cases of flooding with a scale model (1:50)  in a physical modeling laboratory created in the office. The  results turned out to be somewhat worse that the calculations  carried out when correcting the plans. In order to meet the  unsinkability specifications, recommendations were drawn up to  increase the quantity of liquid ballast used in tanks after they  were emptied. These recommendations were approved by the navy  and the GKS by their decision in August 1966.    A decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of  Ministers foresaw construction of two ships on the basis of  project 1123. Captain 1st Rank A. Khokhlov was appointed chief  observer from the navy, and N. Prudnikov was appointed the chief  builder of the prototype, which was christened the "Moskva".  This cruiser was laid down on 15 December 1962 in Nikolayev at a  large building dock of Plant No 444 (presently the Chernomorskiy  Sudostroitelnyy Zavod Production Association) under rather  mundane circumstances. After the two bottom sections of the hull  were installed and a field joint was welded between them, plant  director A. Gankevich and naval GUK [shipbuilding main  administration] representative N. Grushin signed the ship's  lay-down certificate on a table covered with red fabric standing  beside the hull. In this case, only a few dozen plant workers  and seamen and a small group of specialists who had to come to  Leningrad from the TsKB-17 under the leadership of the project's  chief designer, A. Savichev, were in attendance. But when the  ship was lowered into the water on 14 January 1965, it was under  festive circumstances, in the presence of several thousand  people, and it was a major event at the plant.    The initial general timetable called for completion of  construction of the prototype in 2.5 years; however, changes in  the plans that had been approved in 1962 in the course of  construction itself, a number of alterations, and late  deliveries of the main armament and equipment increased the  volume and laboriousness of the work. Consequently, the mooring  trials of the "Moskva" went on from November 1966 to May 1967,  plant sea trials were held in May-August, and state trials were  conducted in August-December 1967. The state trials were  conducted by a government commission under the leadership of  Rear Admiral B. Lamm. His deputy was the new chief designer of  the project, A. Marinich, who replaced the retiring Savichev in  March 1967. After the state trials were completed Captain 1st  Rank F. Starozhilov was appointed ship commander. (He replaced  the first commander of the cruiser helicopter carrier "Moskva"  G. Kopylov, who commanded the crew from February 1965). V.  Konovalenko was appointed the manufacturing plant's chief  inspector during the sea and state trials; (they were conducted  in the Black Sea).    During the state trials around 100 Ka-25 helicopter sorties  were flown day and night, in good and adverse weather, with the  ship both at rest and under power, and with different  specifications of heeling, trim and speed of the resultant air  flow above the flight deck. The results confirmed that the  shipboard resources of the ASW helicopter system met the  requirements completely.    By the beginning of this stage of the trials 19 new models  of  weapons and equipment not yet adopted by the navy had been  installed aboard the ship. They were checked out and accepted  simultaneously with the ship, which significantly complicated  the organization and conduct of the trials. After their  completion, on 25 December 1967, a government commission  accepted the ship into the navy. It was noted in the acceptance  certificate that the latest models of armament and equipment  installed aboard the cruiser helicopter carrier would keep its  specifications and performance characteristics at a modern level  for a long time to come (see Table).

In 1.5 months and in  a complex situation of constant contact with ships and aviation  of the USA and NATO, and a sea state of up to 6 points, the  cruiser traveled around 11,000 nautical miles. Its helicopters  flew around 400 sorties during the time of the cruise, surveying  up to 10,000 square miles per day with good results in searching  for, detecting and lengthy shadowing of submarines. This complex  cruise confirmed the high reliability of the armament and  equipment of the cruiser helicopter carrier. Creation of the  cruiser and the Ka-25 helicopter was marked by state prizes.    In fall 1969 the second ship of this class--the  "Leningrad"--joined the navy. In 1974, after the end of the  Arab-Israeli War, it helped to clear mines from the Suez Canal  (together with Pacific Fleet minesweepers) at the request of the  Egyptian government. Because our country did not possess any  minesweeping helicopters at that time, eight Ka-25 ASW  helicopters had to be refitted quickly for this operation. The  minesweepers cleared moored mines from the channel, while  helicopters removed ground mines, as well as moored mines in  places where ships could not operate because of reefs and  shallow water. The helicopters also worked reliably and without  incident in these unusual operating conditions, and their crews  demonstrated a high class of piloting. In three months the canal  once again became navigable. For this operation, the crews of  the Soviet ships and helicopters earned the gratefulness of the  Egyptian government and the USSR minister of defense.    In the mid-1980's the "Leningrad" visited the city in honor  of which it was named. It stood on the Neva, not far from the  building occupied by the design office that gave it life, where  the collective of designers was already working on the design of  new, larger aircraft carrying ships.    Both cruiser helicopter carriers sailed many long cruises  and  combat patrols.

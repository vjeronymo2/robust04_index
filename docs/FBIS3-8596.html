			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Democratic Alliance Chairman Neritan Ceka, </F> issued in Tirana on 11 March: "Criminals Hold the Real Power in  This Country"]    [Text] The ugly crime against the deputy and editor in  chief, Teodor Keko, was clearly of a political nature. It marks  a further escalation of the strategy of violence against the  Democratic Alliance [AD] and free speech that began in Shkoder  with the murder of Gjovalin Cekini and the assault on Gjergj  Zefi, and continued in Tirana with the arrest and persecution of  journalists.    There is no doubt that the hand that struck Teodor Keko was  one of those criminal hands that raised a toast in the tourist  hotel in Shkoder with the odd Democratic Party leader. For us,  this represents a caveman's reaction to the letter from the  Cekini family published in ALEANCA two days ago.    An assault on a deputy in the middle of the street, in the  presence of his own wife, shows that criminals hold the real  power in this country.    As chairman of the second-largest opposition party, an  intellectual, and a citizen, I demand a public statement by the  president, the prime minister, and the Public Order Ministry  concerning guarantees that they give for the normal conduct of  political life in Albania. The opposition is here to ensure a  democratic order, not to create a pretty facade for foreign  delegations, behind which a corrupt and criminal state can  operate.    Silence would be a disgrace, if not an incrimination, for  any  civilized politican.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "A Job To </F> Be Finished"]    [Text] It could not be expected that from the moment he  became head of the Finance Ministry, Ambassador Rubens Ricupero  would present a new economic policy or report in detail his  plans to continue implementing the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique  Cardoso Second] plan. In his own words, his main mission is to  act simply as a successor, not a substitute. His is a very  delicate duty: to administer a program inherited from someone  else. This, however, did not prevent him from clarifying that  although he will be faithful to the process, he plans to give it  his personal style.    He must, nonetheless, firmly become the one in charge of  implementing an already defined program. With this objective,  the new finance minister thought it necessary to point out the  plan's perfection, which reflects the skills of the person who  masterminded it. He praised his predecessor to show that he was  thoroughly familiar with the program drafted by Fernando  Henrique Cardoso.    His praise of President Itamar Franco sought to calm those  who feared he did not have the same Planalto support his  predecessor had. He emphasized that he could count on the  president's thorough support "without which," he added, "my work  would lack effectiveness, and the appointment would have been  pointless."    In the long introduction to his speech, in which he sought  to  clearly define the aspects of his mission, the new minister  tried to characterize his style, although he is aware that he  will be staying for fewer than nine months at the head of the  Finance Ministry. He painted this picture in a discreet and  indirect manner, but made everyone realize that his decisions  will always be inspired by his social concerns; that is, that it  will always pursue one objective -- man, in all of his  dimensions.    He made no demagogic promises and pointed out that no  economic policy can be successful without being preceded by a  constitutional reform. He added that the absence of this reform  has been foiling all attempts at adjustment to failure. He  therefore plans to do his best to ensure that the reform process  continues. He is even willing to negotiate and temporize to make  sure that the process will be concluded, particularly because  unless it is concluded the country will reach a serious impasse.    He added, however, that the success of the FHC2 plan does  not  depend entirely on the support the Congress or the president of  the Republic gives it. He thus calls for society's cooperation  in making the program effective. "The judicial branch,  state-owned companies, and the governments of states and  counties, as well as the media, entrepreneurs, workers, and the  public in general, will all have to contribute to this success,"  Ricupero said. Through this call Minister Ricupero carefully  established levels of responsibility. It must be noted that the  judicial branch appears at the top of the list.    Rubens Ricupero is giving priority to the moralization of  public expenditures. He pointed out that if the order given by  Tancredo Neves at the beginning of the New Republic era -- "it  is forbidden to spend" -- had been complied with, the country  would have been in a very different condition. Talking on  behalf of an administration that holds him responsible for  fulfilling this task, he said: "We will persevere in the  relentless pursuit of an operational balance of the budget." We  are giving emphasis to this sentence because the new minister  seems to indicate that such a balance -- on which the FHC2 plan  is based -- has not yet been ensured. As we have said in  previous commentaries, Rubens Ricupero will certainly pay more  attention than his predecessor to the public deficit issue,  which still has not been resolved through the congressional  approval of the Emergency Social Fund.    Perhaps the minister has been daring in announcing that as  soon as the stabilization is consolidated it will be possible to  gradually reduce interest rates. Everything indeed indicates  that for a long time the monetary area officials will have to  maintain high interest rates to prevent the inflation rate from  going up too much and making the FHC2 plan fail. Surely the  president of the Republic, who so far has not been entirely  conscious of this need, will demand that his new minister  prevent the inflation rate from going up. While working on the  monetary problems, Rubens Ricupero announced that in the  immediate operational plan, he will define rules for issuance of  the new currency and ways to back the new currency. These rules  are certainly essential for creating confidence in the real.    It would not be fair to conclude an analysis of the speech  Minister Rubens Ricupero delivered at his installment ceremony  without pointing out that his concern over social problems  permeated all his remarks. In his opinion, the problem of an  unfair distribution of wealth must be urgently solved. He  however does not plan to correct this situation through a  populist way of distributing wealth. On the contrary, he  believes that the success of the anti-inflation effort depends  on the capacity to reduce social unfairness. We can rest  assured that as the economic program is implemented, the new  minister's characteristics will be reaffirmed.</p>

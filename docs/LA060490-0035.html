			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MOZART PROGRAM SHOWS OFF EARLY WORKS  </P> <P> Ideally, a well-planned festival invites excursions on musical paths less  traveled. Saturday evening at the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre, Mainly  Mozart's second program followed the rule and balanced Mozart's early Piano  Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, with the even earlier Symphony No. 21 in A Major,  K. 134. Music director David Atherton's unhackneyed programming was but the  concert's first virtue.  </P> <P> The second virtue was enlisting pianist Gustavo Romero as the concerto soloist.  While he made his Mainly Mozart Festival debut on this program, the San Diego  native is hardly unknown to local audiences. More than a Mozart specialist,  Romero plays Mozart's keyboard music with uncommon insight.  </P> <P> In addition to his creamy legato and consistently elegant phrasing, Romero  knows how to build his interpretation from the composer's smallest motifs. With  diligent articulation and subtle accent, for example, Romero infused the simple  unaccompanied theme at the opening of the Andantino with a lyrical sensibility  that radiated throughout the movement. Unlike those pianists who mindlessly  dispatch Mozart's passagework as if to say, "But wait until you hear my  Beethoven -- it's smashing!" Romero brought a sense of urgency and mental  presence to the concerto's bravura finale.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the festival's Kawai grand piano did not provide the soloist  with adequate sonic resources. In the treble range, where the composer outlines  his most tender melodies, the instrument sounded particularly thin and shallow.  Having heard Romero play eloquently on better pianos many times, this reviewer  has no doubt that the Kawai was at fault.  </P> <P> Violist Cynthia Phelps, who was the San Diego Symphony's acting principal  violist several seasons back, served up Johann Hummel's Viola Fantasy with  predictable verve and a burnished sonority. At age 10, Hummel was a pupil of  Mozart, and in this Fantasy he quotes an aria from his teacher's opera "Don  Giovanni." Phelps imparted a sure sense of direction to an otherwise rambling  bauble.  </P> <P> As it made clear in last week's opening concert, the festival orchestra took  its task seriously. The response to Atherton's meticulously detailed A Major  Symphony was both solid and stylish, although the horn players besmirched their  colleagues' precise intonation and clean phrasing. Atherton opened the program  with a rare Haydn morsel, the Overture to "L'infedelta Delusa."  </P> <P>  The Mainly Mozart Festival continues with a chamber concert at the Old Globe  Theatre at 7 tonight.  </P></p>

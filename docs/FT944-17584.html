			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cartilage cells clue to treatment Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted laboratory-grown cartilage cells into injured knees. The findings hold out hope that this method of repairing cartilage defects could help arrest the development of osteoarthritis. The research, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved surgically removing a small amount of each patient's healthy cartilage, which was then grown in tissue culture. The cells were surgically put into the patient's damaged knee. The results of the treatment of 23 patients were described as 'highly promising' by the research team at the University of Gothenburg's Research Centre for Endocrinology and Metabolism and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden. The scientists are now collaborating with BioSurface Technology, a US specialist in tissue engineering products, to conduct clinical studies.

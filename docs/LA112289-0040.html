			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP LAWMEN MEET TO MAP A DRUG WAR;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: RESORT ATMOSPHERE BELIES BUSINESSLIKE ATTITUDE OF STATE, FEDERAL AND  MILITARY OFFICIALS WHO DISCUSS STRATEGY AT TWO-DAY CONFERENCE.  </P> <P> The conventioneers came from as far away as Zapata County, Tex., 170 strong.  They tended to wear cowboy boots and colorful summer shirts, and steered clear  of the swimming pool and golf courses. They had come not for sunshine, but to  huddle in private rooms and plot a war.  </P> <P> In a two-day conference that ended Tuesday, top law enforcement officials from  throughout the Sun Belt, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and  his counterparts from Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial  counties, met with ranking state, federal and military authorities to map  strategy over how best to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States  from south of the border.  </P> <P> "This is the first war I've planned in a fancy hotel, but . . . this is one war  we aim to win," said a Texas Ranger, who was dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt.  </P> <P> The meeting, which was organized by Block and the California National Guard,  was described as significant by its participants because it marked the first  time that so many government combatants in the drug war actually met to share  experiences, information and strategy.  </P> <P> The Palm Springs meeting followed pledges in September by President Bush and  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to commit the military to the drug war. It was  particularly gratifying for Block, who has criticized the federal government's  level of support for local authorities fighting the illegal drug trade from  Latin America.  </P> <P> "This is a real beginning," Block said moments after standing up during an  opening conference session to praise the presence of Michael Wermuth, a deputy  assistant defense secretary.  </P> <P> Since the Bush Administration proposed military participation in the drug  fight, the burden of the Pentagon's involvement has fallen not on full-time  regular troops but on part-time National Guard units in each state  </P> <P> The mood of the gathering was upbeat as veteran drug fighters from inner-city  Los Angeles swapped business cards with reservists from the New Mexico National  Guard. The attendees were conspicuous in the resort setting with their  uniformly short haircuts and pale complexions.  </P> <P> Much of the business was kept secret. The meeting's organizers refused to say  what was discussed in so-called "breakout meetings" that were closed to news  reporters. Nor would they say when the new coordinated drug war would commence.  </P> <P> "Nobody tells you everything in a war," said one grizzled federal agent from  New Mexico, who like the other conventioneers wore a name tag but asked that  his identity not be published. "Let the drug lords find out when we put them  behind bars."  </P> <P> One ranking official of the U.S. Customs Service, while declining to discuss  specifics in the closed-door sessions, said civilian authorities seemed  interested in determining how best they can use military equipment and  personnel. Of particular interest was how military intelligence can be used.  </P> <P> "If we merged intelligence from several sources, including the military, just  think how much more effective we can be in making seizures and arrests," the  customs official said.  </P> <P> Despite the optimism of those in attendance, it seemed evident that this new  war may have some rocky moments.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Herbert Temple, who heads the National Guard Bureau in Washington,  went out of his way to tell the civilian officials that the reserve military  units were not the ultimate players in the government's commitment to fight  drugs.  </P> <P> "We are not in charge of the war on drugs," he said. "You are. Our job is to  help you win it."  </P> <P> Temple also said he was hesitant to commit reservists to certain tasks, such as  searching cargo containers for illegal drugs, since that is not a "military  duty these folks were trained to do."  </P> <P> He said he would consult with civilian authorities on how best to deploy Guard  units.  </P> <P> California Gov. George Deukmejian addressed the group at its closing luncheon  at the Radisson Palm Springs Resort Hotel.  </P> <P> "While there are some pessimists who want to run up the white flag and  surrender, there is no question in my mind that this defeatist attitude is dead  wrong," Deukmejian said. "The health, safety and quality of our society depends  on it.  </P> <P> "We have a long, difficult, arduous fight ahead of us. But let me say, it is  worth it."  </P></p>

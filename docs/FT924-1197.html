			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Safeway store to close on Sundays SAFEWAY, the food store chain, yesterday became the first retailer to feel the effect of this week's European Court of Justice ruling upholding English Sunday trading laws. It has agreed to close its store at Newport, Shropshire, on Sundays from December 27. The store will be open tomorrow. The Wrekin Council took Safeway before the High Court. It was the first case since the European court's ruling that the Shops Act in England and Wales, which limits Sunday trading, did not clash with EC laws. The High Court did not issue an order for the store to close. It said it would wait for the European court's ruling to be considered by the House of Lords. Safeway said yesterday that it had agreed with the council that in the light of the legal action it would close its Newport store on Sundays from December 27 until any further court order, or until parliament changed the law. The agreement was approved by Mr Justice Morritt. Safeway said it was taking legal advice on whether to continue Sunday trading at other stores after tomorrow, although for the moment opening would continue. Other retailers, including J. Sainsbury and Tesco, said they would also go ahead with plans to open tomorrow. However, they would be taking legal advice and would be reviewing the situation when the House of Lords had considered the European court ruling.</p>

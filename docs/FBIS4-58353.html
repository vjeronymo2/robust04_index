			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by AL-THAWRAH correspondent Sa'ib 'Abd-al-Muhsin] </F>   [Excerpt] Marking the blessed birthday of the builder of  great Iraq's glory, leader President Saddam Husayn, may God  preserve and protect him, Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayr  inaugurated the first phase of the project to develop the Saddam  oilfield which was implemented by the technical teams of the  Northern Oil Company in Salah al-Din Governorate. It is  considered the biggest gas field in the country.    The ceremony began with a recital from the Holy Koran and a  prayer for the repose of the souls of the righteous martyrs.  Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad then delivered a speech in  which he said: I am pleased to be given the opportunity to  inaugurate this project amid the national celebrations of  immortal April and the birthday of leader President Saddam  Husayn, may God protect him. This is considered one of the  important projects to be carried out by the technical and  engineering teams of the Northern Oil Company to develop Iraqi  oilfields. The project involves the development of Saddam  oilfield, which the responsible foreign contracting company left  incomplete in August 1990.    Dr. Talal 'Ashur Kan'an, director general of the Northern  Oil  Company, also delivered a speech in which he said: The project,  whose first phase we are inaugurating today, is an integral oil  complex in this area which is far from the company's central  installations. The complex consists of units for oil  separation, soft oil treatment, desalination, dehydration,  treatment, and injection of polluted water, and gas assembly and  compression. The complex also includes two pipelines: an oil  pipeline which is linked to the second pumping station on the  second Iraqi-Turkish pipeline with special adjustments to link  it to the northern refineries, and a gas pipeline which is  linked to the northern gas complex. The designing of this  integral technical complex for the production of crude oil and  gas takes into consideration the possibility of expanding oil  operations in this area by including the production activities  of Hamrin oilfield in the future.

He died of head injuries, coroner's officials said. The office  said the other youths in the pickup were between the ages of 14 and 17.  </P> <P> The truck went over the side of the freeway between Mission Avenue and  Oceanside Boulevard.  </P> <P> Irvine police said they received a call shortly after 9 p.m. Saturday from a  woman who reported that people in a truck and car were either trying to  burglarize her automobile or steal it from the front of her Irvine home.  </P> <P> Officers spotted the truck and the late model Toyota going north on Culver  Drive near Warner Avenue.  </P> <P> Police said the car, which had also been stolen, turned right on Walnut Avenue  and sped down the street and into Heritage Park, where it crashed into an  abutment.  </P> <P> Two teen-agers were arrested on suspicion of car theft.  </P> <P> The truck continued north on Culver and onto I-5, with two Irvine police patrol  cars after it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 95 M.P.H. on Freeway  </P> <P> Officers reported that the truck maintained a speed of at least 95 m.p.h. on  the freeway through Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Saddleback Valley, San Clemente,  Camp Pendleton and into Oceanside.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa's Eagle 3 police helicopter was called on in the chase but had to  turn back because of low clouds and fog.  </P> <P> Before the chase entered Oceanside, the Irvine patrol cars pulled back and were  replaced by CHP units.  </P> <P> The injured youngsters were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, the  CHP said. The driver of the stolen truck was in critical condition.  </P></p>

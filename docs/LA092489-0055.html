			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: PORTLAND SETS EXAMPLE IN URBAN DESIGN  </P> <P> Although architecture is arguably the most permanent of the arts, the focus of  the profession can be very ephemeral.  </P> <P> Over the last decade, the focus has been on how buildings look and what sort of  statement they make.  </P> <P> But lately, there seems to be a healthy shift in the focus to a concern with  how buildings function within particular settings, how people use buildings and  how buildings affect the life around them.  </P> <P> It's also appropriate that this issue of design priorities -- being at least as  concerned with the experience of buildings as with their potential individual  expressiveness -- be raised in this damp Northwest city.  </P> <P> It was here seven years ago, that the bulky, grossly colored and flamboyantly  decorated municipal building designed by Michael Graves was unveiled, and  subsequently hailed, and then condemned as a landmark of the Post Modernist  movement. The Princeton-based architect was touted by profession icon Philip  Johnson, acting as a competition adviser to Portland.  </P> <P> The building generated star status and a bevy of commissions for Graves. And it  put Portland on the architectural map as the site of the "most important  significant American building of the decade," according to a prominent East  Coast design critic.  </P> <P> Now, seven years later, the Portland Building, as it is called, seems oddly  faded and does not command a second look, except for a monumental, figurative  sculpture of a graceful maiden above its entrance. It remains, as it did when  dedicated, an isolated architectural object, not particularly friendly to  passing pedestrians or users.  </P> <P> Instead, the design focus in downtown Portland these days has shifted and  broadened. It is distinguished not only by the preservation of landmarks, but  also how buildings are sited and scaled, and how they are knit together by  streets and sidewalks to create an engaging urban scene.  </P> <P> We are not talking here about the image of a building or an ensemble of  buildings as an isolated object, leaden with symbolism, to be viewed as a piece  of sculpture, preferably from a distance. But rather, about how buildings  function at ground level, what spaces they create, the experience of bordering  sidewalks and streets, broadly defined in the design profession as the public  realm. It is the stuff of urban design.  </P> <P> Helping is Portland's traditional sensitivity to open space, light and air -- a  sensitivity heightened by the cloudy conditions here part of the year. When the  sun shines, everyone wants to enjoy the rays and not be in the shadows of a  bulky building. Accommodating this are wide sidewalks, a network of open  spaces, edged with benches and spotted with fountains, several inviting plazas  and parks, and an attractive light-rail system serving downtown.  </P> <P> The result is an accessible, humanistic city offering a wealth of lessons in  urban design. These include how buildings are scaled so as not to overwhelm  streets, how their ground floors line the streets with engaging shops and  stores, how detailing such as brickwork lends color and safety to pavements,  how parks are made inviting to all and how people are encouraged to park their  cars and get out and walk, even in the rain.  </P> <P> To be sure, the lessons are not new.  </P> <P> What is happening in Portland is going on in varying degrees in many other  cities. San Francisco a few years ago approved an imaginative, if  controversial, plan to protect its downtown streetscapes that many felt were  being overwhelmed by indifferent commercial monoliths.  </P> <P> "There is a renewed appreciation in our design reviews of how critical  pedestrian life is to the building, the street and the city," comments Edward  Helfeld of the city's redevelopment agency.  </P> <P> And San Diego is looking much closer and carefully at how new developments  might generate more active street life, instead of discouraging it or  channeling it into the privatized world of a mall.  </P> <P> Buildings should not be viewed as pieces of sculpture but as part of a puzzle,  suggests Michael Stepner, who recently was appointed to the newly created  position of city architect. He notes his major concern is urban design.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles there also seems to be an increasing awareness of the importance  of urban design, particularly in the planning of large-scale developments.  </P> <P> Note the recent debates concerning the shaping of the open space for Phase 2 of  California Plaza, the interest in the streetscape designs in the Library Square  area and the concern for how the Grand Avenue Plaza proposal will affect the  historic scale and tone of 7th Street.  </P> <P> Most environmental reviews now include an urban design element evaluating how  particular developments will relate to neighboring buildings, and bordering  streets.  </P> <P> "As the city becomes more dense, the nature of the spaces between the buildings  becomes more critical," observes senior city planner Deborah Murphy.  </P> <P> This increasing awareness should be especially encouraging to those concerned  with the livability of the city.  </P> <P> After all, contrary to some opinions, Los Angeles is more than some sort of  facade seen from a freeway erected overnight like a backdrop for a movie set,  but a place where some people might actually want to get out of their cars and  stay awhile.  </P></p>

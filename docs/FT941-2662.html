			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysian affair - insensitivity and mistaken beliefs (1) Sir, As managing and marketing director of a small UK consulting company which exports technology and services around the world (including south-east Asia), I have followed the UK press coverage of the Malaysian Pergau Dam affair with a passionate interest. I never cease to be amazed at our (the West's) ability to report and, in effect, pass judgment on the rest of the world's social and business cultures. In SE Asia, these demand a high degree of sensitivity and consideration and go hand-in-hand in all walks of life, but this is especially so in any international business negotiations. Clumsy comment, whether true or false can (as proven with the press revelations of the Pergau Dam affair) result in significant and long lasting damage to international business for UK plc. Sir Edward Heath, appearing on a recent 'Frost on Sunday' interview, succinctly summed up the situation: 'With freedom comes responsibility'  - a profound and accurate comment which applies equally to our valued free press as it does to society as a whole. Mr Andrew Neil's Sunday Times coverage of the Pergau Dam affair has certainly increased the reader's awareness and has opened up a wound in the side of British politicians. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is rubbing its hands in eager anticipation of securing business which could have come to UK plc. If UK companies are to compete for and secure international business, helping exports, increasing employment opportunities and generating profits (the tax on which helps to support our national operating overheads - irrespective of the ruling political party), UK plc needs constructive not destructive support from all quarters - including the press. The effects resulting from the handling of this affair have not been restricted to Malaysia; already other business associates of ours in SE Asia are concerned that Britain's free press can say what it likes without being concerned about trade repercussions. The point is that our sensitive existing and potential business customers perceive it this way and this introduces yet another obstacle in securing new export business.

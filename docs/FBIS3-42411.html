A report was  delivered by Lieutnenant-General S. Pshenichnikov, chief of the  Personnel Training and Assignments Directorate of the Ground  Troops. We are publishing a report on that address.    The degree to which the forces are manned with officers,  their professional preparation, efficiency and sense of  responsibility are the determining factors with respect to  ensuring combat readiness and accomplishing the missions  involved in training and indoctrinating the personnel. This is  precisely why the upbringing and placement of military cadres is  one of the most important areas of work for commanders and  chiefs at all levels.    The changes occurring in the nation and in the armed forces,  however, have produced major changes in the organization and the  execution of the work performed with the officer corps and  greatly exacerbated many personnel problems and service issues.  More than 58,000 officers were discharged from the Ground Troops  during the period 1990-1992, around 26,000 (44.9 percent) of  them junior officers, an absolute majority of whom were below  the age of 30. A total of 7,603 officers were released into the  reserve during the first six months of 1993, including 4,082  (53.7 percent) junior officers. The number of young officers in  the officer corps of the Ground Troops has dropped 9%  during  the past year. Together with the reduction in the number of  military school graduates entering the troops, this has created  an adverse situation with respect to manning the positions of  platoon commanders and other primary officer positions.    The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that there  are at the present time no realistic possibilities or sources  for making up the shortage of officers to man the primary  positions. The capacity of the Ground Troops' schools was  calculated several years back based on a natural attrition of  4-5% of the officers, and at the present time it does not  meet  the requirements of the troops.    There is only one way out of the situation: to organize  specific, focused work with civilian school graduates who have  studied in the military departments. Most of them are now  receiving a noncommitting diploma and, due to the drop in  production, are having certain difficulties in finding jobs.  This creates the essential basis for acquiring candidates for  military service under contract. Success depends primarily upon  our ability to get in touch with the people. First of all, it is  necessary to proceed from the premise that as a rule the reserve  officer signs a contract with the command element of the  military unit at his place of residence. Upon signing a type-B  or type-C contract, the officer may not be transferred to a  different unit or garrison. At the same time, if the officer  experiences housing difficulties, he can be provided with  service housing or paid for the cost of renting.    When explaining the financial and material payments and  benefits, it is essential to provide specific facts and figures  to indicate not only the amount of pay for the position and  officer's rank but also other advantages: The payment of a  one-time monetary bonus for the year's results, material  assistance, payment for travel on city and suburban transport,  as well as travel to the place of leave and back, the value of  the food ration and clothing allowance issued, special payment  for housing and electricity, and so forth. With this approach  there is a basis for comparison, and in view of the present  social and economic difficulties this kind of specific work for  selecting civilian VUZ graduates and signing contracts with them  to serve in the army is producing good results.    Another aspect of the problem, which has to do with the  service of the young officers, is the ability and the desire of  commanders to work with them, to demonstrate concern for and  give attention to their problems and requests. If the commander  gets to know each newcomer and is able to deal with his needs  not as a formality but sincerely and paternally, the officer  will serve conscientiously, with desire and initiative. If not,  we shall have another candidate for early release into the  reserve. This is why it is essential to do everything possible  properly -- to receive and assign the young officers, to help  them in their service development and with their material and  personal matters.    Only by demonstrating real concern for retaining the army's  young cadres and working actively to attract personnel for  service under contract will we succeed in solving the problem of  manning the primary officer positions.    Working with officers assigned to the jurisdiction of  commanders in connection with the conduct of organizational and  establishment measures continues to be the most important for  the command element and personnel agencies. More than 13,000  officer positions will be cut this year under the plan of  organizational measures in the Ground Troops. There are already  around 6,300 supernumerary officers.    In view of the fact that the possibilities of the districts  for placing officers, particularly older ones, have practically  been exhausted, we must enhance control over the appointment of  officers to positions and also accelerate the release into the  reserve of officers who have served 20 or more years and are  provided with housing.    The leading role in this matter must be taken both by  commanders and personnel agencies and by the officers in their  work with the personnel. It is their common mission not to evade  acute questions but to answer them specifically and find  solutions acceptable to the officers.    Focused individual work with those officers who have served  out the established service terms based on age requires  particular attention. It is mandatory for everyone to strictly  observe the release plan and schedules for conducting talks and  sending officers to the VVK [military medical board], because  the prompt release of officers into the reserve is the main  source of vacancies today. On the other hand, observance of the  laws and formal send-offs of those being released into the  reserve will demonstrate our concern for them, help them make  the difficult transition in life and avert various complaints of  violations of the procedure for release into the reserve.    By decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Troops,  all officers who have served out the established period at  remote sites or in regions with difficult conditions and are  included in the replacement plan will be replaced. No changes  are permitted in the replacement plans. A directive to that  effect has been sent to the district personnel agencies.    COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 9 1993</p>

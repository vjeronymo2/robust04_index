			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / People: And Shakesby buzzes off Shiraz Malik-Noor, who re-emerged as King bee at royal jelly maker Regina after a long and acrimonious EGM in April, has strengthened his grip on the company. The board has appointed him executive chairman. His associate Guy Neely, a chartered accountant and former financial director of Glaxo Holdings, has stepped down as non-executive chairman to become financial director. Anthony Shakesby, the former financial director who managed to hold on to his job at the EGM, has at last buzzed off, resigning 'to pursue other interests'. Shakesby and former chairman Paul Geoghegan fiercely resisted Malik-Noor's return to the company in which he is the largest shareholder. Malik-Noor had been hived off in a coup last March. The USM-quoted group, which has numbered Lady Thatcher, Dame Barbara Cartland, Cliff Richard and Millwall Footballers among its customers, has negative shareholders' funds.</p>

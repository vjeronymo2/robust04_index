			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] Alfredo Jordan Morales, Politburo member and  agriculture minister, has met with farmers in Guisa  Municipality, Granma Province. They want to return to the  mountains, to land they abandoned when the Revolution triumphed.  The Agriculture Ministry is evaluating and accepting these  petitions, acting under a Politburo accord that allows the state  or cooperatives to give up unattended land that has agricultural  potential.    Approximately 600 caballerias to date have been apportioned  and are now covered with tobacco crops, worked by the people who  have made these requests. Jordan spoke at length with those who  were originally farmers and who are now working in restaurants  or other activities in the cities. These lands, abandoned for  more than 20 years and having agricultural potential and will be  replanted with tobacco, coffee, trees, and other crops.    Jordan told the farmers that the Agriculture Ministry will  be  happy to review any request from anyone anywhere in the country.  Jordan went on to inform them that the Ministry is confiscating  the land of those farmers who do not meet the commitments they  have with the state.    Family contract [contrato familiar] is the name given to the  document that was drafted by the Agriculture Ministry and the  bank that grants credit to those who request this contract to  cover initial expenses. It is nice to know that farmers,  people, and families are requesting land so that the production  of tubers, vegetables, and grain -- food for our population --  increases.</p>

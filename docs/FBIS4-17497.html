			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 22 Apr--The three-day talks in  Sevastopol between the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers  on a stage-by-stage settlement of the problems of the Black Sea  Fleet ended effectively in failure, given that no documents were  signed as a result. The Russian delegation returned to Moscow  without holding the concluding meeting with the Ukrainian  delegation. [passage omitted]    "We cannot agree to the staffs of the fleets of two states  being based in the same town," Grachev emphasized at a news  conference before flying for Moscow.    The Russian defense minister believes that the Ukrainian  side's position on the basing problem diverges from the accords  that have been previously reached and with Leonid Kravchuk's  statements.    "Sevastopol should be the main base of Russia's Black Sea  Fleet. We cannot and do not have the right to undermine its  combat readiness as an integral part of the Russian Federation  Armed Forces," Grachev declared.    Although no specific documents were signed on the problems  of  the Black Sea Fleet, the sides reached fundamental accord on the  parameters of dividing it up. The delegations agreed that the  force composition of the Black Sea fleet numbers 833 combatant  ships and vessels. According to preliminary calculations, 669  craft should go to Russia and 164 to Ukraine. Given the accords  reached previously on a 50-50 division of the Black Sea fleet,  Russia should pay Ukraine compensation for 252 ships. At the  same time, Grachev pointed out, over the recent period Ukraine  has unilaterally privatized 126 Black Sea Fleet ships and  vessels that should have been taken into account when the fleet  was divided up.    Grachev also said that, apart from Sevastopol, the Russian  Federation side intends to base its subdivisions in Balaklava,  Feodosiya, Kerch, and Donuzlav. Inter alia, it is planned to  locate about 70 percent of Russia's part of the fleet in  Sevastopol, 10 percent in Donuzlav, 5 percent in Balaklava, and  7 percent each in Feodosiya and Kerch. When the talks started,  the Ukrainian delegation was insisting that Russia could have  only one base for its fleet, in Donuzlav.    Unless the issue of bases for Russia's Black Sea Fleet and  Ukraine's Navy is settled, it is inexpedient to start the  process of dividing up the ships of the fleet, since without a  land-based infrastructure it cannot exist, Grachev said in  conclusion.</p>

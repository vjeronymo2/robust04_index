			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Consultation on car move - National Insurance EMPLOYERS would be consulted before the introduction of new regulations requiring them to pay national insurance contributions in respect of company cars provided for employees, Mr Nicholas Scott, minister of state for social security, assured the Commons last night. He said the new impost, which also applies to free fuel provided for employees, would not become payable until June of next year. MPs gave a general welcome to the Social Security (Contributions) bill authorising the new charges, which will yield Pounds 550m in respect of cars, and Pounds 60m in respect of fuel in 1991-92. Mr Scott said it was estimated that in the current year over 2m employees would receive the benefit of a company car as part of their remuneration package. Welcoming the bill, Mr Graham Allen for Labour suggested there was scope for extending tax charged on the 'company car perk'. The bill was given an unopposed second reading, and completed all its stages. It now goes to the House of Lords.</p>

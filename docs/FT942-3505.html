			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: LSE advises on stock borrowing practice The London Stock Exchange has published a guide on stock borrowing and lending aimed at informing lenders about recommended best practice. The booklet, developed in conjunction with the Bank of England's stock borrowing and lending committee, details the exchange's role in regulating activity. Market participants generally expect a surge in demand for borrowed equities once the stock exchange abandons its traditional two- and three-week account settlement period on July 18, and moves to a system of 'rolling settlement'. Some market-makers fear obtaining securities to cover 'short' positions in their proprietary trading books will be more difficult, forcing changes in the way they trade for their own account. There is also concern from regulators that institutions such as pension schemes which agree to engage in securities lending may fail to fully understand the risks. Stock Borrowing and Lending, The London Stock Exchange, Market Supervision Division, 071-797-3653. No Charge.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "prime minister </F> and finance minister in southern Yemen" by correspondents Falih  al-Saghir and Sa'ud al-Rayyis; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-YAWM] How do you explain the Arab evasion  concerning the recognition of the Democratic Republic of Yemen  [DRY]?    [Al-'Attas] This is due to the ambiguities of the current  situation. But now that the issue has been discussed by the UN  Security Council, I believe the time is very appropriate for  Arab and friendly countries to explicitly specify their stand in  order to avert further destruction of our people, which the  northern leadership carries out. [passage omitted]    [AL-YAWM] Do you believe recognition of the DRY will  increase  the chances of halting the war?    [Al-'Attas] Recognition will keep Sanaa from continuing what  it insists on carrying out.    [AL-YAWM] What is the actual number of dead and homeless?    [Al-'Attas] There are no accurate figures about how many  have been killed. But we estimate the number of dead at 60,000  and those made homeless at hundreds of thousands.    [AL-YAWM] What do you have to say to Sanaa's statement that  the southern forces were the ones to hit the Aden refinery?    [Al-'Attas] Two northern Air Force squadrons, each  comprising  four planes, raided the refinery. These are lies. It is very  shameful for them to resort to such lies. [passage omitted]    [AL-YAWM] What about the shortage of medical and food  supplies? Is there any assistance in this respect?    [Al-'Attas] The war in Yemen has resulted in an acute  shortage of medical and food supplies. We do not have the  medical supplies needed to treat those wounded in the war that  was ignited by the Sanaa leadership against our people in the  south.    There is also a shortage of food supplies as a result of the  war that obstructs their shipment to southern Yemen. We appeal  to our Arab brothers and our friends to send us medical supplies  and food.    [AL-YAWM] Will you ask Sanaa for war reparations?    [Al-'Attas] Certainly. Although the war has harmed all the  Yemeni people, the Sanaa leadership launched it. [passage  omitted]    [AL-YAWM] Are there foreign elements other than the Iraqis  within the northern forces?    [Al-'Attas] Yes, there are Sudanese elements, beside the  Iraqis. Iraq assists the northern forces. Jordan also provides  spare parts for aircraft and other equipment. We have  information that they received new aircraft and spare parts for  the Phantoms they have from Jordan. They also received other  forms of technical assistance and pilots. We know the pilots  that carry out the raids are not Yemenis but are Iraqis and from  other nationalities.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GM PURCHASES 50% OF SAAB; JOINT CAR PRODUCTION PLANNED  </P> <P> Saab-Scania AB stunned the automobile world today by agreeing to sell 50% of  its Saab auto division to General Motors Corp. for $600 million and set up a  venture with GM to produce cars together.  </P> <P> Saab has been hit by weak sales in recent years despite its long-standing image  as a maker of quality autos, and its diversified parent has been seeking a  partner to invest in the company.  </P> <P> The pact with GM, the world's largest car maker, came as a surprise since Saab  was widely expected to complete a deal with Italy's Fiat SpA.  </P> <P> Saab was driven to find a partner by a turndown linked to price increases and  intense competition. Its relatively small size has been a handicap in an  industry increasingly dominated by a handful of global car makers building up  for the unification of European Community markets in 1992.  </P> <P> GM has made strong gains in Europe in recent years while its domestic business  has fallen into a serious slump. The Saab purchase was viewed as a move to  consolidate its gains in Europe and shore up its quality image at home.  </P></p>

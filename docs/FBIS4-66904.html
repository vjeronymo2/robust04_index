			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Russia Implements START-1 Accord and </F> Helps Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia to Become Non-Nuclear"]    [Text] From the moment the START I accord on the reduction  of offensive weapons went into effect, Russia "has destroyed 350  missiles and 300 launchers," Colonel General Igor Sergeyev,  commander in chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, told a press  conference. He reminded the audience that Ukraine, Kazakhstan,  and Belorussia [Belarus] became parties to this accord in June  1992, and this put a fresh obligation upon Russia.    For example, according to Gen. Sergeyev, 180 nuclear weapons  have been shipped from Ukraine to the Russian Federation to be  destroyed at Russian plants under agreements between both  countries and the United States. Besides, as the commander in  chief intimated, as of last year Ukraine removed from alert  status RS-18 missile systems with expired guarantee dates; the  shipping of nuclear weapons to the Russian Federation and the  radiological decontamination of SS-24 missiles began this year.    Gen. Sergeyev also recalled that, in line with an agreement  signed with Minsk, the Strategic Rocket Forces group has been  placed under Moscow's jurisdiction: A scheduled withdrawal of  missile regiments to Russian territory is in progress.    An agreement also was reached this March with Kazakhstan on  lending a "Russian status" to the missile subunits deployed in  the republic, and on the dates for their pullout. Now an  agreement is in the works of the elimination of the missile  systems.    Col. Gen. Sergeyev underscored that the implementation of  the  disarmament process depends not only on the United States and  the Russian Federation but also on all former Soviet republics  on whose territories strategic arms are deployed.</p>

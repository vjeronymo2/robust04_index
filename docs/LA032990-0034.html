			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SUCCESS AT PHYSICAL FITNESS IS NOT LIMITED TO THOSE WITH  IDEAL BODIES  </P> <P> In America today, two visions seem to be emerging simultaneously. One is of  sleek, muscled bodies in expensive jogging shoes, colorful workout leotards or  revealing swimsuits. Svelte yet strong, this contingent sips diet sodas or  light beers, shuns fat and cholesterol and opts for slenderizing salads and  bean-sprout sandwiches in between trips to the health club.  </P> <P> On the other side, we've got the queen-size, comfortable look, fast-food fries,  crispy cooked chicken, burgers with everything and doughnuts baked fresh each  morning. This group varies from the "plump-is-prettier,  I-accept-myself-the-way-I-am" stance to the "I'll kill myself if I don't lose  40 pounds by next Wednesday, I'm going on a starvation diet now" approach.  </P> <P> What we're witnessing is partly encouraging, partly disturbing. In America  today, 34 million of us are overweight. Of that group, 13 million are seriously  obese. By contrast, only 30% of the population exercises regularly, and only  some at a level that promotes cardiovascular fitness.  </P> <P> But in TV and print advertising, the image of the physically fit, healthy,  happy individual is consistently held out as the ideal. Success is portrayed as  a combination of youthful physical prowess, self-confidence and affluence.  </P> <P> In life, there is always a conflict between reality and perfection. Naturally,  we think good health and physical fitness are worthy goals toward which we all  should strive. It's healthier not to be overweight, and it feels good to be  physically active. What's more, it's a sign of civilization's progress that the  old view of women -- as weak creatures in need of protection -- is being  replaced by a vision of strength and independence.  </P> <P> TV or magazine ads that show people jogging or lifting weights may spur some  people into action. That's all to the good. Where we might run into trouble is  when such a presentation of the small group of Americans who are at the  pinnacle of fitness becomes not an inspiration but a source of depression to  the others.  </P> <P> If you're a good 75 pounds overweight, seeing an ad for a slender celebrity  working out at the spa could make you feel worse than ever. You may say to  yourself, "I can't afford to join a health club, and even if I exercised for a  million years I'd never look like a famous movie star, so why bother?" And then  there's your hand, reaching for the doughnut box again.  </P> <P> Our message is a simple one: Set your own goals. In their desire to sell  products, the media and the industries they represent create images we can  never match in our own lives. But that doesn't mean we should give up and sink  into sedentary "flabdom."  </P> <P> You don't have to aim for the body of celebrated muscle man or Wonder Woman to  be healthy and strong. In other words, you don't have to try to re-make  yourself to fit somebody else's vision of perfection -- a goal you probably  can't achieve anyway. That might just mean setting yourself up for failure and  frustration.  </P> <P> Think realistically, not on a grand scale. Ask yourself, "What can I do today  to maintain or improve my health?" How about a 20-minute walk? Or a trip to the  supermarket to buy fresh fruits and vegetables. Forgo the submarine sandwich at  lunch and take something lighter; go to the store and price exercise machines;  check a cookbook for a new, interesting low-fat recipe. Find out where in your  neighborhood you can swim regularly; use stairs instead of elevators at work;  go for an after-dinner stroll with your family instead of (or at least before)  plunking down by the TV.  </P> <P> These suggestions add up to a general approach that can make a difference.  You're likely to find that some of the changes turn out to be fun, not  burdensome, as long as you're following your own agenda rather than forcing  yourself into a prefabricated model.  </P> <P> The point is to think about what your own life is like and what your  preferences are, and to incorporate into that a desire to be a healthier, more  active person. The Greeks devised the concept of the "golden mean," which has  remained valid throughout the span of centuries. The muscular actor or actress  in the TV commercial whose body is sculpted to perfection and who seems to own  the world may have about as much to do with body type and life as does the man  in the moon.  </P> <P> But if that vision isn't attainable, the alternative doesn't have to be  resignation and a size-large pizza. There is a place in between spending  umpteen hours a day at a health club and growing so totally out of shape that  you get winded running for the telephone. You need to find that place -- your  own personal golden mean -- and use it to work toward good health and good  times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slight Differences for Pink, White Grapefruit  </P> <P> Question: Are there any nutritional differences between pink grapefruit and  white grapefruit?  </P> <P> Answer: The real difference between the two is that pink or red grapefruit  contains some carotene, which the body converts to Vitamin A. Color is the key  to how much it provides.  </P> <P> For example, figures derived from an average of pink and red fruits grown in  California, Arizona and Florida indicate that half a grapefruit will provide,  on average, about 6% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for Vitamin A.  However, values for red grapefruit from Texas are more than twice that.  </P> <P> Beyond that, grapefruit are nutritionally similar. For a small grapefruit  weighing about a pound, half will have approximately 40 calories. It also  contains some iron and B vitamins. And it is an excellent source of Vitamin C;  a small grapefruit usually provides 75% of the day's needs.  </P> <P> Q: I bought two bottles of olive oil several months ago. When I went to use the  second one, I noticed a milky residue in the bottom. Does this mean it's  unsafe?  </P> <P> A: No it doesn't. The fatty acids in olive oil are mainly monounsaturated.  However, it also contains varying amounts of saturated fatty acids, which tend  to be solid at room temperature. The milky residue you describe is made up of  crystals of saturated fatty acids that have settled to the bottom of the  bottle. You would observe the same phenomenon, perhaps even more extensively,  if you stored the oil in the refrigerator, since cooler temperatures speed the  process.  </P> <P> That doesn't mean you should avoid refrigeration. While olive oil can keep up  to two years if tightly sealed and stored away from heat and light, it is  sometimes recommended that to prevent it from becoming rancid, it should be  stored in the refrigerator when the weather is hot and humid. As it comes to  room temperature, or with slight warming, it will turn clear once again.  </P> <P> Q: We live in an area where there are many fine restaurants. Yet for anyone  interested in a low-fat, health-conscious menu, eating out is very difficult.  We've spoken to one young chef who says that if he had guidelines, he would add  a low-fat selection to the menu. Can you give us directions in helping him?  </P> <P> A: Across the country, both fine restaurants serving elegant fare and those  catering to more everyday needs increasingly are offering low-fat menus  designed to please the palate and, at the same time, taste as good as richer  dishes.  </P> <P> The basis guidelines are the same as those used by millions of Americans in  their homes. They begin with heavy reliance on ingredients that are low in fat  and light on salt, and then preparing them by methods that do not require  adding much salt or fat, particularly saturated fat. And, of course, for flavor  they should rely on the freshness of the food and on herbs and spices, rather  than a heavy hand with the salt shaker.  </P> <P> For example, well-seasoned vegetables purees often replace rich cream sauces  for chicken. Alternatively, a tart fruit sauce is used for lightly sauteed fish  fillets or poultry. Pasta dishes with simple but appealing sauces prepared from  several varieties of mushrooms carefully seasoned with herbs and perhaps a  little smoked salmon are another choice. In place of (or in addition to)  cream-based soups, restaurants are offering soups that make use of good fish  stock, hot chile seasonings or the wonderful flavor of fresh vegetables.  </P> <P> Fresh fruit, attractively served, should be a menu mainstay, with some sorbet  for those who want it, and perhaps cookies prepared with unsaturated fat. Some  people are concerned about fat and sodium but not worried about their weight.  For that audience, the chef might prepare elegant desserts, such as cakes  prepared mainly with oil (not butter) and served with fruit slices.  </P> <P> To help the young chef get started, we have several basic suggestions. First,  he might begin by searching among his repertoire for recipes that lend  themselves to adaptation. Second, he should consider working with a registered  dietitian who could not only offer specific guidance on modifying his recipes,  but who could provide him with nutrient analyses with respect to fat, saturated  fat and sodium. He can find one through his state's dietetic association.  </P> <P> We also recommend that the chef clearly identify those special dishes on this  menu, and provide information about calories, fat and sodium to his customers.  Experience suggest that all this is good for business.  </P></p>

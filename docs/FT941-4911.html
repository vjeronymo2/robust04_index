			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Flamboyant director of Rome Opera resigns Giampaolo Cresci, controversial director of Rome Opera, has resigned. His sudden departure from the post, two years before his contract was due to expire, ends a flamboyant regime marred by a L35bn (Pounds 14m) deficit, spectacular backstage rows and talk of scandal. In the latest crisis, Cresci was summoned to appear in court with the singer Jose Carreras over allegations that the opera house paid the Spanish tenor an unauthorised extra L130m - on top of the normal fee of L30m plus L10m expenses - for a recital in October 1992. The public prosecutor claims that a decision was taken to make an extra payment to Carreras and describe it in accounts as 'sponsorship'. Magistrate Filippo Laviano is seeking to try Cresci on charges of abuse of office. Carreras' agent, through his lawyer, denies any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying that the singer was paid rather less than his usual fee. The agent does not, however, disclose the sum actually paid. The allegations follow a succession of sackings and rehirings and accusations of extravagance of heroic proportions recalling, according to one Italian newspaper, a Byzantine court in the last stages of decadence. A payment of L27m was allegedly made for unnecessary English language courses for the opera house fire brigade. L51m went towards a New York production of Aida which never took place. Recently, more than 1,200 operatic costumes were impounded by a renovation company, which threatens to sell the costumes at auction in May if the opera house does not pay its bill of L1.25bn. There have also been accusations by Roman concert institutions that the opera house filched artists under exclusive contract to them (Rockwell Blake from the Accademia Filarmonica Romana and Georges Pretre from Santa Cecilia, who was later forced to return). So catastrophic was the financial situation at the opera house that the 'Green' mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, appointed himself Rome Opera commissioner and delegated the unravelling of the theatre's finances to Vittorio Ripa di Meana. 'We can no longer allow the director to continue,' said Rutelli. 'We have already waited far too long as more and more terrible stories about the financial mess at the opera emerge every day.' Cresci was unperturbed and dismissed the deficit as 'a mere trifle . . . no more than the cost of a few tanks.' He went on to add, with unnerving candour, 'only an infinitesimal part of it went into bribes.' Last week, both Rutelli and di Meana resigned in exasperation at Cresci's intransigence and the deputy prime minister, Senator Antonio Maccanico, was obliged to step in. By the weekend, it was Cresci's turn to step down and his resignation was accepted, while Rutelli and di Meana agreed to return to their posts. The queue to take over the job of director of Rome Opera, dubbed by Riccardo Muti as 'Barnum's Circus', is not enormous. It is viewed by some as a poisoned chalice. Mayor Rutelli's choice, Sergio Escobar of the Bologna Comunale, has already let it be known that he would rather remain where he is. The search for a successor goes on.</p>

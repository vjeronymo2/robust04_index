			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an applicant does not have an approved rate agreement, an indirect cost rate proposal should be prepared in accordance with Section XI.H.4. of the Grant Guideline, based on the applicant's audited financial statements for the prior fiscal year. (Applicants lacking an audit must budget all project costs directly.) If an indirect cost rate proposal is to be submitted, the budget should reflect estimates based on that proposal. Obviously, this requires that the proposal be completed at the time of application so that the appropriate estimates may be included; however, grantees have until three months after the project start date to submit the indirect cost proposal to the Institute for approval. An indirect cost rate worksheet on computer diskette is available from the Institute upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Does the budget truly reflect all costs required to complete the project? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After preparing the program narrative portion of the application, applicants may find it helpful to list all the major tasks or activities required by the proposed project, including the preparation of products, and note the individual expenses, including personnel time, related to each. This will help to ensure that, for all tasks described in the application (e.g., development of a videotape, research site visits, distribution of a final report), the related costs appear in the budget and are explained correctly in the budget narrative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations To Grantees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Institute's staff works with grantees to help assure the smooth operation of the project and compliance with the SJI Guidelines. On the basis of monitoring more than 800 grants, the Institute staff offers the following suggestions to aid grantees in meeting the administrative and substantive requirements of their grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> After the grant has been awarded, when are the first quarterly reports due? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Quarterly Progress Reports and Financial Status Reports must be submitted within 30 days after the end of every calendar quarter_i.e. no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30_regardless of the project's start date. The reporting periods covered by each quarterly report end 30 days before the respective deadline for the report. When an award period begins December 1, for example, the first Quarterly Progress Report describing project activities between December 1 and December 31 will be due on January 30. A Financial Status Report should be submitted even if funds have not been obligated or expended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By documenting what has happened over the past three months, Quarterly Progress Reports provide an opportunity for project staff and Institute staff to resolve any questions before they become problems, and make any necessary changes in the project time schedule, budget allocations, etc. Thus, the Quarterly Project Report should describe project activities, their relationship to the approved timeline, and any problems encountered and how they were resolved, and outline the tasks scheduled for the coming quarter. It is helpful to attach copies of relevant memos, draft products, or other requested information. An original and one copy of a Quarterly Progress Report and attachments should be submitted to the Institute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional Quarterly Progress Report or Financial Status Report forms may be obtained from the grantee's Program Manager at SJI, or photocopies may be made from the supply received with the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Do reporting requirements differ for renewal grants or package grants? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Recipients of a continuation, on-going support, or package grant are required to submit quarterly progress and financial status reports on the same schedule and with the same information as recipients of a grant for a single new project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as a supplement to and extension of the original award, and the reports numbered accordingly. For example, if the last quarterly report filed under the original award is report number six, the first report including a portion of the renewal grant should be report number seven.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recipients of a package grant should file a summary Financial Status Report covering the entire package as well as separate financial reports for each of the projects in the package, identified by letter of the alphabet (e.g., SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What information about project activities should be communicated to SJI? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, grantees should provide prior notice of critical project events such as advisory board meetings or training sessions so that the Institute Program Manager can attend if possible. If methodological, schedule, staff, budget allocations, or other significant changes become necessary, the grantee should contact the Institute's program monitor prior to implementing any of these changes, so that possible questions may be addressed in advance. Questions concerning the financial requirements section of the Guideline, quarterly financial reporting or payment requests, should be addressed to the Chief or Deputy Chief of the Institute's Finance and Management Division.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is helpful to include the grant number assigned to the award on all correspondence to the Institute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

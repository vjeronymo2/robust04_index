			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- A rough ride is expected  for the dollar next week as the political turmoil unleashed  Friday [21 January] hurts the yen but boosts political pressure  for a weak dollar.    Dealers expect stocks and market interest rates to tumble,  at  least initially, in the wake of Friday's crushing defeat for  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform package.    Fundamentally, that spells trouble for the yen, but with  hopes receding for the preoccupied government to craft speedy  economic stimulus measures, fundamentals may take a back seat to  international politics, dealers said.    That thinking drove the dollar lower in Europe after the  reform vote in the House of Councillors, which followed the  Tokyo close. It dipped briefly to a one-month low below 110 yen  in London, but was bought back afterward on perceptions that it  had been oversold and closed at 111.10-20 yen. It later  finished in New York at 111.55-65 yen.    In Tokyo, the U.S. currency declined 0.45 yen for the week  to  111.30 yen, wavering in a range of less than 1 yen as the market  awaited the reform vote.    The U.S. Government has been withholding high-yen pressure  to  give the young Hosokawa coalition a chance to cut Japan's trade  deficit by expanding domestic demand and thus boosting imports,  Tokyo dealers say.    With such fiscal hopes on the rocks, they believe, America  may pull the monetary lever, talking the yen up to make Japanese  imports cheaper in yen terms and putting the heat on Japan's  exporters by forcing export prices up in other currency terms.    "We have to pay more attention to the politics from now on,"  said Takao Sako, head of yen trading at the Union Bank of  Switzerland. But the result for the currency market will be  "very unpredictable," he said.    With U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen holding hastily  arranged meetings Sunday in Tokyo with Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii and Hosokawa, players wondered if Washington would play  the "high-yen card" before February's bilateral summit.    Adding to the pressure were Friday's report of a record 120  billion dollar 1993 Japanese trade surplus, stalled bilateral  trade talks and President Bill Clinton calling Japan one of "our  biggest problems" on trade.    Washington "won't allow a weaker yen," said Junichi Kodama,  a  Chemical Bank vice president and head of corporate foreign  exchange sales.    He predicted a test of chart-based technical support in the  109 yen range next week with any rebounds curbed at 111 yen.    The chance for dollar declines is building, but "we just  can't predict," said dealer Yuko Fukakusa at Tokai Bank.    Chief dealer Toru Itami at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. said  that after the market's first reaction to sell the dollar, it  may recall the apparently steady U.S. recovery as compared with  Japan, where the Bank of Japan said Friday that recession  continues and "any salient economic recovery is still at a  distance."</p>

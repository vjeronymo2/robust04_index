			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the second year of this grant, the grantee institution will improve the prototype program based on year-one experiences, and will offer the hands-on science program to a new group of Head Start staff during the summer 1996. Also during the second year, the ``A Head Start on Science'' grantee will fund for one year, and mentor another college or university to: (1) implement the prototype ``A Head Start on Science'' model in the summer of 1996 and; (2) provide follow-up assistance to the Head Start staff as they plan to implement their new skills in their local programs. The addition of a second institution will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of the concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the grant period, a third party evaluator must be secured by the grantee institution to assess the effectiveness of the approach, content and transferability of the ``A Head Start on Science'' project. The third party evaluator must not be involved in the conduct of the demonstration. The evaluation of the students in both institutes in the summer of 1996 will be completed by the end of the project period. It should focus on the students' plans for the implementation of the program and principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Head Start Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Project Period and Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A total of approximately $550,000 in ACF funds will be available to fund the demonstration project for a 24 month period. Applicants must propose how much will be needed for each 12 month period of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The grantee must provide at least 20 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project requesting $550,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of approximately $275,000 per budget period) must provide &sect;137,500 in cash or in-kind contributions (20% of total project costs of $687,500).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

Colleges and universities are eligible to apply for these funds. The college or university must also be able to award college credit to Head Start staff that successfully complete the summer program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The project should be directed toward Head Start teachers, teachers' assistants and/or home visitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Funds may be used for university operating expenses and related costs. Related costs include such activities as planning and development costs, administration, supplies, insurance, university staff salaries, training provided at Head Start events and the third party evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The university or college institute teaching team will be comprised of individuals with knowledge of science, adult learning, and early childhood education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Part III_Specific Responsibilities of the Applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When submitting an application under this announcement, applicants should include a maximum of 50 typed, doubled-spaced pages.

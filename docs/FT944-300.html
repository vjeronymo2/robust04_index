			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexican finance minister quits as part of rescue plan Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo announced yesterday that as part of an 'emergency economic plan' to be implemented in January he had accepted the resignation of Mr Jaime Serra Puche as finance minister. Mr Serra will be replaced by Mr Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, minister of communications and transport and former chief deputy to Mr Pedro Aspe at the finance ministry during the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas. The emergency plan will seek to mitigate the negative effects on the economy caused by the 29 per cent devaluation of the peso over the past two weeks and the resulting financial crisis threatening the country. In Washington, meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said he backed reform efforts in Mexico and was looking into 'what we can do' to stabilise the peso: 'It is something that I take seriously . . . We're talking to the Mexican government about what we can do.' Earlier in the day, the Mexican peso stabilised as investors were reassured by reports that an emergency economic plan would receive backing from leading industrial countries and international financial institutions. Mexican reports suggested that the international backing might range from approval from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations of Mr Zedillo's proposals to funding of up to Dollars 10bn to ease fears over repayment obligations. A delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Mexico City late on Wednesday night and was reported to have met Mr Zedillo and Mr Serra, who had been criticised for poor handling of the peso crisis. In a speech long on explanations of why the devaluation was necessary and short on details of what concrete economic measures will be taken next year, Mr Zedillo said last night the new economic plan would include four main elements: an accord between labour and business that 'prevents falling into a race between devaluation and inflation'; a fiscal adjustment that would reduce the country's dangerous current account deficit and imply an important reduction in government spending; a series of measures to deepen Mexico's structural reform and international competitiveness, including further private participation in infrastructure development and ownership; and the establishment of an international assistance fund 'large enough to permit financial stability in the shortest time possible'. At the close, the rate for the peso was 4.875 to the US dollar, slightly up from Wednesday's close of 4.975, while the Mexican stock market was up 3.14 per cent. Mexican equities in New York continued a slow climb that began on Wednesday. Bid to win confidence, Page 5</p>

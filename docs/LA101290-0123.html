			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRIA REPORTED MOVING TO OUST LEBANON'S AOUN  </P> <P> Tank-led Syrian troops closed in on major routes leading to rebel Maj. Gen.  Michel Aoun's enclave Thursday, and police said an attack appeared imminent to  evict Aoun from Lebanon's Christian heartland.  </P> <P> Hours earlier, President Elias Hrawi, Lebanon's internationally recognized  chief of state, had asked Damascus for help to crush Aoun's resistance to his  government.  </P> <P> Aoun commands about 15,000 mainly Christian troops from the presidential palace  in East Beirut. He refuses to recognize Hrawi and rejects an Arab-sponsored  peace pact for Lebanon.  </P> <P> Police said a dozen columns of Syrian T-62 tanks and thousands of soldiers  moved up to combat positions to support Hrawi's army along a five-mile front  from southern Beirut to the central mountains east of the capital.  </P> <P> France was making an 11th-hour mediation bid to persuade Aoun to abandon the  palace and leave for Paris, a Hrawi government source said. The source said  that French Ambassador Rene Ala was in radio contact with Aoun, urging him to  "spare Lebanon another blood bath."  </P> <P> "If and when Ambassador Ala tells us his effort failed, our forces, backed by  the Syrian army, will attack," he said. He mentioned no deadline.  </P> <P> Aoun's radio station instructed inhabitants of his enclave, home for 150,000  Christians, to ring church bells all night to "protest what looks like an  imminent military thrust."  </P> <P> The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate  to end the long civil war between Muslims and Christians.  </P> <P> For the last three weeks, 20,000 Hrawi troops and Syrian soldiers have ringed  Aoun's 80-square-mile bastion in a bid to starve the maverick general into  submission.  </P> <P> Aoun has vowed to fight unto death if attacked.  </P></p>

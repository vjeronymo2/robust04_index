			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Indonesian army 'to keep role in politics' Indonesia's army will continue to play a political role in the country for a long time yet, senior military officials said in Jakarta yesterday. At a meeting between foreign media and military personnel, Lt Gen HB Mantiri, chief of staff for general affairs, said the military's role in civilian affairs will 'go on forever and ever'. The Indonesian constitution contains a legal basis for what is known as the military's 'dual function', its civilian and military role. 'We are like shepherds,' said Gen Mantiri. 'Sometimes we are in the middle of politics, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind.' The military's emphasis on internal political affairs, rather than creating a professional army, has had its costs. Gen Mantiri admitted the army was under-equipped when it came to defending Indonesia's many islands. This was one of the reasons Indonesia had bought a fleet of 39 former East German warships, a controversial acquisition. 'But even when these ships come, our equipment is still not yet up to the minimum standard because we have to cover such a big country.' The acquisition of the former East German warships was a hotly-debated topic between Mr JB Habibie, minister for research and technology, and Mr Marie Muhammad, minister of finance, who argued the purchase was too expensive. Lively coverage of the argument which split the ruling elite prompted the forced closures of three popular general news magazines in June this year. Former employees at DeTik, one of the magazines banned in June, have now joined a weekly newspaper called Simponi, which was launched on Monday this week. Asked if the military would allow this magazine to survive, Gen Mantiri said: 'We hope it will live for a long time, but it depends on them. If, like the other three magazines, they do not heed our warnings, they may only last one day or one week.' Indonesia, which encompasses more than 13,000 islands and 187m people, has a long history of military involvement in politics. President Suharto, who has governed the country since 1967, was an ex-army general himself. The Indonesian military differs from other military forces in south-east Asia because its role in socio-political affairs is enshrined in the law.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Decisions based on hard data - Sponsorship One reason why arts sponsorship has been slow to develop from a chairman's perk to a vital component in a company's strategic marketing programme is the lack of research into its effectiveness. This is not surprising. It can cost more to assess scientifically the impact of sponsorship on an arts event than the funding of the event itself. This is changing. Sponsorship is moving inexorably under the control of marketing directors who tend to make spending decisions on the basis of hard data. So when Clerical Medical, the insurance company, considered increasing its commitment to arts sponsorship, it thought it essential first to invest in research. A Pounds 15,000 survey into the composition of the audience for the arts, and its views on arts sponsorship, has not come up with anything sensational but its very existence has been enough to sway the board. This year Clerical Medical spent under Pounds 100,000 on arts sponsorship, mainly on music at the Bath Festival. In the future, while its competitors concentrate on sport, it plans to reach its potential customers by investing more heavily in the arts. The research, which is based on responses from over 8,000 individuals, confirms that the audience for the arts is just what a company wants - affluent, middle aged, and committed. Arts lovers prefer music and the theatre way above other arts forms and see little wrong with sponsorship. They think sponsors should concentrate on trying to bring seat prices down, and their main complaint is that sponsors grab the best seats. In the main the research is positive. The findings would perhaps deter companies from supporting the experimental and the avant-garde, but suggest that the Royal Opera House is on the right lines in its attempt to get prospective sponsors to help by subsidising seat prices rather than new productions. ABSA played its part in producing the research and will supply copies of the findings for Pounds 150 to its members and Pounds 75 for arts organisations. The Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, under which Pounds 4.5m. of Government money is available this year to match new, and existing, sponsorships by companies, has gone international. British Council offices in 98 countries can now apply for grants, up to a collective limit of Pounds 250,000. The first beneficiary was the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Its visit to Thailand was sponsored by Jaguar to the value of Pounds 15,000 and the Bangkok office of the British Council secured an additional Pounds 3,750 for the trip through the BSIS scheme. As an established sponsor Jaguar only qualified for a 1:4 bonus. The British Council is selling hard to business the commercial spin-offs that can follow from sponsoring British arts companies on overseas trips, especially the opportunities to meet key foreign politicians. Its enterprise is paying off. Last year it brought in Pounds 6.8m. in sponsorship, beating its target by Pounds 1m . And most of this sum, Pounds 4.9m. in fact, fostered arts events rather than exchanges and training. In the current economic climate it is getting harder to persuade business to invest in the arts and there are numerous arts companies, including the RSC, the CBSO, and the National Theatre, still seeking sponsors for projected overseas tours this year. But the Council has raised its target for 1993-94 and has high hopes of a major splash in Los Angeles in late 1994. Glaxo has put up Pounds 36,000 for a three-year programme to give the children of Ealing, where it is a major employer, their first taste of opera. Pavilion Opera performed Donizetti's L'Elisir d'amore in four schools during May, and 1500 children were involved in linked projects and as an enraptured audience. The recently established Pavilion Opera Educational Trust (POET) is now talking to the mayors of Westminster and Tower Hamlets in the expectation of finding local companies who will support performances in these boroughs in future years. POET chairman Geoffrey Simmonds is seeking Pounds 75,000 a year which will finance twelve school performances by the chamber opera troupe. Vanity Fair, the magazine, is spending the little money it has this year for promotion on helping the arts in an unconventional way: by underwriting parties. On Thursday 250 friends of the Serpentine Gallery gathered, with the Princess of Wales, for a gala dinner designed to raise around Pounds 50,000 towards the Serpentine's Pounds 1.5m. rebuilding appeal. The party went all the better thanks to a Pounds 30,000 contribution from Vanity Fair. Earlier this year Vanity Fair paid for the launch party for the movie Damage. It feels that the participants at these glitzy charity events are its type of reader. It also helps that the Serpentine is enhancing the gala with a three-day show of works by artists who have enjoyed exhibitions in its bucolic setting over the decades, artists like Hockney, Moore, Rego, Hitchens, and others. As usual the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT), which opened yesterday, has been well backed by sponsors. The key new sponsor is BT which, in its desire to get involved with community projects, is supporting two local carnivals, one based around Vietnamese newcomers to Greenwich, the other a Trinidadian masquerade in Spitalfields. In addition it is backing LIFT's first major educational programme in which overseas artists train London school children in their skills. Cable &amp; Wireless, Enterprise Oil, Routledge, and British Gas are also involved, and Cameron Mackintosh is financing a visit by the Hanoi Water Puppets, the first Vietnamese arts group to tour the UK, in recognition of the Vietnamese contribution to his hit musical, Miss Saigon. There may be no Glyndebourne Festival in Sussex this year (the theatre is being totally rebuilt) but the nine concerts arranged by Glyndebourne with the LPO on London's South Bank this summer are virtually sold out, and the first, a concert performance of Beatrice et Benedict on June 21st, is to be sponsored by the Banque Nationale de Paris.</p>

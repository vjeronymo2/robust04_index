			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] France's relations with Germany and  the European Union (EU) were the subject of several commentaries  and interviews in the 7 May Paris weekly LE POINT.  <H5>  `Malaise' in French-German Relationship </H5>   According to commentator Alain Dauvergne, while relations  between France and Germany appear exemplary on the surface and  their level of cooperation is "unprecedented" in Europe,  problems do exist between the two countries. He claimed that a  "malaise" has troubled the relationship for several years ever  since German unification and Bonn's formulation of new ambitions  and cited former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas as saying that  "it is a euphemism to say today that things are not going well  between the two countries." This "malaise" and the disagreement  between the two countries stemming from the Bundesbank's  interest rate policy has given rise to a "vaguely poisonous"  climate. As an example of the difficulties in the bilateral  relationship, Dauvergne cited Germany's ambition to have more  deputies in the European Parliament to account for its greater  population after unification. While the initiative was not  "shocking," he questioned the way in which Bonn "literally  imposed" East German observers on the Parliament immediately  after unification. He also cited another German ambition, now  openly advocated by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of obtaining  a permament seat on the UN Security Council. Dauvergne  maintained that such moves demonstrate that the Germans now feel  "more muscular" and "speak louder" in an international context.    Dauvergne remarked that Paris has reacted negatively to the  change in Germany's foreign policy style but is at a loss as to  how to respond to Bonn's ambition to take a more assertive role  in international affairs. He maintained Bonn is assuming the  leadership in Europe because Paris has remained silent.  According to Dauvergne, since the difficult Maastricht  referendum, the French, across the political spectrum, seem to  be "on the defensive" and incapable of playing their traditional  role of "inventors" of Europe.    While expressing skepticism about Germany's intentions,  Dauvergne recommended taking steps to escape the encroaching  "malaise" in Franco-German relations. He commented favorably on  Dumas' call for a "new bilateral start at all levels."  Dauvergne said that such a process could begin at the  Franco-German summit at the end of May, although it does not  appear to be on the agenda. According to German Foreign  Minister Kinkel, the summit will discuss enlargement of the EU  to include East European states. According to Dauvergne, while  the Germans insist they have no intention of "killing Europe,"  it remains to be seen whether their behavior may not lead to  this very result.  <H5>  EU Expansion Potentially `Disastrous' </H5>   In an interview with Dauvergne, the chairman of the Senate  Committee on Economic Affairs, Jean Francois-Poncet, expressed  the opinion that expansion of the EU without first undertaking  institutional reorganization might have "disastrous"  consequences for Europe. Francois-Poncet maintained that the EU  will be a 16-member organization functioning with a system  designed for six, with few chances of meeting future challenges.  Asked the reason for the "formidable pressure" applied by  Germany on behalf of adding members, he said it should not be  concluded that Germany has suddenly become anti-European but  that, after unification, Bonn thinks that the EU no longer  matches Europe's political and economic configuration. He also  argued that Germans feel strongly that with the addition of  Greece, Portugal, and Spain, the EU became "very Mediterranean,"  a consequence that the French had underestimated. To avoid  "increasing paralysis," he expressed the hope that a "hard  nucleus" of member countries will emerge within the EU, a  subject that should be debated during the 1996 EU conference  aimed at reviewing the European institutional system.    Francois-Poncet also commented on relations between France  and Germany. He suggested that following the German  parliamentary elections and the French presidential elections a  Franco-German seminar be held to prepare for the 1996 EU  conference and to begin planning for a revision of the  Franco-German treaty.  <H5>  Eurodeputy Criticizes German `Arrogance' </H5>   A commentary by Catherine Pegard criticized Germany's  lobbying effort in the European Parliament on behalf of EU  membership for the Scandinavian countries and Austria. Claiming  that the German efforts were "unprecedented," she wrote that the  "entire panoply of persuasion" was used, from telephone calls to  financial "blackmail." Certain deputies such as centrist  Francois Froment-Meurice--"not a foe of enlargement"--were  "frankly surprised." According to Pegard, Froment-Meurice said  he had a bad reaction "when pressure reaches this level of  arrogance" and warned that "our German friends--indeed, our  German brothers--should not forge that arrogance may sometimes  be their worst enemy."  <H5>  EU Structural Problems Viewed </H5>   A commentary by Alain Duhamel criticized the proposal to add  four new members to the EU at a time when, he maintained, the  Franco-German duo seems to be "short of ideas" and "rather  devoid of energy." He warned that an increase in the number of  member countries should not result in "diminished collective  energy." Complaining that EU executive power is becoming  increasingly "anemic," he claimed that the rotating six-month  presidency of the European Council is devalued by imbalances  that increase with every enlargement of EU membership. He  insisted that these structural obstacles should be removed  before the arrival of four new members. The 1996 conference  that will attempt to tackle these issues will be four years too  late, Duhamel maintained, adding that by then the EU's best  defenders "will be writing their memoirs and growing the roses  of retirement."</p>

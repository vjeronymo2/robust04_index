			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Ireland finds progress difficult - International Given Ireland's recent impressive economic performance - high growth, coupled with low inflation and a healthy government budget deficit - the outlook for the country's government bond market should be bright. However, until a better tone returns to other world government bond markets, progress for the Irish market will be difficult. Irish gilts have not been spared the dramatic fall in prices that has afflicted most of the world's government bond markets in 1994. Since their trough in February of this year, the yield on Irish gilts has risen by about 2.5 percentage points to 8.7 per cent. The yield spread against Germany widened from 0.5 to 1.7 percentage points between January and June, although it has since narrowed to about 1.2 percentage points as Irish gilts, in line with their British counterparts, have outperformed the rest of Europe. Yet the concerns that weighed down other markets, fear of rising inflation and higher interest rates and worries about a flood of new bonds to fund large government budget deficits, in the main part do not apply to Ireland. High unemployment, strong productivity gains, and an incomes policy aimed at restricting wage growth has kept the annual inflation rate at around 3 per cent, with little risk of it moving higher. Cuts in public spending, tax increases and economic growth have helped the government reduce its annual budget deficit to a sustainable 2.3 per cent and make inroads into the stock of national debt, although at 88 per cent of GDP this is still one of the highest in Europe. With about IPounds 50m to IPounds 100m of net gilt sales remaining for the rest of this year out of a total of about IPounds 1.6bn, the Irish gilt market has few supply worries. The only credible concern for the Irish government bond market is that of rising short-term official interest rates. The Irish monetary cycle is closely linked to that of the UK and if the British authorities raise interest rates, the Irish central bank will find it difficult not to follow suit. 'The best we can hope for is that interest rates remain static for the rest of 1994,' said Mr Alan McQuaid, economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. 'Our view is that the UK will raise rates before the end of the year. There may be some lag, but the strong link between the punt and the pound means that Ireland will have to follow.' That long-standing link between the Irish currency and sterling was temporarily broken when Ireland joined the ERM in 1987 and the punt became effectively pegged to the D-Mark. 'Ireland successfully adopted a monetary policy independent of the UK and Irish gilts traded off bunds (German government bonds),' said Mr Alan Sutherland, investment man-ager at Standard Life in Edinburgh. 'With the break-up of the ERM in 1992, however, Ireland reverted to being a UK satellite, with Irish gilts tracking UK gilts.' Ireland's entry into the ERM also changed the make-up of the Irish gilt market, a large proportion of which, about 25 to 30 per cent, has traditionally been held by overseas investors. While the punt tracked the D-Mark, long-term German investors were attracted into the Irish market, holding about 20 to 25 per cent of government bonds. With the demise of the ERM, however, they left, to be replaced largely by UK and US investors, which along with continental European investors each hold about 10 per cent of the Irish gilt market. Ireland received a boost last month when Moody's, the credit rating agency, upgraded the country's foreign debt rating to Aa2. The Irish authorities are also attempting to improve the attractiveness to foreign investors of the Irish government bond market. As well as launching a new 10-year futures contract to be listed on the Irish Futures and Options Exchange, they hope to improve liquidity by an overhaul of government bond trading, replacing the current order-driven system with a market-making system similar to that used in the UK. The IRA ceasefire may also improve sentiment and focus the attention of international investors on Ireland's favourable economic fundamentals. However, any support these developments may provide will only become apparent in the long run. 'They are all positive factors, but in the short run a lot will depend on what happens in other bond markets, in particular in the UK gilt market,' said one bond analyst. 'There's no getting away from the fact that what happens in Ireland will continue to be dictated by what happens in the UK.'</p>

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment is the culmination of an investigation of Microsoft begun by the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') in June 1990 and continued by the Department of Justice beginning in August 1993. From April 1991 onward, the FTC's investigation had as its central focus the licensing practices by which Microsoft distributes its operating system software products, MS&hyph;DOS and Microsoft Windows, to manufacturers of personal computers, a group referred to in the computer industry as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In the course of its investigation, the FTC subpoenaed documents from Microsoft, deposed over a dozen Microsoft officers and employees, and interviewed numerous OEMs, firms that compete against Microsoft in the development and sale of operating system software, and other software industry participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While focussing on Microsoft's licensing practices, the FTC staff also considered whether Microsoft attempted to stifle competition in various computer software markets through other practices. Among other things, they considered whether Microsoft had deliberately created incompatibilities between its Windows operating system software product and its competitors' disk operating system products in order to disadvantage those competing products; whether Microsoft used false preannouncements of new products; and whether Microsoft's developers of applications software products obtained an anticompetitive advantage over their competitors because they received preferential access to information about Microsoft's operating system products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In August of 1993, following reports that the FTC's deliberations had ended with a 2&hyph;2 vote that would result in no enforcement action against Microsoft, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice began its investigation of Microsoft. The Justice Department was provided with complete access to all evidence collected by the FTC in the course of its investigation. After reviewing this evidence, the Department sought additional evidence from Microsoft and other industry participants. The Department carefully examined the use by Microsoft of per-processor and per-system licenses to distribute MS&hyph;DOS and Windows to OEMs. The Department also looked extensively at all other issues that had been considered by the FTC, including alleged false product preannouncements and the relationship between Microsoft's operating system and applications divisions. In addition, the Department's investigation explored new issues which first emerged during the course of its investigation, including Microsoft's use of restrictive non-disclosure agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department contacted dozens of OEMs, and Division staff lawyers visited at least fifteen OEMs in person. In addition, the Division contacted numerous other industry participants, former Microsoft employees, and other companies and individuals knowledgeable about the computer software and hardware industries. In total, the Department conducted over one hundred interviews of individuals involved in the software industry. Twenty-two depositions were conducted pursuant to Civil Investigative Demands (``CIDs'') issued by the Department; six of these oral examinations were of top-ranking officers of Microsoft. In addition to reviewing the material produced to the FTC, the Department reviewed material produced in response to twenty-one additional CIDs that it sent to a number of software companies, including Microsoft. In total, the Department reviewed over one million pages of documents in connection with this investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of this effort, the Department determined that certain of Microsoft's licensing practices and its use of unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure agreements violated the Sherman Act. The Department challenged these practices, and obtain a proposed Consent Decree which adequately addressed the competitive concerns. As to all other areas that were investigated, the Department carefully considered the evidence before it under the prevailing legal standard, and determined that no further action was warranted on the evidence before it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

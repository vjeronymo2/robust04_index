			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCDONALD'S RECYCLING PROGRAM  </P> <P> The editorial accolade for McDonald's promotional campaign to recycle its  enormously polluting products is naive. Despite the overkill of commercialized  sentiment regarding Earth Day, environmental awareness did not hatch yesterday.  </P> <P> It has been warned about for at least 20 years.  </P> <P> Heck, in 1971, our 8th-grade ecology teacher at Palms Junior High inspired our  printing of ecology T-shirts, which we wore on our weekly bike rides to Marina  del Rey to dig aluminum cans out of trash bins for recycling.  </P> <P> McDonald's may not have known about the problems of plastics and landfills  then, but it surely knows that decimating rain forests so cattle can be raised  to produce its (and Burger King's) beef is an unconscionable decimation of my  planet.  </P> <P> McDonald's is able to insulate itself from bad press by stuffing dollars into  leaking dikes.  </P> <P> The good journalists and editors at The Times should be able to see the forest  for the sake of the trees.  </P> <P> MITCH EARLE  </P> <P> Atlanta, Ga.  </P></p>

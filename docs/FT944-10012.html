			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Old mistakes . . . and new - In the late 1990s the rich countries may face serious debt crises Welcome to a new spot for this column, but the issues remain the same. Spending is more pleasant than paying the bills. Promises are cheap, delivery is costly. Financial markets are unpredictable, but if you stand back far enough you can detect a pattern. First, the short view. It has been a week for right swings in the US. George Foreman's fist struck a blow for the over-40s. And, on Tuesday, the right hit back tellingly at President Bill Clinton, reducing the Democratic party to minority status in Congress and condemning Clinton himself to the role of a prisoner in the White House. Briefly, the markets celebrated with a traditional rush of blood to the head. As a gut reaction, markets like conservative administrations. But the enthusiasm soon faded. Two years of political stalemate seem like a far from inspiring prospect. Meanwhile, the US electorate remains as contradictory as ever. On the one hand, there are all the complaints about 'big government' and excessive taxes; on the other, there is little sign of acceptance of a parallel case for serious public spending cuts. Recent Republican history is scarcely impressive for its emphasis on sound finance. The Reagan administration, after all, left the US with a heavy extra burden of debt as the nation embarked on an unprecedented and unbroken series of budget deficits. From under 20 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s, net debt reached 30 per cent by the end of his presidency in 1989 and is now about 40 per cent. While the US government has chronically over-spent and under-taxed, household savings have dwindled from an inadequate 9 per cent of disposable income to a minimal 4 per cent now. In the UK, the political trends are scarcely more encouraging. The usual propaganda has been emerging from Whitehall about public spending cuts, but much of this represents the impact of unexpectedly low inflation. The government has only itself to blame for its painful struggle to balance the books: it won the last election, in 1992, partly by cynically stoking up public spending (mainly by raising pay rates) and partly by promising low taxes. Soon after the poll, a clamp was placed on public sector pay and taxes were raised. But it is a trick that cannot be pulled twice. The financial consequences are clear in the Bank of England's annual exercise of calculating the national debt. In the year to March, this jumped by almost Pounds 60bn to Pounds 307bn. Every new-born babe inherits a Pounds 5,400 share. Fortunately, the burden is by no means unbearably high by past standards, or in comparison with other countries such as Canada, Sweden, Belgium or Italy. Nevertheless, the UK government's net debt in 1993-94 jumped by the equivalent of 5.4 per cent of GDP, making Bill Clinton look like a fastidious housekeeper. The deficit not only showed how far the UK was living beyond its means but also gave a warning of how rapidly a deterioration can occur. Historically, the damage has been done only by wars but, today, the public spending machine of a modern welfare state can run out of control swiftly in peacetime. With luck and good management, though, the further rise in debt in the present financial year will be little more than 3 per cent. This is from a level of 38 per cent of GDP on the basis of net debt. And although the Maastricht-style gross debt formula gives a figure of 48 per cent, the UK is, ironically, still much better placed in relation to the 60 per cent ceiling for monetary union candidates than are most of the other EU member states. But the Maastricht rules will, of course, be bent. In the 1980s, we were troubled by financial crises in poor countries. For years, we used to worry about when and how Mexico would default. Most of such countries have been allowed duly to renege on the bulk of their debts and are now at various stages of a third world economic boom. Capital is flooding in again from the west, although through the securities markets rather than the banks this time. The feature of the late 1990s, however, could well be financial crises in rich countries. Their citizens have voted for expensive social benefits but are not willing to pay higher taxes. They are also keen to import cheap goods from developing countries made by workers whose social security benefits are minimal to non-existent. You don't have to be Sir James Goldsmith to appreciate that there might be a contradiction here. Several economic and social trends pose a long-run challenge to public finance. The private economy is shrinking in relative terms, the public economy is expanding. Essentials such as food, clothing and manufactured goods, which used to loom prominently in personal budgets and in the economy at large, have become much cheaper in relative terms because of vast increases in productivity. But education, health and (for demographic reasons) care of the elderly are becoming much more important and are all highly labour-intensive. Unlike training shoes, they cannot be imported cheaply from the Far East. The particular problem is that in many western countries these services are provided mostly by the state. Either they must be privatised or taxes must rise and rise; but the risk of a transitional crisis of over-indebtedness is obvious. As for the long view, it is that governments learn from past mistakes but manage to discover new ones. In the 1930s, for instance, monetary contraction and a trade war were allowed to cause an economic slump. By the 1970s, too much monetary expansion led to inflation. In the 1990s, the monetary statistics around the developed world look almost perfect - neither soaring nor slumping - but over-spending governments have opened up the global capital market and are raiding the world's dwindling savings. With Congress and Clinton competing to cut US taxes, it looks as though the limits of this strategy may be tested.</p>

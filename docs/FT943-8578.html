			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Regulation of cable charges hits net at TCI Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest cable television operator in the US, saw second-quarter net earnings fall to Dollars 6m from Dollars 26m following tighter regulation of cable charges. Revenues for the quarter inched up by 3.7 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn, restrained by the Federal Communication Commission's curbs on cable operators following the 1992 Cable Act. Mr Brendan Clouston, vice-president for domestic distribution, said the company had seen 'continued fundamental subscriber growth' despite 'the turmoil associated with cable rate regulations'. Evidence of the regulatory squeeze on cable profits comes during a series of deals which is rapidly consolidating the US cable industry as operators chase economies of scale. The number of pay subscriptions at June 30 was 11.3m, up 18 per cent on the year end. But although interest charges showed only a small increase at Dollars 185m from Dollars 182m, after sharp increases in selling and administrative costs and depreciation, pre-tax earnings fell to Dollars 27m from Dollars 43m. Earnings per share fell to 1 cent from 6 cents. The quarter's results cut net earnings for the first six months of 1994 by more than half to Dollars 38m compared with the Dollars 78m achieved in the first half of 1993. Earnings per share for the half-year dropped to 8 cents from 17 cents. Earlier this month the group reached agreement to acquire TeleCable, a smaller, privately-held rival, for Dollars 1.4bn. The deal, which will be equity-financed, will boost the group's share of the market to more than 18 per cent. It will then have just under 11m subscribers out of a total of 60m homes in the US with cable television. It also confirmed this month that it has been in talks with Viacom, the entertainment group, about possible strategic pacts between the two groups' operations.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Proper approach to words - Radio LISTENERS in the London area have drama from the LBC as well as the BBC, and a lot of it comes out of the Woolwich Young Playwrights Awards, sponsored by the Woolwich Building Society. The ten winners in the 1992 competition, out of 335 entries, received their awards on Tuesday at the Purcell Room. The winning plays will be heard first on LBC, then touring on 14 independent local radio stations and 8 BBC local services. Drama may also be found on Radio Clyde, and I have just heard their A Fugitive Day, by Robert Forrest. It is a kind of thriller, but the weapons are nerves, not guns. Emma (Sybil Wintrope) describes her dreams to psychologist James Weaver (Ian Hogg), to see if they fit into his studies on synchronicity. We are not told, but I may tell you now, that the events of the dream correspond with the events of James's naughty night with Louise, who later died. In a well-wrought story, we hear of more unhappy synchronicities until James, re-enacting the Louise night with Emma, is driven out of his mind. Emma has in fact been put up to it by James's wife Anne (Celia Imrie). The adroit direction is by Finlay Welch. Radio 3's Sunday piece was Michael Hastings's Tom and Viv. The marriage of TS Eliot and Vivienne Haig-Wood, its subject, was indeed pathetic, she driven mad by ill-judged drugs, he driven near it by her madness; but in the play, Tom and Viv are just ordinary people in difficulties, no doubt why Hastings masked their superiority under their nicknames. Of its kind, it is not a bad play, but not a very good one; and though Miranda Richardson is a convincing Vivienne, John Duttine is no Eliot, whatever he is described as doing. Sue Wilson's direction allows fine work from the supporting players. I was put off Frank Delaney's Word of Mouth (Radio 4, Mondays) because Radio 3 was doing Words at the same time; but I approve its properly oldfashioned approach. It has dealt with the 'less' and 'fewer' matter, and, in response to listeners' letters, this week brought up 'different to' and so on. They taught me about such things in the fifth form at school, and it distresses me that they do not figure universally in our nationalised education. One good thing about the question of women's ordination is that broadcasters have learnt to pronounce 'schism' (even if they still put the extra 'r' into 'law and order'). Now let us all say 'on the ground that', singular, when there is only one ground. Frankly, though, I doubt if requiring decent English from people who care little about it is one of broadcasting's major duties. Better teach us to be understood in other tongues, as Radio 5 so attractively does in its three Sunday evening programmes on conversational French, Italian and German. No language teacher I; no great linguist either, but these half-hours seem to me worth their weight in gold. I wrote lately about The Locker Room on Radio 4, men telling one another about their interests. I did not, and I do not, find it very interesting. But at least it is better than Knowing Me, Knowing You, also Radio 4 - another programme from the same mould, only commoner and rather dirtier. Are we seeing radio's counter-attack on feminism? A Book at Bedtime (Radio 4) is usually well-chosen. It is currently using short stories, though Fay Weldon's The School Run was long enough to go over two evenings. You could say that it dealt only with everyday concerns of mature women moving to the country - but it is written by Fay Weldon, which would have guaranteed its unusual felicity even if it had not been so likeably read by Julie Christie. There are some more Weldon-Christies to come.</p>

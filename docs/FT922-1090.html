			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Coke's green bottle takes a fall COCA-COLA yesterday launched in Europe its first plastic bottle partly made from recycled material, but quickly ran into criticism from environmental groups. Mr Ralph Cooper, president of the company's European Community Group, said recycling of plastic into new containers would eventually become as common as recycling in the glass, aluminium and steel industries. The bottle, of which 25 per cent is recycled plastic, has been launched into a limited market covering Shoreham-by-Sea, Brighton and Worthing on the south coast of England. Consumers will be able to return bottles via kerbside collection boxes to an experimental materials recovery facility in West Sussex. The bottles will then be sent to a reprocessing plant in the US. The regenerated pure plastic resin will be sent back to existing Coca-Cola bottling plants in Europe to be included in the normal manufacturing process. The two-litre PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles are indistinguishable from other Coca-Cola bottles, apart from a special logo. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said it would have preferred Coca-Cola to have introduced returnable PET bottles as it had in the Netherlands. These bottles, which carry a Fl 1 (30p) deposit, are heavier than the non-refillable PET bottles (110 grammes as opposed to 50 grammes) but can be returned, cleaned and re-used.

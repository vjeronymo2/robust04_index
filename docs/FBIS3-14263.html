Whether we accepted or rejected al-Sadat's initiative at the  time -- and it had its fair share of regional and international  analyses -- its results may be deemed satisfactory if we  consider the current situation and how, although the secret Oslo  talks expedited the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, serious  concessions have been made giving Israel control of the  situation in view of the weakness of the Palestinian position,  which is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad warned of when he  said that the consequences would be devastating for the status  of the Palestinians and for their rights to their land, to a  state, and to repatriation. [passage omitted]    If the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre has removed the last  Israeli fig leaf, it has also exposed the Palestinian weakness  in the eyes of the peacemakers, so much so that U.S. President  Clinton did not hesitate to declare Jerusalem Israel's capital  and to block any UN Security Council resolution condemning the  massacre, a fact which has set back the peace clock because the  criteria have moved in the opposite direction through the  actions of the prime peace sponsor. That outcome has so stunned  and embarrassed the Palestinians that they called for a meeting  of the Cordon States, which was tantamount to an admission of  the bitter reality they had been driven to through uncalculated  peace steps.    Even assuming that the U.S. President was trying to  rearrange  his mental and political state in the face of his financial  scandals, he did utter what he said he would during his election  campaign -- thereby indicating that he was keeping his promise  to Israel and that the Arabs should close this subject in peace  negotiations to come later in the more distant future.</p>

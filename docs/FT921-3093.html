			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Shrimps to global strategies - Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, talks to Robert Thomson Contemplating his promotion to president of Mitsubishi Corporation, Mr Minoru Makihara smiles as he considers the blend of skill and serendipity that has carried him from the shrimp import division of Japan's largest industrial group to the helm. But Mr Makihara, 62, born in Hampstead in the UK and Harvard-educated, has a clear and confident vision of the changes needed at the trading house, including reforms to a management style that has brought Mitsubishi remarkable success. At the same time, the new president wants to make transparent the often opaque connections of Japanese corporate groups, known as keiretsu, and their alleged collusion, which is a matter of serious trade dispute with Washington and European governments. 'The mystique should be erased.' For example, Mr Makihara says foreigners have the wrong idea about the monthly meetings of Mitsubishi company heads, whom they perceive to be creating monopolies and cornering international markets. He would like journalists to attend the Friday Club, as the gathering is called: 'I will probably be outvoted, but by not disclosing what is happening we build up unnecessary mystique.' As president of Mitsubishi Corp, Mr Makihara will share the inner sanctum with 28 other Mitsubishi men, including the presidents of Mitsubishi Bank, the world's seventh largest, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors, Nikon, the camera maker, and Kirin, the brewer. In all, about 190 companies are members of the Mitsubishi family, in relationships characterised by strategic cross-shareholdings and exchanges of executives. In the case of Nikon, for example, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking holds 6.9 per cent of the company's shares, Mitsubishi Bank, 4.7 per cent, two Mitsubishi-linked insurance companies hold 9 per cent, and Mitsubishi Corp has 1.9 per cent. For Mitsubishi Corp - the core company - the two insurance companies, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire and Meiji Mutual Life, hold 13.9 per cent between them, Mitsubishi Trust 5.3 per cent, Mitsubishi Bank 4.9 per cent, and Mitsubishi Heavy 3.1 per cent. US trade negotiators claim that these 'horizontal' keiretsu, by their nature, tend to exclude newcomers, both Japanese and foreigners, by monopolising markets and dealing exclusively with each other. Separately, the US has condemned the 'vertical' keiretsu - families such as that run by Toyota Motor, which has several layers of sub-contractors supplying parts to the parent company or selling its products. 'I sense that in the US, at least in informed circles, and not necessarily the political circles, there is a better understanding that the horizontal relationship is much looser than the vertical one, and that it is not a relationship that tries to exclude outsiders,' explains Mr Makihara, whose unhurried answers are tinged with a gentle irony. 'In this global economy, the closer the partnership you can establish with a company, the better, and it doesn't have to be a Japanese company. The popular word, I suppose, is strategic alliance. Establishing a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Electric will be as useful as establishing an alliance with General Electric, which we are trying to do.' But the US Trade Representative's office argues that sometimes it is not just the shareholdings, but the psychology of keiretsu that makes life difficult for competitors - Mitsubishi people know and prefer to deal with Mitsubishi people, and drink only Kirin beer, not Asahi or Heineken. After a smile, Mr Makihara confesses: 'I prefer Budweiser.' Mr Makihara, who will formally take control in June, often uses the word 'global', and his own global perspective has come from spending 22 of his Mitsubishi years abroad and 14 in Japan. In 1956, he began in 'marine products', which involved overseeing imports of shrimp and tuna, and was transferred in 1959 to London, where he spent eight years. He then returned to Tokyo and marine products. Since 1985, he has lived in Washington and New York, and in October 1990 was appointed chairman of Mitsubishi International. During that period, Mitsubishi Estate bought a 51 per cent stake in the Rockefeller Group, giving it control over prime New York properties and stirring controversy over a perceived Japanese takeover of US cultural icons. He suggests that controversy is 'bound to happen', given the inclinations of 'some of the media'. While Tokyo business leaders have noted that Mr Makihara will be an eloquent spokesman for corporate Japan, his first concern is to strengthen the trading house's operations. The appointment, he made clear, was a business decision, not a political response to US criticism. 'It was probably a sense that my understanding of international affairs would be useful in the global economy, and that we have to do more non-Japan oriented business. For example, US-Brazil or US-Russia business, taking advantage of our networks and expertise. I want to open our channels up - New York to Brazil, instead of Brazil to Tokyo, Tokyo to New York and, eventually, New York to Brazil.' The changing relationships between overseas operations are part of a necessary reform of Mitsubishi management and philosophy, if the company is to ensure its competitiveness in the global market, Mr Makihara says. Delegating authority to offices outside Japan and encouraging Tokyo executives to accept the reduction of their power will not be easy to accomplish. His plans essentially mean an overhaul of the company's entire management structure, as he also intends to replace the promotion path on which merit is often not as important as time-serving. In changing the culture of the group, which traces its origins and three-diamond logo back to 1870, Mr Makihara admits that he will face strong opposition. Traditional nemawashi, or consensus building, will be done to ensure that the changes are neither too fast, nor too disruptive. 'It will take a long time, and probably luck, too. People say that we are like an aircraft carrier, and that it's difficult for us to change direction,' he said. 'Some Mitsubishi people think that the way we have run the business so far has been successful, so it would be dangerous to change dramatically. I agree with the bit about 'dramatically', but I do think change is necessary.' The success or failure of Mitsubishi's foreign ventures has been closely tied to the character of the individual chosen to handle that project, almost regardless of the project's potential, says Mr Makihara, who regards his 'ability to listen' as an important asset. 'We have several subsidiaries and investments in the US. Some are having problems, often stemming from who is running that corporation. To cope with that, we have to adjust our thinking, and not send the person who is scheduled to go, but send in the right person, whether he or she is Japanese, American, British, or whatever.' Mr Makihara, who is in the process of moving back to Tokyo from New York, has enjoyed his time in the US. Apart from detective novels, he likes American theatre and the diversity of US culture. He also has a deep respect for the country's economic prowess and in its 'power to recover and return to the right place', a power not much in evidence in recent years. 'In the auto industry, once restructuring takes place, there are definite comparative advantages for US companies. They have a large market, and have more talent compared to a Japanese manufacturer in Japan with mostly Japanese designers. That comparative advantage will show out in the long run, provided the US makers put in a concerted effort.' He also suggests that US executives have an advantage in being able to escape from work concerns. In New York, he sought the company of a 'non-business' circle of friends and developed an ability to relax, a quality he would like to cultivate at Mitsubishi Corp. 'In Japan, day and night, you are more or less with business associates. We Japanese have been living in an environment which is very labour-intensive. But we have to change because we are moving into a world that is idea-oriented. Just thinking for 12 hours doesn't necessarily generate a better idea than thinking creatively for one hour.'

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Photographic Exhibitions Photographic images are a staple of our culture with a vital role in our visual arts, where they have been the rival, partner and tool of the painted or graphic image since photography became generally accessible as a medium in the mid-nineteenth century. The manner of presentation of photographic images has been much debated, and forms an important current in the complex aesthetic climate. In 'Outer Space', at the Camden Arts Centre until April 26, eight artists from different countries use photography in conjunction with installation and video to explore a wide array of subjects, from the world outside the gallery window - the cars photoscreened on the walls by Ulrich Gorlich seem to have driven straight in from the Finchley Road - to the imaginary history sparked off by the accidental discovery of a menu holder. Cultural identity forms a common theme in the works shown by Willie Doherty, Krystyna Ziach and Susan Trangmar, whose slide projection installation simply but very effectively illustrates the complexity of symbols, from embroidered Indian silks to Ninja Turtle badges, sported by the young pupils of Virginia Primary School, east London. One of the most successful pieces is Hotel Polen by Ania Bien, a Polish artist who lives and works in Amsterdam. A series of large black-and-white photographs, imposingly framed in black, lines the walls of a corridor-like space. The photographs are of photographs, old photographs from the time of the second world war displayed in a menu holder inscribed with the name of the hotel. As we walk and look from image to image, we become absorbed in the narrative they seem to suggest. The people, places and objects shown were once real enough. The connections we begin to fancy between them we construct for ourselves, an excellent demonstration of the imaginative power that such a careful conjuncture of image and presentation can achieve. The notion of the photograph as bearer of secrets, recorder of hidden worlds, is at the heart of the work of Sophie Calle, an example of which can be seen in 'Doubletake', about to finish at the Hayward Gallery (until April 20). She exhibits four works based on photos taken by the security camera of a cash machine. Three of them show male heads, expressions differing a little  -relaxed and whistling, clutching the forehead, distracted and maybe sad - as they perform this everyday task. The fourth set of photos is very different. First we see a woman, concentrating as she looks down at the machine. In the second frame, a man appears. In the third, the same man crouches in the middle distance, intent on something on the pavement. The fourth picture shows the man again, much closer to the camera, his torso naked. Of those who chose to comment on this work, none noted that this sequence showed not a cash transaction but a rape. An everyday urban event, perhaps, but hardly, surely, unworthy of comment. Calle's grim and clever piece makes plain that the notion of 'security' which devices such as hidden cameras are supposed to represent has very little to do with what really constitutes preservation of the self. The mechanical watcher with the indifferent eye might provide useful evidence of a robbery but its programme did not include summoning help in the case of an attack. Also at the Hayward, Andreas Gursky shows very large colour photographs of unremarkable scenes - the interior of a factory, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the view over a bleak motorway landscape. He is not the only artist choosing to present such images: Alex Webb, Reinhard Mucha, Thomas Ruff, Jeff Wall and the partnership of Peter Fischli and David Weiss (represented in 'Doubletake' by an installation) and others have all shown similar photographs, capturing similar scenes with equally apparent artlessness. Only the grand scale of their printing, the exquisiteness of their finish, gives the game away. This is the sort of work that prompts puzzlement and irritation, bringing forth remarks such as: 'I could do that'. Why? Because, by presenting in the privileged space reserved for the viewing of art, images the content of which is so obviously ordinary, the artists strip away the received and cherished notion that art must present itself through certain forms or materials in order to be recognised as art, as something which has been given the right to comment on our lives. Gursky, like his colleagues, will have none of this. Instead, he chooses as his subjects scenes of the everyday, the impersonal workplace, the tedious journey, the drab bleakness of which we normally thole without comment. It is a shock to be confronted with these familiar but unacknowledged environments when we are least expecting them, when we had hoped, perhaps, to have made our escape. Our lives, these works remind us, are lived in such bland interior, traverse these weary spaces. We are the architects of our own banality, and it is our everyday refusal to acknowledge this responsibility which makes these pictures seem so odd, so surreal.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / C&amp;G defends Lloyds bid from legal challenge The Building Societies Act 1986 was not a 'comprehensive code' covering all aspects of transferring the business of a society to another organisation, Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, was told yesterday. The argument opened the High Court legal challenge to Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, which is opposed by the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator. Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, counsel for C&amp;G, highlighted three main points at issue - whether it was lawful for anyone except a society and its successor company to be party to a transfer agreement; whether it was lawful for a payment to be made in consideration of a transfer where it was not expressly permitted by the act; and - assuming a third party was allowed to make such payments - whether the act allowed them to be made to members of less than two years' standing. There were significant differences, he said, between the 'distribution of funds' described and restricted by the legislation, which came from the assets of a society or its successor company, and the payments that would be made if the Lloyds agreed bid succeeded. C&amp;G's assets would not be depleted at all by the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn offer, he said. He argued that the provisions of the 1986 act should not be read as forbidding any payment or involvement in the transfer of the business of a society that it did not explicitly allow. 'It should not be taken as prohibiting everything, however beneficial, that it does not permit,' he told the court. The relevant part of the act did not deal with the conduct of third parties, and their position had not been addressed in the parliamentary debates on the legislation. The commission had interpreted the act 'in a highly restrictive fashion', so any society in the position of C&amp;G was 'likely to end up having a stand-up argument with the commission on certain fundamental questions of law'. Mr Sumption acknowledged that during the passage of the legislation ministers had identified two possible problems they were keen to avoid; that of a society's members taking a decision on the basis of a short-term financial gain, and that of speculative flows of deposits between societies on the basis of rumours about unannounced takeovers. He argued, however, that the primary defence which ministers envisaged against these mischiefs was not the restriction on those to whom payments could be made, but the very high level of support required from voting members of a society for the takeover of its business by any outside organisation. The commission's argument will be put today.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Malaysian plan to set up new airline MALAYSIA says it intends to create an airline to operate on domestic and international routes, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, said the new airline was necessary because Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier, was expanding so fast that it had become 'overstretched'. He said the new airline could be based on Pelangi Air, a small carrier which already operates on some domestic and regional routes. The prime minister said the government would not take up a stake in the proposed new airline. 'We want the private sector to do business. We regulate the business', said Dr Mahathir.</p>

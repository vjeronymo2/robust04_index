			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bifu welcomes jobs assurance from Hongkong Bank BIFU, the banking union, yesterday welcomed indications from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation that most jobs would be safe if it acquired Midland Bank. In a letter to Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, Hongkong Bank said its primary reason for the acquisition was growth rather than cost cutting Bifu opposes the rival bid from Lloyds Bank on the grounds that 30,000 jobs would be shed after the takeover and 1,100 branches would close. The letter adds: 'It is not our intention to supplant Midland management.' It says the two banks do not offer overlapping services and confirms Midland would retain its name and identity. Mr Mills, speaking to the union's annual conference in Bournemouth, said: 'This confirms the continued existence of Midland Bank and gives reassurance to staff.' Many delegates from Lloyds and Midland spoke in support of an emergency motion condemning Lloyds' bid. Delegates expressed fear of victimisation of those who spoke out and said morale among staff in both banks was low. They agreed to oppose a Lloyds takeover by any means possible and said workers in Lloyds and Midland should be balloted if they wanted to take industrial action. Mr Mills has agreed to attend top level meetings at both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds this Thursday.</p>

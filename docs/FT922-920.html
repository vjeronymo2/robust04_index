			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: US auto industry 'may falter in fourth quarter' FIRST Chicago, the leading midwest regional bank, expects over-ambitious third-quarter production schedules in the auto industry to increase the risk of the US economy petering out in the fourth quarter. First Chicago said that the auto industry, a pillar of the US economy, could provide a repeat of America's disappointing 1991 economic performance. Last year, the industry, whose production is concentrated in the midwest, led an incipient recovery then badly faltered in the fourth quarter, prolonging the recession. Despite lacklustre selling rates, the industry's third-quarter production is scheduled to rise by 15.5 per cent from the second quarter to a 11.8m monthly rate, its highest level for the three years. Sales, including imports, last month reached 12.7m. This represented a recovery from their trough of a 11.2m monthly rate at the start of the Gulf war, but was still below the 1990 peak. While the boost in production may add more than 1.5 percentage points to the US real GDP for the next quarter, the bank said, 'the auto industry could place a drag on growth in the fourth quarter'. It noted, however, that automakers might yet trim their production schedules more realistically for the third quarter. On the bright side, the bank said the market share of US-based car manufacturers, including Japanese cars made in the US, had risen to 83 per cent from 78 per cent between May 1991 and May 1992.</p>

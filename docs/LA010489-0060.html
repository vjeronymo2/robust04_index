			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: MODELL WON'T RULE OUT HIRING TONY DUNGY AS HEAD COACH  </P> <P> Owner Art Modell of the Cleveland Browns said Tuesday he would not rule out  hiring former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Tony Dungy as the  Browns' head coach.  </P> <P> Dungy, 33, often mentioned as a candidate to become the National Football  League's first black head coach, quit the Steelers Tuesday after four other  Pittsburgh assistant coaches were fired. Chuck Noll remained as the Steelers'  head coach and was given a lifetime contract by the club.  </P> <P> "We think highly of Tony Dungy," Modell said. "We wouldn't rule him out."  </P> <P> Modell has said previously he feels no pressure to hire a black head coach and  would consider one "with Class A-1 credentials."  </P> <P> "I won't hire a coach because he's black and I won't deny one because he's  black," Modell said.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / US chief executives showing drop in confidence TOP US chief executives are markedly less confident about the economic outlook than they were three months ago, the Conference Board, a business analysis group, said yesterday. The board's index of business confidence fell from 70 to 62 between the second and third quarters. The index is based on a survey of chief executives at leading companies. The drop in business confidence follows a series of disappointing economic reports which culminated last Friday in a surprise announcement of a steep fall in employment in August. The deteriorating sentiment in boardrooms is another blow for President George Bush, because it suggests that the US economy is unlikely to show visible signs of recovery before the presidential and Congressional elections, come November. The fall in the board's index reversed an increase between the first and second quarters. The proportion of respondents saying conditions had improved in recent months dropped to 48 per cent, compared with 80 per cent in the second quarter. Chief executives in insurance, the retail and wholesale trades, and in heavy manufacturing, were among the least upbeat. Top business people, however, are still markedly more confident than at the trough of the 1990-91 recession, when the board's index hit a low of 33. A reading above 50 indicates that optimsts have outnumbered pessimists. The erosion of boardroom sentiment has begun to close a surprising gap between business and household confidence. Consumer confidence has been hovering near record lows for much of the past two years, in part because of worries about job security.</p>

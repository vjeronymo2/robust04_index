			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tengiz Pachkoriya] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi May 20 TASS -- More than 62 per cent of  Georgian residents surveyed recently by the newspaper SVOBODNAYA  GRUZIA (FREE GEORGIA) answered negatively when asked if they  considered the Russian-dominated CIS peace-keeping troops a  reliable guarantee of the safe return of refugees to Abkhazia.    The newspaper's survey, published on Friday, had the goal of  determining Georgian society's opinion of the four-sided  agreement on a ceasefire and withdrawal of forces, which was  signed in Moscow on May 14. Twenty per cent of the inhabitants  of Tbilisi and Georgia answered positively to the above  question, while about 15 per cent did not express an opinion.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Changes to UK banking rules - EC requirement will lead to external audit of banks' interim figures UK BANKS will only be able to include half-year profits in their core capital resources, known as tier one capital, if their interim profits are verified by an external auditor, the Bank of England said yesterday. Under internationally agreed rules, banks have to maintain a ratio of capital resources to assets - mostly loans - of at least 8 per cent. The preservation of capital in this way is intended as a protection for depositors should a bank run into difficulties. Of this 8 per cent ratio, at least 4 per cent must be in the form of tier one capital, principally equity. In the past the Bank of England allowed profits of a UK bank to be included in tier one capital if the bank published an interim statement, whether or not the profits were verified by an auditor. But from January 1 1993, a bank's auditor will have to review interim profits and pass judgment on whether they have been calculated reasonably and in accordance with UK accounting rules, if the bank wants to include the profits in tier one capital. Banks were given this instruction yesterday in a notice sent out by the Bank of England, which said that the requirement stemmed from the provisions of the European Community Directive on Own Funds. However, banks will not be required to carry out a full audit of their six months' figures. The Cadbury Committee's recent report on corporate governance suggested that UK companies audit their interim figures. A bank can include interim profits in tier two capital, which is less precious to banks than tier one, if the interim results have been verified by the bank's internal audit department. In the absence of any such verification, interim profits will be excluded from all calculations of a bank's capital. Most of the big UK banks already ask their auditors to check interim figures. But smaller banks do this less frequently.</p>

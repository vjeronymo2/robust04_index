			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: MIDNIGHT SCREENING OF CULT CLASSIC DRAWS SMATTERING OF  DEPRAVITY BUFFS  </P> <P> And now for something entirely different. Or: it's gross to you but it's Divine  to them.  </P> <P> It is just before midnight Saturday and everything is normal.  </P> <P> At Sea World the Christmas lights burn with a hard-edged glow. In the coffee  shops of Mission Valley, Iranian cabdrivers are talking with young ladies  dressed in their finest MTV garb.  </P> <P> At an undisclosed location the sheriff and his burglar alarm have been put away  for the evening.  </P> <P> I am at the Park Theatre where North Park melts into Hillcrest. I am buying a  $6 ticket to see "Pink Flamingos," the 1972 cult classic of gore, sex and  excrement done in High Camp style.  </P> <P> I am here to see what sort of San Diegans attend a midnight showing of a movie  that gives decadence a bad name.  </P> <P> An engaging pair of avant-garde entrepreneurs named Trevor Watson and Thaddeus  Temple think San Diego is ripe for midnight movies.  </P> <P> They think San Diego has outgrown "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as its only  midnight movie. They make it their business to know about these things.  </P> <P> Watson, 29, a graphic artist from Nottingham, England, and Temple, 26, a writer  and graduate of San Diego State, publish "Revolt in Style," a Pacific  Beach-based magazine devoted to the cutting edge in arts and fashion.  </P> <P> Now they've branched out to midnight movies. The first was "Ziggy Stardust,"  the David Bowie concert film done with a home movie camera.  </P> <P> On Dec. 16, Watson &amp; Temple will present "Blue Velvet," complete with a  party where guests are invited to dress like Frank, the depraved Dennis Hopper  character. In January, it's on to "Sid and Nancy."  </P> <P> The "Pink Flamingos" crowd is bright and chipper, lots of tiny earrings and  hair dyed jet black: Students, film buffs, depravity buffs, the culturally  alienated, people stultified by San Diego's early-to-bed image.  </P> <P> An advertising executive is there alone because his date stood him up. A chief  petty officer from North Island is there because he sometimes sees three and  four movies a night; he rushed over from Chevy Chase's latest.  </P> <P> A real estate appraiser and his girlfriend, an escrow officer, are there  because they like Divine, the 300-pound female impersonator who stars in  "Pink." They dare not share their passion with co-workers.  </P> <P> Rainer Schottlaender, a folk singer and Gene Wilder -- look-alike from East  Germany, warms up the crowd with original work. "No Sex In Space" and "On the  Highway to LA" are favorites.  </P> <P> "I hope people know how disgusting this movie really is," mutters Temple.  </P> <P> Not to worry. Many are "Pink" aficionados.  </P> <P> Yvonne Hunt, 32, a hair stylist: "I look mild-mannered but I like sick stuff."  </P> <P> John Contreras, 18, a Mesa College student: "John Waters (the director) is a  genius. He's so disgusting."  </P> <P> John Smiley, 19, an office worker: "John Waters hates hippies and so do I. His  movies are like scream therapy for me."  </P> <P> When it's over at 2 a.m., the audience fills out cards suggesting other  midnight movies. Among them are Warhol films, silent films from the Soviet  Union, sci-fi classics and Jane Russell's "The Outlaw."  </P> <P> One guy writes that he'd like to see autopsy films. I avoid eye contact as I  hurry to my car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elvis Not Fit to Be King, Students Say  </P> <P> Here and there.  </P> <P> * The student council at UC San Diego rejected a proposed Elvis Week that would  have included Elvis movies and impersonators.  </P> <P> Objections were raised to Presley's supposed racial views.  </P> <P> * Airlines are careful about their in-flight movies. Times reporter Barry  Horstman thinks maybe it's time to regulate passengers' reading material, too.  </P> <P> He admits being nervous on a recent trip from Tampa to San Diego. His seatmate  was reading the novel "Final Flight."  </P> <P> * Social activism 1989.  </P> <P> The planned march Friday night down University Avenue by Neighbors United  Against Hate Crimes will have a twist. Marchers are encouraged to bring their  dogs and other pets.  </P> <P> * If you think Aviara is an overly cute name for a massive land development,  you only know the half of it.  </P> <P> The number for prospective home buyers in the Carlsbad project is 800-TAKEWING.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY PROPOSES WIDER USE OF HOMELESS  SHELTERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday proposed keeping armories and  recreation centers open to the homeless from mid-December through mid-February  regardless of weather conditions. Bradley's proposal comes in the wake of  criticism that the current policy -- which is to open shelters only when  temperatures drop below 40 degrees or when it is raining and below 50 degrees  -- fails to meet the needs of the tens of thousands of homeless in the city.  </P> <P> Under Bradley's plan, the shelters would be kept open between Dec. 16 and Feb.  13, and would also be open from as early as Nov. 1 and as late as March 31  whenever the cold and wet weather criteria were met.  </P> <P> There would be eight central shelters in six areas of the city, including three  downtown and in surrounding neighborhoods, and one each in the South-Central  and Harbor districts as well as the Westside, San Fernando Valley and  Hollywood.  </P></p>

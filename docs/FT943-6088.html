			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Strong golds help S Africa Gold shares were the feature of Johannesburg trading as a rally in the bullion price lifted the golds index by 63, or 2.8 per cent, to 2,297. The good gains in the sector offset a softer showing among industrial shares, helping to take the overall index ahead to 5,845 from a previous close of 5,822. Industrials remained under pressure, the index weakening 39 to 6,539 as investors worried that the latest rise in inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Kloof, the gold miner, gained R1.75 at R69.75, while Gencor edged up 10 cents to R13.50 in anticipation of good year-end results due after the market closed. Vaal Reefs advanced R10 to R428. Barlows, the industrial group, relinquished 50 cents at R31.75, while Iscor, the steel producer, finished 1 cent softer at R4.18 ahead of annual results due today.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer CASH RATES in the sterling money market were slightly softer yesterday, as dealers continued to digest the effects of Monday's concerted intervention by central banks to keep the dollar above its all-time low. Although the US currency's rise helped to keep sterling above its own lows, the pound had a weak bias throughout the day. It closed unchanged on the day but left the markets in a bearish mood. In the morning, short-term rates were boosted by a medium-sized shortage of Pounds 750m from the Bank of England, most of which was removed by dealers in early operations. Traders said there was now no expectation at all of a base rate cut, considering the Bank's decision to deal in Bands 3 and 4 last Friday at the old rates which had preceded their cut of two weeks ago. The speed at which the shortage was brought down reduced the offered rate for one-week money: it closed  1/8 off at 10 per cent. The one-month rate was at 10 1/4 per cent, down from 10 5/16 per cent. Dealers said the Treasury's decision to reduce the gross interest paid on the First Option National Savings Bond also helped to soften rates because it had taken the pressure off building societies to raise their mortgage interest rates. Helped by this, three-month money ended down at 10 5/16 per cent offered from a previous close of 10 3/8 per cent. All of this was offset by sterling's poor performance. The 10 5/16 rate was offered right out to one-year, and the virtually flat yield curve showed how bearish the market has become. The decision on National Savings had a bullish effect on short sterling futures in the morning, with the September contract opening at 89.75, up 5 basis points from its previous close. However, the front-month contract dropped to a day's low of 89.63 before closing only one basis point up at 89.76 on balance. The Bank of England's operations were light, with the Bank dealing at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo). In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 550m in a repo for resale on August 10. In the afternoon, the forecast was revised to Pounds 900m and the Bank bought Pounds 350m in Band 1.</p>

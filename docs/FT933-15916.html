			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers lower Food retail issues were again under pressure as the market continued to reflect on the negative comments which accompanied Friday's results from Asda. Its chief executive declared the years of high growth and fat margins over and predicted several years of tough trading conditions. After Friday's heavy falls, stocks across the sector were again marked back. Argyll lost 5 to 312p, Iceland 6 to 224p, Kwik Save 13 to 721p, Nurdin and Peacock 6 to 216p, J. Sainsbury 12 to 455p and Tesco 5 to 206p. While talk in the sector was again of more downgrades to come, there was also attention focused on the likely strategies of individual stocks. One unlikely candidate from the fallout was Marks and Spencer, with some speculation being heard that the group may consider changing its stance on Sunday trading in order to combat the tough food retail environment. Sunday trading, which M and S has traditionally opposed, is seen as a key future battle area by industry analysts once the law has been settled. M and S slipped 5 to 343p. Turnover in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce rose to 13m and the shares lost 3 1/2 to 141p on a combination of factors. UBS was said to have had a large amount of the company's shares and was believed to have placed around 6m early in the session at 140p, which was below the market price. Sentiment was further dented by a 30-page sell recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. The agency broker said: 'Profits will continue to be under pressure, there will be large cash outflow and there may be a need for a rights issue.' The company also said the level of foreign share ownership had exceeded 29.5 per cent, the limit permitted under its articles of association and it was issuing notices that will force foreign holders above that limit to relinquish the stock. Motor dealer T. Cowie signalled an end to its interest in motor group Henlys, for which it unsuccessfully bid last year, when SG Warburg bought and placed its near 10 per cent stake of 3.78m shares. The stake yielded a healthy sum for Cowie when Warburg, having bought them at 181 1/2 p, placed most of the stock with institutions at 183p. The market appreciated the deal and shares in Henlys firmed 2 to 191p, while Cowie closed unchanged at 248p. The financial areas of the market continued to hold up well in the face of the overall decline yesterday. In the banks, Abbey National was the outstanding performer, with its strong profits flow and solid defensive stance behind some keen support from institutions. Abbey shares moved up 3 to 415p, albeit in rather thin turnover of only 2m shares. The rest of the clearers, however, gave ground as the market became increasingly aware of the growing view that another cut in UK interest rates may be some way off. One banking analyst said the sector looks 'increasingly stretched' and pointed out that the banks sector yield relative is heading back to levels not seen since the 1970s, 'leaving little margin for error in view of the pressure which appears to be resurfacing on banking margins'. Lloyds Bank, due to kick off the banks' interim reporting season at the end of this month, receded 6 to 562p, while Barclays lost 4 to 477p, and NatWest and HSBC 3 apiece to 481p and 654p respectively. A block of 880,000 shares in Lowndes Lambert was placed by Kleinwort Benson Securities with a number of institutions at 397p a share. Ladbroke Group held up well against a rumoured downgrade from Hoare Govett, the shares losing a penny to 188p. The negative sentiment in First Leisure continued and the stock dropped 10 to 335p. Granada benfited from favourable weekend comment over its recent television manoeuvring and gained 3 at 421p. Worries over low food price inflation again kept food manufacturing stocks under a cloud. Associated British Foods declined 6 to 474p, Northern Foods 6 to 269p and Cadbury-Schweppes 5 to 456p. Property group Greycoat announced that it was discussing with Postel Investment Management a possible restructuring of its capital base and debt. Although Greycoat said it would make another statement in the next 48 hours, there was no comment on weekend press reports that it intended to make a Pounds 120m rights issue. The reports suggested that Postel would underwrite the issue at around 12 1/2 p, a substantial discount to yesterday's price. The shares closed three-quarters of a penny down at 19 1/2 p. After their recent strong performance, the regional electricity stocks were subject to profit-taking. Among those hit were East Midlands, which slipped 7 to 468p, Midlands, 9 down at 483p, and Eastern, 6 cheaper at 489p. A move by National Power into the US market, with the Pounds 105m purchase of a Texan gas supplier, failed to prevent it slipping back with the sector. The shares shed 7 to 364p. The market's latest newcomer, Business Post, continued the recent run of sparkling Stock Exchange debuts, with the shares closing at 133p, compared with the 120p placing price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Knin, 12 Feb (TANJUG)--The constituent session of  the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has started  in Knin. The session is chaired by Branko Peric of Knin, the  oldest deputy. However, the session was interrupted and a  recess announced due to serious disagreements over the adoption  of the agenda and the verification of the deputies' mandates.    The assembly became divided into two camps: deputies from  the Serb Democratic Party of Krajina [SDS] and from the Serbian  Radical Party in one, and deputies from all the other parties  and citizens' groups in the other.    This development dashed hopes that the first session of the  new Krajina parliament would be held in a jubilant atmosphere  and that the deputies would transcend party interests--something  the Chairman Peric had called for at the beginning of the  session. Drago Kovacevic, head of the SDS group of deputies,  proposed that the assembly president and deputy presidents be  elected first and that Milan Martic be sworn in as president  afterward, while the agenda proposed the opposite.

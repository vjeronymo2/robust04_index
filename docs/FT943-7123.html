			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Number of GCSE candidates up 2.8 per cent in 1993 The number of candidates taking GCSE exams in England and Wales rose 2.8 per cent last year - slightly more than the rise in the 16-year-old population, John Authers writes. Entries for mathematics rose 9.8 per cent. This contrasted with last week's A-level results which showed a sharp fall in the subject's popularity. Examiners attributed the rise to the national curriculum, which includes mathematics as a core subject. There were 30.9 per cent more entrants for general science. This subject is increasingly replacing individual science subjects at GCSE, all of which dropped at least 16 per cent and are now restricted mostly to independent schools. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said she hoped these figures would 'encourage more pupils to opt for A-level study of science and mathematics'. Business studies proved popular, with the 7.8 per cent rise in applications reflecting a trend also seen this year at A-level. This was balanced by a drop of 16.3 per cent in economics entries. There was a fall of 5.4 per cent in entries for English language, another core subject of the national curriculum. The new A* grade, introduced to recognise outstanding individuals, was achieved by 2.9 per cent of entrants. Pass rates improved slightly. There was a rise of 0.5 percentage points in the proportion passing with at least a grade A; a rise of 0.7 percentage points in the proportions managing at least a grade C; and of 0.3 percentage points in those passing with at least a grade G. Following claims that GCSE standards are falling, the examining boards said they had 'made full use of scripts retained from the GCSE examinations of 1993' to ensure standards required for each grade had remained constant.</p>

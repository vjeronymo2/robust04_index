			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: 'La Duena' resurrected - Max Loppert reviews Gerhard's tantalising, musically rich opera in Madrid ON THE stage of the Teatro La Zarzuela, a delightful theatre built to house the eponymous Spanish operetta genre and currently serving as Madrid's opera house, something unusual is this month under way. At first it does not seem so: the curtain opens on an 18th-century Seville street scene. Out of the orchestra pit leap flashing Spanish rhythms and colours, reminiscent of innumerable favourite zarzuela numbers. But then beneath them one starts to appreciate a distinctly un-zarzuela-like harmonic idiom, full of keen 20th-century asperities. A young man dressed like Rossini's Almaviva picks up a guitar and, after flurries of comic delay, begins to serenade at a window - but it is in English that he sings, an 18th-century English graced with lines like 'Unveil those beauteous eyes'. Spanish surtitles pour out at speed on the proscenium-arch screen. What is happening is, in fact, a piece of cultural history in the making. For this is the stage premiere of La Duena, a three-act comic opera closely based on Sheridan's The Duenna. It is taking place four decades after the work was first heard, in a 1949 BBC radio performance; and, as it is by Roberto Gerhard, it represents - as did Gerhard himself - a remarkable, unrepeatable Anglo-Iberian fusion. Gerhard, born in Catalonia in 1896, came to England in 1939 as a post-Civil War exile, and died here in in 1970, having become in his final years one of the most celebrated figures of the British modern-music scene. In spite of currently undergoing a patch of neglect, the scores of his extraordinary late flowering as a modernist - the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, the chamber pieces Gemini, Libra and Leo - remain absolutely fresh, their adventures in form guided by a dazzlingly personal command of means. But though Gerhard came to consider himself an English composer, he was more than that: a figure who from his youth concerned himself with both his native musical inheritance and that of all Europe. The fact that he could seek to study with the most significant figure in the 20th-century Spanish renewal, Pedrell, and then with Schoenberg in Vienna and Berlin, suggests the peculiar breadth of his cultural preoccupations. It is in this light that his single opera (Gerhard always referred to it as La Duena, and kept the name-forms of Sheridan's characters in Spanish) must be examined. It is a comic opera that searches out its place in several distinct traditions: 18th-century comedy of manners, zarzuela, opera buffa, the Spanish folk-music inheritance, the Second Viennese School musical dialectic. Only a mind creatively untrammelled could contemplate such a marriage of differences. In the post-war world it guaranteed Gerhard the worst of all possible receptions: in cosy, closed-minded Britain his Schoenberg connections were a terrible disadvantage, while in Germany (where at a 1951 modern-music festival it was given in concert) the 'accessible', popular side of the music was viewed with puritan horror. Several Duena stagings were planned and then dropped; in 1971 it was given in shortened form on Radio 3. This Madrid production is in significant part the achievement of the scholar David Drew, a lifelong Gerhard enthusiast, who has made this amplified Duena edition and revision (the details of which, and much else about Gerhard, can be learnt in a fascinating two-part article in the December and January issues of Opera). At this 'post-modernist' stage in European operatic history the work's multifaceted nature should cause no parti pris disapproval: it was certainly time for a Duena re-examination, and touching that Gerhard's native land should choose to undertake it. One went to Madrid hoping for a triumphant reversal of fortune. But the situation seems to me more complicated. Many of the opera's parts - solos, concerted numbers, finales - are quite marvellously brilliant and beautiful, bounding with Falla-like rhythmic energy and clarity of sound, vocally and orchestrally scintillating. As a comic-opera whole it proves misshapen, fitfully paced, intermittently overscored, strangely numb and unidiomatic in conversational passages, and - pace Drew - simply too long. The Sheridan play, though Gerhard lit upon it with fervent appetite, seems now a liability. Comedy based on physical ugliness is both Politically Incorrect and, worse, boring; though the hints of Sheridan's anti-Semitism were sedulously removed, there remains a queasy undertone to the relationship of the disguised Duenna and the Portuguese Jew Isaac Mendoza. On Madrid evidence I find La Duena a tantalising, musically rich first-opera failure, of a kind that ought to have had companies lavishing on Gerhard subsequent opportunities to perfect his undoubted gift for the medium. That the opposite happened affords in itself a painful reminder of the wider 20th-century musical crisis. All this said, I'd now like to see and hear the work in Britain - in Madrid it was quite mad not to play it in translation - in a production less archly busy (full of dancing streetfolk) than Jose Carlos Plaza's, and in a theatre where the music might sound less constantly loud. It was intelligently cast with notable British singing-actors - David Rendall, Anthony Michaels-Moore, Richard Van Allan, Anne Mason and Sharon Cooper (a not quite 'finished', hugely promising young soprano lead) among them - and with two wonderfully tactful leading performers in Felicity Palmer (Duenna) and the Spanish baritone Enrique Baquerizo (who sings in excellent English) as Don Isaac. The admirable conductor, plainly a Gerhard habitue, is Antoni Ros Marba, the theatre's music director. Radio 3 transmits a live relay from Madrid this Thursday; the production goes to the Barcelona Liceu next month.</p>

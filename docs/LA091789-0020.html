			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S VIEW OF KFAC  </P> <P> The word that stands out in Bernheimer's article is embarrassment, which he  uses to describe the fact that "there will be no commercial (classical-music)  radio station in Los Angeles." Let's face it, L.A. is not a sophisticated city.  It's a beach town with all the name entails. Angelenos' idea of culture is  eating designer pizza and getting tickets for "Les Miz" or "Phantom."  </P> <P> YOLANDA KRELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

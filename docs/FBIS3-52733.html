			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "There Can Be No Peace Unless All  Golan Territory is Restored," the newspaper TISHRIN comments on  the constant Israeli provocations and attempts to scuttle the  peace process and forestall the expected positive outcome of the  al-Asad-Clinton summit.    TISHRIN says: It is clear that all Israeli provocations are  part of a carefully-studied plan to cast doubts on the  usefulness of the Syrian-U.S. summit, which the entire world  views as important and extremely vital for activating the peace  process and ending the current stalemate. Regional developments  have shown the falsehood of Israeli arguments that the Syrian  and Lebanese tracks of negotiations are unimportant. These  arguments have proven to be baseless. This is because events  have shown that Syria's role is crucial, and that it is  impossible to achieve peace in the Middle East without Syria's  involvement or participation. It was no coincidence that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced in occupied  Jerusalem in the aftermath of talks he held with Rabin and Peres  during his recent tour of the region that the United States is  interested in achieving a comprehensive and durable peace in the  Middle East, and that Syria demonstrated genuine and serious  cooperation with the efforts to achieve peace. What nurtured  the Americans' convictions regarding the need to achieve  comprehensive and just peace were the deadlock reached by the  Gaza-Jericho accord, as well as the deterioration of the overall  situation in all occupied territories.    TISHRIN affirms that Israel is preparing for war, rather  than  peace. It is not unlikely that Israel will mobilize the Zionist  lobby in the United States and the West to bring pressure to  bear on the U.S. Administration to make it back down on the  objective of achieving just and comprehensive peace. Likewise,  it is not unlikely that Israel will exacerbate the situation in  southern Lebanon and the region. For Israel believes that peace  must result in the endorsement of its expansionist plans and  settlement ambitions. It is looking forward to swallowing up  the Golan, Jerusalem, and most occupied territories, the paper  argues.    The paper believes that the impudence of Zionist settlers  has  reached the limit when they said that President Clinton does not  have the right to discuss the issue of the occupied Golan. This  is a serious development, particularly since the Golan issue  has, since 1967, continued to be debated by the world community,  not to mention that this community has passed several  resolutions on it, all of which called for Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan.    The paper believes that Israel and Jewish settlers are  robbing the world community of its prerogatives and  responsibilities. By so doing, the settlers are posing a  serious threat to the entire world community.    Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian  territory, and will remain so. No single Zionist settler will  experience comfort or peace as long as the Golan is occupied.  Moreover, regional peace is contingent, first and foremost, upon  a complete Israeli withdrawal. Indeed, there can be no peace  unless this withdrawal takes place.    Under the headline "The Credible Syrian Positions," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: The  regional developments that have been unfolding since the signing  of the Oslo agreement have proven beyond any shadow of doubt  that any unfair agreement is doomed to failure. Moreover, any  agreement that is not comprehensive is unviable. For, as the  regional conflict is an indivisible whole, and as the occupation  of the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied Arab  territories is an indivisible whole, the solution itself is an  indivisible whole. The conclusion of separate deals, as well as  claims that there is a need to delay progress on some tracks to  allow for digesting an agreement on a single track are useless.  Syria has warned against the consequences of accepting separate  deals, regardless of the television stunts and the high-falutin  words and terms used to promote them. Israel's policy is to  promote separate deals to foment inter-Arab divisions, hold on  to the occupied territories, or, at least, part of them,  blackmail Arab sides one at a time, and undermine the  foundations of just and comprehensive peace, which is not in the  interest of Israel's aggressive plans.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the  Syrian position is the mainstay of the full-blown Arab position  in terms of preparation and coordination. This position is  necessary for proceeding with the peace process to achieve a  comprehensive and just solution, which is firmly advocated by  Syria. Syria will not allow Israel to torpedo the components of  just and comprehensive peace, particularly since the entire  world in general, and the United States in particular are well  aware that the achievement of peace is contingent upon a  complete Israeli withdrawal. Likewise, they are well aware that  Syria cannot bargain over this principle.    Under the headline "Various Means To Achieve The Same End,"  the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli rulers' current  positions have shown that their daily jargon is divorced from  any frank or clear handling of the facts and terms which could  result in the achievement of true peace in the region. These  rulers have persisted with their acts and practices, which are  bound to torpedo the peace process, although the entire world  community has reached the conclusion that separate and partial  agreements cannot produce peace, nor even help achieve security  and stability, and defuse conflicts and disputes in the Middle  East.    The paper adds: The Israeli rulers have continued to  circumvent substantive issues in the peace process to turn this  process into empty slogans, which they are using on the  international scene to obtain huge funds under the guise of  developing the Palestinian territories and launching what they  call a new Middle East, in which Israel would have the upper  hand. By so doing, Israel seeks to be in a position to control  the region's resources and destiny, and determine the fate of  its future generations.    The paper goes on to say: We in Syria have always been  sincere in our efforts to achieve just and comprehensive peace.  Similarly, we have been sincere in our respect for  international legitimacy and its resolutions. Given this  sincerity, we are extremely concerned about the foundations of  the peace process. We also want to restore our territories and  rights. The Israeli rulers, as well as the U.S. Administration,  which launched the peace initiative, are well aware that it is  impossible to achieve peace in this region as long as Israel  continues to reject the principle of trading land for peace, and  to oppose the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will always  remain willing to cooperate with any international endeavor to  achieve just, comprehensive, and honorable peace in the region.  But, under no circumstances will it accept the version of peace  that would result in abandoning rights, territories, and dignity.</p>

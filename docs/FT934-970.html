			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Abandoned pits pour out a toxic threat: After British Coal, it is unclear who will be responsible for preventing minewater pollution The National Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, has warned the government that it has inadequate powers to deal with pollution caused by water from abandoned mines. Such water is a growing threat as British Coal rapidly contracts. The rundown of deep mining and British Coal's forthcoming privatisation has thrown into doubt the future of its costly minewater pumping operations, currently paid for by the corporation to protect working pits. Without constant pumping, minewater in coalfield areas can rise into disused workings and become contaminated with metals before leaching out into rivers, killing wildlife and contaminating drinking water. In County Durham, now without a single operating deep mine, studies have suggested that discharges of polluted minewater into the River Wear would begin three months after British Coal's Pounds 6m-a-year County Durham pumping programme ceased. The NRA, which has mounted no prosecutions over pollution by water from abandoned mines since its formation in 1989, says the law hampers it from taking action in such cases. It says the problem is the 1991 Water Resources Act which states that 'permitting' water from an abandoned mine to enter controlled waters is not an offence, although 'causing' it to do so is. Also, under the act the NRA is not allowed to recoup the cost of clearing up after such incidents. NRA chief scientist Mr Jan Pentreath says the law in this area is deficient and must be altered. 'The NRA has said this publicly again and again.' The NRA's plea for stronger powers comes as MPs, environmentalists and industry - including the water industry - together with rural interests, including the National Farmers' Union, are increasingly expressing concern about potential minewater pollution. Nobody knows precisely how great the threat is. British Coal's present pumping regime has, until now, helped to prevent pollution from long-abandoned workings. But a 1991 incident in which 80m gallons of water contaminated with toxic metals spewed out of the Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall, turning the River Carnon red and endangering marine life, illustrated minewater's hidden power. In its coal privatisation bill, the government proposes that a new public-sector body, the Coal Authority, take over British Coal's responsibilities for the physical legacy of historical mining not transferred to the private sector. The 160-page bill sets out a framework for licensing of mining, safety, pensions, concessionary fuel, coal-bed methane exploitation and subsidence, but does not mention minewater pollution or pumping. 'This kind of detail is worked out during the passage of the bill,' the Department of Trade and Industry said. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, last week said the NRA's complaint that the law is deficient was a Department of the Environment matter. County Durham Labour MPs and councillors have met Mr Eggar to express disquiet. Conservative MPs in mining areas, such as Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, Nottinghamshire, are also worried. 'British Coal is apparently overlooking the likelihood of their underground water, which may be contaminated with metals, leaching into the rest of the water and consequently the water supply,' he says. With other MPs he has lobbied Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. 'Clearly the state has a responsibility,' says Mr Alexander. Mr Howard Gill, regional operations adviser at Northumbrian Water's sewage and water arm, says: 'These discharges are a direct result of the closure of an industry; the costs should be recognised as part of that closure programme. They shouldn't fall on water consumers in a few years' time.' There were suspicions, he adds, that the 1991 act was phrased so as not to saddle companies with long-term minewater pollution responsibilities. There is evidence of the deterrent effect of pumping costs - RJB Mining dropped its bid for Easington pit in County Durham for this reason. Mr Gill says the water industry fears that hard-won improvements in river quality may be lost. North East Water has warned that if pumping ceases, possible minewater pollution in the River Wear could force it to spend Pounds 25m on new treatment facilities. Minewater pumping is also sometimes useful to water companies in maintaining environmental standards. The Clean Rivers Trust, a Nottinghamshire-based environmental group committed to working with industry, says that without regular inflows of pumped minewater some stretches of rivers in its area would consist mainly of treated sewage. Mr Harvey Wood, trust co-ordinator, says minewater has implications nationally for many industries, including agriculture, tourism and brewing. 'I don't think it's being taken seriously at the moment,' he says. Minewater, he adds, is unpredictable. 'It has a very nasty habit of popping up where it's least expected.' One man who knows this to his cost is farmer Mr Peter Raine. In 1979 a concrete plug on a disused pit shaft near his farm at St Helen Auckland, an area of County Durham once extensively mined, was blown off by the pressure of underground water. Since then his field drainage ditches have begun overflowing with water, turning 10 acres into bogland. It is land where once he grew winter barley, grazed cattle and made hay. Now it squelches, sodden and useless, over the top of his gumboots. Mr Raine is certain the water has risen through abandoned mineworkings. His worries were heightened by the death of five cattle from poisoning several years ago. Fearing contamination, he has zoned off a further 10 acres of grazing land. Yet, in spite of the anxiety and lost income, he has found no means of redress and no way of stopping the flow of water. 'How do I prove it's coming from a pit shaft?' he asks. 'And who's going to take responsibility for the problem, especially after British Coal's privatisation?'</p>

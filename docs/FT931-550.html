			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Balladur must try to please three masters MR Edouard Balladur, who last night was chosen as France's new prime minister, faces a delicate balancing act. His first job will be to choose a ministerial team that gives fair division of spoils between his own Gaullist RPR, the larger member of the ruling coalition, and the centre-right UDF. Here he will have to satisfy both party chiefs as well as the Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand. He interfered closely with the selection of ministers in the previous right-wing government, and will probably do so again. That done, much of Mr Balladur's time will be devoted to keeping discipline in the RPR, whose internal splits on the European Community and monetary union are likely to open again now that the election is over. President Mitterrand chose Mr Balladur, 63, partly for his qualifications as the man who drew up the policy of delicate cohabitation followed by the 1986-1988 right-wing government, in which he was finance minister. The fact that recent polls made him the most popular prime ministerial candidate by a long way, also counts. For the right, he is a suitable candidate because he has no presidential ambitions, so leaving that field clear for the RPR's leader Mr Jacques Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF. Mr Mitterrand found him acceptable because of Mr Balladur's natural good manners, because he does not want to lever Mr Mitterrand out of the Elysee - unlike Mr Chirac  -and because he is pro-European, a key criterion laid down by Mr Mitterrand. Does Mr Balladur have the qualities needed to steer this tricky course? He is a moderate, pragmatic Gaullist, in line with his mentor, former president Georges Pompidou, and so will avoid dogmatic battles. Another strong point is the authority he gains as the mastermind of the last right-wing government's privatisation programme, one of its few successes. Mr Balladur promises another round of state sell offs.</p>

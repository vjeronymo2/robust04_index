			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN REFORM WILL GIVE U.S. INVESTORS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE  </P> <P> Every few months, Russell W. Bogda likes to escape Los Angeles and relax in his  vacation home 100 miles south of the border.  </P> <P> But the Mexican government has welcomed the Los Angeles attorney only up to a  point. Like all non-Mexicans, he was not allowed to own his property near the  coast; he could control it for only 30 years.  </P> <P> That changed dramatically last week, however, when Mexico announced a sweeping  relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment. As a result, some California  investors foresee a sharply rising U.S. stake in Mexican hotels, resort  complexes, villas, condominiums and other tourist properties.  </P> <P> "Obviously, you want to look at the fine print, but I think it will make more  people interested and willing to consider investments in Mexico," Bogda said of  the new rules. "That's why I was excited."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 100% Foreign Ownership  </P> <P> Under the far-reaching changes, Americans who seek resort homes in Mexico no  longer will have to relinquish them after 30 years. A Mexican bank will  continue to have ownership through a trust -- but at the end of 30 years, the  foreigner's control will be extended for another 30 years.  </P> <P> In addition, Mexico is for the first time allowing 100% foreign ownership of  Mexican corporations in tourism and certain other industries. Previously,  foreigners were restricted to owning less than half of Mexican enterprise.  </P> <P> "If I can go down and build a four-unit condo on the beach and deal with a  60-year trust and not have to have a Mexican partner, I'll be more inclined to  do it. I think it's a positive sign," Bogda added.  </P> <P> Mexico's incentive is no secret: The rule changes are designed to ease its  foreign debt burden, estimated at $108 billion. Tourism is considered an  especially effective tool to combat debt because it draws hard currency.  </P> <P> Yet Mexico's tourism industry has been far smaller than that of nations in  Western Europe, for example, "even though it (Mexico) has a giant country like  the United States and also Canada in close proximity," said David G. Ellsworth,  a Los Angeles attorney whose clients include foreign developers in Mexico and  Mexico's tourist development and finance agency.  </P> <P> Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the nation's secretary of tourism, has reportedly said  that Mexico seeks to double its income from tourism between 1988 and 1994 to $5  billion, and expects 50,000 new hotel rooms to be built in that time.  </P> <P> Now some believe the changing rules may help usher in some of the development  that the debt-ridden nation seeks.  </P> <P> "This obviously makes a very, very big difference," said Don Gandy, a San Diego  consultant who has worked with several developments proposed for Mexico. "More  than anything, it indicates a change in philosophy."  </P> <P> Under the old philosophy, for example, foreign investors had trouble gaining  long-term financing for projects, in part because they were limited to minority  ownership.  </P> <P> "Now a U.S. or Japanese developer can go down to Mexico and set up their own  company without having to find a Mexican partner or get approval from a  national commission -- and own 100% of the company," said Ellsworth.  </P> <P> He continued: "The lender's going to look at it (Mexican development) much more  favorably."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Climate Was Improving  </P> <P> Moreover, the 30-year restriction on control applied not just to choice  oceanfront property but to a sprawling band of territory known as the  "forbidden zone," stretching 32 miles inland from the coastline and 64 miles  from Mexico's borders.  </P> <P> The 30-year limit "has been a hindrance on developers going into Mexico to do  projects and individuals going into Mexico to buy projects," Ellsworth said.  </P> <P> Even before the announcement, the foreign investment climate in Mexico seemed  to be improving in light of Mexican officials' friendlier attitude. For  instance, the stage is being set for rapid growth in Northern Baja, between  Tijuana and Ensenada.  </P> <P> "If you drive up and down the coast, you can see dirt being moved on eight to  10 smaller projects," said Gandy, adding that "Within the last year,  practically every piece of vacant usable land on the water has been put in  position for development."  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Securities settlement After the expensive blunder that was Taurus, London's new paperless settlement system was always likely to involve compromise in the interests of a quick fix. But the Bank of England is anxious to give institutions the opportunity to remain on company share registers even though the shares are held in nominee accounts under its new Crest system. Such designation might help protect pension funds against unauthorised selling or borrowing against their assets. The snag is that it adds enormously to Crest's complexity, since many large bargains would have to be broken down into their component parts. Support for designation is understandable in the wake of the Maxwell affair. The Goode committee report on pension fund law reform, delivered to government in September, said it should be encouraged wherever practical. Yet Goode stopped short of recommending that designation should be made compulsory, on the grounds that the only real protection against loss of pension fund assets is better supervision of administrators and fund managers. Designation is no protection against a fund manager determined to act beyond its powers. If designation can be incorporated within Crest without jeopardising the project, though, the Bank is right to stick to its guns. Fund managers freely admit that most of their pension fund clients are likely to opt for designation if it is available within Crest. With the security of pension funds at stake, the customer is surely right.</p>

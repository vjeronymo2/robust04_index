			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "Outside </F> International Legitimacy"]    [Text] The U.S. F-15 military aircraft's downing of two UN  helicopters over the no-fly zone in north Iraq is raising many  questions about the legality of the measures the United States  is taking in monitoring the situation there and the congruity  with the UN resolutions that specified the nature of the  international measures imposed on Iraq as a result of its  aggression against Kuwait.    It is well known that a Western agreement imposing the  no-fly  zone over Iraq was reached among the United States, Britain, and  France outside the framework of the United Nations and the  Security Council resolutions to protect the Kurds in north Iraq  from the atrocities and persecution of Saddam Husayn's regime.  Despite the fact that the Shiites in south Iraq are exposed to  the same atrocities and persecution, they have not enjoyed the  same degree of protection as the Kurds.    It seems illogical that the West should volunteer to protect  the Kurds in Iraq while it ignores the raging battles between  the Turkish Army and the Kurds in the Turkish-Iraqi border area.  The Turkish forces have for several months been bombarding and  burning Kurdish villages on a large scale, and even chasing them  inside Iraqi territory. This indicates that the no-fly zone in  north Iraq and the U.S. military aircraft sorties in its  airspace are not meant to protect the Kurds as much as to put  the Iraqi people under a stiffer international blockade than the  Security Council resolutions stipulate in a way that threatens  to separate the Kurdish areas in the north from the Iraqi state.  This would definitely lead to partition or to creating new  political situation allowing the establishment of an independent  state for the Kurds.    The U.S. State Department spokesman's statement blaming Iraq  for causing the downing of the two helicopters and the death of  more than 20 senior commanders and UN figures is ridiculous. It  is the U.S. military aircraft that mistook the UN helicopters.  When the use of double standards becomes a well-established  method in international dealings, the stance of the United  States and NATO on the Serb aggression against Bosnia and the  continuing bombardment of Gorazde and of the UN forces seem  extremely strange. The Serb forces' defiance of the UN  resolutions and NATO ultimatums are being met with a great deal  of patience, pampering, and caution. Air strikes are calculated  while contacts, negotiations, and attempts to reach a peaceful  solution go on. Moreover, numerous acts of aggression against  safe zones in Bosnia are ignored. This totally contradicts what  is happening in Iraq. Why? This is the question.</p>

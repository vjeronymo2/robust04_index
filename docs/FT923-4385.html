			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / International Company News: GEC shows slight rise in current year THE ANNUAL meeting of GEC was told that sales in the current year were marginally down but profits were slightly higher compared with a year ago. Lord Prior, chairman, said the principal businesses - electronics systems, power systems and telecommunications - were maintaining high order books and benefiting from the restructuring measures taken earlier. However, in some other trading sectors 'we are not progressing as we would wish; market conditions are not improving, and further action will be taken.' The policy of requiring profits to show in cash had led to increases in bank balances with consequent higher interest income. Last week Yarrow Shipbuilders, a subsidiary, announced that it was to cut 510 jobs because of a gap in its order book. Last year, GEC shed about 5,000 staff in a restructuring of its defence activities.</p>

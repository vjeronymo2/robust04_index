			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Abbey National promotes Pople to run its Scottish life subsidiary Andrew Pople, 36, an ex-Bank of England man who joined Abbey National five years ago, has taken over as chief executive of Scottish Mutual Assurance, its recently-acquired life insurance business. Abbey National bought Scottish Mutual in January 1992 for Pounds 287m with the objective of using its skills to launch Abbey National Life in February 1993. Scottish Mutual chief executive Douglas Patrick, 51, was put on the Abbey National board and given the task of heading the group's life assurance division which contributed Pounds 61m of Abbey National's Pounds 704m pre-tax profits last year. However, Abbey's rapid expansion into the life assurance industry has been threatened by the sudden resignation of Patrick, for family reasons. Pople's knowledge of the life assurance industry is limited to what he picked up when he was helping plan the establishment of Abbey National's life assurance strategy, but his appointment marks him out as one of Abbey National's young high-fliers. He worked in the Bank of England's banking supervision section for three years before getting his MBA from the City University Business School. In 1988 he joined Abbey as strategic planning manager, Life Assurance and in 1992 switched into a line position managing 800 staff and 62 branches in Abbey's central division. Meanwhile, Abbey has sought to plug the rest of the gap left by Patrick's resignation by giving John Fry, 58, Abbey's group services director, main board responsibility for the group's life and general insurance business.</p>

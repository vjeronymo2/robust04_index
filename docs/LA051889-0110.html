			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested five men and recovered millions of dollars  worth of art stolen earlier this month, including works by Salvador Dali and  Henri Matisse, a Brazilian police officer said. Alvaro Luis Souza, who  commanded a raid leading to the arrests, said that police, responding to a  phone tip, staked out an apartment in Rio's Botafogo neighborhood and  apprehended a man as he was leaving. The stolen goods were discovered,  undamaged, inside the apartment. Souza said four other men were arrested hours  later. Police still are searching for three more men they believe were involved  in the May 3 robbery of the Chacara do Ceu Museum, Souza added. Police  recovered all the stolen art except two Chinese ceramic sculptures from the 7th  Century and a collection of silverware.  </P></p>

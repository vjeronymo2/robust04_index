			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Swaps markets losses total 0.115% of deals THE credit quality of coun-terparties in swap transactions remains high, according to the International Swap Dealers Association, which published a study yesterday showing that cumulative losses among a large proportion of dealers in the swaps market totalled just Dollars 358m, 0.115 per cent of the notional principal amount of outstanding contracts. The survey, carried out by Arthur Anderson, was conducted among ISDA members, who account for about 70 per cent of the Dollars 4,300bn swaps market. 'More than 90 per cent of the swap transactions in the port folios surveyed were with investment grade counterparties. This confirms the traditional high credit quality of swap counterparties,' said Mr Akira Watanabe of Mitsubishi Bank, vice-chairman of ISDA. UK local authorities were the source of almost 50 per cent of the Dollars 358m of net losses. Other categories of counterparties representing net losses were companies (26 per cent), non-dealer financial institutions (17 per cent), and US savings and loans institutions (6 per cent). The report may help the association's fight in the US against attempts to move over-the-counter swaps and options business on to regulated exchanges, and bolster ISDA's argument against calls for greater regulatory control of over-the-counter derivatives business. Some bank regulators have expressed concern that over-the-counter derivatives business is increasing the level of risk undertaken by banks.</p>

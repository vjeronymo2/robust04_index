			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL RACE IS AS PLANNED: MAD DASH;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: WITH THREE WEEKS TO GO, ONLY FIVE TEAMS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE  PLAYOFFS.  </P> <P> The NFL is getting just what it wanted when it expanded the playoff system to  12 teams. With three weeks to go:  </P> <P> * Only five teams have been officially eliminated -- Atlanta, New England, the  New York Jets, Cleveland and Denver, the latter two the principals in last  season's AFC title game.  </P> <P> * Five teams have clinched berths -- San Francisco, Chicago, the New York  Giants, Buffalo and Miami. The first three are division winners, the others at  least wild cards.  </P> <P> * Four playoff teams will come from one division -- the Giants, Eagles,  Redskins and Cowboys from the NFC East. Dallas, 1-15 last season, got back in  the running on Sunday by being idle while Green Bay, Minnesota, Philadelphia  and the Rams all lost.  </P> <P> * A team may make the playoffs at .500 or worse, just like in those prototypes  of playoff mediocrity, the NHL and NBA.  </P> <P> * Five teams are 7-6 and five more are 6-7. All can make or miss the playoffs.  </P> <P> AFC -- The East comes down to the Buffalo-Miami game in two weeks. If Miami  (10-3) wins, it holds the tiebreaker over the Bills (11-2) because of a 30-7  victory over Buffalo earlier in the season.  </P> <P> The biggest muddle is in the Central, where Cincinnati, Houston and Pittsburgh  are tied at 7-6.  </P> <P> Cincinnati has the best tiebreaker position with a 3-1 division record and two  wins over the Steelers.  </P> <P> But the Oilers have three division games left -- Cleveland and Houston at home,  Cincinnati away and could win by sweeping.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh, which is at Houston and New Orleans and home to Cleveland, can  probably get a wild card by winning two of three.  </P> <P> Kansas City (9-4) leads the West over the Raiders (8-4 going into tonight's  game in Detroit). The Chiefs hold the tiebreaker with their two wins over Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> NFC -- Things are smooth at the top, where the Giants (East), Bears (Central)  and 49ers (West) have clinched division titles.  </P> <P> Barring upsets, San Francisco (12-1) will have the home-field advantage  throughout the playoffs; New York (11-2) will get a week off, then play at home  and Chicago (10-3) will have to play a wild-card game, the consequence of its  10-9 loss in Washington Sunday. The Giants also hold a tiebreaker advantage.  </P> <P> Washington (8-5) is in good shape for a wild card and Philadelphia (7-6) should  get the second, although they're inconsistent enough to blow it.  </P> <P> Then come Green Bay, Minnesota, Dallas and New Orleans, all at 6-7. Green Bay  could confuse things more with an upset of the Eagles in Philadelphia on  Sunday.  </P> <P> The Rams (5-8) are barely alive.  </P></p>

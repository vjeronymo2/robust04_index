			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Trade Quick Balance -- </F> Exports Decreased, Imports Increased"]    [Text] According to preliminary figures on foreign trade  product turnover, imports amounted to 1,162.5 billion forints at  current prices in 1993, some 30 percent more than the year  before. At the same time, exports amounted to 820 billion  forints, 3 percent less than in 1992. The balance of trade  closed with a deficit of 342.5 billion forints or $3.6 billion.  All this has been reported to MTI by the Central Statistical  Office.    The data also show that items that do not attract payment  obligations represented a greater than usual proportion in the  turnover. The delivery of fighter aircraft in exchange for the  former Soviet debt, and natural gas imports to offset the  investment at Yamburg belonged to this group. Deliveries of  goods in connection with products manufactured under commission  agreements, repairs, and leasing, and material contributions to  businesses also amounted to a significant amount. Discounting  these, the deficit can be put at $2.3 billion. In imports,  Germany has been overtaken by the successor states of the Soviet  Union and it is now in second place. On comparable prices,  imports exceeded their 1990 level by 25 percent. Within this,  the amount of machinery imports increased more than one and a  half times. The purchase of the Boeing passenger aircraft  played a big role in this. The import of foodstuffs increased  by 30 percent, and the import of materials and other consumer  goods increased by 10 to 16 percent.    Exports decreased by some 10 percent. Exports decreased by  20 percent in the first 10 months of 1993 but significantly  increased in the last two months of the year. The decline of  agricultural and food-processing industry exports can be gauged  at 20 percent, while 16 percent fewer consumer goods were  exported. The export of materials decreased by 4 percent  compared with 1992 and the export of machinery increased by 3  percent.</p>

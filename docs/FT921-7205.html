			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / The power behind Greenspan's throne Mr David Mullins seems in his element as vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve. Although sworn in as Mr Alan Greenspan's deputy only last July, he is already emerging as a power behind the throne. 'He is well organised intellectually and as influential as any vice-chairman of the past two decades,' says Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. 'He has charged out of the starting blocks,' says Mr David Jones, a Fed watcher at Aubrey Lanston, the Wall Street brokerage. 'He is a rising star: he does his homework, works well with people and is persuasive at board meetings.' Mr Jones credits Mr Mullins with having played an important role in securing last December's aggressive one-point cut in the discount rate - possibly the Fed's most important monetary decision in recent years. Up to that point, the Fed had favoured a gradualist approach, involving frequent, small rate cuts. The bold December move lifted gloom in financial markets and prompted an economically beneficial decline in long bond yields. At 45, Mr Mullins has enjoyed a meteoric rise. Five years ago he was a finance professor at the Harvard Business School with no plans for public service. In 1987, Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury secretary, asked him to serve on the official committee investigating the stock market crash. In 1988 he joined the Treasury as an assistant secretary and helped mastermind the bail-out of bankrupt savings and loan (S&amp;L) institutions. He moved to the Fed as a governor less than two years ago. In conversation, Mr Mullins displays a lively mind. Analytical by nature, he provides neatly structured answers to questions. Indeed, in a town where many political appointees have only a hazy grasp of their briefs, he reminds one of the European mandarin class of civil servant. Fed vice-chairmen, like US vice-presidents, have often enjoyed only symbolic power. The articulate Mr Mullins is well positioned to wield influence, partly because the composition of the seven-member Fed board has changed markedly. In November and December, two new Bush appointees  - Mr Lawrence Lindsey and Ms Susan Phillips - were sworn in as governors. Mr Lindsey, a former White House aide, is a well-known 'supply-sider'. Both new governors are regarded as 'pro growth'. Mr Mullins says there has been a 'subtle change' in the Fed's objectives. 'Our primary goal is to maximise growth,' he says. 'Price stability is a means to that goal.' He contrasts this with the view of some previous governors who saw price stability as an ultimate objective. He also draws attention to the political costs of trying to achieve price stability too quickly. If the Fed consistently pursued excessively tight policies, it would risk losing its independence on monetary matters. But Mr Mullins is anxious not to be cast as soft on inflation. He says the way to maximise growth is by reducing inflation to 'de minimis levels'. If the US could restore the inflation levels of the 1950s, interest rates could stay low permanently, providing a spur to investment. He also regards low inflation as the best route to stable exchange rates and hence as a way to encourage trade flows. On the economy, he cautions against excessive optimism about an imminent recovery. In spite of recent interest rate cuts, the public mood remains sour and the economy extremely sluggish. The Fed stands ready to ease again if growth does not materialise. He regards the recession that began in July 1990 as 'pretty much over', in spite of recent falls in employment and production. But the painful process of 'wringing out the imbalances of the 1980s' may continue for several more quarters. If it proved necessary to reduce debt ratios to the levels of the early 1980s before households and companies felt free to spend, the recovery could take longer to arrive than widely envisaged. 'The upturn may start in the second quarter but it is likely to be mid-year before we get a growth rate of 2 to 3 per cent,' he says. And that, he fears, may not be fast enough to convince people that a recovery really is under way. He says the Fed can do nothing about the biggest long-term drag on growth: the prospect of another decade of huge budget deficits. The best evidence of deteriorating fiscal trends is the rise in the 'operating deficit' - the federal deficit minus debt interest and extraordinary items such as the cost of the S &amp; L bail-out. This has risen by Dollars 120bn in the past year. The US, he says, 'must go back to the drawing board' and find a better way of controlling federal deficits. But he is not hopeful of progress. This year's fight over tax cuts will exhaust patience on Capitol Hill and lessen the chance of a comprehensive attack on the deficit in 1993 - the first year of a new presidency and thus the best opportunity for fiscal restraint. Mr Mullins's rapid rise has sparked speculation that he could be a future candidate for Treasury secretary. He discourages the idea. He is a 'problem solver' who has 'never had much ambition for the public spotlight'. The Fed, with its 200 economists, provides an agreeable setting for an ex-academic, comparable with that of a 'world-class university'. 'I'm very happy here,' he says with a smile. 'It's a setting where you can do real analytical research yet also have a real policy impact.' Perhaps his ambitious eye is set on the Fed chairmanship when Mr Greenspan's term expires.</p>

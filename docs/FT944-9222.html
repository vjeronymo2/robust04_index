			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese banker sees disappointing first-half earnings Japan's leading commercial banks will post disappointing earnings for the first half of the current financial year, the president of the country's largest bank warned yesterday, writes Gerard Baker in Tokyo. 'Tough conditions are continuing,' said Mr Toshio Morikawa, president of Sumitomo Bank and chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan. Mr Morikawa said his own bank would report a year-on-year decline in unconsolidated after-tax profits from core banking business for the six months to the end of September, as a result of poor profit margins. He blamed sluggish lending at home and increases in US interest rates for the difficult conditions. Mr Morikawa added that write-offs of non-performing loans would continue to erode pre-tax and net profits for the entire banking sector. Japan's 21 leading banks have seen profits decline for four consecutive years and are expected to report another fall for the current full-year. They are scheduled to announce their half-year results on November 24.</p>

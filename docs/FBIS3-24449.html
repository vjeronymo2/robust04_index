			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Kozlovskiy, under the rubric "Individuals": </F> "Slippery Shokhin: Political Agility as a Means of Fighting a  Decent Reputation"]    [Text] The only representative of power to have met with  former U.S. President Nixon, between the latter's meetings with  Mr. Rutskoy and Mr. Zhirinovskiy, as it happened, was RF  [Russian Federation] Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin. One  can guess that this meeting was scarcely at Mr. Shokhin's  personal initiative; however, the fact that it was he who was  selected for this mission reflected the position he has landed  in the government, due largely to his own initiative.    Aleksandr Shokhin remains one of the most tenacious  ministers  in the Russian government. He was invited by Ivan Silayev to  occupy the post of labor minister, held on in the transition  administration of Acting Premier Oleg Lobov, and entered  organically as one of the key vice premiers into the "reform  cabinet," where, as we know, he headed up the economic bloc.  Despite his early manifested inclination toward extreme  political tenacity, Mr. Shokhin was long considered one of the  most literate and powerful reformers on the "Gaydar team," on  which he occupied a special, relatively independent position.    By the way, when Aleksandr Shokhin, as the first of the  "renegade reformers," began to pronounce unintelligible texts  "on the need to strengthen the social orientation of the  reforms" on the eve of the elections, it reminded us mostly of  cheap demagoguery: it reminded us that during the first period  of reforms the social bloc's former chief could boast of a  single merit--he held on tenaciously to that same "social  protection" and blamed the government for its lack.    Without dwelling on the reasons that brought Mr. Shokhin  into  the "Shakhray party," it should be noted that he entered quite  organically into the role of economic ideologue. His theoretical  constructs were limited to hints at a poorly digested "centrism"  in the spirit of the Civic Union, and his practical attacks  against government policy pursued the goal of toying with  Russia's Choice. Mr. Shokhin's membership in the PRES [Party of  Russian Unity and Accord] and even, to some extent, his  supremacy in that party might seem surprising at first. However,  he quickly achieved "unity and accord" with his colleagues on  the basis of a single ideological paradigm that linked the party  to absolute political spinelessness. From this standpoint, each  of the PRES leaders has his own special merits: Mr. Shakhray,  who virtually ensured passage of the criminal resolution  granting amnesty to the organizers of the state coup due to  extenuating circumstances; Mr. Zatulin, a petty trade-finance  middleman implicated in petty machinations who has now attained  petty power and who long reviled in the press the very people  and politics with which he now willingly formed a bloc.    As for the "intelligent and competent" Mr. Shokhin, he along  with his comrades in his party, willingly agreed to the  suggestion to join a government formed on the very basis of  their party's defeat in the elections. By the way, we should  mention the fact that it was Mr. Shokhin who brought in Mr.  Melikyan to take over the newly freed up chair of the head of  the RF Ministry of Labor. Mr. Melikyan is now willingly and  extensively developing both in public and in his practical  activities his patron's most demagogic ideological findings.    Once he took over Russia's Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr  Shokhin attempted to proclaim it the key economic department,  empowered to carry out the purposeful state regulation of the  economy. Thus he attempted virtually to commandeer the legacy of  Mr. Lobov, an act that ought to have been considered utterly  shameful for the "economist-reformer."    I will make the proviso that Mr. Shokhin's undoubted service  was his extremely harsh position at the negotiations with  Western partners and international financial organizations on  the issues of their economic "assistance" and Russia's foreign  debt. However, Mr. Shokhin has been virtually dismissed from  these duties, and he is not going to be allowed, or so it seems,  to render any such benefit in his new field of endeavor.    The administration seems to have made the most radical  reform  decision of recent years by taking away from the Economics  Ministry the monumental quarters of the old USSR Gosplan [State  Planning Committee]. Soviet-Russian bureaucratic practice shows  that, after something like this, "great institutions," as a  rule, are not restored. So that once again they have, as they  say, wiped their feet on Mr. Shokhin.    The new economics minister's highly developed agility is  becoming a threat to his own professional reputation: unlike Mr.  Soskovets or Mr. Chernomyrdin, he cannot fail to be aware of the  content of his new economic illuminations. By the way, in his  conversation with President Nixon, Aleksandr Shokhin accused  Premier Chernomyrdin of excessive monetarism in connection with  February's indecently low rates of inflation. In a recent  interview, former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov proposed that  Mr. Shokhin's next post be minister of health care. However, if  Aleksandr Shokhin is going to treat himself as carefully in the  future as he has so far, then he might boldly count on occupying  the chair of deputy minister of health care.</p>

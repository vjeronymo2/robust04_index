			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNS OF CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Reading the article "Lack of Hospitality," by Arnold Stone (June 24), reminded  me of our drive last July from Vancouver, B.C., through Washington, Oregon and  into California.  </P> <P> There were many helpful directions and signs for tourists all through  Washington and Oregon, but the moment we crossed the border into California,  the first sign we saw was "$500 Fine for Littering." Very few directional signs  were evident along the California coast. Winding through the hills near Bodega  Bay, we were strictly on our own, fervently hoping that we were heading for San  Francisco.  </P> <P> No welcome station at the California border is necessary, but more hospitality  and signs would be appreciated.  </P> <P> MARJE BUTLER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has been more forthcoming in providing  information about prisoners of conscience, according to veteran  human rights lobbyist John Kamm.    And a senior source in the human rights movement has  indicated China may release famous dissident Ren Wanding in the  near future.    In meetings officials in the Justice Ministry earlier this  week, Mr Kamm was given information concerning the whereabouts  of 10 little-known detainees.    "The judicial authorities were willing to give a systematic  account of a number of prisoners of conscience I raised with  them, including age, sex, occupation, health conditions and  their attitude in prison," Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong yesterday.  "This is an encouraging development."    For example, the lobbyist was told that Zhai Decheng,  sentenced in 1983 to 15 years, escaped after 10 months in jail.  Zhai (sometimes known as Cai), a worker who was detained for  putting up "counter-revolutionary posters", escaped from Kaifeng  Prison in Henan province in October 1984 and has not been  recaptured.    Qi Dafeng, a former graduate student who is serving two  Years  in a re education through labour camps for meeting America-based  student dissident Shen Tong in late 1992, has had his sentence  extended by three months. Qi, originally due for release this  year, was criticised by judicial officials for "refusing to  submit to discipline," Mr Kamm said.    Details of the conditions of Yu Dongyue, Kajikhumar Shabdan  and Jampel Changchup were also given.    Yu, 29, is serving a life sentence in Hunan No. 1 prison for  spilling ink on Chairman Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square.    Shabdan, 71, a Kazakh was detained in 1987 for alleged  espionage. He was given a 15-year term to be served in Urumqi  No. 1 Prison.    And Tibetan Changchup, 33, is serving a 19-year term in the  Lhasa Prison, also for espionage.    Mr Kamm said he was told the number of jailed  "counter-revolutionaries" in China was 2,935 at the end of  March, compared with 3,036 at the end of 1993.    He said Chinese officials were aware that while President  Bill Clinton had delinked human rights from trade, "that's not  the same as saying that the human rights issue has been  resolved".    Meanwhile, a source in the human rights crusade said  yesterday he was given hints by officials that dissident  intellectual Ren, sentenced to seven years in prison in 1991,  might be paroled later this year.    "I was told that Ren's behaviour in jail is good and that he  has followed the rules and regulations," he said. The source  said, however, he was less optimistic about former senior  official Bao Tong, the principal secretary of ousted party chief  Zhao Ziyang.    Western government have been pressing Beijing to grant  "medical bail" to Bao, who is serving a seven year term.    "The authorities do not dispute that Bao is ill," the source  added. "But they claim they do not think he can receive better  medical treatment out side prison.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNORS' REPORT URGES ACTION ON TRANSPORTATION  </P> <P> State governments should take the lead in strengthening the country's  transportation system to help make the United States more competitive in world  markets, according to a National Governors' Assn. task force report issued here  Saturday.  </P> <P> But the report, released as state chief executives gathered here for the  association's conference, said the federal government should help the states  meet the cost of transportation improvements by delivering revenues accumulated  in various federal trust funds for transportation.  </P> <P> "Billions of dollars that are committed to transportation uses, and only to  transportation uses, are being held in the budget in Washington and not being  spent out in America where they are supposed to be spent so that the (federal)  budget deficit looks smaller," said Republican Gov. James R. Thompson of  Illinois, the task force chairman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $13 Billion Involved  </P> <P> Governors' association staffers said that more than $13 billion was involved,  most of it in the highway trust fund raised by gasoline taxes and the aviation  trust fund financed by taxes on airline tickets.  </P> <P> Federal officials have contended that the money is needed to meet future  expenditures by the states.  </P> <P> The task force report urged states to take the initiative in establishing  partnership arrangements with local governments, with federal agencies and with  the private sectors to find new approaches to transportation planning and  development.  </P> <P> "This nation needs to devote its attention to finding ways to improve all types  of transportation infrastructure -- highways, mass transit, airports and  seaports," said Thompson. "We must bring them up to this century and the  fast-approaching 21st Century."  </P> <P> The transportation report was the final one in a series of six task force  studies issued by the governors' group in the last year, all with the overall  purpose of improving U.S. competitiveness.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Identify Needs  </P> <P> Because of their close involvement with ownership and operation of  transportation facilities, states are in the best position to identify needs,  manage programs and build and operate improved transportation systems, the  report said, but the federal government, in addition to accelerating outlay of  trust fund revenues, should remove present limits on use of tax-exempt  financing for transportation improvements by state and local governments. Also,  the report urged Washington to increase its own spending for research and  development to encourage technological improvements in transportation  infrastructure.  </P> <P> "The cost of doing business is influenced by how well we move goods and  people," said Thompson. "For every dollar of export goods, about 25 cents is  spent on the transportation of raw materials, semi-finished goods and  components between domestic manufacturers."  </P> <P> In a statement reviewing the association's work in the trade area, Gov. Gerald  L. Baliles, a Virginia Democrat and the association chairman, stressed that  close coordination is needed on a broad front. "As we have improved in one area  of global competitiveness we have quickly realized that all the wheels must  turn in concert," he said.  </P> <P> Baliles said previous reports have dealt with the search for new markets  abroad, communication with trading partners and competitors, investment in  technology, education, work force training, access to capital and child welfare  and development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush to Speak  </P> <P> The three-day conference, which officially opens today, will hear an address by  President Bush on Monday and will discuss subjects ranging from drugs and  education to telecommunications and energy. But one topic that is not on the  official agenda is the hottest issue now facing state politicians -- the  controversy resulting from the Supreme Court decision last month giving the  states broader authority to regulate abortion.  </P> <P> Baliles said that the decision had come too late to be included on the  conference agenda, planning on which began about a year ago.  </P> <P> In addition, Baliles said: "This is a topic that will have to be argued within  each state, depending on the political situation in each state. It is a topic  that is unlikely to achieve the kind of consensus that would produce a policy  resolution through the National Governors' Assn."  </P></p>

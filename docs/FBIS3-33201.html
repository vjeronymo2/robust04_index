			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta from the "Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] The dialogue for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas  will begin earlier than originally planned. Although the talks  between the 19 EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Front]  delegates headed by Subcommander Marcos and Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis will formally begin today, some meetings were held  yesterday.    According to reports released yesterday and early today,  three groups were formed to define negotiation mechanisms.  Although the reconciliation process formally begins at 0900  [1500 GMT] today, the first phase of the meeting will be private  and accredited reporters will not be allowed coverage. We do not  expect to receive any information on the first direct meeting  between the 19 EZLN delegates, among whom are four women,  Commissioner Camacho Solis, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz  until midday.    The EZLN representatives have spent 18 hours inside the San  Cristobal de Las Casas cathedral, which is now being called the  cathedral of peace. Standing guard at the cathedral are unarmed  military policemen, Red Cross volunteers, and members of  nongovernment organizations. These three circles were  established on Saturday, and they operate day and night with  changes every four hours. Working in these circles are  approximately 450 volunteers, a similar number of persons from  nongovernment organizations, and approximately 500 soldiers.</p>

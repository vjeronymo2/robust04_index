			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Era ends as Leopoldo Pirelli gives up executive power MR LEOPOLDO Pirelli, 66, chairman of Pirelli, the loss-making Italian cables and tyres concern, is giving up executive powers in the company established by his grandfather 120 years ago. Management control is going to a seven-member executive committee. The group includes Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, 44, Mr Pirelli's son-in-law, who has emerged as the company's new driving force. Mr Tronchetti Provera, already one of two managing directors, has now been named executive deputy chairman. Mr Pirelli will remain chairman, but concentrate on liaison between Pirelli and Societe Internationale Pirelli and Pirelli &amp; C, the two financial holding companies which control it. The termination of direct Pirelli family control over the company ends an era in Italian family capitalism. Although Mr Pirelli's son, Alberto, 38, remains one of three deputy chairmen, Mr Tronchetti Provera's steady rise has left him increasingly sidelined in recent months. The management changes represent further fall-out from last year's abortive takeover bid for Continental, Pirelli's slightly bigger German rival. The costs of that bid, notably the secret financial guarantees given to Pirelli's allies, account for around half its forecast L690bn (Pounds 320.03m) loss for 1991. Despite calls for changes at the top, Mr Pirelli had stressed his intention to stay in charge. The change now, on the eve of a L519bn rights issue to buttress the group's shaky finances, will end speculation about his future. The arrival of a younger generation of management not tainted by the Continental affairs should also help to restore shareholders' confidence. There has been growing concern in recent weeks about Pirelli's vulnerability to a takeover following reports of sustained purchases of shares in Pirelli itself, and in the two holding companies. Although theoretically immune to a bid thanks to its complex structure, the rumours have raised doubts about the company's future. Mr Tronchetti Provera is believed to have been firmly against the Continental takeover and to have watched with increasing dismay as it foundered. His family is one of the core shareholders in Pirelli, with a 5.6 per cent stake in Pirelli &amp; C, the ultimate holding company. Observer, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEMENI LEADER BACKS TRIBALISM, ISLAM, ARMS  </P> <P> Yemen's top tribal chief says tribalism and Islam should retain their  importance in a multi-party political system and that tribesmen should have the  traditional right to carry weapons.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, pluralism is better than a one-party system, but it should be  based on the Yemeni people's beliefs, which are mainly Islam," Sheik Abdullah  ibn Hussein Ahmar, was quoted Monday as saying in the Emirates newspaper Al  Ittihad.  </P> <P> Tribesmen will continue to carry weapons because "we consider them part of our  tradition," he said.  </P> <P> Yemen and South Yemen last November agreed to a political merger and reforms  including the right to form political parties when the two states finally  unite.  </P></p>

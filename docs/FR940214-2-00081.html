The amendments pertain to disclosure by investment advisers that sponsor ``wrap fee programs,'' services under which investment advice and brokerage services are paid for in a single ``wrap'' fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments to rule 203&hyph;1 and Form ADV would require sponsors of wrap fee programs to prepare and file with the Commission new Schedule H to Form ADV discussing important information about the wrap fee program. It is estimated that approximately 300 investment advisers would be required to amend their Form ADVs to include Schedule H in the first year after the schedule's adoption, and that each adviser completing Schedule H would incur six burden hours in its preparation. The increase in burden resulting from this amendment will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 204&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it is estimated that each year approximately thirty investment advisers will be required to complete Schedule H as part of an initial application for registration on Form ADV, and that each adviser required to complete Schedule H would incur six burden hours in addition to the time currently necessary to complete Form ADV. This increase in burden will be reflected in the burden associated with rule 203&hyph;1 (Form ADV). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The burden hours associated with rule 204&hyph;1 are likely to decline after the amendments' first year. In future years, each adviser amending its Form ADV would merely need to make any necessary changes to its existing wrap fee brochure. The Commission estimates that the changes will take significantly less than six hours necessary to prepare the brochure initially. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would require an adviser to deliver its Schedule H to prospective clients of the wrap fee program, and offer to deliver it annually to existing clients of the program, in lieu of the disclosure document required by the rule to be delivered to the adviser's other clients. Because the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 would merely require the delivery of a specific wrap fee disclosure document to certain clients in lieu of the delivery of a more general disclosure document, the Commission estimates that the amendments to rule 204&hyph;3 will not increase the burden on advisers in complying with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General comments may be directed to Gary Waxman at the address below.

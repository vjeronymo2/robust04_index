During talks with visiting Dutch Foreign Minister P.H.  Kooijmans here this morning, Qian said China and the Netherlands  differ in their national conditions but they share many common  points.    Over the past year or more, he said, there had appeared a  good momentum of growth in bilateral ties, adding: "We are happy  to see that political contacts between the two countries have  increased and results of cooperation in economy and trade are  remarkable."    On bilateral economic relations and trade, Qian noted that  the volume of bilateral trade last year amounted to 2.32 billion  U.S. dollars.    However, he said: "We are not content with the results  already achieved. There still exists a big potential in this  regard."    Qian said that China's economy is developing rapidly in a  healthy and sustained way, and more Dutch entrepreneurs are  welcome to invest in China. "It is our hope that the Dutch  Government will give active support to extending loans," he  added.    Meanwhile, he said, it will be useful that the Netherlands  will raise the competitiveness of its products.    On the ties between China and the European Union, Qian said  China and the European Union are playing important roles in  international affairs, adding that in the fields of economy and  trade, they are important partners of cooperation.    He stressed the great importance of developing the relations  between China and the European Union, saying that such ties are  not only beneficial to both, but also to peace, stability and  development in the world as a whole.    Qian expressed the hope that the Netherlands will make  further efforts to this end.    Kooijmans said the Netherlands is also satisfied with the  rapid development of bilateral relations, economic ties and  trade in particular.    He told Qian that his current visit to China is aimed at  strengthening contacts and cooperation between the two countries.    He said the Netherlands was pleased to note the improvement  of the relationship between the European Union and China.    Kooijmans said the Netherlands, as a member of the European  Union, is ready to promote the growth of such ties.    At the visitor's request, Qian briefed Kooijmans on his  recent visit to South Asian countries.    The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on other  issues concerning bilateral ties and international issues of  common concern, in a sincere and friendly atmosphere.    After the talks, Qian gave a luncheon for Kooijmans and his  party.</p>

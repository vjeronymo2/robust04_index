			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FLEMING HANGS UP HER SKATES  </P> <P> Peggy Fleming, who won a gold medal in figure skating at the 1968 Winter  Olympics, says she no longer skates -- even recreationally.  </P> <P> She said she gets exercise from walking, a little running and a new interest:  weight training.  </P> <P> She said she does the weight training with a girlfriend and this arrangement  helps stimulate her.  </P> <P> "I think having a friend will make you stick to an exercise program a little  better, maybe even motivate you to get started," she said Tuesday. "It's a  commitment. You don't want to let your friend down."  </P> <P> Fleming, 41, of Los Gatos, was in Memphis on a promotional tour for support  hose.  </P></p>

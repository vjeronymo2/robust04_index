			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 18  January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item.    Official sources said Honduran banana production will drop  by  5 million cases -- 18 kg each -- in 1994. According to official  estimates, Honduras will produce 35 million cases in 1994,  compared to 40 million produced in 1993. The reasons given for  this were floods at the end of 1993 and EC protectionist  measures. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1637 GMT 12 Jan)    Honduran international reserves dropped approximately $100  million during the past few months, to the point that there are  only $131 million in the Central Bank vaults. This is only  enough foreign exchange to back imports for one month, official  sources reported on 12 January. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish  1632 GMT 12 Jan 94)    Finance Ministry official William Chong reported that the  government failed to collect 1 billion lempiras in taxes,  including sales and income taxes. Chong admitted that this is  due in part to corruption and irregularities in the Customs  Department. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in Spanish 13  Jan 94 p 3)</p>

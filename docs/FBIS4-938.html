This final decision was  taken at an AVF executive board meeting in Pretoria.    In a separate statement the AVF said it was surprised at the  Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to take part in the April 26 to  28 poll.    The AVF called for an indefinite postponement of the  election  until a proper and inclusive solution was found. Dr Hartzenberg  said the AVF had been unable to reach agreement with the Freedom  Front on participation in the election and called on AVF  supporters not to vote.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: ``The IAEA Clarification: An Answer </F> to the West's Babblings'']    [Text] Dr. Hans Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has stated that the outcome of the  visit by IAEA inspectors to the Islamic Republic of Iran was  very positive.    Handing this report to the IAEA in Vienna, he said that the  agency's inspectors very freely inspected all of Iran's nuclear  installations in Aban [month ending 21 November] and that  officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran actively cooperated  with this delegation. The IAEA chief said that this  delegation's inspection of Iran's nuclear installations was an  important step toward removing existing false ideas on the  nuclear programs of some countries.    This is not the first time that the peaceful nature of the  Islamic Republic's nuclear programs have been confirmed by the  IAEA. Previously too, the IAEA sent delegations to inspect our  country's nuclear installations and those delegations also  emphasized the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.    The IAEA's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is the  clearest answer that can be given to babblings by hegemonistic  powers that ignore that agency's reports and have always tried  to falsely accuse the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to mask  their own support for the nuclear arsenals of the regime  occupying Jerusalem. Last year IAEA chief Hans Blix stated that  Israel should also be included among the places where nuclear  weapons are to be dismantled as part of the Middle East peace  process. He stated that an area free from nuclear weapons  requires that Israel also abandon its nuclear capability.  Nevertheless, under pressures from America and other Western  powers that support the regime occupying Palestine, he has never  been able to send investigation teams to occupied Palestine.    Hans Blix's remarks clearly refer to the existence of  nuclear  weapons in occupied Palestine and to the Zionists' opposition to  any effort to send delegations there. For years now the  Zionists have been investing immensely on nuclear projects in  occupied Palestine with American support. They are receiving  all types of financial and technical support from the Americans  in the manufacture of such weapons. Not only have the Zionists  not hidden there efforts and the American support for their  nuclear programs, but they have even very impudently been  boasting about their progress in these projects. With America's  political support, they are the only party to the Middle East  compromise talks that is refusing to allow international teams  to inspect their nuclear installations. This is a fact of which  all the Arab regimes longing for peace with the regime occupying  Jerusalem are aware; and Hans Blix and other high- ranking IAEA  officials have also admitted this on several occasions during  their visits to Middle East countries.    The fact is that if it is the IAEA's duty to prevent  non-peaceful nuclear projects around the world, then it should  begin to confront those governments that disregard all  limitations on the use of weapons of mass destruction. The  Americans and the Zionists have repeatedly proven with their  actions that they do not recognize any laws, criteria, or  commitments on the use of weapons of mass destruction or in  perpetrating crimes against the human lives. Therefore, these  are the governments that deserve stricter pressures by world  forums.    If international laws and world commitments are so easily  trampled on by impudent regimes that are not punished for their  acts and if laws do not differentiate between obedient and  disobedient governments, what our world recognizes as universal  law will be nothing more than mere words on paper that only take  up space in the archives of international bodies. The IAEA  should be able to prove with its actions that it is not affected  by pressures from any side.</p>

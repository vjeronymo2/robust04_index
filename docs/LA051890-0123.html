			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST MOVES BASKETBALL FINAL FROM NCAA CONFLICT  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach was left out of the NCAA basketball tournament two months  ago because it couldn't beat Nevada Las Vegas, which won the national  championship by 30 points over Duke in the NCAA final.  </P> <P> Determined to prevent its teams from being caught again in a time conflict  between the televised NCAA tournament program and the conference's televised  title game, the 10-team Big West Conference decided Thursday at Santa Barbara  to cut its men's and women's tournaments to eight teams and restructure the  tournament so that the men's championship game will be over before the  televised selection program begins.  </P> <P> Long Beach learned at halftime of the Sunday afternoon tournament final in  March that the NCAA selection committee had announced it would be invited only  if it beat UNLV to win the automatic Big West berth. The 49ers lost, 92-74.  </P> <P> Jim Haney, Big West Conference commissioner, said the NCAA has not given the  Big West assurances that it would not be penalized again for the lateness of  its title game.  </P> <P> The Big West title game began at 3 p.m. on a Sunday last season, conflicting  with the 3:30 p.m. selection show. Haney said the final is tentatively set for  1 p.m. next season.  </P> <P> But Seth Greenberg, then an assistant and now head coach of the Long Beach team  that was left out, said he is not convinced the change will make a difference.  </P> <P> "I really don't think when that final game is played has an effect of the  selection process," said Greenberg, who replaced Joe Harrington, now coach at  Colorado. "By that time, they pretty much know who's in and who isn't. But it's  nice they moved it. It takes one less cop-out away from the NCAA committee. The  bottom line is the people on the committee have to decide whether the Big West  merits four teams."  </P></p>

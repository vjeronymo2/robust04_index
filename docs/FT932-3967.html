			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Institutions should help more to curb executive pay excesses Sir, As always, I found Barry Riley's article on executive pay and corporate governance ('When the brass is greener', June 5/6) both entertaining and informative. While he argues that executive pay excesses are due to the opportunities afforded by the increasingly confused roles of 'proprietor' and 'manager', especially on the part of non-executive directors, I would also argue strongly in favour of another of his insights, which he might have taken further. That is, that the opportunities for excessive executive pay have come about because of the 'hands off' approach taken by institutional investors. I contend that, were institutional investors made more accountable to their membership, then we would find directors becoming more accountable to their shareholders. It is the problems of institutional investor governance that have led to problems of corporate governance. The solutions are more clearly in the hands of the Goode Committee (pension law review) than the Cadbury Committee.

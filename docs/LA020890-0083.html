			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: REVISED CHICKEN ENTREE RETAINS ITS VERY RITZY FLAVOR  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Is there a way to revise this recipe so it is both low in salt as  well as cholesterol and fat?  </P> <P>  -- JUDY, Park Forest, Ill.  </P> <P> VERY RITZY CHICKEN  </P> <P> 3 whole chicken breasts or 6 halves, skinned and boned  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons olive oil  </P> <P> 6 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese  </P> <P> 1 pint whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Dip chicken breasts into beaten eggs, then coat with bread crumbs. Heat oil in  skillet over medium heat. Add coated chicken and brown lightly on both sides.  Remove from pan and place in baking dish, topping with slice mozzarella cheese.  </P> <P> Combine whipping cream, Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste in  saucepan. Cook until mixture gets hot and thickens. Pour over chicken and bake  at 350 degrees 25 minutes. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR JUDY: I was able to reduce the fat and cholesterol with a few simple  substitutions. The result is just as tasty but lacking the fatty taste that  only fat can give. Fortunately, the reduced fat allows the other wonderful  flavors to shine and makes it possible to enjoy this rich-tasting dish without  "putting on the Ritz."  </P> <P> Egg whites coat the chicken just as well as whole eggs, but without the added  fat and cholesterol, and evaporated skim milk works wonders in place of heavy  cream. By frying the chicken in two batches I was able to greatly reduce the  oil required; cutting the amounts of cheese in half also accomplished the  desired results.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> RITZIER CHICKEN  </P> <P> 6 chicken breast halves, boned and skinned  </P> <P> 3 egg whites, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons olive oil  </P> <P> 3 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, sliced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cornstarch  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups evaporated skim milk  </P> <P> 2 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> Dip chicken breast halves into beaten egg whites and coat with bread crumbs.  Heat 1 teaspoon oil in skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 chicken and brown  lightly on both sides. Remove from pan and place in baking dish.  </P> <P> Repeat with remaining oil and chicken. Top with sliced mozzarella cheese.  </P> <P> Dissolve cornstarch in 3 tablespoons evaporated skim milk. Heat remaining milk,  Parmesan cheese, parsley and pepper in saucepan. Add cornstarch mixture and  cook until sauce thickens.  </P> <P> Pour sauce over chicken and bake at 350 degrees 25 minutes. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: May be prepared ahead and refrigerated 1 to 2 days before baking, if  necessary, then increase baking time to 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Each serving contains approximately:  </P> <P> Original Recipe:  </P> <P> 705 calories  </P> <P> 286 mg cholesterol  </P> <P> 52 gm fat  </P> <P> 770 mg sodium  </P> <P> Revised Recipe:  </P> <P> 331 calories  </P> <P> 88 mg cholesterol  </P> <P> 9 gm fat  </P> <P> 436 mg sodium  </P></p>

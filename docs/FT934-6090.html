			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Twilight hour - There are conflicting signals over the future of solar energy Although the widespread use of solar energy has long been a dream of ecologists and politicians, the private sector is sending out mixed signals on the industry's future. On the positive side, Southern California Edison, the electric utility, has just unveiled a pilot programme to offer solar energy to rural customers. Sounding a negative note, Mobil Oil announced this month that it was putting its solar arm up for sale. Solar energy has always struggled with a dilemma. To bring down costs, many more people must buy the technology. But to attract more buyers, the industry must bring down costs. Economies of scale are the elusive key to success. Sceptics say the failure to resolve this dilemma has turned solar energy into little more than a pipe dream. 'The sector is tiny and we don't expect it to become a major player in the energy industry for the next 20 years, at least,' says John Lord, a spokesman for Mobil Oil. Solar energy proponents are pinning their hopes on rural customers. They believe heightened demand for solar power in remote areas will add enough economy-of-scale benefits to usher the sector into a new phase of high growth. For off-grid users - homes not already served by a utility - solar energy is already highly competitive. 'For off-grid customers, solar energy fills an important niche,' says Alan Panton, solar sales manager for Kyocera of Japan, the semiconductor ceramic package maker. 'It's just a matter of getting the awareness level up.' There are few cost-effective alternatives for rural homes. Running an electric line through miles of wilderness to service a single user is prohibitively expensive. In the past, rural residents relied on personal generators for their energy needs. Recently, however, many have turned to solar power. Increased demand by off-grid customers has helped to build the industry into a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) a year worldwide operation, according to Strategies Unlimited, the consultancy group. Growth has been robust - averaging an annual 20 per cent over the last few years. Siemens, the German electronics group, British Petroleum and Kyocera all have solar divisions and a number of start-up groups are being drawn into the industry. 'With the large oil companies walking away from this, it creates more space for small entrepreneurial companies like mine to step in,' says Vijay Kapur, president of International Solar Electric Technology. Utilities are hoping to capitalise on the surge in demand for solar energy by acting as the middleman. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, for instance, is considering a programme which would finance the initial cost of fitting a home with solar energy. The utility would then charge a monthly fee for the installation. 'By mid-1995, we should offer solar energy to off-grid users on this basis,' says Howard Wenger, senior project manage for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Solar energy advocates believe the main increase in demand, however, will come not from industrialised countries but from developing ones. Governments in South America and India have expressed keen interest in using solar energy to 'electrify' remote communities. This interest is being fuelled by World Bank funds earmarked to promote solar power. Proponents hope that demand from developing countries will infuse solar energy with enormous economies-of-scale benefits. 'Can you imagine the demand it would create if countries like China caught on to this?' says Kenneth Zweibel, a manager at the National Renewable Energy Lab, a research facility funded by the US Department of Energy. Just how quickly a critical mass can be achieved is uncertain. The sector's inability to compete effectively in the 'on-grid' market is a big drag on growth. For homeowners hooked up to an electric utility, solar power is not cost-effective. Solar energy per kilowatt hour, for instance, is estimated at 2.5 to five times more expensive than electricity. 'Right now, there's no way solar energy can compete with electricity, oil and natural gas for on-grid customers,' says Michael Merlo, head of research, development and demonstration at Southern California Edison. According to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, however, there may be exceptions to this rule. 'If demand stays stagnant, it's probably not cost-effective,' says Wenger. 'But if demand increases to the point that you'd be looking at a new nuclear power plant, or if you had to upgrade the lines to a certain neighbourhood, all of a sudden it looks feasible.' Wenger says the company is considering mixed-use areas, which would switch to solar energy at peak-use times. Solar energy may also get a boost from improved technology. The US government has been providing tax subsidies for research in solar power since the oil crisis of the 1970s. As a result, technology has improved tremendously. Photovoltaics - the solar industry's equivalent of the computer chip - are far more efficient in translating the sun's rays into usable energy. Photovoltaics are also cheaper to manufacture and install than they were a decade ago. The solar panel manufacturer International Solar Electric Technology, for instance, has managed to slice the silicon wafers used in solar energy in half, thereby cutting the cost of production. The solar energy division of Texas Instruments has reduced the cost of installation by using lighter weight, flexible panels. Because of these advances, solar panels are now just 5 per cent of their 1978 cost, according to John Schaeffer, president of the solar energy group Real Goods Trading. Despite the advances, the US government feels technological improvements will not be sufficient to make solar energy competitive. 'Technology can play a role in bringing down costs, but what we really need is an increase in demand,' says James Rennalds, director of the photovoltaics division of the US Department of Energy. Because of imponderables such as the level of government subsidies, it is difficult to assess whether solar energy is headed for boom or bust. It will probably continue to stumble along for the next few years at least, in search of the elusive critical mass that would make it a significant player in the worldwide energy sector.</p>

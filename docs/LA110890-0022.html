			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 44.31 ON WAR FEARS, ELECTION UPSETS  </P> <P> Rising war fears combined with disappointment over a big U.S. Treasury bond  sale and the election results sent the stock market reeling and knocked the Dow  Jones industrial index down 44.31 to 2,440.84.  </P> <P> The war worries, which lifted crude oil futures for December $2.68 a barrel in  New York, rose as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared that Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein faces war soon unless he withdraws from Kuwait. The  warning mingled with wide speculation that a war is more likely now that the  U.S. elections are over.  </P> <P> "The talk got oil prices running, and that spilled over quickly into our  market," said Kenneth Ducey, head of institutional trading at S. G. Warburg  &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 149.13 million shares,  compared to 141.13 million on Tuesday. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by  1,134 to 444, with 441 stocks unchanged.  </P> <P> As the Dow fell 1.8%, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also fell 1.8%,  or 5.61 points, to 306.01. The NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter  stocks slipped 3.73 to 336.80, a 1.1% loss.  </P> <P> The $2.68-a-barrel spike in the December oil contract brought the contract's  closing New York Mercantile Exchange price to $35.31.  </P> <P> Analysts said the fear of Persian Gulf hostilities was the primary force in the  market, but there was also unhappiness with waning investor interest in the  U.S. Treasury bond sale. The auction of $34.25 billion in government securities  began Tuesday and runs through today.  </P> <P> "The auction was not a disaster, but a bit of a disappointment," said Michael  Metz, market strategist for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. He said much of  the market's optimism about an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve  had faded by the end of the session.  </P> <P> The markets also heard several rumors, among them a report that the Western  allies planned to strike Iraq soon to prevent the country from completing  construction of a nuclear weapon later this month, Metz said.  </P> <P> There has been speculation for some weeks that the Administration would not  launch an attack on Iraq before the elections, lest it be accused of trying to  manipulate the election results, said Chris Pedersen, director of trading at  Twenty First Securities in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Pedersen said the election results were also a negative for the market, because  many on Wall Street had hoped that the defeat of a large number of incumbents  would show Congress that it needed to become more serious about reducing the  deficit. Instead, 96% of House incumbents were reelected, and all but one  senator.  </P> <P> Pedersen said the market was also driven by a technical factor. At the close of  Tuesday's trading, the value of the S&amp;P index fell below its 50-day moving  average, which, he said, "re-established a downward trend."  </P> <P> Market technicians were also watching a sudden reversal in the Dow utility  index, he said, noting that some market analysts consider utility prices a  leading indicator for other averages. Utilities had been gaining in recent  weeks, but dropped sharply in the past three sessions. Wednesday, the Dow  utility index fell 1.9% to 209.07.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * All of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial index fell except McDonald's,  which was flat at 26 3/8. Among big losers, International Paper fell 1 1/2 to  46 1/2, GE lost 1 3/8 to 52, and Alcoa gave up 1 1/4 to 51 3/4.  </P> <P> * Many financial stocks weakened anew. Insurance stocks were particularly hard  hit. Santa Monica-based Fremont General plunged 2 to 12 5/8 after a  disappointing profit report. USF&amp;G fell 5/8 to 11 5/8 after slashing its  dividend 66%. Other weak insurance stocks included Chubb, down 1 3/8 to 44 5/8,  and Kemper, off 1 1/4 to 17 5/8.  </P> <P> * Investors dumped pollution control stocks after Browing Ferris' report of  dismal quarterly earnings Tuesday. Browning fell another 2 1/2 to 21 3/4 after  falling 6 on Tuesday. Other losers Wednesday included Waste Management, down 1  1/2 to 31 1/2, Zurn Industries, off 2 to 30, and Chemical Waste, off 1 1/8 to  19.  </P> <P> * CBS traded as high as 162 but settled back to close up 1/2 at 158 5/8.  Speculation mounted about the potential sale of the late founder William S.  Paley's 8% stake by his heirs. But analysts said Laurence A. Tisch's 25% CBS  stake makes the disposition of Paley's shares irrelevant.  </P> <P> * Circuit City lost 7/8 to 10 3/8 after falling 2 7/8 on Tuesday on a negative  October sales report.  </P> <P> * Cereal stocks continued to fall on worries about possible product price wars.  General Mills slumped 2 1/8 to 84 3/8, Kellogg lost 5/8 to 68 1/4, and Ralston  fell 2 5/8 to 94.  </P> <P> * Oil stocks were hard hit, despite rising crude prices. Mobil lost 2 1/4 to 57  3/8, Chevron fell 1 1/2 to 67 3/8, Louisiana Land tumbled 2 3/8 to 48 5/8 and  Unocal fell 1 1/8 to 29 1/8.  </P> <P> * Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering gained 1 1/8 to 20 3/4 on a strong earnings  report.  </P> <P> In Germany, shares dropped 1.9% in thin, nervous trading. It was the seventh  session in the last nine that the market has declined as traders worried about  the Mideast. The 30-share DAX index fell 27.09 points to 1,371.15.  </P> <P> Share prices closed lower on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial Times  100-share index was down 10.6 points at 2,059.2.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks closed lower as rumors of war in the Gulf and scandal  depressed a market already slumping on lower oil prices and a weaker yen. The  key 225-share Nikkei index fell 465.50 points or 1.9% to 23,500.25. Early  today, the Nikkei lost another 441.26 points, nearing the 23,000 mark.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Mideast Anxiety Hurts Bond Prices  </P> <P> Bond prices fell sharply Wednesday as a successful auction of 10-year Treasury  notes was overshadowed by renewed fears of war in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The government's bellwether 30-year bond fell 19/32, or about $5.94 per $1,000  in face value. Its yield surged to 8.69% from 8.63% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 7.675%, down from 7.688% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Dollar Slips Against Mark, Gains on Yen  </P> <P> The dollar fell against the German mark, hitting a record low on speculation  that the Federal Reserve Board may lower interest rates again.  </P> <P> But Mideast war concerns boosted the currency later in the session, and the  dollar rose against the Japanese yen, which was hurt by rising oil prices.  </P> <P> The dollar finished at 1.4874 marks, down from 1.4927 at Tuesday's close, but  above a historic New York low of 1.4785 set earlier in the session. The dollar  finished at 128.73 Japanese yen, above Tuesday's close of 128.20 yen.  </P> <P> The British pound rose to $1.9690 in New York from $1.9657 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Gold, Silver Head in Opposite Directions  </P> <P> Gold futures slipped and silver futures rallied modestly on New York's  Commodity Exchange in lackluster trading.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, soybeans rebounded, grains were mixed and livestock  and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Platinum fell sharply on the New York Merc, though, erasing most of the gains  posted in the two previous sessions.  </P> <P> Gold finished 20 to 30 cents lower, with December at $387.90 an ounce, and  silver was 2.9 to 3 cents higher, with December at $4.287.  </P></p>

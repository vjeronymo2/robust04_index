			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KTTV TO AIR 'LUCY' SPECIAL  </P> <P> KTTV-TV Channel 11 will pay tribute to Lucille Ball on Saturday with a 10-hour,  commercial-free "I Love Lucy" marathon, beginning at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> During periods between the episodes and at what would normally be the  commercial breaks within the shows, KTTV will run newly taped spots featuring  Ball's friends and co-workers sharing their favorite Lucy stories, said Don  Tillman, Channel 11's vice president of programming.  </P> <P> Because there will be no commercials, Tillman said Thursday, episodes will not  necessarily begin on the half-hour. The last four episodes to air during the  tribute, he said, will be the favorites of the actress, who died Wednesday.  </P> <P> Tillman said the marathon was intended as "a celebration of life, not a  mourning situation."  </P> <P> He said he could not estimate how much the station stands to lose in  advertising revenue. Another Los Angeles station estimated the figure at  $150,000.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SAVING THE EARTH'  </P> <P> Larry Stammer's report from London, "Saving the Earth: Who Sacrifices?" (Part  I, March 13) and the editorial "A Truce With Nature" on the same day give a  dire prognosis on the state of the Earth's health. Hopefully, such information  will help arouse the consciousness of people as to the sacrifices it will be  necessary for us all to make if we are to survive.  </P> <P> I wonder, do we stand by and watch our magnificent planet and all the life it  holds being destroyed in the same manner we have allowed the continuation of  the building of nuclear weapons, spending billions and billions of dollars each  year while people starve and our Earth suffers?  </P> <P> ELEANOR WASSON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

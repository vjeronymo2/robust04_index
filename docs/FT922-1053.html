			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Spain refuses further Ercros aid THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) and the Spanish government were heading for a confrontation last night after the state refused to come to the aid of Ercros, KIO's troubled industrial flagship in Spain. Ercros, the country's biggest chemicals company, is facing a severe financial crisis. Mr Jose Recio, Ercros's chairman of just three weeks, resigned on Monday, triggering a suspension of trading in the group's stock. The resignation came after a failure to secure agreement from KIO or the government on bailing the group out of its Dollars 990m consolidated debt. KIO's new London-based management is understood to have told the Spanish Finance Ministry last week that it was prepared to allow Ercros to go bankrupt if Madrid did not help it out with new funding. At that meeting the government replied it would not make any more money available to Ercros unless KIO responded in kind. 'Ercros is a private company and it is not our business to bail it out,' said the Industry Ministry, which in the past three years has channeled up to Pta18bn (Dollars 182.7m) of subsidies to Ercros - mainly to shore up its loss-making fertiliser operations. At the state-controlled Banco Exterior, Ercros's biggest creditor, an official said the bank had Pta20bn in outstanding loans to Ercros and would not initiate any negotiations if KIO or the government did not move first. Ercros would be the biggest corporate collapse in Spain for nearly a decade. Group turnover last year totalled Dollars 2.2bn, and it reported losses of Pta16.4bn. The group employs 10,500 people in the chemicals, fertiliser, mining and explosives sectors. Its predicament - caused largely by weak fertiliser prices - is an embarrasing setback for KIO in Spain. In the last few weeks it has tried to reassure Madrid that it intends to stay in Spain as a long-term industrial investor. KIO's industrial assets in Spain, built up over the last 10 years, are worth an estimated Dollars 7bn. Mr Jose Recio, who took over as Ercros chairman at the beginning of the month, resigned after failing to secure a Pta25bn capital injection by KIO, which owns some 40 per cent of Ercros through Torras, its Spanish investment arm. Mr Recio, a senior banker, was hired to smooth out differences between KIO and Madrid over funding Ercros, which is also negotiating a joint fertiliser venture with Freeport MacMaRon of the US. He appears to have decided to leave Ercros before being drawn into a messy collapse. A Freeport joint venture, dependent on new money being pumped into Ercros by KIO or Madrid, looks increasingly unlikely.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DRABEK STOPS MONTREAL AS PITTSBURGH WINS, 6-1  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Pirates have been hovering around last place in the National  League East all season.  </P> <P> However, it is not Doug Drabek's fault. His record doesn't show it, but the  27-year-old right-hander is pitching better than he did last season, when he  finished 15-7.  </P> <P> Drabek is 10-9 this season after pitching a six-hitter in the Pirates' 6-1  victory over the slumping Expos Monday night at Montreal. It was the Expos'  ninth loss in the last 11 games and dropped them three games behind Chicago in  the East.  </P> <P> Drabek, who also drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single, has given up  three or fewer runs in 21 of the 25 games he has started.  </P> <P> Dennis Martinez (12-3), suffering from the flu, lasted five innings and lost  his second in a row after 11 consecutive victories.  </P> <P> "I'm embarrassed to be where we are," Pirate Manager Jim Leyland said. "I don't  know who will win the East this year, but I'll pick the Expos for their  pitching. We caught Martinez when he wasn't at his best."  </P> <P> St. Louis 7-5, Atlanta 4-2 -- The Cardinals kept their hopes in the East alive  by sweeping the doubleheader at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Joe Magrane improved his record to 15-7 in the opener, winning for the 10th  time in his last 11 decisions. Magrane, who gave up six hits and three runs in  eight innings, also singled in a run in the five-run third inning rally that  gave him a commanding lead.  </P> <P> Milt Thompson had three hits and drove in three runs in the opener to hand John  Smoltz (11-11) his fifth loss in a row.  </P> <P> In the nightcap, the top leading batters in the Cardinal lineup had a big game.  Vince Coleman and Jose Oquendo each had two singles, a walk, a stolen base and  scored twice.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, losers of four out of five in New York, are 5 1/2 games eout of  first place.

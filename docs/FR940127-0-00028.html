			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters also indicated that in loans with multiple tracts, title to some tracts may be evidenced by abstracts while other tracts are covered by title insurance. This comment indirectly raises the issue of whether the regulation permits the lender to decide, for each tract, whether to use an attorney lien certification or title insurance to document the existence of a first lien when more than one tract is involved in a single first mortgage loan. The regulation should not be read to preclude the use of different methods of lien documentation for different tracts. In the case of multiple tracts, if title insurance is relied upon for some tracts and attorney certifications are used for others, the minimum amount insured by a policy for a particular tract shall bear the same ratio to the outstanding balance that the appraised value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security. For example, suppose a loan for $80,000 is secured by two properties with appraised values of $70,000 and $30,000. Insurance policies for the properties should be obtained in amounts of at least $56,000 and $24,000, respectively. If an attorney lien certification is used for the first property, then title insurance for the second property need only be obtained for $24,000_not the $80,000 loan amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iv) requires that personnel with adequate training and experience in real estate title matters, designated by counsel, certify in writing that they reviewed the final policy and that the final policy insures a first lien or its equivalent on the primary real estate security for the loan. Commenters believe that it should suffice that a person performing this function meet certain standards of training and experience that are prescribed by the counsel for the lender, but that there should be no specific requirement that counsel actually designate the individual who performs this function. The FCA agrees with the commenters' observations and has modified paragraph (a)(2)(iv) to require that a person performing this function meet written standards for training and experience prescribed by the counsel for the lender, and to eliminate any implication that counsel actually has to designate the individual who performs this function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the first sentence of &sect;615.5060(a) is revised to make it less awkward. The meaning of the sentence is not changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 615  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting, Agriculture, Banks, Banking, Government securities, Investments, Rural areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated in the preamble, part 615 of chapter VI, title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 615_FUNDING AND FISCAL AFFAIRS, LOAN POLICIES AND OPERATIONS, AND FUNDING OPERATIONS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

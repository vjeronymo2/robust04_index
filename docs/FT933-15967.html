			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Novel move lifts Lafarge Coppee stake in Asland LAFARGE Coppee, the French building materials group, has increased its stake in Asland, the Spanish cement and concrete maker, to 87.3 per cent following an exchange offer it called a 'large success,' AP-DJ reports from Paris. As a result of its exchange offer, Lafarge Coppee issued to Asland shareholders participating in the swap a total of 3.42m new shares representing 5.8 per cent of the share capital in the French group. In April, Lafarge Coppee announced it would make a bid for the 46 per cent of Asland it did not already own by swapping two of its new shares for every nine existing Asland shares. Lafarge Coppee noted that its operation was the first such exchange offer by an international group for a Spanish-listed company. It said the acquisition underscored its long-term confidence in Spain. In 1992 Asland, which employs 1,800 people, posted consolidated revenues of Pta42.8bn (Dollars 330m). Asland also holds minority stakes in companies in Turkey and Morocco. Lafarge Coppee shares will begin listing on the Madrid and Barcelona bourses on Friday.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Queens Moat deal is months away Queens Moat Houses may need until April next year to finalise details of a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing agreement with its 65 banks, Mr Stanely Metcalfe, chairman, told shareholders yesterday. He told a packed, and sometimes angry, annual meeting that the group hoped to persuade banks to extend the standstill agreement which is due to expire at the end of January. Earlier, the company had hoped to have an agreement by then. Only after agreement has been reached with the banks can a restructuring plan for the hotel group's debt be put to shareholders. If that is approved the shares would then be relisted. On a show of hands shareholders voted against adopting the annual report. However, on a poll the resolution was carried by 356.7m to 52.5m. Some shareholders attacked the new board, which has replaced former directors who have all resigned since the group's shares were suspended on March 31. Some supported the previous management, although others attacked them. One said he now realised 'my money has been moved about by a load of Essex cowboys'. Argument centred on the group's valuations of its hotels. Two firms of surveyors had put widely different values on the assets. Weatherall Green &amp; Smith had valued the hotels at Pounds 1.35bn in May, after a draft valuation had shown a figure of Pounds 1.86bn. Jones Lang Wootton was then appointed to revalue the hotels and came up with a figure of Pounds 861m, which had been incorporated in the 1992 accounts. Mr Metcalfe said that it was the previous board under Mr John Bairstow, the former chairman, which had appointed JLW. After the meeting Mr Bairstow said that appointment had been made because the board thought the WG&amp;S valuation was too low. Mr Bairstow admitted he carried most responsibility for the mess the company was in. While praising the new directors, some of whom he had appointed, he said the new board did not have sufficient property expertise and was 'shooting itself in the foot' over the valuations. Mr Metcalfe repeatedly told shareholders that the company could only continue trading with the banks' support. He said the group was not paying interest on Pounds 800m of its Pounds 1.3bn debt. Cashflow was too low to sustain the company without 'a significant reduction' in debt and a further 'significant' amount becoming non-interest bearing. He could give no indication of the size of the debt-for-equity swap being negotiated and thus the dilution of shareholders. After the meeting Mr Michael Harkavy, one of the leaders of the shareholders action group, said there could be a way of avoiding a debt-for-equity swap on the scale he believed was being contemplated.</p>

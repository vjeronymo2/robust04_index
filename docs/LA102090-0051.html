			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT / MEDITERRANEAN IN DISTRESS;  </P> <P> POLLUTION AND DEEP BLUE SEA  </P> <P> A terrible loss of animal life etched the issues for all to see on the eve of  an international conference on the environment of the Mediterranean Sea: Scores  of dead dolphins were washing up on the beaches of Majorca, the Costa Brava and  other favorite resorts of Spain.  </P> <P> Veterinarians concluded that contamination of the Mediterranean had broken down  the immune systems of these sleek animals, leaving them too weak to fight off a  viral infection.  </P> <P> It was a dramatic reminder that the calm and light-blue waters of the  Mediterranean have become polluted in the last few decades by the immense  industrialization of southern Europe and by the 50 million tourists who crowd  onto the sun-drenched beaches every year.  </P> <P> The Rhone River alone, which courses past some of France's most potent  petrochemicaland nuclear energy plants, each day deposits an enormous tonnage  of nitrates, sulfates, iron, sewage, mercury and pesticides into the sea.  </P> <P> The issues thus seemed obvious enough when the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opened its meeting on the Mediterranean  environment here almost a month ago.  </P> <P> But the Mediterranean, usually described as the cradle of European  civilization, has often been a crucible of conflict as well. So, it was not too  surprising that the meeting of 35 nations, which ended with flowery and general  promises of cooperation Friday, was caught up in tense wrangling during key  moments of negotiation.  </P> <P> A political problem erupted on the first day when Spanish Foreign Affairs  Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, supported by the Italian foreign  minister, called on the member governments "to apply the spirit of Helsinki to  the Mediterranean and Middle East" and create a new organization, the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> The proposal touched the heart of the history of the organization. The CSCE, a  meeting ground for Europe's Western and Communist camps, first met in Helsinki  in 1973 and produced a series of agreements on human rights two years later  that became known as the Helsinki Accords. Since the Soviet Union had signed  the accords, dissidents in Eastern Europe embraced them as justification for  their cries for freedom.  </P> <P> With the world in crisis over Iraqi aggression in the Middle East, Fernandez  Ordonez said, it is time to create an organization that would provide a meeting  ground for all Mediterranean peoples, no matter how much in conflict. Steps  might somehow be taken, for example, to ease relations between Israelis and  Arabs just as the Helsinki Accords gradually led to an easing of U.S.-Soviet  relations.  </P> <P> The Spanish-Italian proposal hit some delegations like a wet fish. Ambassador  John Davis, the U.S. delegate, insisted it simply was out of place: It had  nothing to do with the Mediterranean environment.  </P> <P> The U.S. government obviously looked on the proposal as a Pandora's Box, one  that might create a new forum for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or lead to  the kind of international conference on the Middle East that the United States  has long opposed. In the end, the U.S. view prevailed: The final communique  merely noted that the proposal had been made.  </P> <P> The conference also had the usual tug of wills between environmentalists and  protectors of economic interests. In the end, according to the private  environmental organization Greenpeace, the economic interests won.  </P> <P> Xavier Pastor, a Spaniard in charge of Greenpeace's Mediterranean studies,  denounced what he called the incompetence of many delegations and singled out  the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and the European Common Market  secretariat as the main diluters of tough resolutions.  </P> <P> Britain, according to Pastor, had rejected a proposal by Italy to ban the  mile-long drift nets that catch every small species in the way while trapping  commercial fish in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> Pastor pronounced the conference "a complete failure." In the end, he said, the  delegates failed to adopt any resolution that "will make a substantial  difference in what is going on in the Mediterranean."  </P></p>

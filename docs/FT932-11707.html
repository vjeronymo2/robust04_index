			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BPCC considers market flotation BPCC, Britain's largest commercial printing company, is likely to go for a Stock Exchange flotation either late this year or early next. The company, formally owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell but sold when he pulled out of printing, has started work on the 'beauty parade' to choose financial advisers for the flotation. 'I'm not saying we are floating in October but we have started the process,' Mr John Holloran, BPCC's chief executive, said yesterday. The company, which prints nine of the top ten magazines in the UK from the Radio Times to Woman's Own, left the Maxwell empire in January 1989 in a Pounds 235m management buy-out. The inspiration for the possible flotation has come from the company's new chairman, Mr Brian Garraway, who retired recently as deputy chairman of BAT. Timing would depend on market conditions as the printing industry starts to pull out of recession. Mr Holloran said that if the company decided to go ahead with a float 'the earliest would be towards the end of this year and it could roll into next year.' Last year BPCC had a turnover of Pounds 289m with an operating profit of Pounds 19.5m. After interest charges of Pounds 26m the company made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5m. Since the buy-out the BPCC chief executive says Pounds 94m has been invested in re-equipping printing plants and as a result a number of contracts lost to continental European printers have been regained.</p>

The Reforms Must Be Started All  Over Again"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   Why, actually, is there the widespread opinion that  democracy  failed in the December elections? There is no doubt that the  results of the elections were unexpected and many people were  simply shocked. It is also true that we are still a long way  from true democracy and recognized political pluralism. But even  under these, to put it mildly, extraordinary conditions, after  the bloody crisis in October and two months of actual  authoritarianism, democracy immediately produced its results as  soon as the valve of the election points was opened up for it.    These results come from the working of a feedback mechanism  between the people and the state leaders. This is one of the  fundamental and indispensable functions of democracy and it is  manifested most distinctly through general elections.    Here again we should not console ourselves with illusions.  The loss by the government party, Russia's Choice (whose  presumptuous name now sounds rather amusing), and the immense  shortage of democratic and centrist blocs along with the solid  success of the nationalists and communists cannot be explained  away by random or attendant factors.    Essentially the Russian people gave the strictest warning to  the ruling circles that they must not continue to rule in this  way. The social organism is sending a strong and painful signal  to the effect that it is seriously ill and the course of  treatment of the past two years has not brought improvement but  has severely exacerbated the disease. But this pain itself is  both dangerous and salutary at the same time.    It is dangerous because if the previous policy is continued  the pain will increase and ultimately destroy the organism; it  will cause irreversible degeneration and then death. It is  salutary because if the signal is taken seriously and the course  of treatment is correctly altered there will be every  possibility of averting tragedy. In the situation that has  developed, both a negligent attitude toward the results of the  elections and gloomy fatalism or panic are equally destructive.    And it is not that "the people are always right"--history  provides many examples of nationwide self-destruction, including  through fascism, imperialism, and militarism. It is simply that  the people are what they are and any program of reform must be  adapted to this particular country with all of its specific  features. The reverse will not work: the people cannot be  selected to fit the program. No theoretically ideal reform is  worth its salt if it works for distant England or even nearby  Poland but is rejected by Russia and opens up access to power  for extremists. Nobody except the people themselves can carry  out a reform in Russia, and if an immense and ever increasing  part of the society lets the ship of reform pass them by,  ultimately it will be overturned and everything will sink to the  bottom: advanced and backward, right and wrong.    The main truth of the current moment is that the majority  who  voted for Zhirinovskiy are not so stupid and naive as to believe  his easy promises and give themselves over to cheap demagogy.  They voted that way out of a feeling of protest against what is  happening in the country and also because they did not see any  clear and attractive alternative. Herein also lies the key to  the solution to the problem, the path to the rescue of the  democratic reforms.    In his speech on 22 December President Yeltsin noted that  the  elections to the Duma showed that the administration is "falling  short of its task." I am afraid that the president was being too  kind to himself and his subordinates. In the current situation  this is very alarming. We have had enough of protecting the  president from criticism, from truthful information about the  real state of affairs, from nondepartmental assessments of the  prospects for economic and social development, from what people  are saying about him and his government. To offend and anger the  president is less dangerous now than to indulge the complacency  which has already manifested itself so fatally during the  election campaign.    The bitter truth is that the preceding state of the reforms  was a failure, and cosmetic patching up, personnel reshuffling,  and administrative leapfrog will not rectify the situation. We  must no longer speak about "continuing the course of the  reforms" but about radically revising both the methods of  development of the policy and the policy itself.    Over a period of two years industry has declined by 40  percent, and more in consumer goods production than in defense  and heavy industry. Actual consumption decreased by 40-60  percent. Some 30 percent of the population ended up on the brink  of disaster. The structure of the economy changed even more in  the "Soviet" direction--in favor of the extraction branches. The  same thing pertains to exports. The national currency is  "working" only in the sense of its being exchanged for freely  convertible currency, and nobody uses it for savings or  investments.    Just an enumeration of the various aspects of the  unprecedented collapse, degeneration, and uncontrolled behavior  that have appeared in all areas of our life would take up too  much space, and quite enough has been written and said about  this. It is important not to console ourselves with illusions,  as though these are temporary difficulties and it is impossible  to carry out such great transformations without them. The  previous policy has completely exhausted itself and we are left  with a delicate balance between hyperinflation and  hyperunemployment, and its continuation will ultimately lead to  both of the above at the same time.    I will not resort to the assessments of nongovernmental  economists such as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Nikolay Petrakov, Oleg  Bogomolov, or Stanislav Shatalin--they too are sufficiently well  known. I will turn to the statements of Yegor Gaydar, who even  after the elections stated once again that the government's main  goal is to put an end to inflation through a balanced budget so  as to provide for savings and investments and thus bring about  economic growth. And it was literally right at this point that  he admitted that demonopolization and privatization were not  working and it was not without irony that he called for everyone  who has solutions to these problems to support the government.    How can that be? After all, without demonopolization and  real  privatization the mechanism for investments, competition, and  economic growth will never begin to work. To find the practical  solutions the first deputy prime minister is asking for would  indeed be extremely difficult. But without them how can we count  on any economic growth (except in the sphere of trade and  speculation) even with decontrolled prices? After all, now 87  percent of Russian enterprises either belong to the state or  controlling blocks of shares in them are in the hands of  bureaucrats.    The mechanism for self-perpetuating inflation is implanted  in  the very basis of the "liberalized" Soviet economy, which has  obtained as a result of a two-year attraction to monetarism. It  was revealed by an adviser and advocate of the government  program, Yevgeniy Yasin: If we produce money--prices will  increase because there will be more money; if we do not produce  money--prices will increase because production will decline and  there will be fewer goods.    If there is no solution to the key problems of  demonopolization and privatization so far, we must search for  them with redoubled energy and for the time being abandon all  hope of a deficit-free budget and "financial stabilization."  Free prices and full store shelves that are accessible to the  minority, exchanges, commercials, vouchers, and shares--all  these are merely the wrappings, an imitation of a market economy  without the internal motive mechanisms. It will never work just  as the Papuan plane will not fly (after the war natives of Papua  went out into the meadows and began to build a facsimile of an  aircraft out of branches in the hope that the kindly Americans  would fly to them again and bring them cigarettes and chocolate).    If, having gone through the cycles of the fight against  inflation, we turn the financial screws even tighter, abolish  subsidies, and no longer provide wages and cut state social  programs (as Boris Fedorov suggests) the economy will simply  grind to a halt and tens of millions of people will be left  without a means of existence. Then who will handle the  accumulations? And what will they invest in even if there is  zero inflation? And what kind of political stability can one  hope for by 1996 with this kind of situation?    After all, ultimately a market economy is not a goal in  itself. Democracy is impossible without it, but a market economy  in and of itself by no means guarantees democracy and progress.  Both Bangladesh and Somalia have market economies too, but they  have neither democracy nor prosperity. Nor should one forget  that Hitler's Germany was based on a market economy and it lived  in harmony with concentration camps, Gestapo terror, and an  all-out suicidal war. The price and costs of reform are not as  important as the final goal--70 years on a path to a "bright  future" should have taught everyone this.    What we need now is not switching of offices but the  creation  under the president of a broad independent committee of leading  experts so as, in the first place, to clarify on the basis of  complete information the real state of affairs resulting from  these two years of reformism and to tell the whole truth,  regardless of how bitter it may be. And, in the second place, to  suggest ways of getting out of the crisis irrespective of dogma  and the personal affiliations of officials, tailoring them to  the objective conditions of the Russian economy and  sociopolitical situation. This path must be followed based on  the broadest possible coalition of all democratic forces of the  society and above all the parliamentary factions.    In this connection we may speak about the unity of  democratic  forces. Anatoliy Chubays and many Russia's Choicers after him  hastened to lay the blame for the results of the elections on  other democratic blocs which supposedly fragmented the reformer  front. But that is nothing but an attempt to shift the blame. If  all these parties were to form a bloc with Russia's Choice they  would have simply divided up among themselves the same  electorate that voted for Choice. And their own followers either  would not have participated in the elections at all or some of  them would have voted for Communists, increasing their  representation in parliament even more.    The main mistake of the democrats who did not belong to  Russia's Choice was that they were unable to join together and  were unable to provide a democratic alternative to the course of  the government and Russia's Choice that was clear-cut and  attractive to everyone who was not against reforms and democracy  in principle but would not accept what had been done in the  country during the past two years. If this had happened the  democratic opposition would have had many more positions, and  the Communists and nationalists would have had fewer.    Extensive unification of democratic forces, and above all in  parliament, is more necessary now than ever before. But not on  the basis of collective suicide, automatically following Gaydar  down a blind alley, but on the basis of a radical revision of  it. And it would be desirable, of course, together with  Choice..., the government and the president, if they were to  draw the correct conclusions in the December elections.    The question of the new constitution is closely linked to  this. Specifically, it would be a great mistake to rely, as  Vladimir Shumeyko and certain other figures close to the  president are now suggesting, on the authority of the executive  power enlarged in the constitution and the curtailed rights of  parliament.    The main problem is that the Basic Law appeared on earth  with  grave inherent flaws. They were brought about by the secrecy of  its development, the open pressure of free discussion, and the  relaxed procedure for adoption, which allowed the constitution  to pass with the support of only a few more than one-fourth of  the voters.    An easy victory does not cost much, and the objective  achieved at this price may quite well turn out to be illusory. A  constitution that has not undergone the difficult test of the  broadest public discussion, which does not fully reflect the  balance of forces and the consensus of the main political forces  in the country, which has not received the endorsement of the  real majority of the voters--is not likely to really become the  basic law of life of our immense state. Either the constitution  will be transformed into an object of political confrontation  from the very beginning or it will be simply ignored by all  parties and will motivate them to search for nonconstitutional  forms of struggle.    With a continuation of the previous policy, even if there  are  partial adjustments, the sociopolitical balance of forces will  inexorably change in the direction against the president and  lead to his isolation, and no written prerogatives will help him  retain control of the situation. (Thus all of the extreme  provisions turned out to be ephemeral for Mikhail Gorbachev in  1991.) But with a radical change in policy and the formation of  a broad coalition in support of democracy and the new course of  the reforms the domination of the president and the executive  structures will be simply superfluous and excessively burdensome  for them since it would impede efficient division of labor and  responsibility among the branches of power.    Another extremely serious illusion is that conducting the  reforms requires maximum concentration of power in the president  and the executive organs. Proponents of "enlightened  authoritarianism"--from Andranik Migranyan to Valeriy  Novodvorskiy--are defending this idea especially actively now in  light of the results of the election and the adoption of the new  constitution. Well, we will have no problems with  authoritarianism, we are used to that. The only question is how  to ensure enlightenment.    Possibly during the times of Petr I, who adorns the emblem  of  Russia's Choice, there was no other way than to "write edicts  with the knout." Probably even in our day there is no other way  in a number of Asian countries. But for a nation that is  basically European such a path holds no promise. Political  oppression beats down the people's economic activity as well,  and for market reforms, as distinct from Petr's or Stalin's, it  is above all necessary to have lively participation,  enterprisingness, self-expression, and self-respect of the  largest possible proportion of the population. The state must  merely direct them into a civilized, legal channel.    Hopes placed in the personal qualities of Boris Yeltsin, who  will not abuse power, are completely naive, and not simply  because man is mortal and his character can deteriorate, as the  president himself recently admitted in an exchange with Eldar  Ryazanov. The problem is much deeper. Authoritarianism gives the  leader only the illusion of a free hand. But in fact by  releasing him from restrictions imposed by the parliament, the  courts, the press, and public opinion, at the same time it makes  him a slave to the bureaucratic complex and a victim of intrigue  and bickering among favorites for positions closer to the  throne. They are the ones who stand to gain from  authoritarianism, and not the leader-reformer.    As distinct from democratic freedoms and a system of checks  and balances, a bureaucracy works unimpeded to refine the art of  selecting information. It skillfully leads the leader to the  decisions it needs, interprets their practical implications  according to its own will, and does not allow the possibility of  monitoring execution or obtaining an objective assessment of the  results. An example of this--the long-awaited edict on the  land--has already been provided during the short period of the  presidential monopoly. They hastened to adopt it before the  legislators could get in their way and it immediately turned  into its opposite, strengthening even more the rural  nomenklatura's power and possibilities of getting rich.    True freedom--within the framework of constitutional  authority, of course--is provided to the leader only by a  democratic environment that presents alternative sources of  information and the possibility, in conjunction with the  legislative and judicial powers, of controlling the bureaucracy.  But this kind of system will not tolerate arbitrariness on the  part of the president and will force him to engage in constant  political work to ensure parliamentary support for his policy,  and it will place high demands on the reputation of his  subordinates to preserve the reputation of the entire  administration.    It is understandable that democracy does not work according  to the ideal plan anywhere. It certainly does not provide a  guarantee against mistakes, and sometimes serious ones. The  point is this: the absence of democracy, regardless of the  personality of the leaders, guarantees mistakes and the  impossibility of correcting them promptly and, ultimately, the  failure of the policy and the state. This pertains fully to the  current Russian reforms as well.    In an authoritarian system the leader will very soon be  forced to serve the interests of the nomenklatura and above all  its power structures. Otherwise they will simply remove him or  make him ineffective. Both Khrushchev and Gorbachev learned this  through experience. On this plane, the fact that the Third Army,  in spite of an order to vote for Choice..., voted for the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] is as alarming as it is  explicable.    With respect to the army, President Yeltsin committed one of  the most serious of his mistakes, and it was of a dual nature.  On the one hand, in two years nothing was done to establish  effective political control over the army. On the other  hand--the military were drawn into internal political conflicts  against their will, which reached its culmination in October.  Both of these are dangerous individually, and together--even  more so. After the elimination of the army political organs the  armed forces were essentially left on their own. In order to  survive under the conditions that have developed in recent years  they needed radical reform. But no state department anywhere is  ever able to reform itself. The more so one like the military:  with its rigid hierarchy, deep traditions, enormous departmental  structure, and the existing economy. Without strong and  purposeful political leadership the reform of the army was  clearly doomed. It did not succeed, and as a result even the  concept of "military reform" disappeared from the recently  adopted military doctrine.    The army ended up in an extremely difficult condition: the  state did not have the funds to reduce and reorganize it and  there was no money to maintain it at its present size. Hence the  growing dissatisfaction among the military because of the  failure to solve numerous problems, of which the shortage of  housing, the failure to pay salaries, and the shortages in  recruitment are only the most critical.    Political control of the army cannot be based on good  relations between the president and the minister of defense.  Personal factors are too fragile and changeable a basis for such  a complex and important matter. Real political control over the  army is possible only under two conditions: the existence of a  civilian ministry of defense with its own apparatus and the  active role of parliament in all aspects of defense policy.  These are indispensable conditions for a democratic structure.  There are democratic countries that have no armed forces at all,  but there is no country with an army that does not have the two  aforementioned conditions for civilian control. And, conversely,  in all authoritarian regimes the military is in charge of the  ministry of defense and frequently combines this post with the  presidency. It is not without reason the Soviet leaders too  (Stalin, Brezhnev) loved to amuse themselves with high military  ranks and luxurious uniforms.    All this is no accident and it is certainly not a matter of  the intellectual and psychological peculiarities of the  military. The essence is that institutionally the most  intelligent and peace-loving military leader in the post of  minister of defense will always be a representative of the army  in the government. And the most narrow-minded and rigid civilian  person will always be a representative of the president in the  army and a proponent of his policy. The minister is also the  intermediary between the military and the parliament, which  raises difficult questions and checks on efficient expenditure  of allocations.    The new constitution and military doctrine have established  practically complete elimination of parliament from military  affairs. All control has legally been placed in the hands of the  president, but this is merely on paper. In fact he remains one  on one with a giant military establishment and himself is  dependent on it. This "feedback" is so great that the army is  drawn into internal political conflicts in an inadmissible way  and has actually been made the arbitrator in their resolution.    Indeed, during the October events the armed forces against  their will had to choose for themselves which president and  minister of defense to obey. And then they had to perform  functions that are not appropriate for the army, which dealt a  stronger blow to the prestige and moral condition of the army  than August 1991 did. Even worse is that these functions have  now been officially assigned to the army according to the new  military doctrine, as though we do not have enough internal  forces, specialized subdivisions, and OMON's [Special Purpose  Militia Detachments].    Voting for the LDPR is not only a sign of protest against  the  terrible disintegration in the armed forces. And it is not only  a response to Zhirinovskiy's military-patriotic advances. To an  enormous degree it is also an expression of an attitude toward  the October events, a strict warning to the head of state.    And no purges or punishments will help here. They will  alienate the military even more and place them in opposition to  the political leadership. We need an in-depth reinterpretation  of the policy of the Russian leadership in the military sphere  and a radical change in the mechanism for political control of  the army and the decisionmaking system. Regardless of what the  level and composition of the armed forces may be, the army must  be fully provided with everything necessary to carry out its  tasks, occupy a worthy position in society, be under effective  civilian control, and be completely removed from deciding issues  of internal politics.    Today everything is proceeding in precisely the opposite  direction. If things continue this way, the army will decide  that it can remove and install presidents. (And here Russia has  the great traditions of the Streltsy, the Preobrazhensk units,  and the Semenovites.) Relying on force is a double-edged sword  and it is far from being as obedient a weapon as it might seem.  The power game is a game in which democracy will always be  defeated. In this game President Yeltsin will find stronger and  more perfidious rivals, and they will not be linked to the  turbulent history of 1991-1993.    Democratic reforms in both the economy and politics may be  carried out only within the framework of a rule-of-law state, on  the basis of a balance of interests of all nonextremist groups  of the society. Force creates only the illusion of a rapid and  radical solution to problems. In fact force cannot solve a  single problem of democratic construction; it only exacerbates  problems and produces diametrically opposite results.</p>

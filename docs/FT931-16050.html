			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Torras files suit against top Kuwaitis GRUPO TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office which went into receivership last month, yesterday filed a criminal lawsuit against seven former senior executives alleging that they had committed financial irregularities which had cost the company millions of dollars. They include Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the KIO's former chairman and a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait. The lawsuit, which included allegations of fraud, tax evasion, falsifying public deeds and price manipulation, was brought before Spain's senior monetary court by lawyers acting on behalf of the executive team that took over management of the KIO and of Torras midway through last year. The potential litigation - the monetary court now has to rule on whether to investigate the charges - suggests that an explosive process of claims and counter-claims may take place which could damage the KIO's reputation in the financial world. At the heart of the Torras dispute is the allegation by its new management that company profits were routed towards external offshore accounts held by members of Kuwait's ruling establishment. When Torras applied for protection from its creditors last month citing losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) it claimed that an 'apparent misappropriation' of funds had taken place in addition to 'mismanagement on a massive scale'. Yesterday's statement alleged that irregularities commited by Sheikh Fahad, by the KIO's former general manager Mr Fouad Jaffar, by Torras' former deputy chairman Mr Javier de la Rosa and by four other former senior Torras managers had caused 'fraudulent losses for the company well in excess of Pta100bn'. Mr de la Rosa said he was 'delighted' that the lawsuit had been filed because 'we are now going to demonstrate the truth'. Claiming that 'Torras is not the important issue' and that its new management was acting 'like a bull in a china shop', Mr de la Rosa said he and his associates would file their own lawsuits against those who had brought charges against them. 'We are going to shed a lot of light on the KIO's dealings in London (the office's headquarters) and on the internal political situation in Kuwait,' Mr de la Rosa said. Meanwhile Ercros, the Torras-controlled chemical conglomerate which went into receivership last July, announced yesterday the closure of five of the 12 plants in its fertiliser division and the loss of 1,900 jobs in the division, half the total. The cuts form part of a salvage plan prior to the hoped for disposal of Ercros.</p>

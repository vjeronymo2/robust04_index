			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Medical spending to rise by 1.6% - Health A Pounds 1.6bn increase in health spending in England was announced yesterday by the chancellor, a 1.6 per cent rise in real terms. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the increase represented a clear commitment to health, in spite of a very tight budget. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the rise failed to take into account the additional costs of an ageing population and advances in medical science. The government also announced it wanted health authorities to make savings of 2.25 per cent this year, which would save Pounds 450m. Together with the increase in spending, it would mean the National Health Service could treat 4 per cent more patients, Mrs Bottomley said. One means of making the savings will be through local productivity pay bargaining. Pay settlements would have to be modest, she said. Mrs Bottomley said the Pounds 3bn drugs budget would continue to grow faster than the rate of inflation. However, efforts to restrict prescribing would continue. 'Doctors need to realise that when they sign a prescription, they are writing a cheque,' she said.</p>

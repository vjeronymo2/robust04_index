			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusuisse makes further cut in aluminium output ANOTHER CUT in German aluminium production was announced yesterday. Alusuisse-Lonza said output from its smelter at Essen would be reduced to only one-third of its 135,000 tonnes annual capacity. This followed an impassioned plea by the Federation of the German Aluminium Industry on Wednesday when it said more production cuts would be needed unless domestic power costs were reduced or there was a substantial fall in exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Mr Jochen Schirner, vice-president of the federation, complained that Germany had cut capacity by 25 per cent in the past two years since CIS exports began to surge. But the country's aluminium smelters were still making losses even though they used some of the most advanced technology in the world. Alusuisse, the Swiss producer, had previously cut output at Essen by one third in March last year. The smelter will now produce only 45,000 tonnes annually. Analysts suggested that this action would have little impact on prices and aluminium for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange closed yesterday down Dollars 2.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,171. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said the industry 'has been slow to respond to the low price environment under which it has laboured for so long'. CIS exports to the west could have been as high as 1.2m tonnes last year (including 400,000 tonnes via unofficial routes) yet, according to the International Primary Aluminium Institute statistics, daily production averaged 41,600 tonnes in January only slightly down from 42,000 tonnes in December and up from 39,700 in January 1992. Europe's aluminium industry wants the European Commission to implement a quota system or introduce tariffs to reduce substantially imports from the CIS but the German government is against this proposal.</p>

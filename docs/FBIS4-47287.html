The  Novomoskva refractories plant is using x-ray analysis to detect  inclusions, variation in wall thickness, graphite distribution,  and internal defects such as cracks and splits in the refractory  components of continuous casting machines. Radio-frequency  inspection methods are being used primarily to measure porosity.  Various acoustical methods, such as the shadow and echo methods  and acoustical emission, are being used extensively by U.S.,  Japanese, and European firms for specific applications. For  example, acoustical emission is being successfully used to  assess deformation and destruction mechanisms and heat  resistance. The echo method is used to detect internal cracks  and cavities and to measure wear and the useful thickness of  linings in thermal processing equipment. Ultrasound is being  used in conjunction with physical measurements to measure the  strength of a refractory material or product. Acoustical  resonance is being used at the Vnukov refractories plant to  measure density, porosity, and the mechanical strength of the  plate linings of slide valves. These methods are highly accurate  and reproducible and enable refractories producers to effect  substantial savings in quality control costs while enabling  end-users to avoid costly equipment failures.

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATORS SEARCH GERMAN FIRMS' OFFICES  </P> <P> Prosecutors today searched the offices of 14 West German companies suspected of  helping Libya build a chemical weapons factory, authorities said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Offenburg, Hubertus Voegele, said  one of the firms searched was Imhausen-Chemie in Lahr, which is suspected of  playing a major role in building and equipping the Libyan plant.  </P> <P> Voegele said the searches were conducted "on suspicion that export laws had  been violated." He declined to name the other firms whose offices were  searched, but added they were located throughout the country.  </P> <P> The U.S. government says the plant at Rabta, 60 miles south of the Libyan  capital of Tripoli, was built to make poison gas. Libya says it will  manufacture medicine.  </P> <P> Bonn officials initially dismissed the U.S. allegations, but have now launched  a criminal investigation to determine if Imhausen-Chemie and other companies  illegally shipped arms, hazardous substances or components that can be used to  produce them.  </P> <P> The affair has deeply embarrassed the West German government.  </P></p>

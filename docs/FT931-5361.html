			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Dispute at South African talks MULTI-PARTY negotiations resumed yesterday in South Africa after a nine-month hiatus, but were immediately bogged down in disagreements between the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the government and the African National Congress, writes Patti Waldmeir from Johannesburg. Some 26 organisations gathered at a hall outside Johannesburg for the conference, with participants ranged from the pro-apartheid white Conservative party (CP) through traditional tribal leaders to the black radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). There was an immediate dispute over who should chair the talks, and over where delegates should be seated. Inkatha, the mainly Zulu party, also signalled problems ahead, saying it rejected an agreement between the ANC and government calling for power-sharing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 June at a news conference held in Lvov,  Oleksandr Yemets, minister for issues of nationalities and  immigration (who is running in the Supreme Council elections in  Lvov's Halytskyy constituency supported by the "Nova Khvylya"  coalition) addressed the issue of presidential elections.    Oleksandr Yemets said that candidates whom he would like to  support (for example, Lanovyy), unfortunately, do not have any  chances. The only possible competition is the one between  Kravchuk and Kuchma. The nationalities minister stated that he  is ready to support any candidate capable of countering Kuchma.  "Although I have a great number of critical remarks regarding  Kravchuk, the current situation is that no one but he can do  that," Oleksandr Yemets said.    The same position was voiced last week by People's Deputy  Taras Stetskiv, one of the "Nova Khvylya" leaders, in an  interview with VYSOKYY ZAMOK.</p>

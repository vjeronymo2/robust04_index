The Foreign Minister, the sources said, emphasized in his  letter that any strikes, even limited ones, are fraught with  heavy consequences. He is sure this will aggravate the  situation on all Bosnian fronts and will even jeopardize the UN  relief operation, because it will make assistance meaningless.    Kozyrev believes the decision to use air power in Bosnia is  solely the prerogative of the UN Secretary-General in  consultation with the UN Security Council.    Speaking about the opening of the airport in Tuzla, Kozyrev  said that Moscow was sure that only a political solution could  be effective.    The main aim of Russia is the same, said Kozyrev. It is the  earliest political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this  plan we fully rely on common sense and the desire of all sides  to solve the problem politically.</p>

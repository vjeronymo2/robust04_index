Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was  speaking on the 8 o'clock television news. He answered Demetrio  Volcic's "political" questions and relaunched our country's  image. And yet, it is difficult, if not impossible, to  understand what is going badly: no-confidence motions,  presented in order to obtain confidence; calls for confidence  which serve to dissolve parliament; incredible discussions on  the date of the elections, even before the mechanisms for  setting the necessary procedures in motion have been found.  Meetings of senior parliamentarians which go on for hours.  Constitutionalists and political brains attempting to stage a  debate, which first of all will take place, then perhaps will  not, and finally will, but beginning in the afternoon. The  prime minister who, it seemed, was to open this phantom debate,  giving a speech, the lines of which were already traced out.  The prime minister who decided -- at the "institutional"  experts' suggestion -- to take his time and to let [Radical  leader] Marco Pannella open the D-day.    What is going on in the Roman power palaces? And what do the  head of state and the head of government have in mind? What  lies behind the present crazy institutional mayonnaise?  Ciampi's plan is at the same time simple, and extremely  difficult to implement. Nor is it a secret plan, far from it.  He himself unveiled it publicly at Montecitorio [parliament] on  21 September last year: "Once we have completed our principal  missions, we will be ready to hand over. But citizens and  economic players, both Italian and foreign, need to be certain  that this passage will be from a stable government to an even  more solid one. In any event we will not let ourselves be  overcome by nervous impatience, we will not give way to artful  accelerations, nor will we slow down the government's action. We  will continue to work with the best of our strength, in the  fullness of the tasks and powers which the Constitution  provides, and we will not shirk, by postponement, from  confronting all the problems which will have to be resolved in  the interest of the country."    A government at the height of its powers. A dissolved  parliament, at least two-thirds of which had to be renewed. A  civil, correct election campaign, in which the government would  refrain from taking any position, continuing its work of  rebirth. Will [President] Scalfaro and Ciampi complete their  course successfully? At Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's  office], they explain that it is absolutely "essential to avoid  a period of instability in Italy. We are under observation on  the world stage; one false move and, bang, they will close the  door in our face, interest rates will rise on our huge debts,  followed by new costs and new taxes. Nor should be forgotten  that Ciampi's government is the first one since 1978 to have  succeeded in getting the budget approved by a large majority."  The ungovernability spiral, according to Ciampi's men, will not  stop for one minute after the vote. The next elections, all the  experts forecast, will be followed by a difficult phase in which  it will not be at all easy to put together a new majority. Nor  will the birth of the first government of the 11th legislative  period be self-evident. But as soon as this is possible, they  assure us, Carlo Azeglio will relinquish the chair of office.    Could it be that he has grown fond of the job of prime  minister? On the plane bringing him back from Rome after the  three-day mission to Brussels, the head of government replied:  "When I was governor of the Bank of Italy, I used to refer to  my role with the words `governor in office.' And when, during  the preparations for the bank's centenary celebrations, I stated  that these would be carried out by the governor in office, my  colleagues thought that I was joking. And yet it was indeed my  successor who had the task of celebrating the bank's century.  And in the same way, today I am the `prime minister in office.'  There is a continuity about institutions and one has to  approach the job with the same commitment as if one were to  remain there all one's life, but be ready to leave at any time."  He then went on to conclude: "We are all temporary workers,  but we must not live in a temporary fashion."</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TICKET SALES SLOW FOR FIRST COPPER BOWL  </P> <P> The newest postseason college football game, the Copper Bowl, is having trouble  drawing attention and ticket buyers.  </P> <P> The Copper Bowl debuts today (5 p.m. PST) with North Carolina State playing  Arizona. But the game between the 7-4 teams may be played before a half-empty  house.  </P> <P> Only 30,000 tickets had been sold as of Saturday morning, though Arizona  Stadium seats 57,000, and officials said with TBS' broadcast of the game being  aired in Tucson and the chance of cold, rainy weather, even a turnout of 35,000  "would be hopeful."  </P> <P> North Carolina State lost its last three games.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Asian chemical plant for Eastman Kodak EASTMAN Chemicals International (ECI), a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak, the US maker of consumer photographic products, plans to build a chemicals manufacturing plant in Asia by 1995 and invest in several more, Reuter reports from Singapore. Mr Ernest Deavenport, ECI president, told a conference in Singapore that his company had so far announced a polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) plant and this was the first of a planned series of investments in the Asia Pacific region. 'Our vision for the Asia Pacific region is to have a very substantial sales presence here and as a result of that have a very substantial manufacturing presence,' he said. 'For every dollar of sales, we have a dollar of investment, and we plan to grow our sales in this region from 10 to 15 per cent of a total of USDollars 4bn, to the neighbourhood of 20 per cent or more of a much larger company,' he said. ECI's first Asia plant would require between USDollars 40m and USDollars 100m in investment, de-pending on projected annual PETG output of 30,000 to 80,000 tonnes. The size and location of the plant would be decided by August. Possible locations included Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton falls quiet about minivans - The campaign hit that was always out of tune AS presidential candidate, Bill Clinton took a stand on minivans, attacking the 'Dollars 300m trade break' given to Japan in 1989, when the Bush administration declined to raise the US tariffs on minivans to 25 per cent. Nowadays, Mr Clinton does not talk about minivans. The minivan controversy is not likely to appear on the list of American trade priorities, which is due to be released this week by the Office of the US Trade Representative. Nor did it receive a mention when the president gave what was billed as a definitive address on trade and international economics in Washington last Friday. In fact, Mr Clinton could be in the process of backpedalling from his hawkish rhetoric on this particular issue. During the campaign, Mr Clinton - intentionally or not - seemed badly briefed on minivans. He seemed convinced that the Bush administration had succumbed to lavishly-financed Japanese lobbyists and reclassified multi-purpose vehicles as cars, when they had always been trucks, in order to give the imports a lower tariff rate. Although the reverse was closer to the truth, Candidate Clinton's tune played like a symphony in Detroit. The US tariff on light trucks has been 25 per cent since 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson raised the duty in the infamous 'chicken war' to punish West Germany. Later, when minivans and sport-utility vehicles became popular, it was debatable whether, in fact, they should be classified as cars - with a 2.5 per cent tariff - or trucks. After much controversy, the US Treasury Department in 1989 ruled that two-door multipurpose vehicles generally would be classified as trucks, because their principal purpose could be described as the transport of goods. Four-door multipurpose vehicles were classified as cars - as they had been previously - because they were clearly designed for transporting people, the Treasury said. Vans with side windows and rear seats to accommodate at least two people were deemed cars. This decision raised - rather than lowered - the number of multipurpose vehicles which were classified as trucks, the Treasury said at the time. In 1989, about 239,000 minivans and sport utility vehicles entered the US. About 44 per cent were classified as trucks and 56 per cent as cars. Under the new definitions, 62 per cent would have been classified as trucks and 39 per cent as cars. As a result of the ruling, US manufacturers have been able to retain such a dominant share of the market, that the US International Trade Commission found itself unable to sustain a finding of 'injury' last year, when the domestic producers tried to raise the tariffs through a dumping action. Having failed in that quarter, Detroit tried to secure the entire market through legislation. A bill to raise the tariff made it through the House, but was stopped by the Senate Finance Committee, headed by the then Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Mr Bentsen is now the Treasury secretary, in charge of the Customs Service, which makes him a key player on this issue, as well as many others. The Treasury is said to have produced four options: doing nothing; raising all the tariffs for minivans and sports utility vehicles to 25 per cent; establishing a new tariff classification; or sending the whole matter back to Congress. 'It has been kicked down to working group level,' said one closely connected lobbyist, who called the controversy 'a real tar baby'. She continued: 'The administration has to decide if this is the issue they want to go to the mat on.' What happens next could depend on who gets the recommendation. Will it be the Bill Clinton who apparently found the minivan issue useful during the campaign to blunt criticism for his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement? Will it be the president who has railed against Airbus subsidies while supporting research and development subsidies for US manufacturing? Will it be the scrapper who promised not to 'roll over and play dead' for the Europeans? Or will it be the president who vows not to pursue 'a policy of blame but one of responsibility'? The one who sees as 'the truth of our age' that 'open and competitive commerce will enrich as a nation'. Bill Clinton is a pragmatist, who recognises the irreversibility of the global economy and insists that open US markets be met by 'comparable' market openings abroad. It is the pragmatist who last Friday complained that the Uruguay Round 'has dragged on entirely too long'. It is probably the pragmatist who will recognise that a higher tariff on minivan imports will raise new suspicions that the US is really set to pursue a divisive and protectionist course.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (8): Dilemmas amid the glitter / Town profile of Blackpool BLACKPOOL, Britain's largest, brashest and, in terms of money spent, most successful resort, is an overwhelming experience no matter what time of year you visit. At 10 o'clock in the morning on a grey, drizzly day in late September the ornate ballroom in the Blackpool Tower is full of pensioners waltzing to a thundering organ. The streets are full of shoppers. The seven live shows are already taking bookings. By lunchtime it is difficult to get near the bar of Yates wine bar (champagne on draught is its proud boast). At a time when most British seaside resorts are pulling down the shutters for the end of the season, Blackpool remains in full swing. The famous illuminations, which remain switched on into November, also ensure that Blackpool has a longer season than other English resorts. But beneath the glitter of the lights along the Golden Mile, Blackpool has its problems. One cloud hanging over town is the future of the British Aerospace works at nearby Warton, where some 7,200 are employed, from various parts of Lancashire, including Blackpool. If the European Fighter Aircraft does not proceed, there will be severe job losses compounding an already serious unemployment situation. Tourism is Blackpool's most important industry. Some 15,000 people are directly or indirectly associated with the trade or 25 per cent of the working population. (If retailing, distribution and catering in the broad sense of the term are included, then the figure is much higher). About 80 per cent of the working population is involved in service industries, compared with a national average of under 70 per cent. Only 15 per cent is involved in manufacturing compared with 24 per cent nationally. Tourism is, however, a seasonal business which is slanted towards female employment. Even if Blackpool has a longer season than most resorts, unemployment is still high - more than 10 per cent overall, and in some inner city wards unemployment among young males is more than 20 per cent. Tourism is also a poorly paid industry. Mr Ivan Taylor, the leader of the Labour party-controlled city council, estimates that incomes in Blackpool are 35 per cent lower than average incomes in the south-east. 'Blackpool has survived the change from old style long-stay family holidays very well,' Mr Taylor says. 'We have managed to extend the season with conferences and the illuminations. We have constantly brought on new products, such as the Pleasure Beach. There continues to be new private investment. First Leisure, which owns the Tower is spending Pounds 13m over two years on refurbishment and upgrading. We have been able to keep the visitors rolling in.' But the very success of Blackpool is at the heart of the borough council's dilemma. 'We project the image of success in order to keep the visitors coming, but the heavy dependence on tourism means that the government in Whitehall does not see or accept that we have inner city problems as bad as anywhere in the north of England. We also have infrastructural problems.' Mr Taylor feels Blackpool should receive more help in diversifying its economy. 'On the so-called Z-score, an index drawn up by the Department of Social Security for inner city deprivation, Blackpool came in the bottom 20 per cent of towns in the north of England. But we are not even in the urban programme.' Not being in the government's programme for urban aid means that Blackpool cannot participate in City Challenge bids for urban renewal. Furthermore, because Blackpool no longer qualifies for British government assisted area status, the town receives no help from the European regional development fund (ERDF) towards infrastructure projects. Mr Taylor says: 'Our sea defences are in need of repair. Also we have the oldest electric tramway system in the country: together with the illuminations, this taxes our electricity system. We need new cabling. This would cost Pounds 6m. The borough council has not got this kind of money.'</p>

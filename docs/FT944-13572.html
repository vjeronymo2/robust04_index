			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Quality standard rigidity rapped The BS5750 quality assurance standard is unsuitable for the smallest companies, the Small Business Research Trust warned yesterday. In a report the group says the standard is too costly, rigid and formal for smaller companies which often rely on the 'hands-on approach' of owner-managers. There was no evidence that informal quality systems, based on the personal involvement of business owners and employees with detailed knowledge of customer requirements, were inferior to more formal systems such as BS5750 accreditation, the report says. The report is based on responses from more than 4,000 smaller companies and was sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry, the British Standards Institution and National Westminster Bank. It is one of the most comprehensive inquiries into the relevence to small businesses of a standard that the institution says was 'written by big business for big business'. The survey found that BS5750 - or BS EN ISO 9000, as it is now called after its European Union counterpart - was widely seen as a useful marketing tool. 'Users derived significant benefits, notably relating to marketing and competitive issues rather than internal operational efficiency', the report says. Mr Francis Chittenden of Manchester Business School's business development unit, co-author of the report, said it showed that BS5750 would be relevant to some small companies and not others.

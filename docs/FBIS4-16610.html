			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent 18 April, TASS -- Thousands of residents of  Tashkent spilled into the streets of the city to welcome Chinese  Prime Minister Li Peng who arrived in Uzbekistan on an official  visit on Monday.    At Tashkent's Airport Li Peng observed the guard of honour.  The national anthems of the two countries were played.    "I am glad that I am here, in this ancient and world-known  city of Tashkent," Li Peng said. "The visit by President Islam  Karimov of Uzbekistan to our country in 1992 opened a new page  in the history of friendly relations between our countries," he  continued.    The Chinese premier expressed the hope that "the documents  to  be signed during the visit will strengthen friendly ties and  elevate our economic cooperation to a new height."    Karimov stressed that Li Peng's visit is taking place at a  time when political, economic, trade and cultural ties between  the two countries are growing ever stronger. He expressed the  confidence that the visit will become a new step towards  strengthening relations between Uzbekistan and China. "Friendly  ties between our states date back to the time of the 'great silk  route,'" he said.    This is the first visit to Uzbekistan by the Chinese prime  minister.</p>

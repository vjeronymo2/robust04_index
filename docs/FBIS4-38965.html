			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- A session of the  parliament on 2 June examined a resolution "On the Ukrainian  president's proposal to the Supreme Council on postponement of  the election of the president of Ukraine, local councils, and  local council chairmen scheduled for 26 June 1994." The  resolution says that, taking into account the current  preparations for the elections, as well as the fact that  postponement of the election would affect social and economic  reforms, postponement of the election is deemed inexpedient.  The resolution instructs the Supreme Council Commission for  Legal Policy and Legal and Judicial Reform and the Commission  for State-building, Council Activities, and Self-government to  submit before 12 June proposals to the parliament regarding  draft laws regulating the powers of the president of Ukraine,  the government, and local authorities. [passage omitted]    Despite calls from deputies who wanted to make remarks on  the voting procedure, Oleksandr Tkachenko, first deputy Supreme  Council chairman (Oleksandr Moroz is informally reported on sick  leave), put the draft resolution to a vote, and 201 voted to  adopt it in principle.

The powers of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the 12th  term  are coming to an end early. Its deputies were elected in the  spring elections of 1990. These elections were a powerful  impulse which awoke the disappointed and indifferent people and  evoked their natural inclination for freedom, democracy, and  justice. Everyone wanted changes in society because they  understood well that they could go on living lies and deceit no  longer. People went to polling stations with these thoughts.  There were a few names on the ballots, and for the first time in  the 70 years of Soviet power the voters got an opportunity to  choose and thus influence the development of their country.    The voters attached hopes for changes in society and for a  better future for Ukraine primarily on the Supreme Council.  Unfortunately, under the conditions of Communist Party diktat  and the muffling of even the smallest manifestations of  democracy, it was extremely difficult for the patriots of  Ukraine-democrats to become deputies. For this reason,  representatives of the Communist Party nomenklatura--secretaries  of oblast, city, and rayon committees, executive functionaries  of state organs, military commanders, kolkhoz chairmen, and "Red  directors"--gained a majority in the Supreme Council. Under the  leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Ukraine, they got together in the notorious "Group of 239" and  dictated their will to the Supreme Council and all of Ukraine.  In turn, on 6 June 1990 the democratic minority formed an  official opposition in the parliament of Ukraine--the People's  Council. It consisted of fewer than one-third of the total  number of deputies; however, it was precisely due to its  vigorous activities that we succeeded in ensuring live radio  broadcasts and TV coverage of all meetings of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine, which for the first time gave people of  Ukraine an opportunity to see and hear the free, truthful word  and alternative political views. It was precisely due to this  information that the people of the entire Ukraine were awakened.  What quite recently had appeared to many to be the unshaken and  mighty Communist Party machinery in the center and localities  began to yield one position after another.    From the first days of its activities, the People's Council  has stated unequivocally that it would fight for the acquisition  of complete political and economic independence for Ukraine. The  Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, the Law on the  Economic Independence of Ukraine, the Decree on Military Service  by Citizens of Ukraine in the Territory of the Republic, the  Decree on the Introduction of Ukrainian Time in the Territory of  Ukraine, and the Supreme Council's confirmation of historical  national sacred notions of Ukraine--the blue-and-yellow flag,  the trident coat of arms, and the anthem "Ukraine Has Not  Perished Yet"--as state symbols became the greatest achievements  of the People's Council. Of course, the Act of Proclamation of  the Independence of Ukraine, dated 24 August 1991, which was  ratified by the people at a referendum on 1 December 1991, was  the foremost accomplishment of the People's Council. This was a  truly triumphant victory. There has been no case in history in  any country in which the opposition, in the minority, won a  victory in the parliament. We won it in a peaceful manner  because we drew on support from the entire nation. However, this  victory did not come out of nowhere--it was based on the great  self-sacrificing labor and self-denying struggle of past  generations for the freedom of Ukraine. We are proud of being  directly involved in this sharp historical turn in the fate of  our people.    Despite considerable obstacles, we have taken resolute steps  along the path toward freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, we  do not have justice yet because we have not had the opportunity  to qualitatively change the authorities in Ukraine, beginning  with the Supreme Council and down to the rural councils.  Economic reforms cannot be implemented by the forces of the old  apparatchiks. These reforms should be preceded by radical  political changes, primarily in all branches of state power.  Their implementation may only be ensured by the people in new  elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the local organs  of state government and self-government.    The People's Council sets for itself three main tasks:    FIRST. Acquisition of state independence by Ukraine.    SECOND. Removal of the Communist Party from power and the  creation of a democratic society.    THIRD. Creation of an efficient market economy.    The first two tasks have been accomplished in the main. The  third task is much harder to accomplish. It is precisely a  market economy that should ensure an increase in production and  welfare worthy of the people. Unfortunately, the life of the  people has become harder. The reasons for this are many. First,  the party-nomenklatura majority in the Supreme Council of  Ukraine has continuously blocked the adoption of economic laws  which would reform the socialist economy, make it multisectoral,  and introduce the free development and greater pace of  production in urban and rural areas on the principle of equal  rights for various forms of ownership. Second, it so happens  that the old nomenklatura, retaining command posts in the  economy, has disposed of state property as if it were theirs,  has plundered Ukraine, and has profiteered from the wretched  condition of the people. Third, a situation has developed in  which the monopoly of state property prevails in Ukraine while a  strong executive authority is absent. This has brought about an  unprecedented rampage of organized crime and corruption, which  has primarily affected the power structure. Corruption and  organized crime, which have brought about the plundering of the  national wealth, pose the main threat to Ukraine and its  independence.    The democrats are not to blame for the massive rampage of  the  mafia, the decline in the standard of living of the bulk of the  population, the slump in production, and other adversity. After  all, the democrats are not the ones to control the economy and  make the policy of the state because there are very few of them  in the Supreme Council; there are almost none in the Cabinet of  Ministers, and they have not been heard from in a majority of  oblasts, rayons, and cities. From the Supreme Council, the  administration of the president, and the Cabinet of Ministers to  the rural councils--everywhere, with minor exceptions, the same  people who governed 10 or 20 years ago are still governing.  Thus, the assertion that power in Ukraine is in the hands of the  democrats is not true. It is exactly the other way around. The  widespread myth that the democrats are to blame for everything  has been created by that same party nomenklatura which remains  in power, takes advantage of power for personal enrichment, and  behaves in keeping with the logic of a robber who has himself  stolen but is the first one to yell "Stop, thief!" at the  marketplace.    Therefore, the removal of yesterday's people from power is  the main task in Ukraine. We should begin with the Supreme  Council, the new composition of which is to be elected soon.  People should be elected as deputies on account of their  political positions, activities in building the state,  dedication to the principles and ideals of an independent  Ukraine--individuals who were together with the people in this  struggle, those who advocated and still advocate free,  democratic development, welfare, and an affluent life for the  people. What the Supreme Council will be tomorrow depends on who  the people elect now--such will be the laws the Supreme Council  will adopt and the government that will lead Ukraine. Therefore,  look carefully at who and which forces support a candidate and  what political platform he subscribes to. Do not make the wrong  choice, because a mistake will cost both you and Ukraine dearly.  Think well and remember the wise expression: "Each nation has  the rulers it deserves." So, do everything to ensure that the  deputies elected by you will care first of all for the people  and for Ukraine. Remember that in the preelection struggle two  main forces will clash first of all: those that are in favor of  Ukrainian statehood, those that rely on the will and strength of  their own people and want to live as masters of their native  land and transform Ukraine into a strong and rich country, and  those who are against Ukrainian statehood, for whom the people  of Ukraine are merely a source for their personal enrichment.    Being a member of the Ukrainian parliament is a lofty and  honorable position. However, it is necessary to view it is a  means to serve the Motherland, which provides an opportunity to  be of greater use and do more good for your people, rather than  as an end in and of itself.    People should not come to power who are burdened by the sins  of the past or the thirst for profits, but rather highly  educated people with great integrity, wise and patriotically  minded politicians for whom concern for the Motherland and the  people constitutes the main goal.    The people are the only source of power. Your fate and the  future of Ukraine are in your hands, citizens!</p>

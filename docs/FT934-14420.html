			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead ON MONDAY Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components and equipment manufacturer and distributor, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 15.4m before exceptionals in the year-ago period. The results will be the first for Howard Poulson, Farnell's new chief executive, who arrived in August from Volex. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports third-quarter profits on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 300m, up 12 per cent on the Pounds 267m achieved during the same period last year. The results will be affected by the sale of consumer products to Sara Lee and restructuring charges. Underlying pharmaceuticals growth is expected at between 8 and 10 per cent, but analysts will be looking carefully at the impact of reforms in Italy and Germany. Also on Tuesday, Wolseley, the heating and plumbing distributor, is expected to report preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m for the year to end July 31, up from Pounds 91.3m last year - a figure which surprised analysts who had been expecting Pounds 70m. Smiths Industries, the aerospace and specialist engineering group, is likely on Wednesday to report annual profits only marginally increased from last year's total of Pounds 102m. Once again, delays in defence procurement and reductions in civilian aircraft programmes will be partly offset by the strength of the group's medical products side. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is expected on Thursday to report a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 52m to about Pounds 48 in the year to August. Stephen Walls replaced the group's founder, Tony Millar, as chairman last year after a traumatic year for the former stock market favourite. Walls will be quizzed about the state of the fresh produce market in Europe and the US, as well as any plans for disposals or acquisitions.</p>

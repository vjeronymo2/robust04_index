			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The strength of the dollar at the end of last week caused the D-Mark to slip behind the Belgian franc to fourth position in the system's grid position. All currencies, except the Irish punt, gained ground against the Spanish peseta, the weakest member. Page 31 The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the system. Most of the currencies are permitted to fluctuate within 15 per cent of agreed central rates against the other members of the mechanism. The exceptions are the D-Mark and the guilder which move in a 2.25 per cent band.</p>

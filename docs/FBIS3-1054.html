Guy] </F>   [Text] Umtata March 17 SAPA -- Former Transkei Justice  Minister Tsepo Letlaka accepted his position as Eastern Cape  premier designate for the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] at a  lunch in Umtata on Thursday [17 March]. "The Eastern Cape  region has a new problem of having the boundaries imposed by the  World Trade Centre process without consulting the people in the  region," he said.    "Consequently the region is still divided on whether it  should be divided into two -- Border/Kei and Eastern Cape."    He said it also remained a sensitive issue whether the East  Griqualand-Mount Currie-Umzimkulu area should be part of his  region or kwaZulu-Natal.</p>

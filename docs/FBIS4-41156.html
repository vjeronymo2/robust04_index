			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin left for Greece on Thursday morning. He is due to take  part in the meeting of the heads of state and government of the  member countries of the European Union which is to be held on  the island of Corfu. The Russian president is expected to sign  an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and  the European Union.    For the first time in the history of the European Union, a  Russian president will attend its summit, take part in its work  and sign an agreement which is designed to bring closer the  countries of the once-split European continent.    Boris Yeltsin will also be present at the state dinner which  Greek Prime-Minister Andreas Papandreou will give in honour of  the heads of state and government of the countries-members of  the European Union.    The signing of an agreement with the European Union does not  mean for Russia an automatic membership of this prestigious  club, Boris Yeltsin said at a press conference in the Kremlin  ahead of his trip to Corfu. But it will certainly mark the  first step made by the European Community since the fall of the  Iron Curtain towards the recognition of Russia as a full-fledged  partner in the political and economic spheres.    The signing of the agreement provides for free trade between  the European Union and Russia from 1998, if Russia fulfills a  number of obligations before its partners. The European Union  will grant Russia the benefits now enjoyed by its member  countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Russia's way towards cooperation with the European Union was  and remains far from smooth. Russia was granted the right to  sign an accord with the European Union a short time ago after  France lifted its objections to the sale of Russian uranium on  the external market and President Yeltsin signed a decree  allowing foreign banks into Russia. Many more barriers will  have to be cleared before Russia becomes a full-fledged  participant in the club.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The authorities of tyrant Saddam have added a new  crime to their record of atrocities with the execution of a  number of innocent civilians in the marshlands of Maysan.    According to our sources, the tyrant's forces waged a  ferocious attack on the (al-Sukhraydah) area in Maysan. Having  blockaded the area and kept it under a sustained barrage of  fire, the forces finally swept over it, killing and wounding  some inhabitants and arresting others.    Our sources say that the tyrant's forces did not stop at  this  but executed seven (al-Sukhraydah) inhabitants by firing squads  in front of their families. Here are the names of the executed  men: Hulayyil Badr 'Awf al-Bukhaytawi, 'Abbar Juwaysim, Yusuf  Khaylul al- Sawa'idah, 'Abbas Furayyij, Muhammad Muqashshar  al-Bukhaytawi, Jawad Kazim al-Bukhaytawi, and Ghazi Lazim  al-Bukhaytawi.    Our sources add that the regime's forces killed livestock  and  demolished houses in (al-Sukhraydah) before leaving, then they  lobbed more shells into the area.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Management: A word in Tony's ear - Kevin Brown offers tips on how to influence Britain's Labour party So you want to lobby the Labour party? You are not alone. With Labour nearly 30 percentage points ahead of the Tories in most opinion polls, businessmen have been queueing up to talk to the people many expect to form the next government. It was not always like that. Michael Heseltine, quick to spot an opposition weak point, raised a big laugh only a couple of years ago by poking fun at Labour's attempts to make business converts by dining in boardrooms - the so-called prawn cocktail offensive. 'Never have so many crustaceans died in vain,' Heseltine told the Commons in a hilarious skit on the campaigning efforts of the late John Smith, then shadow chancellor, and Margaret Beckett, his deputy. The jibe prompted Tory cheers - and not a few wry grins from Labour MPs - because of the widespread view that any hope of cordial relations between the party of trade unions and its class enemy was a joke. But Labour is having the last laugh. The charm offensive launched by Smith was continued when he replaced Neil Kinnock as leader after the 1992 election, and put into overdrive when Tony Blair took over in the summer. Even Robin Cook, one of the more traditionally minded of Labour's leading figures, undertook a protracted tour of Britain to consult small business - an undertaking inevitably dubbed Labour's Cook's tour by Commons wags. 'For a long time in the 1980s Labour had very little to do with business; frankly, they thought we had two heads, and that was what the prawn cocktail offensive was designed to overcome,' says a senior Labour official. 'Things have changed a lot recently, partly because people now see us as serious contenders for government, and partly because of the perception that the party under Tony's leadership is more interested in a healthy business sector.' Roland Wales, director of policy development at Labour's London headquarters, says the party welcomes the increasing number of approaches from business because 'it is in our interests for our policies to be well thought out'. But it is important to go about it in the right way. So here are some tips for those who spent the 1980s ignoring the people's party but now want to make their voice heard. Don't bother with lobbying companies. Kinnock's office had an iron rule of never dealing with them. Blair's Labour party is more flexible, but the lobbyists will probably be wasting your time and money. Senior officials say that most businessmen will probably be given lower-level access through a lobbyist than through a direct approach. But consultants can be useful to businessmen who don't know how the party works. Charles Clarke, who worked for Kinnock and now runs Quality Public Affairs in London, advises clients seeking to influence Labour to steer well clear of the mushrooming lobbying industry. 'A lot of people are fobbed off by lobbyists with cocktail party contacts, which are usually a waste of time. You have to make your case, and you have to make sure you are making it to the right people,' he says. Don't make unsolicited personal approaches, especially to people's homes. 'Once or twice we have had people who come to the front door and demand to see us, which is not a terribly helpful way to go about it,' says Wales. Never offer inducements (although a slap-up meal will not be refused). Labour frontbenchers and officials believe they have the government on the run in the sleaze battle. They want to be in government too much to risk doing anything questionable, even if they are tempted. Do remember that there are several ways of influencing policy development. For most companies, the best will be via the party headquarters policy unit or the shadow minister who speaks for Labour on your subject. But Labour also has a standing Industry Forum specifically designed to foster contacts with business. And there are usually a number of consultation exercises going on - the current crop includes health, the economy and crime. Do make your initial contact in writing. Labour is short of resources, so don't expect a lengthy reply, but shadow ministers and officials say they respond to all their letters eventually - and they will meet you if you have something worthwhile to say. Do make sure you have worked out clearly what your concerns are, and that your arguments are cogently explained. Many business people apparently think their views are self-evidently correct, especially if they usually talk only to Tories. Do identify carefully who you need to talk to. Remember that each shadow minister has a team of front-bench MPs to assist him or her. Sometimes you can make your point better by not going to the top. Do remember that officials can be useful points of contact, too. Access to Blair is tightly controlled, for example, but you might have more luck with David Miliband, the leader's young and imaginative head of policy. There are also some very influential MPs in apparently junior positions. Formally, for example, Peter Mandelson, the MP for Hartlepool, is a mere junior whip. But he is also an intimate confidant of Blair, with far more influence than most members of the shadow cabinet. Do remember the regional approach. If you are based in Scotland, try approaching George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary; from Wales try Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary; from Northern Ireland try Mo Mowlam, shadow Ulster secretary. London has its own shadow cabinet spokesman - Frank Dobson, who also handles transport. And finally, do make sure that a senior executive makes the approach. Socialists are like everyone else, they like to have their egos massaged.</p>

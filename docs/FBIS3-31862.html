			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 25 Feb (TANJUG) -- There are several  mutually conflicting initiatives at the moment. None of them is  fully articulated, but it is obvious that the Russian initiative  is the most serious one as it requires that the issue of the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina be resolved at a summit between the  major powers, or rather the most responsible powers, Yugoslav  Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in the  Hallmark of Time program broadcast on Kragujevac Radio [Serbia].    The fact is, the federal foreign minister said, that there  is  no other place that is more suitable nor any other participants  more competent to take steps toward peace.    Commenting on other proposals, and the West's refusal to  offer support to the Russian initiative, Jovanovic said: "There  have been some proposals favoring small steps and referring to  lower level meetings under the pretext that larger steps require  longer preparation. It is difficult to say whether they are  only a way to prevent the acceptance of the Russian initiative,  or whether they are guided by rational reasons. At the moment  it seems to be more important to prevent the Russian initiative  than to offer another alternative plan that would be as good and  as useful."</p>

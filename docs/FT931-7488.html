			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever The fashionable view suggests Unilever's shares will languish as investors continue to switch from reliable defensive stocks into more volatile recovery plays. Judging by yesterday's annual results, it would not do to despair too soon. A particularly strong fourth quarter lifted Unilever's annual pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn. Good financial housekeeping enabled the company to contain costs, drive down debt by one-fifth to Pounds 1.2bn, and cut its interest bill from Pounds 276m to Pounds 148m. But additional sales growth was spurred by a 15 per cent increase in advertising and promotional spending. Twenty two acquisitions, at a cost of some Pounds 300m, boosted Unilever's drive into overseas markets. This expansionary momentum should accelerate despite softening markets in mainland Europe. With year-end gearing of just 18 per cent, Unilever can afford to pep up its prospects with sizeable acquisitions. Unilever's earnings growth may trail the expected market average this year. Yet, on most projections, the company is trading on a sub-market rating. Its shares may therefore prove a good hedge should the UK upturn prove as anaemic as the company suspects it will be. Longer term, Unilever offers visibly good growth prospects although the concentration of European retail power threatens to squeeze its margins. But even here, Unilever's renewed emphasis on brand innovation suggests a determination to defend itself.</p>

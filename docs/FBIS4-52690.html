			<p>BFN     [Text] The government plans to revise for the first time  in almost 30 years the method of computing statistics, adopted  in fiscal 1966, on balance of international payments. This is  in response to the situation in which trade in services, such as  finance, communications, and transport, has become active with  the advance of internationalization, and the pace of trade  expansion in this area is expected to exceed that in merchandise  trade. With the aim of increasing transparency of services  trade, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) formulated new  standards last autumn and asked member nations to revise the  method of computing their statistics on international balance of  payments in accord with the standards. Taking the same steps as  the United States and Europe, Japan also plans to revise its  statistics. The government will begin the revision based on a  report to be compiled in June by the Council on Foreign Exchange  and Other Transactions (an advisory panel to the finance  minister and the international trade and industry minister). New  statistics are expected to be adopted in two or three years.    International balance of payments includes current balance,  which shows data on trade in goods, such as automobiles and home  electric appliances, and on trade in services. Presently,  current balance consists of balance of trade, balance of  invisible trade, and balance of transfer. The planned revision  will center on improving data on services trade, which is a  category in invisible trade balance. The government is to  classify data on services trade into about 10 groups by adding  communications, construction, information, and other items to  the present transport and travel. This broad classification  will enable one to know the actual state of services trade at a  glance.    Japan is a nation with a huge trade surplus. It registered a  surplus of $141.4 billion in its balance of trade in 1993. On  the other hand, the nation's balance of invisible trade in the  same year was a deficit of $3.8 billion, reflecting the  increasing number of Japanese who make trips abroad. A  government source said by disclosing detailed data on services  trade, "Japan can demonstrate that its markets are open."  However, if Japan discloses data on balance of payments in the  construction market, which is not fully open to foreign  competition, the United States and Europe might increase their  pressure on Japan to open it wider.    Currently, "capital account balance" is divided into  long-term capital balance (which shows data on increase and  decrease of external assets and debts during a period of over  one year) and short-term capital balance (which shows data  during a period of less than one year). The government plans to  abolish this classification because it is difficult to know from  the data what private companies are aiming at. Instead, it will  reclassify the capital account balance into "direct foreign  investment," "portfolio investment," and "other investments."  Direct foreign investment is an act to acquire shares in  foreign companies to participate in management, while portfolio  investment is an act to purchase foreign government bonds.    Free trade in services was seriously discussed in the  Uruguay  Round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations. The final act of  the round signed in Marrakech, Morocco, in April notes that  trade barriers should be lowered by extending the scope of  liberalization from merchandise trade to services trade.</p>

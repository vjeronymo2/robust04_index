			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Clays loses its feet The savaging of English China Clays yesterday represents a grim warning for any company which turns in interim profits below the market's expectations. Mr Andrew Teare, the chief executive, has certainly blotted a previously pristine copybook. But it is a bit rich for investors to complain about the timing of the offending land bank provisions. It would have to have been made anyway at the end of the year and merely underlines the wisdom of the original decision to get out of housing. The accompanying disappointment of low land sales, of course, has dented ECC's image as a strong cash generator. ECC should still be cash positive over the year as a whole, but after two years of throttling back on investment capital expenditure is rising again. The main concern, however, centres on the 1 percentage point fall in clay margins and the prospect of that trend worsening over the next six months. ECC points out that it has seen a Dollars 2 pound in the past, but the market is understandably worried that even a trickle of cheaper clay imports will put pressure on European prices. Paper industry customers, after all, could do with the relief. Compensating volume increases can only be dreamed of at this stage, while it is hard to see further scope for removing costs. In some senses yesterday's re-rating is only overdue acknowledgement that Mr Teare is not infallible. A 7.1 per cent yield, on the other hand, seriously circumscribes his freedom to make acquisitions with the paper. Shackled to the economic cycle for the foreseeable future, the challenge for a fundamentally extractive company must be to avoid a valuation closer to that of the stricken building sector.</p>

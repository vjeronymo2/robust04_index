			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PARTY OUSTS GRENADA CHIEF  </P> <P> Prime Minister Herbert Blaize was ousted as leader of Grenada's ruling New  National Party during a party convention vote and replaced by his longtime  critic, Keith Mitchell, the minister of communications and works. The election  of Mitchell means he will be the prime minister of the Caribbean island nation  if the centrist party wins in elections due by December. Mitchell, 43, has  regularly criticized Blaize for making major decisions without consulting his  Cabinet. Blaize's ouster as party leader -- a position he has held since 1960  -- was apparently due to a drop in popularity and ill health. The 71-year-old  Blaize, who became prime minister in 1984, has prostate cancer.  </P></p>

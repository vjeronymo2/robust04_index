			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Now SA can get down to business] </F>   [Text] South Africa's transition to democracy could never  have been without pain, and there will be those who criticise  Finance Minister Derek Keys for deciding to load the cost burden  of that process onto middle-class and wealthy individuals and  private sector businesses.    If the critics ignore other factors and simply denigrate the  first Budget of a majority government because of the 5 percent  transitional levy, they will do Keys and his collaborators an  injustice. Keys has produced a Budget designed to generate the  soundly based growth we need if the economy is to create jobs  and allow the fair distribution of wealth and the social  spending necessary for national stability. He had no choice but  to put growth above all other considerations, and with this  year's Budget he should succeed, while helping government avoid  the temptation of fiscal indiscipline.    There will be some gripes about the higher excise duties on  tobacco and alcoholic products. But the new intention that  increases in excise duties should match price increases is wise.    Keys trod a fine line over VAT [value-added tax]. He appears  sensibly to have resisted pressures to zero-rate more  foodstuffs. Variable VAT rates would add to the complexities of  collecting the tax which is likely to become an increasingly  important source of government income as economic restructuring  progresses. But the Finance Minister apparently had to pay the  political price of that by not increasing the overall VAT rate.  <H5>  Realities </H5>   The decision not to change VAT highlights South Africa's new  political realities. The majority of people who elected the new  government are relatively poor. Until their standards of living  are raised, they will continue to oppose taxes like VAT which,  whatever their advantages, are regressive. Social services will  continue to be directed increasingly towards the most needy.    Some sleight of hand has cut the budgeted deficit before  borrowing to 6.6 percent of GDP [gross domestic product] from  last year's 6.9 percent. GDP has been increased by 5.6 percent  -- an estimate of the contribution of the ill-measured informal  sector. Calculated on the older, more conventional basis, the  Budget deficit would have been 7 percent -- visibly higher than  the 6 percent promised to the IMF but still an acceptable level  for a Budget that has to put growth above all else.    Growth cannot be achieved without investment, and the  proposed cut in the corporate income tax rate, in part offset by  the higher 25 percent secondary tax on companies (a tax on  distributed profits), should encourage it. The scrapping of the  import surcharge on capital and intermediate goods will also  help. Investment yields will be enhanced by the lower corporate  tax rate while companies will be encouraged by the higher STC  [secondary tax on companies] to retain and reinvest earnings.  <H5>  Flexibility </H5>   Keys was right not to introduce a capital gains tax that  would deter investment. That will be addressed by the new Tax  Advisory Committee, but it will be addressed in parallel with  Inland Revenue's proposals to facilitate corporate unbundling  and rationalisation.    The Finance Minister would have done well to eliminate the  marketable securities tax that is regularly criticised by  foreign investors. He has, however, made a start on improving  the flexibility of financial markets with the new public debt  management proposals. Financing of government deficits as they  arise should create a more active market in government stock.  Couple that with the new system of depositing tax and loan  receipts with the commercial banks, and most of the market  distortions inherent in the previous system will be eliminated.  In addition, government funding should become more sensitive to  market trends.    Many investors here and abroad remain wary of South Africa's  new government. It has still to prove its credentials  conclusively and, as a result, it is likely to be under greater  scrutiny than its predecessor. This Budget has set the tone,  and has shown that government's financial planners believe the  business of South Africa can be business.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, April 23 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister  Antonin Baudys spoke with journalists on his return from France  this evening. [passage omitted]    None of the information recently spread in the Czech media  that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic  had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted  that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been  stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to  smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course.    Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which  was  not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the  state or created the impression of high insecurity was not  proper.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LIGHTFOOT'S A SUPERIOR FRIEND  </P> <P> Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot sent a check for $2,500 after a group raising  funds for a new ice-skating and hockey arena asked for an autographed item for  a celebrity auction.  </P> <P> Superior made Lightfoot an honorary citizen when he performed last year at  nearby Duluth, Minn.  </P> <P> Mayor Herb Bergson said it would have taken quite a few items to produce as  much money for the Superior Amateur Hockey Assn.'s arena as Lightfoot's check  did.  </P> <P> Bergson said the city was honoring Lightfoot for his song "The Wreck of the  Edmund Fitzgerald." Residents of Superior died in 1975 on the ore-carrying  ship.  </P> <P> The hockey association needs about $60,000 to put the finishing touches on the  arena, Bergson said.  </P></p>

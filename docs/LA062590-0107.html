			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> QUEEN, ICELAND WARM RELATIONS  </P> <P> Queen Elizabeth II began the first visit to Iceland by a British monarch today,  underlining a new warmth between two countries at odds for decades over fishing  rights.  </P> <P> The so-called "cod wars" of the late 1950s and 1970s followed Iceland's  unilateral extension of exclusive fishing rights in four stages between 1952  and 1975, in order to protect its main livelihood.  </P> <P> Eventually Britain accepted Iceland's 200-mile fishing zone in return for  certain fishing rights.  </P> <P> Iceland's woman president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, and members of the government  greeted the queen at Keflavik Airport at the start of her two-day visit.  </P> <P> She inspected ancient manuscripts of Icelandic Sagas, walked through central  Reykjavik and toured the national gallery. The Queen and Prince Philip were  later flying to Canada.  </P></p>

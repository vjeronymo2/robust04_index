			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Advertisers go to work on the egg From next Monday morning breakfasters will be able to read their boiled eggs as well as their newspapers - British Telecommunications has taken advertising space on 13.5m eggs to promote its new daytime phone charges. BT said the eggs, which will bear the message 'Wake up to BT's new Daytime Rate', were a 'cheap medium' enabling it to get over the message that peak charges have been abolished. European ministers failed to agree in September last year on whether advertising on eggs should be allowed - but gave the go-ahead for a two-year trial. Holmes &amp; Marchant Blitz, the advertising agency which is producing the egg campaign for BT, said it was the first large-scale promotion using advertisements on eggs in Europe. It believed egg advertising had been tried in Israel. The advertisements are printed using a high-pressure jet which blows dots of food colouring on each shell. More than 20 packaging stations have been equipped to print the patented 'eggverts'. The eggs will be distributed through Tesco and Asda supermarkets in time for Easter.</p>

As a  result, Hungary has disputes with its neighbors, but these are  not as serious as those in the Balkans or the Caucasus," Prime  Minister Peter Boross said this evening in his reception toast  for participants in the conference of DEMYC, the union of  European center-right parties' youth organizations. DEMYC is  holding its executive committee session in Budapest from Friday  [25 February] to Sunday [27 February].    Boross said debates with neighbors involve human rights  issues, such as use of the Hungarian language in official  contacts, the right to native-language education or the right  and possibility of using originally Hungarian geographical  names. He added Hungary is nonetheless developing economic and  cultural ties with its neighbors, and that the disputes do not  threaten Europe in any way.    DEMYC President Klaus Welle, head of the German CDU's  [Christian Democratic Union] European Policy Department, said  some in the West think that Eastern and Western European  countries should be separated. The young conservatives and  Christian democrats reject this view, and support their joint  participation in NATO, the European Union, the Western European  Union, and other institutions. Hungary has won the right to do  so also by its minority policy, Welle said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Rubio from the "Good Morning From </F> Mexico" newscast]    [Text] Significant and specific advancements have been made  following the presidential bill granting general amnesty to  everyone who participated in the violence in Chiapas State.  Rumors of clashes between the Mexican Army and rebels have  turned out to be just that: only rumors. Here in Chiapas, most  people have returned to their daily activities.    Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, held a news conference upon his  return to Mexico City. He warned that even with the presidential  bill granting general amnesty to everyone who participated in  the violence in Chiapas, there is still a risk of falling into  provocations that could hinder the peace process.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] In facing this situation,  the country is strong, civilian society is mobilized, the  national and international media are vigilant, and the Army is  loyal to the executive branch and the nation, which prefers a  political solution to an escalation of the conflict. [end  recording]    Regarding rumors of clashes, Camacho Solis said firmly that  unlike some other countries, the civilian government controls  the Armed Forces in Mexico. He added that he hopes the Indians  have received President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's message,  which he read in the Tzotzil, Tzetal, and (Chol) languages.    San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia during  his Sunday homily expressed his satisfaction about the  conciliatory messages exchanged by both sides. Bishop Ruiz  Garcia invited Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis to come  to the altar, to which Camacho replied: I am just a faithful  Christian. Bishop Ruiz Garcia responded: I am bishop of this  Diocese, but I am also a citizen.    Before approximately 3,000 parishioners, Ruiz Garcia said he  has received threatening telephone calls.    [Begin Ruiz Garcia recording] Without trying to be  conspicuous, without any deception in my words, but with a  sincere heart, I tell all those who have recently said they will  make me disappear -- even making such threats in public places  -- and all those who have left threatening messages -- even  though I have also received encouraging phone calls -- that  although I know their names, I harbor no hard feelings against  them in my heart. [end recording]    In closing the homily, Ruiz Garcia said the eyes of the  world  are on Mexico and urged the parties involved in the conflict to  meet and show their willingness to find a solution through  genuine national fraternity.</p>

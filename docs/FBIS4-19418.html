			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands UN Observer Missing in </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] A Netherlands military UN observer who was stationed  in the Muslim enclave of Zepa in eastern Bosnia has been missing  since around 0007 GMT on Monday [11 April]. The soldier  concerned is Air Force Major Van Baal.    Although all UN observers were supposed to stay inside due  to  possible revenge attacks by Bosnian Serbs after the NATO air  strikes at Gorazde, Van Baal still went out on Monday morning.  It is not clear why the major did not obey the instruction.  Also it is not known why he set out with only two interpreters  and not with one or more UN observers, as customary.    Defense Ministry spokesman in The Hague, Colonel F. Olivier,  said [the Ministry] was "terribly concerned" about Van Baal's  disappearance. Olivier said that he had only sketchy  information.    The matter was being taken up at a high level in the United  Nations, Olivier said. The highest civilian UN representative  in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, was reported to have  brought up Van Baal's disappearance yesterday during his talks  in the Serbian stronghold of Pale.</p>

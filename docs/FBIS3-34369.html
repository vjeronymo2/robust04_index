			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Security Council and Confidence Building: </F> What Is the Required Position?"]    [Text] Everyone is now aware that Iraq has fulfilled all  of its obligations toward Section C of Resolution 687 and  Resolution 715 concerning monitoring, and that Iraq has  confirmed its commitment through the various measures it has  taken to implement these two resolutions. This fact has been  noted by various international quarters. The UN Special  Commission has also confirmed that Iraq has respected its  commitments and obligations despite the injustice done to it.    This reminds us once again of the fact that reciprocal  obligations of both Iraq and the UN Security Council, in  accordance with the Council's own resolutions, require an  immediate move to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 which  stipulates that the oil embargo should be lifted without any  delay to enable Iraq to secure its immediate food and medical  needs.    Within the contexts of justice and logic, any fair observer  must view with surprise any attempt to bypass this fact and  delay the lifting of the embargo, or any attempt to use the  suffering of the Iraqi people as a card for extortion and cheap  bargaining to achieve certain political objectives that are  rejected in part and parcel and infringe on the Iraqis' right to  possess their free will.    To be clearer, we refer to statements made by some people on  "confidence building" and the suspect call for delaying a  resolution to end the embargo until the conditions for that  "building" are established. These statements are part of the  maneuvers mastered by the United States, which seeks to involve  others in these maneuvers, prevent them from seeing what is  right, and place them in the whirlpool of the U.S. hostile  objectives that run contrary to legitimacy and the principles of  right and justice.    Confidence building between Iraq, the Security Council, and  the Special Commission with a view to ending the injustice and  the wrongdoing done to the Iraqi people is an immediate,  important, and a required thing to do. It can be achieved  through understanding and the fair objective perspective that is  free from ulterior motives and evil purposes. It requires all  the parties concerned to recognize that Iraq has done all it can  to sincerely fulfill its obligations and commitments.    On the other hand, "confidence building" cannot be done  through maneuvers; the attempt to dismiss facts; ignoring the  suffering of the Iraqi children, women, and old people; or  drifting behind the games of this or that international party  that agreed to be a false witness in the greatest moral and  human scandal seen by the world in the late 20th century.    We know very well that the United States and its lackeys do  not wish the truth to emerge or the embargo to end. However, we  also know that the Security Council issued a specific resolution  that included reciprocal obligations, which Iraq has fulfilled.  The Security Council should now fulfill its own obligations and  lift the embargo and put an end to this flagrant violation of  everything legitimate, humane, and just.</p>

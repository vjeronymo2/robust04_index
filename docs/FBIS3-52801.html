Sha'th said that for all intents and purposes both  parties have already agreed on most of the issues: the  timetable for the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal; the  size of the Palestinian police force; security along the  borders, on the roads, and inside the territories; and a safe  passageway between the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    In an interview with our correspondent Moti Amir, Nabil  Sha'th said that there were still disagreements on the issues of  Jericho and the border crossings, on the security zones around  the settlements, and also with regard to the division of  responsibilities between the Palestinian towns and the Jewish  settlements on matters of mutual concern.    As for the crisis in the Cairo talks, Sha'th says the whole  affair was an unnecessary furor caused by premature  announcements. Sha'th said that if the crisis had been put off  for another week, the Palestinian and Israeli teams might have  signed the agreement that they had already almost completed.</p>

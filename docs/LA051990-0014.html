			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRAUD AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS  </P> <P> Congratulations, Times, and congratulations, Ralph Vartabedian, on a very fine  and necessary job well-done!  </P> <P> Finally, the truth comes out! It's what activists have been saying all along,  but no one wanted to listen to them. It was first-rate coverage of the scope  that this scandal is taking, the tip of the iceberg, as we're just beginning to  realize but always feared. By all means, stay with it.  </P> <P> CASEY KASEM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

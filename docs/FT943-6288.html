			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bond market turmoil puts Skandia deep in the red The turmoil in international bond markets had a dramatic impact on the first-half results of Skandia, the Swedish insurer. The group slumped to a SKr2.40bn (Dollars 322.9m) loss from a SKr1.66bn profit at the management operating level under the impact of unrealised losses on its bond portfolio. It still recorded a deficit of SKr550m - against a SKr1.16bn profit  - even if unrealised changes to bond values are excluded. This is because of realised capital losses on bond sales, changes in share values and changes in exchange rates for surplus values of assets. The group's operating performance was also affected. Before adjusting the value of its bonds to the lower of cost or market value, profit fell to SKr529m from SKr572m. After adjusting, it swung to an operating loss of SKr435m from a SKr637m profit. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive, said the group was consoled by the improvement in its core insurance operations where profits climbed 31 per cent to SKr378m. Reinsurance activities improved their results and there was a strong improvement at NIG Skandia, a UK unit. Premium income climbed 35 per cent to SKr27.3bn, driven by a strong expansion of unit-linked life assurance business. Skandia triggered turmoil in Sweden's financial markets in July when it boycotted new Swedish bond issues in protest at a lack of political will to curb state debt. The boycott remains in force. The group said it had no Swedish bonds in its portfolio at mid-year. Net asset value per share was SKr150 at the end of June, against SKr179 on January 1. The group's solvency margin improved to 83 per cent from 60 per cent.</p>

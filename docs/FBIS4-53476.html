			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Nam Yu-chol] </F>   [Text] Despite the political and military tension on the  Korean peninsula over the nuclear issue, North-South trade  continues to grow. The scale of direct and indirect trade  between North and South Korea in 1993 was $186,591,000 (on the  customs clearance basis), as much as a 7.6 percent increase  over the 1992 level. In the recently released "Trends in  North-South Exchanges and Cooperation," the National  Unification Board says: "This scale of North-South trade is not  small at all considering the fact that South Korea ranks fourth  after China, Japan, and Russia in North Korea's volume of  foreign trade, which is estimated at approximately $2.6 billion  in total."    With the trend toward increasing North-South trade, South  Korea's trade deficit with North Korea continues to grow. In  1993 the volume of North Korean goods purchased by South Korean  firms totaled $178,166,000 whereas the volume of South Korean  goods purchased by North Korea totaled $8,425,000. As a result,  South Korea recorded a trade deficit of $169,741,000 with North  Korea. South Korea's accumulated trade deficit with North Korea  since North-South trade began in 1989 has reached $451,893,000,  indicating that South Korean firms continue to "buy goods from  North Korea."    Despite the accumulating trade deficit, the volume of goods  shipped to North Korea continues to decrease whereas the volume  of goods brought in from North Korea continues to grow rapidly.  Compared with 1992, the volume of goods shipped to North Korea  decreased by 20.2 percent whereas that of goods brought in from  the North increased by 9.4 percent. (Our government regards  trade between North and South as domestic transactions and uses  the terms "goods brought in" and "goods shipped out" for  "imports" and "exports.")    Steel and metals lead the list of purchases from North Korea  last year, accounting for 80.3 percent of the total. The reason  is that North Korea abounds in gold nuggets, zinc, and other  minerals, and South Korean firms view them as "profitable  items." Walnuts, medicinal herbs, and other agricultural and  forestry products rank second in the list of items preferred,  accounting for 8.5 percent of the total amount of goods  purchased from North Korea. Textiles ranked third, accounting  for 5.9 percent. Except cotton towels, most of the textile  goods shipped from North Korea, such as trousers and shirts,  were processed in North Korea for South Korean firms on a  commission basis.    Fibers leads the list of goods shipped to North Korea in  1993  accounting for 70.4 percent of the total volume, indicating  that the import of textiles manufactured by commissioning  sharply increased last year. South Korean firms supply Tetron  fibers, cotton fibers, and other raw materials to North Korea,  and North Korea manufactures textiles by using these materials  and ships the finished products to South Korea or third  countries. The volume of trade in goods processed in this  manner, with textiles on the top, has increased more than seven  times over the 1992 level, indicating that South Koran firms  are very much attracted to North Korean light industry goods  manufactured by using low wages.    With our technicians not allowed to visit or stay in North  Korea, it is impossible to provide the on-site technical  guidance necessary for processing by commissioning. Our firms  think that as long as this problem remains unsolved, it will be  difficult to maintain the rapid pace of increase in the volume  of trade in goods processed by commissioning. Included in the  goods shipped to North Korea that were reported to the National  Unification Board are: color television sets, 508 tons of soap,  and 270 sewing machines.    Despite aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula, the  number of South Korean firms desiring to trade with North Korea  has been steadily increasing. Last year South Korean firms  engaging in trade with North Korea numbered 132, or an increase  of nine over the 1992 figure. The major firms leading in trade  with North Korea are mostly general trading firms of  conglomerates, such as Samsung Co., Lucky-Goldstar International  Corp., Daewoo Corp., and Sorin Metals. These four companies  accounts for 73.2 percent of the total volume of goods brought  in from North Korea last year.    The Samsung Co. led in terms of the approved amount of goods  shipped to North Korea with $2,961,000 as it did in terms of  the volume of goods brought in from North Korea, with Sunkyung,  ltd. and the Daewoo Corp trailing behind. Ten companies  recorded over $1 million each in the accumulated total of  exports to North Korea since 1988.    Last year as in the preceding years, indirect trade through  overseas intermediaries was the main form of trade between  North and South Korea. Indirect transactions account for 98.3  percent of all trade between North and South. North Korea does  not yet officially approve North-South direct trade. Despite  North Korea's official stand that it "will not trade with South  Korea," the number of cases of direct trade increased from 11  in 1992 to 14 in 1993. According to concerned sources, the  number of North Korean offers of direct trade has noticeably  increased since early this year.    These sources take the increasing offers of direct trade as  a  reflection of the worsening economic situation in North Korea.  In trade with North Korea, large South Korean firms offer the  most favorable conditions such as the payment of cash because  their business strategy toward North Korea is aimed at  expanding business ties with it even at the risk of losses.    Business sources say that the actual scale of North-South  trade is larger than the government statistics indicate. Only  those transactions that are reported to the government for the  purpose of obtaining exemptions from customs are included in  the government statistics. Companies report their  transactions to the government on a selective basis for various  reasons. In the case of indirect trade, it is practically  impossible for the government to determine which are the  ultimate receivers of goods and which are the ultimate shippers.    Our government has time and again enunciated its position of  linking North-South economic cooperation to the nuclear issue,  namely, the position that it will not agree to North-South  economic cooperation as long as North Korea refuses to settle  the nuclear issue. However, the abstract term "North-South  economic cooperation" as used by our government should be  interpreted as meaning "investment" only, not including  "trade." The reason is that what the government is actually  prohibiting is nothing but investment in North Korea, and  despite tension aggravated by the North Korean statement about  "turning South Korea into a sea of fire," direct and indirect  trade between North and South Korea has been growing steadily.</p>

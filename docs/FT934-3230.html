			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New Dow high on selective late demand Wall Street US stocks finished on a mixed note yesterday, but blue chip issues followed Tuesday's record-setting performance with an impressive encore, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 15.65 stronger at 3,734.53, beating the short-lived high of 3,718.88. But the more broadly based Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.47 to 466.29. The American SE composite was up 1.47 at 468.87 but the Nasdaq composite lost 1.46 at 767.89. NYSE volume was heavy at 314.4m shares. Equities limped through the morning with little sense of direction ahead of today's producer price data. Tuesday's record closing high could not dispel the flat mood, nor could the stagnant US Treasury market, where bonds across the maturity range trod water in relaxed anticipation of Thursday's inflation data. In late trading the benchmark 30-year issue was barely higher at 101 5/32 , amid expectations of a modest 0.2 per cent increase in last month's wholesale prices. The day's only new economic data, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book summary of regional conditions, only served to reinforce the impression of strong growth and low inflation suggested by last week's stream of statistics. The Dow briefly touched negative territory in the early afternoon, before spurting ahead in a late burst of buying in a handful of pivotal stocks. Among the contributing issues, JP Morgan, the US securities house, added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 72 3/4 after raising its dividend. Eastman Kodak was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 62 1/2 and Aluminum Co of America gained Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 72 1/2 . Airlines were again among the most active stocks. Continental's 'B' stock was marked down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 1/2 after an offering of 7m new shares at Dollars 20 each. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, edged ahead Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 150 5/8 on reports of progress in negotiations over a move by its unions to acquire 60 per cent of the company. With Comex gold prices on the rise, mining issues were in play. Placer Dome rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 24 1/2 , while American Barrick climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 28 1/8 . On the Amex, Pegasus Gold advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 and Echo Bay Mines was Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 13 5/8 . An announcement by Xerox that it would cut about 10 per cent of its 97,500-strong workforce sent the stock Dollars 5 1/4 higher to Dollars 86. Marriott International added Dollars 2 at Dollars 27 after Wertheim Schroder upgraded its rating from 'neutral' to 'buy'. Canada Toronto finished at a record peak in active trading, boosted by strong gains among gold and other mining stocks. The TSE 300 index climbed 42.2 to 4,307.7. Rises led falls by 492 to 336 after volume of 79.1m shares. The golds index jumped 4.9 per cent as the spot gold price rose USDollars 6.20 an ounce in New York.</p>

The problems of  overstaffed organizations, duplication of functions, uneven  relations, and low efficiency still exist in the province. It  is time for us to conduct reform and to deal with these problems  fundamentally.    According to the station reporter's dispatch from the  provincial personnel affairs work conference that concluded on  15 January, the major tasks the province adopted to cope with  the aforementioned problems are to push forward in an overall  way reform of organs; to establish gradually or enforce the  system of public servants; to conduct vigorous reform of the  wages systems of organs, establishments, and units and to orient  the wages systems to an enforcement track; to promote reform of  the system of social insurance in organs, establishments, and  units; to deepen reform of personnel affairs systems of  enterprises and establishments; to actively establish or improve  the managerial and service systems for talented personnel; and  to enhance the management over the affairs of specialized and  technical cadres. In successfully conducting reform of organs  and enforcing the system of public servants, emphasis should be  placed on successfully grasping the connection between the  reform of organs and the enforcement of public servant systems.  First, we should do a good job in conducting definition in the  following three fields: 1) The definition of organs functions;  2) The definition of organs names; and 3) The definition of  staff size. We should be determined to deal with the  long-standing problems of disputes over trifles that exist among  economic departments and between the comprehensive economic  departments and the specialized economic departments. Second, we  should carry out personnel transfers and do a good job in  shifting the function of departments. A central task in this  regard is to establish a demarcation line, under the socialist  market economy system, between things that must be controlled by  the state and those that should not be controlled, and to deal  correctly with the relationship between them. Streamlining the  staff size of organs and transferring personnel constitute a  difficult point in reforming organs and is a premise of  enforcing the system of public servants. In line with the  demands of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and  the province's situation, the party and government organs at or  above the county level across the province should carry out a  personnel cut of 35,000. This is a quite arduous task and  requires us to do a good job in deeply and carefully conducting  ideological and political work among personnel and to enable the  broad masses of cadres, staff members, and workers to adopt a  correct attitude toward the new appointments and dismissals by  realizing it is necessary in order to build Hebei into a strong  economic province. We should try to have the reappointees be  relaxed and greeted with pleasure by the outgoing personnel.    The provincial party committee and the provincial people's  government have decided that the province will basically  complete the reform of organs by the end of 1995 and the work of  enforcing the systems of public servants by the end of 1996.  Tasks for the two reform projects are very arduous. Meanwhile,  they have also made specific arrangements for the reform of the  wage systems.</p>

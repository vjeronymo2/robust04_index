			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (2): The Great Game revisited - How Russia, the West and Turkey are jockeying for Baku's oil favours Crude is not necessarily the first word on the lips of Western and local oilmen in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. These days their first utterance is just as likely to be 'Russia'. The oilmen are preoccupied by a revival of the 19th century Great Game, in which Russia vied for influence in the region against Britain, Iran and Turkey. The new round of this old game threatens to block a Dollars 11.8bn British Petroleum-led oil proposal to resurrect Baku as a world oil leader. One of three new oil producing republics on the shores of the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan possesses more than 4bn barrels of proven oil reserves. Industry analysts believe that together with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan could form the world's third-largest oil-producing region, after Siberia and the Gulf. For Azerbaijan, a century after Robert Nobel developed the Baku oil fields, the same resource could be the basis for Azerbaijan's long-term independence from Moscow for the first time since Czar Alexander the First's conquest of the area. President Heydar Aliev has just delayed a contract with the BP-led group, in what industry analysts see as the beginning of a pitch for more Western aid against a Russian effort to consolidate Moscow's economic and political influence in the region two years after the fall of the Soviet Union. 'In Aliev's mind, he's negotiating Azerbaijan's international future, using the only commodity he's got - the oil,' said a Western oil executive involved in the Baku negotiations. 'He's trying to get as much as he can before giving it up.' The revival of Great Game politics on the shores of the Caspian comes four years after Western oil companies began speaking with Azerbaijan about its oil. The talks have involved not only new production. With their rickety old equipment, the existing oilfields' production is declining - last year it fell to 10.25m tonnes from 13.1m tonnes in 1989 - and western companies are being asked to re-equip them. Eight Western companies have won shares of the proposed oil production contract. Besides BP, they are Amoco Production, McDermott International Inc., Pennzoil, Ramco Energy Ltd., Statoil, Turkish Petroleum and Unical. Since moving in, the companies have invested Dollars 140m in bonuses, demonstration projects and charity, and most have opened plush, computer-lined offices in Baku. The deal has seemed close to signing several times, but on each occasion has been held up because of the republic's political instability. Last June, two weeks before the then President Abulfaz Elchibey was to sign the deal in London, a military rebellion overthrew his government. Then in November, Mr Aliyev, who criticised Mr Elchibey's version as insufficiently lucrative, came close to a new deal that raised Azerbaijan's percentage of proceeds from 70 per cent to 80 per cent and added Dollars 200m to a previously arranged Dollars 300m signing bonus. Ultimately, Azerbaijan was to receive Dollars 94bn in profit over 35 years, and the companies Dollars 24bn. Mr Aliev, however, had second thoughts, and now may agree to a lower return over the long term if he can receive more in the first 10 years of production, according to an informed Western diplomat. Under the abandoned deal, the diplomat said, Azerbaijan's proceeds in the first decade would have been just 30 per cent, as the companies recovered their share of Dollars 7bn in projected development costs. Meanwhile, with the talks idling, some of the companies have lowered their profile in Baku. BP, which in partnership with Norway's Statoil has the greatest exposure with a 36.7 percent stake, has reduced its Azerbaijan project staff from 80 to 30. Diplomats and industry analysts say that Mr Aliev is not negotiating in bad faith. He is merely responding to increased pressures, they say. Among them are the public's desperation for a favourable end to Azerbaijan's six-year undeclared war with Armenia, in which thousands of Azeris have died in the last two months alone. There also is dissatisfaction with the republic's unremitting economic collapse, in which production has shrunk at least 40 per cent in just the last two years. And there are Russia and the oil, issues that have seemed increasingly intertwined. It is hard to see what pressure Mr Aliev thinks the US and European companies can exert on Moscow, but he clearly wants a minimum breathing space. 'Azerbaijan has no lobby in any Western country. But when the oil agreement is signed, it will have economic relations with these countries,' and thus a voice there, said Ms. Leyla Yunusova, a former deputy defence minister and now a private military analyst. For its part, Moscow wants a share in Azerbaijan's major oil projects, and abandonment of a Dollars 1.4bn proposal to divert oil shipments through a Turkish pipeline to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Russia wants Baku to continue shipping its oil to its Black Sea port of Novorossisk through an expanded or new pipeline. A new pipeline to Novorossisk would cost an estimated Dollars 2bn. Mr Aliev already has awarded Russia's state-owned Lukoil company a minimum 10 per cent equity share of the estimated 3bn-barrel oil deal under negotiation with the BP-led group. He also has agreed to separate, joint development with Lukoil of the 1.4bn-barrel Guneshli offshore oilfield, which until October was supposed to be part of the Western-led venture. Moscow is not the only former Great Game player to be cut in on the deal late in the game. In 1992, Ankara's Turkish Petroleum was awarded a share. But its appetite was far smaller than Moscow's - just 2.5 per cent. Now, Turkish government officials believe that Mr Aliev has also agreed to ship much or all of Azerbaijan's output to Novorossisk. If true, this would meet what ultimately is Moscow's most serious demand, since a continued monopoly on oil shipments would perpetuate Russia's stranglehold on Azerbaijan's means of economic independence. Since there has been no announcement about the pipeline, most Western oil officials and diplomats continue to hope that the issue is still open. Though Robert Nobel did ship his oil through Russia to Europe, using the Volga River-Baltic Sea route, Western oilmen these days mainly look south. 'The only way Novorossisk makes sense is if you have to choose it for political reasons to please Russia,' said a Western oil official in Baku. 'It's overwhelmingly the worst possible option. It's the most expensive, and you end up with the oil in the wrong place. We want it in the Mediterranean.'</p>

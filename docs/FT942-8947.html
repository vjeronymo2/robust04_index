			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: US action blatantly contradicts free trade Sir, Export promotion quite often is not only the obverse of trade protection, as your leading comment states ('Uncle Sam, salesman', May 16), but is virtually equivalent to it. With decreasing average costs - which is certainly the case in the aircraft industry - winning an export order enables companies such as Boeing to reduce their domestic prices and still earn what is a genuine, that is unsubsidised, profit on the resulting domestic orders. Accordingly, promoting exports to Saudi Arabia is at the same time a most elegant way to prevent possible foreign competitors from gaining access to US markets as well. Consequently, the trade policy currently employed by the Clinton administration stands in blatant contradiction to the free trade philosophy which it sermonises so emphatically, but nonetheless hypocritically, elsewhere.

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Arts: Nothing succeeds like excess - Television You have formed an independent production company with the intention of breaking into television. Should you go for costume drama? Serious investigative journalism? Opera? Certainly not, they are all expensive and difficult. What you need is a new age inter-active programme, presented in studio, by someone from children's programmes, preferably with very odd mannerisms, aided by a transvestite, backed by a team of researchers on telephones, concentrating on spiritual healing, lost relations, and money prizes. One of the biggest changes for years in British television is currently proceeding almost unremarked, largely because it is rather difficult to define. It has been mentioned previously in this column as an increase in tabloid television, but that phrase is really too glib, and consequently misleading, because very few of the programmes in question are concerned with news in the way that the Daily Mirror is. The analogy does hold up if by 'tabloid' you imply such obsolete publications as Reveille, Weekend and Tit Bits which were devoted chiefly to providing entertainment via matters of fact. One of the difficulties is that we are not simply seeing one easily defined type of programme replacing another; it is not like detective series taking over from Westerns. Rather it is a question of one compendium of attitudes, approaches and subjects declining while another set rapidly rises. Variety - in the sense of programmes which incorporate singing, dancing, conjuring and so on - is not dead, but its long term decline has accelerated. The chat show is not dead - The Danny Baker Show with its familiar rock stars, soccer personalities and musical interludes may look like something from the 1970s, yet BBC1 has only just launched it - but it, too, is in long-term decline. 'Light entertainment', in virtually all the forms originally borrowed by television from other places, is declining. Taking its place is material which in some cases would once have been regarded as journalism but which is beginning to evolve into something else: book or travel programmes are now presented by comedians (Griff Rhys Jones with The Bookworm on BBC1, Tony Robinson, best known as Baldrick from Blackadder, on tonight's Great Journeys on BBC2). In other cases the process is further advanced and we are getting material which is neither borrowed nor adapted from elsewhere but is television entertainment sui generis. The Full Wax is a good example, incorporating some elements of the chat show and bits of stand up comedy but relying chiefly on the sort of flight of fantasy in which Ruby Wax managed to get Felicity Kendall, of all people, to appear on Sunday as a sado-masochist madam in full patent leather regalia complete with chains, whip, and stilettos, ostensibly in her own home. At 7.00 on BBC2 tonight is Lifeswaps, based on the interesting idea of getting people to change places (homes, jobs, everything) for a week but introduced by the drag artist Lily Savage, a choice which would have seemed startling only a couple of years ago but which now passes virtually without comment. The result last week was that the 'presenter' in theatrical high heels, stage frock and wig was required to totter around a Welsh cottage and, indeed, Welsh fields. Outrageousness in presenters is now so commonplace that it is becoming unremarkable. From the absurd accents of Lloyd Grossman and Antoine de Caunes to the hyper-activity of Kriss Akabusi and Chris Evans (Don't Forget Your Toothbrush returns on Saturday) it becomes increasingly clear that in television presentation these days nothing succeeds like excess. If you are not a comedian, drag artist or hysteric (Noel Edmonds, towards the end of presenting the first National Lottery, with eyes bulging, screamed 'And now for the countdown to the activation of the balls]') it is best to be a former presenter of children's programmes. Though it is the older section of society that is expanding, broadcasting chiefs are still obsessed with yoof, and anyone who has worked on Blue Peter or anything like it is in great demand. Anthea Turner, ex Blue Peter and now on the ITV breakfast show, was one of the outside reporters on the first lottery programme and will be co-presenting from this week, now that Edmonds has done his stuff. Andi Peters, former continuity presenter for BBC children's television, is co-presenting Good Fortune], the new BBC1 series which hunts down unclaimed prizes and bequests and presents them - and often long lost acquaintances in the style of This Is Your Life - in front of a studio audience. Phillip Schofield, another presenter from BBC children's television, has just begun Schofield's Quest on ITV on Sunday evenings. This describes itself as a 'mystery solving show' though this week's edition had no solutions to the mystery of UFOs on Ilkley Moor, the mystery of a government security garage in Streatham, or the mystery of double-exposure negatives. Like Good Fortune] and so many of the tabloid shows going back to Crimewatch, this one is 'inter-active' or, even more trendy, 'pro-active', meaning that rows of researchers sit at one end of the studio talking on telephones. While Schofield's Quest could not be described as a 'new age' series, it is perfectly happy to deal with spiritual healing, ghosts and the like, the very subjects on which ITV's new Friday evening series Strange But True? concentrates. The more of them you watch, the more these new television programmes seem to have in common with those old weekly tabloids. Every item is designed to make the onlooker say either 'Just fancy that]', or 'Ahhh', or possibly 'Oo-er'. Everything is 'people oriented', meaning that even when it could be called journalism there is a distinct lack of issues or ideas and a perpetual concentration on the minutiae of individual lives. At every turn the customer is urged to 'interact' with the programmes by phone, as they once did with the papers by letter. Everything is 'personality' driven, meaning that a small group of people who are famous for being well known keep on turning up over and over again. The distressing thing is that, although we are still getting Martin Chuzzlewit, rugby internationals, and (last night) the odd and rather frightening Clint Eastwood movie The Beguiled - in other words, material for which television acts as a 'medium' in the sense that it originates elsewhere - there is a strong feeling that Good Fortune], Lifeswaps and The Full Wax are 'real' television. After all, these are the programmes that television invents and makes for itself. Be in no doubt, we shall be seeing a great many more like them.</p>

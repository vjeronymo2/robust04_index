			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Personal View: Hitting a high note at the opera If the Royal Opera House were a publicly quoted company, its share price at the end of this financial year would be riding high. The chairman, reporting the results, would point to outstanding artistic achievement, and, at a time when others are in difficulties, to a useful surplus on the current account, after provision for exceptional items; to debt reduced and gearing improved. No cause for complacency, but the company is very much on the right course, with prospects fair. The financial press might hail this as a turnround. They would be right. Last summer the Arts Council committee, headed by Lady Warnock, which carried out an appraisal of the Royal Opera House, fiercely and, in retrospect it can be seen, intemperately criticised its management. It spoke of a development crisis, a financial crisis, a management crisis. Unattributed, leaked and, incidentally, sexist comment put it more brutally; we could not run a girls' choir. The Warnock committee urged that our development scheme be shelved; it saw no cause for concern in the level of prices we charge; it made no comment on artistic standards achieved, except to recommend a narrowing of ambition. To all this we took exception. But it is, nevertheless, always salutary 'to see ourselves as others see us'. Warnock, insisting that all planning be governed by financial realities, conveyed a useful warning in a deepening recession. The results of the 1990-91 financial year, in which we did better than break even, selling 88 per cent of the financial capacity of the Opera House, were perhaps untypical and would not in any case easily be repeated. In fact, ROH itself had foreseen the danger. Early in 1992 the board commissioned accountants Price Waterhouse to conduct a study of our cost efficiency and working practices. That pointed to possible economies. In the autumn, we tightened our belts, and redoubled our efforts. Extra performances, on a stage already working full out, were crammed into the schedule, and sold. Management structures and communications have been strengthened. Employees, generously and responsibly, have acquiesced in a wage freeze. Economies, within strict cash limits, were imposed. It hurt, but it worked. We end the year wreathed in artistic laurels - for opera a clean sweep of nominations, eight out of eight, for the Olivier Awards - and with a surplus. The accumulated deficit is thereby reduced. We can look our bank manager in the eye. It would be foolish not to concede that Warnock concentrated the mind wonderfully. We shall be stronger for acting on its criticisms. But if this year's results are owed to incompetent management, then I can think of institutions which could do with a dose of the same. Opera and ballet we know are expensive; the forces deployed, dancers, chorus, orchestra, make them so. But they are not elitist art forms. Their followers are numbered in millions; broadcasts on radio and on television carry the work of our three companies into millions of homes each year. The prime minister, in any case, defused the 'elitism' grenade, supposedly lethal in the hands of philistine backbenchers, when he shrewdly linked the arts with sport and other outdoor pleasures. The Royal Opera's subsidy is now down to 27 per cent of its income. This is a lesser proportion than any other UK national company. If higher subsidy were available we should use it principally to reduce or at least restrain prices. If it is not, we shall soldier on. Last year both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera toured Japan. The Foreign Office and the British Council know our worth. In the UK, companies and corporations in the City demonstrate by their support that London needs great opera and ballet, and that they benefit from it. A crunch is coming. The house is falling down. We have to repair the fabric of a loved theatre, built in 1858. We have to modernise a stage not thoroughly re-equipped since the start of this century. We shall improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase the number of performances, particularly matinees. We must rehouse the Royal Ballet, now at Baron's Court, at Covent Garden and gather our workshops under one roof. We shall improve amenities, including air-conditioning, for audiences, and for sponsors. We shall shortly launch a vigorous appeal for funds. But there is one condition precedent to success. If, and only if, matching funds can be identified in the public sector, generous private donors stand ready to play their part; a 50:50 split of a Pounds 90m target. The Royal Opera House, fortified by that partnership, must be enabled to serve the nation in the next millennium. The author is general director of the Royal Opera House</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Observer: ERM - unlucky for some Norman Lamont should be mopping his brow over the fate of City economist Paul Temperton. Unlike the chancellor, who kept his job after September's hiccup on the foreign exchanges, Temperton has succumbed to a row at least partly linked to questions of turbulent currencies. A strong supporter of the European exchange rate mechanism, the 34-year-old has just left his job as head of international economics at the London office of Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank. Right up to Black Wednesday, he was confident Britain would stay in the ERM. Then when events proved him as wrong as the UK government, he had trouble persuading Merrill Lynch colleagues to accept his line that the French franc would resist further devaluation pressures within the mechanism. True, on the franc at least, Temperton has so far been right. But the former Bank of England economist's chagrin increased when a change of house view on the currency was forced through by Merrill's New York office. The upshot is that he and his employer have agreed to end their seven years together. He is setting up on his own as an economic researcher, in collaboration with consultancy Oxford Economic Forecasting which hopes his move will increase its reputation in the City. The effect on his earnings, alas, is in the other direction.</p>

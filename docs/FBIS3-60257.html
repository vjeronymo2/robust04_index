			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Must Turn Words Into Deeds"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hit the nail on the  head when he declared on Wednesday that his Government did not  want rapid economic growth to proceed at the expense of the  environment and social development. This praiseworthy pledge  came amid predictions that the country's gross domestic product  would grow by 8 to 8.5 percent next year, up from anticipated  growth of 7.5 percent this year.    But achieving the worthy goal of progress without pain and  pollution is going to take a lot more than mere words. One  major weapon at his disposal is the Environment Protection  Act--a legacy of the Anan Panyarachun administration. It  provides the mechanism and opportunity with which to curb the  activities of greed-obsessed, influential proponents of  development at any cost. But awareness of the spirit behind the  act, as well as the law itself, has yet to make much of an  impact on the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it.    There is a crying need to educate the educators and launch a  well-coordinated environmental awareness campaign among  government units and members of the general public. The Act can  provide a national blueprint for cleaning and preserving our  natural environment, but this will require the kind of firm  central direction that Mr Chuan seems to have in mind. To put  it even more simply, its provisions must be enforced.    The environment--our air, water, land, forests and other  natural gifts of our country--belong to all of us. As we have  said before and will stress again, this includes not only the  Government and profit-making businesses but also the farmers and  the assembly-line workers, city-dwellers and rural villagers,  military and civilian. No one among any of these groups has  exclusivity. All of us have the responsibility of using  resources without wasting them.    Like most people in the world, we have become aware in  recent  years that the richness of our country is not infinite. There  is still, however, little which could be called a meeting of  minds on how to deal with this growing problem. To some, it  appears that each step forward on environmental matters is met  with two steps backwards and there is a disconcerting lack of  public debate on many issues which affect us all. Too often  they tend to be presented to us as a fait accompli and then the  avoidable agonising and demonstrations begin. The saga of the  Pak Mun dam--rarely out of the headlines for long--provides a  classic example of this.    Although we have a ministry of science, technology and  environment there is a feeling that this government body does  little more than pay lipservice to major environmental concerns.  A broad segment of the population would welcome a ministry with  the mandate to monitor and regulate all developments which fall  under the general heading of environment but there is little  evidence that this exists in an effective form. All concerned  agencies should be gathered together under a single roof so they  can coordinate with each other and work together, rather than  against, each other.    A World Bank report recently noted that pollution in Asia is  growing faster than the region's economies. Our economy doubled  in size from 1975 to 1988, but industrial emissions grew 8 to 12  times worse, the report says. No clearer indication is needed  that it is time to stop the establishment of industries which  pollute, and to force present-day polluters to clean up. There  is no need for new laws or regulations in most cases. These  exist in abundance. The problem is that they also exist in  limbo, far too often. Enforcement of existing anti-pollution  regulations and those governing illegal building would perform a  near miracle to the beginning stage of a true, national  environmental awareness campaign. At present we seem to support  the principle rather than the act of conserving the environment.  Take, for example, the concert outside Khao Yai National Park  in October supposedly to promote environmental awareness. The  irony was that afterwards the ground was strewn with rubbish.    A ministry or department charged with responsibility for the  environment must not only have the powers to enforce these laws  and regulations, but be willing to do so, even when this pits  them against powerful special interest groups. If the  Government is unwilling to use this power, then it cannot claim  to be truly concerned about the environment. Such an entity  must also be made to be responsive to the will of all Thais  because the essence of democracy is that a government is  answerable to its people. For a ministry of environment to be  effective it must invite public debate. Such transparency would  not only be "environmentally friendly"--it would also bring a  breath of fresh air to the workings of government in a  democratic society.    Only by adopting these measures can Mr. Chuan achieve his  commendable goal.</p>

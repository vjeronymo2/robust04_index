			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Councils seek room to settle fire pay dispute LOCAL AUTHORITY employers will tomorrow press the government to give them sufficient financial flexibility to prevent the first national strike in the fire service for 15 years. The local authorities will press their case at a meeting with Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, following Saturday's three-to-one vote by the Fire Brigade Union's delegate conference to hold a strike ballot. The employers - predominantly Labour and Liberal Democratic county and metropolitan councils - have made no secret of their strong sympathy for the firefighters, who are opposed to the suspension for this year of their 15-year-old pay formula, which links firefighters' pay increases to the rise in the upper 25 per cent of male earnings. The employers have already promised the firefighters a return to the pay formula in 1994 despite a second year of tough government-imposed wage restraint. They will be seeking assurances from Mr Howard that he is willing to provide the financial flexibility needed to meet that commitment without forcing cuts in the fire service. Some FBU leaders have said that a guarantee to reinstate the formula would head off the risk of a strike. The earnings figure which determines firefighters' pay will be known on Thursday when the Department of Employment publishes Britain's annual earnings survey. If the figure turns out to be close to the government's 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit, then the employers are expected to meet the firefighters' award in full. The award would be staged, with 1.5 per cent paid this November and the rest coming next spring. A senior local authority employer said yesterday: 'There is a slim chance that the firefighters' dispute can be avoided.' Fire Brigade union leaders are due to resume negotiations with the employers on Friday. But Mr Ken Cameron, the union's general secretary, said yesterday there would be no point in meeting if the employers 'had nothing new to put on the table'. On Saturday, the union's delegates voted by 31,825 to 11,004 to hold a strike ballot which is due to start next Monday. If the ballot goes ahead, the result will be known by November 1 and stoppages could begin after November 8. Firefighters split, Page 10</p>

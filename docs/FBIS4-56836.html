			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Guillermo Quijano, Change `94 vice </F> presidential candidate, at campaign headquarters in Panama City  -- live]    [Text] Citizens: The current times require a great deal of  reflection and positive attitudes for the the nation's future.  Change `94 presented to the voters the best government program  to be implemented by a team of men and women individually and  collectively qualified. This is very true in terms of ability,  proven honesty, and democratic convictions.    The nation will be ruled, starting on 1 September, by a  mandate of a minority of the voters in keeping with our current  laws. Change `94 becomes, as of this moment, a constructive and  overseeing opposition that will guarantee the necessary balance  to watch over the democratic system and the honest execution of  government actions.    We are very proud of the work we carried out and of the  plans  we presented to the nation. We give our eternal and sincere  appreciation to the thousands of Panamanians who believed in us  and who supported our electoral plans and proposals. The  political support we received represents the desire of those who  wished to guarantee the nation's best interests, and that gives  us peace of mind as citizens.    We recognize the national government for offering the nation  a clean and transparent electoral process, thereby imposing on  the newly elected government the commitment to do the same in  1999. We admire and respect our political allies, friends, and  associates for all their work and efforts. Once again, we are  satisfied because we have served Panama while reiterating our  firm willingness to continue to do so. Thank you very much.</p>

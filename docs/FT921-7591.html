			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Budget for expansion agreed by cabinet THE CABINET gave the go-ahead yesterday for an expansionary pre-election Budget against the backdrop of the longest UK recession since the Second World War and an opinion poll putting Labour in the lead. Mr John Major hinted at a significant increase in public borrowing to fund tax cuts expected in the Budget on March 10 - but collided with Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, on spending priorities in an increasingly excited atmosphere at Westminster. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed non-oil output in the UK fell for the sixth successive quarter. Mr Kinnock turned a past Tory election slogan on the prime minister to claim: 'It's official - Majorism isn't working.' Later he said, borrowing for tax cuts was 'a confidence trick'. The NOP poll for The Independent today puts Labour on 42 per cent, four points ahead of the Tories, with the Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent. For the first time in recent months, it also shows more voters believe the Conservative are not competent at economic management than competent. In the same poll last month, Labour led the Tories by 43-40. Labour strategists said election battle lines were clearer. Voters faced a choice between basic rate tax cuts under the Tories or more health service spending and incentives for industry under Labour. In the Commons, Mr Major, who has brought Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, into a campaign 'A team' on election strategy, said the government had spent 'in excess' of the real health spending increases promised by Labour at the 1987 election. He again insisted that a world economic slowdown was to blame for the UK's recession. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph this week, Mr Major said it would be 'prudent' to increase borrowing in a recession. Last night, however, Sir Alan Walters, economic adviser to former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher, undermined Mr Major's stance. He said on Channel Four that Mr Nigel Lawson, former chancellor, was '70 per cent' to blame for the UK's economic problems. The cabinet discussed the Budget for 80 minutes, including a presentation of forecasts by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The figures for gross domestic product exacerbated the 'mood of realism' described by Downing Street. Excluding oil and gas, GDP fell by 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991 compared with the previous quarter. This brought the overall year on year decline for 1991 to 2.5 per cent, the sharpest yearly contraction since 1931. Downing Street acknowledged that lower-than-forecast growth would mean the public sector borrowing requirement as a share of GDP would be 'somewhat higher' than forecast in the Autumn Statement. An official statement said cabinet ministers 'reaffirmed their commitment to prudent management of the public finances'. However, a significant majority of cabinet minsters expects a 1p cut in the basic income tax rate as the showpiece for an April 9 election - likely to be called before the end of Budget week. As ministers pressed Mr Lamont to reconcile the Treasury's insistence on fiscal prudence with the political need for tax cuts, Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, repeated the government's commitment to balance the Budget 'over the economic cycle'. Mr Patten refused to say whether that would imply an obligation to wipe out the need for public borrowing during the lifetime of the next parliament. Mr Lamont, who emerged again from Budget purdah to join Mr Patten at a Westminster press conference attacking Labour's tax plans, refused to answer questions on the government's economic strategy. Colleagues, however, said the chancellor was concerned to lower expectations of a tax-cutting 'bonanza'. In spite of Mr Patten's remarks, some cabinet members are convinced the commitment to a balanced Budget will have to be dropped after the election in order to meet pledges on spending and tax. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said there were 'more ministers spray-painting rosy pictures than there are taking the tough action we need'.

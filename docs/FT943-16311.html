			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: British Bus consolidation move British Bus, the Salisbury-based company, looks set to acquire two of the companies formed as a result of the government's 1987 privatisation of the National Bus Company, further consolidating the industry. The company expects to sign a deal within the next two weeks to acquire Proudmutual Transport Group. This comprises Northumbria Buses and Coaches and Moor-Dale Coaches in north-east England, and Kentish Bus &amp; Coach, now the largest independent operator for London Transport, in north-west Kent and London. It is also waiting to hear whether shareholders in the Luton &amp; District group of companies, which operates in the north-west home counties, have agreed its offer. Luton and District's directors have said that with the industry consolidating into 'four or five' large bus groups their business should become part of such a group. The price offered for the two groups has not been disclosed. British Bus, which operates 2,700 vehicles and employs 5,000 staff, has an annual turnover of more than Pounds 115m. It was formed in December 1992 by a management buy-out of Drawlane Transport. Proudmutual has an annual turnover of about Pounds 49m. It operates more than 700 buses and coaches and has some 2,000 employees. Luton &amp; District operates 500 buses and coaches and employs more than 1,200 people. Last week Perth-based Stagecoach made a recommended Pounds 27.5m share offer for Busways, the main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear, and Aberdeen-based GRT made a recommended offer of Pounds 6.7m for Eastern Counties, which serves the Norwich area.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Ya'el Dan and Mikha Friedman "earlier today"; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Friedman] In the cabinet session today, a demand  will be made that a state commission of inquiry be set up and  that the Hebron settlers be disarmed. What is your position?    [Peres] They went too far this time. They want to bring  disaster to the Jewish nation. These people represent  everything which contradicts the moral stands of Jewish people,  not to mention the political stands. In no way should we let  this go without a response. We must not be intimidated by them.  They must not be given a free hand. The damage they have  caused is hard to imagine.    You know, on occasion, the settlers compare themselves with  those who have been working the land in Israeli kibbutzim and  moshavim. In 80 years of our settling this land, there was never  an incident such as shooting at university students, at a bus,  or at worshipers who pray in the Cave of the Patriarchs from the  back. These are terrible phenomena. And what makes the blood  boil even more are the pictures of the people who speak with  near satisfaction about the incident. This group is a disaster  for the Jewish people. They should be barred from having any  possibility of using firearms.    [Dan] Many practical questions emerge now regarding the  means that should be taken against this population. There is  talk about disarming them, deporting them, placing them under  administrative detention, and so on. What do you think?    [Peres] I say that the most far-reaching steps should be  taken, naturally subject to legal considerations. This morning,  at the cabinet session, I will hear the legal considerations.    [Friedman] Meaning that you first want to hear out the  attorney general?    [Peres] Absolutely.    [Dan] Let us be more specific: Should they be disarmed?    [Peres] I would not want to engage in this. A minister  should not discuss this on the radio; we have a cabinet session  for this. I do not believe that every minister should point to  his personal position. The government should take a bold,  serious, far-reaching stand. The disaster is twofold: One is  what they did, the other is our fearing them. This is a  disaster as well.    [Friedman] Do you regret today the move of a previous  government in which you served to set up the settlement of  Qiryat Arba' at the heart of Arab Hebron.    [Peres] What difference does it make today? The reason to  set up Qiryat Arba' was to avoid settling in the heart of  Hebron. Eventually, they set up Qiryat Arba' but also settled in  Hebron. Everything we were afraid of actually happened. We knew  in advance that a settlement in Hebron would lead to bloody  events. We knew it was only a matter of time before they take  place and cast a shadow on the whole enterprise. Therefore,  even if such a decision was made, it was carried out in a  twisted manner.    [Friedman] And now, Mr. Peres, there is a political process  at the end of which, when the negotiations are completed, a  Palestinian autonomy will be set up in the territories. Do you  believe such an autonomy can be effectively managed in a way  that would eventually lead us to a comprehensive peace agreement  with the Palestinians, when such a nucleus resides in the heart  of Arab Hebron? Or should they be evacuated from there?    [Peres] This nucleus will not manage the State of Israel nor  the policy of Israel. This is not the first time that Jewish  factions depart from the nation. We will not allow such people  to manage the State of Israel, on its or on our behalf. The  appropriate measures should be taken. We are not a miserable  nation. We have the power not to allow murderers to represent  the Jewish people.</p>

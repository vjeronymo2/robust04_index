			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: France accuses US of blackmail over Gatt deal MR JEAN-NOEL Jeanneney, the French foreign trade minister, yesterday accused the US of blackmail in the Uruguay round of world trade negotiations and said there was no reason to conclude a rapid agreement purely to accommodate the US elections. Speaking to the Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce in Bangkok along with Mr Amaret Sila-On, his Thai counterpart, Mr Jeanneney condemned Washington for focusing on agricultural trade in the negotiations and demanding what he called one-sided concessions from Europe. 'We are bound to denounce this blackmail,' he said. 'We and you both are victims.' He reiterated the rebuttal by France and the European Community of the draft agreement prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). In January, the EC trade and farm ministers agreed that the draft was a 'reference document for the final phase of negotiations' but said that 'insofar as the 'Dunkel paper' calls into question the foundation of the Community's agricultural policy, the paper is not acceptable and therefore has to be modified'. The French minister yesterday suggested that the proposed March 31 deadline for concluding the deal could be set aside. 'We will not accept . . . a bad agreement, to beat a deadline set only by the American electoral timetable,' he said. Seen from a developing country such as Thailand, the dispute between the EC and the US over farm trade looks like an argument over the relative merits of different types of protectionism. Mr Amaret politely but pointedly contradicted the French minister and urged that Mr Dunkel's text be adopted as the basis for the final Gatt negotiations. 'Thailand believes that all countries are justified in wanting to protect their farmers and all of us have done foolish things in that regard,' he said. 'But we achieve nothing by finger-pointing. Thai fingers are too small to be noticed by the Europeans or the Americans anyway.'</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kodak unravels a multi-billion dollar web - Derivatives Paying off Dollars 5bn of debt and retiring Dollars 7bn worth of swaps and options must rank as one of the biggest balance sheet restructuring operations. For Eastman Kodak, which is undertaking the process, the result is likely to be a charge to earnings that runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars - though its derivatives strategy has cut the company's borrowing costs over a number of years. Kodak took on the debt in 1988 to finance its purchase of Sterling, a drugs company. On top of this debt - a mixture of fixed-rate and zero-coupon bonds, much of it callable - the US photographic products company layered an array of interest rate and currency swaps, along with interest options. Its overall aim at the time was to restructure the debts, in part to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities between the corporate debt and derivative markets. 'There were two objectives - one was to reduce borrowing costs, the other was to receive cash,' says Mr Jesse Greene, Kodak's current treasurer. One arbitrage exploited by Kodak in the late 1980s, for example, involved the use of callable debt linked with options to create synthetic fixed-rate debt. The company issued callable bonds, then sold call options in the market to receive an immediate cash premium. If interest rates fell, Kodak could pay off the bonds at the call date - but at the same time, the buyer of the option could exercise its own call on Kodak. The effect for the company was indistinguishable from issuing straight fixed-rate debt at the outset, except that it received premium income on the option. This arbitrage strategy is thought to have saved the company 10-15 basis points on its borrowing costs. As a result, about Dollars 2.8bn of the Dollars 7.5bn notional value of Kodak's derivative instruments at the end of last year comprised options linked to callable debt. Elsewhere, Kodak had taken advantage of a variety of arbitrages to reduce its borrowing costs. It had, for example, swapped Dollars 135m of fixed rate dollar bonds into yen-denominated instruments, and Dollars 46m into D-Marks, in both cases to reduce its costs. The overall holdings of derivatives to which this sort of opportunistic debt management policy gives rise can look like a grab-bag. That the notional value of the instruments - at Dollars 7bn - is higher than the value of the debt, and the mix of instruments is so broad, testifies to the layering of different approaches over time. Such an approach to debt management is common among big companies with sophisticated treasury operations, says Mr Irving Wilson, a managing director at CS Financial Products who has worked on balance sheet restructuring. According to Kodak and CS Financial Products and Lehman Brothers, its advisers, unwinding the derivatives positions has been relatively straight forward and not resulted in unusual costs: swaps have been in the liquid US dollar, yen and D-Mark markets making it easy to reverse trades without affecting overall market spreads. Mr Greene says in most cases the unwinding was done with the original counterparties to the instruments, though the company accepted outside bids for parts of the portfolio. For Kodak shareholders, there will be one simple way to assess how successful Kodak has been with the programme. In its quarterly reports for the end of June, Kodak revealed that its long-term borrowings had a fair value that was about Dollars 241m above the value at which they were recorded in the company's accounts (since the debt was issued at a time when interest rates were higher than at present, Kodak would in theory have to pay this amount to buy the debt back). Its swaps and options, meanwhile, were showing a fair value some Dollars 370m below the level at which they were recorded. The message: the whole debt-retirement package would have cost Dollars 611m at that time - that was at least an advance on the end of 1993, when lower prevailing interest rates meant the cost to the company of retiring the debt would have been nearly Dollars 1.2bn. Kodak has reported pre-tax costs of Dollars 162m from unwinding its various positions. Bond yields have risen slightly from their June levels, bringing down the cost of the programme. However, the message from quarterly report is that there are several hundred million dollars worth of charges still to come.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 27 Feb (EFE) -- It was disclosed today  that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) command last  night released a communique demanding free and democratic  elections, the Mexican Government's resignation, and its  replacement by a transition government that will guarantee  equality.    To guarantee free elections, the EZLN has called for the  legalization of the presence and participation of citizens in  the observation of the electoral process, thus sanctioning the  process' legality and guaranteeing the elections' legitimacy.    The EZLN command establishes that a necessary condition for  democratic elections is the resignation of authorities "who  attained power through electoral frauds" and the formation of a  transition government so there will be equality and respect for  all political trends.    The sixth day of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis'  dialogue with the EZLN representatives and the mediation of  Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, concluded  with a communique that points out that the peace dialogue  sessions have continued in a spirit of work and responsibility.    "We cannot overlook" -- the document states -- "that at this  time we are dealing with the most critical part of the  agreements. This means that we will work with a spirit of  responsibility. We are aware that everything that is agreed  upon at the dialogue in Chiapas will have profound repercussions  on the country's future."    The communique, signed by "Subcommander Marcos,"  Commissioner  Manuel Camacho, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz, points out that the  joint effort, seriousness, work, and exchange of ideas for the  purpose of listening to and understanding each other to find the  best possible solutions will culminate in positive results.    The EZLN and Mexican Government are in a negotiations  process  to resolve the armed conflict that began on 1 January with the  EZLN insurrection and the armed clashes that cost the lives of  at least 200 people, wounded approximately 500, and displaced  thousands from their hometowns in the mountains of Chiapas.    During the six days that have passed since the peace talks  began at the San Cristobal Cathedral, progress has been made on  approximately 50 percent of the scheduled agenda, the part that  deals with the immediate and urgent demands of the Indian  population. Nevertheless, the current discussion has come down  to the points that deal with Mexico's general problems,  including political issues and demands such as the demand for  democratic elections and the mechanisms to guarantee equality  and legitimacy.</p>

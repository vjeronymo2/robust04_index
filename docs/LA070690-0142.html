			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: IRVINE CONCERT AN AURAL AND ORAL TREAT  </P> <P> "We're waving the flag, not burning it!"  </P> <P> With that, Marcy Mulville waved Old Glory with gusto on Wednesday night at the  Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, site of the "All-American Celebration" concert by  the Pacific Symphony.  </P> <P> Mulville, the lively chairwoman of the symphony board, joined about 100 music  buffs for the Fourth of July gourmet picnic that accompanied the start of the  orchestra's popular summer series.  </P> <P> Available for sampling on tables set up in the orchestra pit: tender  honey-baked ham with mustard sauce, corn-bread muffins and a crisp salad tossed  with a rainbow of posies (nice touch). Mini pecan pies and steaming coffee  arrived at intermission. The picnic fare was whisked to the tables -- set with  gold-edged ivory china and spotless linens -- in huge baskets wrapped in  firecracker-red cellophane.  </P> <P> And while the food was something to write home about, it was the brut champagne  that gave this event its gourmet status. Guests could toss the bubbly down with  dinner or savor it -- chilled as it was in elegant silver buckets -- throughout  the concert.  </P> <P> Pacific Symphony supporters have a good thing going. For $2,700 per table of  four, subscribers can enjoy all five summer concerts and dine grandly in the  orchestra pit every time. Each ticket really costs $1,200 (actually, you get  eight tickets -- four for the dinner table and four for the stands -- should  you desire to be serenaded somewhere other than in the pit). The remaining  $1,500 is a tax-deductible donation, according to symphony organizers.  </P> <P> Guests can also pack their own picnic fare. Joyce and Jim Justice, trying out  their table for the first time, dined on chilled veal loin with peppercorn  sauce, caviar, smoked salmon, fruit compote and chocolate mousse cake. "This is  so much nicer than the Hollywood Bowl," Joyce said. "There, you're lucky if you  get a decent table."  </P> <P> After the concert, which included the classic "Rhapsody in Blue" (performed on  a red, white and blue Baldwin by pianist Evans Haile), concert-goers were  treated to a 20-minute fireworks extravaganza.  </P> <P> Also on the scene: board members Anne and Tom Key (she in a white shirt  spangled with red stars, he telling fellow picnickers that he is a distant  relative of Francis Scott Key), Gina and Reed Royalty, Charles and Geraldine  Spencer, Gene and Nadine Layton, Martin and Margie Hubbard, Charles and Pat  Poss, and Louis Spisto.  </P></p>

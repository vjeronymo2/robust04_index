			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Hong Kong market ban on Standard Chartered Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, was yesterday banned from taking part in Hong Kong stock market flotations until April after being found guilty of funding illegal share-support schemes. The ban, imposed by the Securities and Futures Commission, which oversees Hong Kong's financial markets, follows renewed efforts by regulators to curb financial malprac-tice. More than 20 executives and traders employed by Standard's Chartered's investment banking arms have resigned after an inquiry by the commission which found the bank guilty of breaking exchange rules in the cases of six public offerings. Analysts said the incident renewed questions about Standard Chartered's ability to control operations. It had to make a Pounds 269m bad debt provision in 1992 to cover losses arising from a securities trading scandal in Bombay. The commission said Standard Chartered Securities, the bank's stockbroking arm, had funded improper share-support schemes for six listed companies between July 1991 and March 1993. The offences included one case in which it lent money to the directors of a company to buy shares in the company's flotation. In others, it allowed employees to trade against clients through private accounts with other brokers. As well as imposing a temporary ban on the brokerage, the commission censured Standard Chartered Asia, its sister merchant bank, for acquiescing in the misconduct. The merchant bank had advised some of the new issues. Standard Chartered will now have to operate the broker and merchant bank separately, re-imposing a traditional separation between the two. The commission plans to decide whether the bank's former employees are fit and proper persons to work in the securities industry. Some resigned at the bank's insistence before regulators became involved. Mr Malcolm Williamson, Standard Chartered's chief executive, said the bank regretted the incident and was strengthening controls. Lex, Page 24 Standard Chartered called to account, Page 32</p>

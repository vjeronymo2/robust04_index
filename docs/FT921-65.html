			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / BSkyB and BBC seek joint football rights BRITISH SKY Broadcasting and the BBC are to try to acquire jointly the television rights to cover the games of the new football Premier League being formed out of the old first division. Negotiations are expected to get under way in the next couple of weeks. The attempt to try to get access to the new league follows the success of BSkyB's exclusive coverage of the World Cup cricket in Australia in boosting sales of dishes. Under the arrangement, the BBC would at least get the rights to recorded highlights of the Premier League games, and also possibly some live coverage. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC Television, is determined that football should stay with the BBC. In a three-way auction for live games between ITV, which has the rights to current league games, and BSkyB, it is unlikely that the BBC would be able bid highest. BSkyB, the satellite television network in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a stake, already has a shared coverage arrangement with the BBC over FA Cup games. That was inherited from British Satellite Broadcasting when it merged with Sky. Under the deal the BBC has live coverage rights from the semi-finals onwards. Negotiations might be further complicated by the arrival of Full Time Communications, a new company offering Pounds 50m a year for 10 years for football rights. The company wants to launch a 24-hour satellite football channel covering all the English games.</p>

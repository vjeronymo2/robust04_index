Staff at the Cardiff headquarters of Companies House were more than a little surprised to get a call from their colleagues at the Post Office the other day pressing them to settle an overdue bill. Given that the nine-day mail strike in Wales has pushed many small companies to the verge of bankruptcy and the business of Companies House itself is less than 30 per cent of normal, it might have been thought that the excuse that the cheque was in the post would be sufficient explanation. The PO ordered Companies House to cancel its cheque and said it would send a messenger round to collect a new one. Sensibly, Companies House told the PO what it could do with its messenger.</p>

The Administrator or SBCAPCD shall consult with the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard prior to inspections. This shall in no way interfere with the ability of EPA or SBCAPCD to conduct unannounced inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) SBCAPCD shall implement and enforce the Federal requirements of 40 CFR 55.13 as well as the applicable state and local requirements contained in 40 CFR 55.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The primary responsibility for enforcement of the OCS air regulations delegated to the District shall rest with the SBCAPCD.

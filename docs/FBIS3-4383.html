Ltd., a joint venture between China Aerospace Corporation and  the Computervision Corporation (CV) of the United States, was  set up here today.    Song Jian, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge  of  the State Science and Technology Commission, met here today with  Russel E. Planitzer, chairman and chief executive of the CV  Corporation, who came here to attend the inauguration ceremony  of the joint venture.    The newly-established joint venture will concentrate on the  development of software for computer-aided design (CAD) and  computer aided manufacture (CAM), and sell the products both in  China and in the international market.    Liu Jiyuan, general manager of China Aerospace Corporation,  said that more than ten years ago China's aerospace industry  began to introduce CAD and CAM software from the CV Corporation  for researching and manufacturing various rockets and  satellites, with fairly fruitful results.    Now China Aerospace Corporation has made computer  application  as one of the three pillar industries producing civil products  with aerospace science and technology, and the corporation will  further expand foreign economic and technological cooperation  and exchange in this field, Liu added.    Sources said that the CV Corporation is a world-renowned  software producer, with a history of 25 years. Last year it had  a total sales income of 800 million U.S. dollars, some 18  percent of the world's machinery engineering software market.</p>

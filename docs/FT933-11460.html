			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / BT warns despite advance BRITISH Telecommunications reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 757m in the quarter to June 30, a 3 per cent increase. The comparable figure left aside the effects of selling non-core businesses, on which a Pounds 135m loss was incurred. First quarter turnover rose 2.9 per cent to Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 3.24bn). Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, described the results as 'encouraging, showing growth in both UK and international call volumes'. But he sounded a warning note on the regulatory and competitive pressures faced by BT. Under an agreement with the telecoms watchdog Oftel, BT is obliged to reduce prices for core services to a figure 7.5 per cent below the retail prices index for the coming 12 months. Nearly 60 per cent of BT's revenue will be affected. Analysts also expect BT to lose about 3 per cent of UK market share over the next year, as Mercury - which has about 10 per cent - and cable TV companies make advances in the residential market. Oftel is considering plans which could improve terms for competitors to connect with the BT network. Revenue from international calls rose nearly 15 per cent to Pounds 499m during the quarter, and there was an 8 per cent rise in income from telephone line rentals to Pounds 595m. Inland traffic was flat at Pounds 1.26bn. Using a 12-month moving average, inland call turnover growth was 2 per cent up, but discount packages and the effect of last year's Oftel price cap kept revenue static. Capital spending on plant and property fell from Pounds 492m to Pounds 467m. BT denied that there had been a decision to invest less at home following the company's recent Dollars 4.3bn purchase of a stake in MCI, the second largest US carrier. It said that two thirds of UK customer lines were now connected to digital telephone exchanges. As at June 30, BT employed 169,500 people, down 1,200 in the quarter, cutting staff costs by 3.7 per cent. A further 30,000 posts are to be shed over the next two years. Operating costs increased 1.9 per cent to Pounds 2.52bn, largely as a result of increased payments to overseas operators for delivery of international calls. Earnings per share rose from an adjusted 7.8p to 7.9p.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Labour seeks to combat 'lies' of opponents Forget the promises and read between the lines. Labour's priority was clear yesterday as the party's leaders launched their European manifesto, Make Europe Work for You. The aim, as Mrs Joyce Quin, European affairs spokeswoman, put it, was simple: to combat Conservative 'lies' about Labour's policies. The manifesto makes it clear that, contrary to Conservative claims, Labour wants to retain the British veto on European directives in areas of key national interest such as fiscal and budgetary policy, foreign and security issues, and changes to the Treaty of Rome. A Labour government would sign up 'immediately' to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, from which Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured a controversial opt-out. But the manifesto rejects the Tory claim that the party has signed up to a compulsory 35-hour working week - even though such a directive is canvassed in the manifesto of the European Socialist Group, to which Labour is affiliated. It says shorter working hours are one of 'many possible approaches', but this is 'a matter primarily for agreement between employers and employees, taking care to protect people at work from exploitation'. There are plenty of other policy pledges: reform of the 'wasteful' Common Agricultural Policy; enlargement of the European Union to include all democratic states with good human rights records and independent courts. The manifesto also urges more powers for the EU in relatively uncontroversial areas such as control of cross-border environmental pollution; and institutional reforms to open the Council of Ministers to the public and force it to record and publish its votes. But there will be more interest in what the party leaders left out. The manifesto leaves many questions unanswered about Labour's long-term approach to the key issues which must be settled if European integration is to continue. For example, the manifesto repeats Labour's established support for a managed system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates as part of a movement towards economic and monetary union. It makes clear such a step could be taken only after convergence of both the real and the monetary economies of member states. But it also urges the EU to take 'further steps to promote such convergence' at the next inter-governmental conference of member states in 1996. The manifesto does not say what those steps should be, or whether the system of managed exchange rates means a return to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, from which the UK withdrew in disarray in 1992, or to some other system. The manifesto also ignores the crucial question of how to reform the qualified majority voting system in the Council of Ministers. Labour leaders say the issue - how to prevent groups of small countries from out voting big countries on important issues - is still under consideration. There is also no hint on whether the party thinks moves towards a single currency or other fundamental steps towards European integration should be approved in a referendum. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting party leader, said a referendum had not been ruled out, but no such commitment appears in the manifesto. In the meantime, Labour seeks to rely on co-operation between member states to implement co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policies. The mechanism for this would include co-ordinated interest rate cuts, creation of a Europe-wide 'recovery fund' to generate jobs, and incentives to encourage investment in manufacturing and infrastructure projects. Mrs Beckett claimed that Labour offered a balance between the Conservatives' 'confusion and disunity' on Europe and the Liberal Democrats' 'unconditional, unquestioning support' for Brussels. 'With Labour, you get the right balance. A party committed to Europe and to Britain's place at the centre of Europe. But equally determined to use that strength and authority in the interests of Britain and its people,' she said.</p>

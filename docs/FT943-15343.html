			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Paying in advance Would it be in order, during March 1995, to pay in advance the electricity and gas bills due during the period April 1995 to end-March 1996? This would avoid paying the full rate of 17 1/2 per cent VAT which comes into force during that time. Yes. You will avoid the increase to the extent you make payments in advance and there is no restriction in relation to bills for which any advance payment is made. You can make a payment of estimated bills for as many years as you wish but the amount of any saving will depend on interest rates applying after the advance payment has been made. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

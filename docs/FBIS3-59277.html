			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, November 23 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai  Xerox Copier Company, a Sino-U.S. joint venture, on Monday [21  November] announced the development of a new multi-functional  product -- the Xerox 5416 copier.    At a news conference here to introduce the new product, Paul  Allaire, chairman and chief executive officer of the Xerox  Corporation of the United States, said that the Chinese-designed  new product was not only a "pride" for the Xerox Corporation,  but also a "glory" for Shanghai and the whole of China.    He said that like other Xerox products, the new copier  enjoys  the full quality guarantee of his company.    A new factory will be built in Brazil later this year to  manufacture the new copiers with parts provided by the Shanghai  Xerox Company and it will begin exporting to southern Latin  America early next year, he said.    Joseph Donaro, general manager of the Shanghai Xerox Copier  Company, said that in developing the new copier, Chinese workers  and technicians received full support and assistance from the  Xerox Corporation of the United States.    "So we should say the new product is a crystallization of  cooperation between Chinese and American engineers and  designers," he added.    The 5416 copier -- 550 mm wide, 340 mm high and weighing 45  kilograms -- is the smallest of Xerox copiers. It takes just 30  seconds to start it.    Since it opened in 1987 with a total investment of $30  million, the Shanghai Xerox Company has built 60,000 copiers,  1,300 of which have been exported to Western Europe. It has  acquired a 50 percent share of the Chinese mainland's market.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATORS IN WHEELCHAIRS SEIZED DURING CAPITOL PROTEST  </P> <P> Disabled demonstrators in wheelchairs were arrested in the U.S. Capitol today  after confronting House leaders with demands for quick passage of legislation  guaranteeing them civil rights protections.  </P> <P> A crowd of more than 100 demonstrators threatened civil disobedience and  interrupted House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and House Republican Leader Bob  Michel as the congressional leaders tried to speak over the din in the  cavernous Capitol Rotunda.  </P> <P> After the congressmen left, about 70 of the people with disabilities assembled  in the center of the Rotunda and began chanting in a planned attempt to provoke  arrest. Capitol police, standing nearby, encircled the protesters and began  taking them into custody.  </P> <P> Outside the Capitol, government-owned vans were lined up, and police began  placing the protesters -- most in wheelchairs -- into the vehicles.  </P></p>

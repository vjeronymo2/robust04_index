			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The individual trading  of foreign exchange has become a favorite investment business  among residents in China's largest economic center.    According to the latest statistics, a total of 15,000 deals  involving 100 million U.S. dollars have been concluded since  last December, when the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China  and the communications bank started such business.    At present, individuals with foreign currency in hand may  exchange it according to the rates on the international foreign  exchange market.    Until late last year all privately owned foreign exchange  had  to be deposited in banks.    Wang Qinpei, an official of the Shanghai branch of the  Communications Bank, said that the individual savings deposits  in foreign exchange in banks in Shanghai had risen from less  than 100 million U.S. dollars in 1987 to 2.4 billion U.S.  dollars by the end of last year, accounting for about one fifth  of the country's total private foreign exchange savings deposits.</p>

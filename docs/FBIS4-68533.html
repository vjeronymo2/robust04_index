			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golovenko: "Foreign Currency Etude, or </F> How Foreign Consuls and Ambassadors Took Revenge Against Our  Auditor With the Aid of Government Officials"]    [Text] Perhaps I am mistaken, but it seems to me that no  event in the State Duma since the declaration of political  amnesty has been as socially significant for Russia as Tuesday's  parliamentary hearings before the Committee on Security. On the  surface, the agenda looked more trivial than intriguing:  "Incidents of the Flagrant Violation of Tax and Labor Laws by  Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia." On the surface, it  seemed as though this would lead to the same kind of banal  arguments that were once heard in the USSR Committee of People's  Control. Just imagine, the chief of the tax inspectorate was  dismissed, reinstated by a court, and then driven out of office  again. Is this kind of labor dispute a matter for discussion by  the Committee on Security?    In fact, questions of this kind were the "warm-up exercises"  of a group of committee members: Must we, they asked, become  involved in this? Would it not be better to send the files to  judicial agencies? And why did some of us receive the  information late? Would it not be better to form a commission to  review all of this?    Committee Chairman V. Ilyukhin, who also chaired the  hearings, dismissed the unfounded complaints and called for  constructive work. We journalists and the members of the  committee were handed a thick pile of documents providing an  excellent illustration of the criminal history of the discussion  topic. Incidentally, PRAVDA reported it in an article entitled  "Why Is Filippov in Charge?" on 14 December last year. Now some  new facts of the case have come to light.    Dmitriy Nikolayevich Filippov is one of the administrators  whom the so-called "democrats" described with what they  perceived as the offensive term "party nomenklatura." Suffice it  to say that he was sent by the Komsomol Central Committee to  head the BAM [Baykal-Amur Trunk Line Project] staff and was  serving as secretary of the Leningrad Party Obkom in charge of  industrial affairs in August 1991 before the overthrow of the  CPSU. During the years of "reform" he put together a tax  inspectorate in Leningrad literally from scratch--an absolutely  new and unfamiliar undertaking. He repeatedly said that this  structure was completely depoliticized: All forms of ownership,  he said, are the same to us. The important thing is the  observance of the laws and the payment of taxes. The press has  had enough to say about the concealment of income by cooperative  managers--the former "saviors of the economy." They had planned  to use the same little tricks when they turned their shops into  small businesses, private enterprises, and joint ventures, but  how were they to conceal dividends from Filippov and his people,  who were well aware of the potential of each large and small  plant in the city? Filippov also set up a tax police force to  investigate cases of unreported income and went after the street  vendors who had no intention of complying with all of the edicts  and decrees mandating the use of control cash registers. Soon  people from dozens of oblasts were coming to him for advice.  After all, this was something absolutely new! Even Mayor A.  Sobchak held him up as an example, once saying approximately the  following when he addressed the team of inspectors: "The State  Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg took shape quickly, and it  is largely due to this that we do not have a budget deficit, and  have even been able to do a great deal for people in the social  sphere."    This "great deal" consisted in subsidies for bread, benefits  for low-income households, free breakfasts for schoolchildren,  free transportation for senior citizens, and so forth. This  actually turned out to be the key: By going after the  businessmen who did not report their income and did not pay  taxes, Filippov's service had supplemented the municipal and  republic budgets considerably, but it soon became apparent that  he was serving not the regime, but the teachers, health care  personnel, students, and staffers of scientific establishments  whose wages had always been held up by the government, forcing  them to go on strike. Filippov had put together a team of  competent and experienced inspectors, some of whom were rumored  to have come from the KGB.    All of the inspections, voluminous documents, fines, and  penalties understandably irritated the schemers who had  established so many enterprises, commercial structures, and  private shops. The city's chief financial inspector began  receiving calls from the mayor's office, advising him to "stop  digging so deep." Here are just a few of the incidents he  related to the committee:    "When we went after a sacred cow, the Property Fund, we were  absolutely stunned by the scales of the fraud we uncovered.  Inspections revealed undistributed (in other words,  concealed--Ed.) resources in the amount of 6.623 billion rubles.  Of course, we charged them a penalty of almost 400 million and a  fine of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. You can understand why  they were annoyed. We also learned that 44,000 vouchers were  inexplicably missing in this privatized establishment and that  Fund Deputy General Director Fishkov had been arrested for a  discrepancy of 134 million rubles in privatization checks....    "We also learned that the fund had privatized whole city  blocks and port facilities in violation of the law, but the  biggest surprise came later: The fund did not transfer all of  its receipts to the proper account, but allowed commercial banks  'to make use of its money' at a ridiculously low rate of  interest--a whole 2 percent!    "We are not children, after all," Dmitriy Nikolayevich told  the deputies, "and we have to understand that commercial agents  are not being offered these unimaginable privileges just for  their good looks."    A genuine storm broke out when D. Filippov formed a special  group to inspect the joint ventures. After all, he managed to go  where most inspectors would not venture. And just imagine, the  very first audit of the Europa Hotel revealed an amazing  panorama of theft. This joint venture preferred to keep its  dividends in Stockholm, naturally without contributing a single  cent to our budget. The financial inspector fined the Swedes 5  million dollars, but as Dmitriy Nikolayevich put it, "it will  take much more effort to force them to return the 25 million  dollars that are working for the Swedish economy."    The auditors also ruffled the feathers of "Lenraumamebel,"  the joint venture so dear to A. Sobchak's heart. This respected  establishment was manufacturing furniture with cheap energy and  manpower, from raw materials that were so inexpensive they were  almost free, and selling 90 percent of it for hard currency  abroad. The currency was then put in circulation there,  promoting the "rebirth of Finland."    "When we ordered the Finns to return the hard currency and  pay the taxes," Filippov continued, "they sent a whole team of  ambassadors and consuls after me. They accused me of trying to  'sabotage Yeltsin's policy.' I replied that I was supporting his  policy by forcing them to abide by his edicts and our laws."    I saw the journalists sitting around me exchange looks when  the speaker added another detail to his account: The ambassadors  and consuls insinuated that he had a choice of officials who  would order him to leave their joint venture in peace. Did he  want a call from Sobchak or from a member of the Russian  Government?    The call came soon.... On 11 October, after the well-known  tragic events (which were immediately recalled by the people  gathered there), Russia's Chief State Tax Inspector V. Gusev  dismissed D. Filippov from his job without any explanation.  Filippov was not intimidated and was soon reinstated by the  Sverdlovskiy Rayon People's Court in Moscow. This was followed  by a bureaucratic ruse we used to hear about in the days of the  reprisals against undesirable people's controllers and other  auditors: On 3 November the position occupied by D. Filippov in  St. Petersburg was eliminated by order of V. Chernomyrdin  himself. His duties were reassigned to another individual, who  was given the title of deputy chief of the Russian State Tax  Service. Who was this individual?    We were told that he was a livestock breeder, a former  sovkhoz director who later worked on the mayor's staff. Then the  effusive Deputy A. Nevzorov addressed V. Gusev:    "You removed a first-rate specialist from office, saying he  was remiss in his duties. He probably has no equal in all of  Mother Russia, and you replaced him with a man with no  experience in auditing tax records or catching swindlers."    The chief tax inspector turned red in the face and did not  know how to respond to the subsequent barrage of questions. How  had D. Filippov, whom he had praised earlier and held up as an  example, suddenly become "unsatisfactory"? Who had made the  phone call from the Council of Ministers to order his dismissal?  If he was guilty of some kind of "negligence," then why did the  order for his dismissal state "staff reduction" as the reason?    In a message to State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin, the dismissed  financial inspector named some specific reasons for his  expulsion: "According to Deputy Chief Yu.M. Ulyanov of the  Russian State Tax Service, the reasons were a letter from Mayor  A.A. Sobchak of St. Petersburg and the pressure exerted by First  Vice Premier Ye.T. Gaydar"....    I could also cite an extremely intriguing excerpt from the  report proposed by committee members and journalists. It says  that A. Sobchak, A. Chubays, Ye. Gaydar, and former Minister of  Finance V. Fedorov were involved in the "unwarranted" dismissal  of V. Filippov from his job.    This is the kind of leverage the offended ambassadors and  consuls used to get rid of a financial inspector who was too  intractable and too incorruptible! Chubays, Gaydar, and Fedorov  did not grace the committee session with their presence,  although they were invited to attend, and could not explain the  "grounds for the dismissal."    Representatives of the counterintelligence services, the  Security Council, the tax police, and the RF Procuracy and  deputies S. Govorukhin, Yu. Vlasov, A. Nevzorov, N. Krivelskaya,  and other speakers discussed the widespread misappropriation of  the country's natural resources and foreign currency and the  colossal sums that have settled in foreign banks. Just as the  chemical composition of the ocean can be judged from a single  drop of water, speakers remarked, the plundering of Russia can  be judged from this single case. And the most frightening aspect  of the matter is that the incorruptible and highly professional  specialist was objectionable to government officials. Then whom  are they serving? This leads to the obvious conclusion that we  are no longer the masters of our own country, now that a  principled employee acting in the interest of his country can be  dismissed from his job simply at the request of a foreign consul  or ambassador.    Summing up the debate, Committee Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin  had  this to say: There is money in Russia. There is enough money for  the miners, the students, and the teachers. But this money is  being rerouted to commercial entities through artificial  channels. What we are witnessing is the deliberate destruction  of the state: Mutual nonpayments cause millions of people to  suffer and stop the work of plants and factories. Much of the  blame has to be accepted by the government, which, as we have  seen, has little interest in supplementing the state treasury.</p>

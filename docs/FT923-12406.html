			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Belgian MPs ratify Maastricht Belgian MPs yesterday gave an overwhelming 'yes' to the Maastricht treaty in the lower chamber's final act before the summer break, writes Andrew Hills from Brussels. The country's upper chamber, the Senate, should complete the ratification process in the autumn. The margin was 146 votes to 33 with three absentions, but the result was never in doubt. Belgium is perhaps the EC's most enthusiastic member and this week's debate was characterised only by its extreme torpor.</p>

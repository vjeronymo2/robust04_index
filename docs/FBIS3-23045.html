One was killed and three others were injured in the attack.  One of the arrested Arabs is a Lebanese named Asad Baz who was  charged with attempted murder. The other two, Malay Muhammad  and Bassam Riyati, both Jordanians, are accused of possessing  weapons and obstructing justice.    The New York police chief said that detectives found what he  described as a veritable arsenal in the home of the Lebanese  suspect. When asked if there was a link between the attack on  the Jewish Americans in New York and the Hebron massacre, the  police chief said that he did not rule out any possibility.</p>

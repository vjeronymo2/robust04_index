			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EMOTIONAL HEARING ENDS IN PRISON TERM FOR DRUNK DRIVER WHO KILLED GIRL, 8  </P> <P> In a hearing that a prosecutor characterized as the most emotional he had ever  seen, a 62-year-old Sepulveda man was sentenced Wednesday to two years in  prison for striking and killing an 8-year-old girl while driving drunk.  </P> <P> The victim's mother, Claudia Morales, gave defendant Thomas Michael Murray a  Bible before he was sentenced for killing Jessica Morales on July 25 in North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "It was one of the most emotionally draining hearings I've ever been at because  the loss was so great -- an 8-year-old daughter -- and yet the victim's parents  were such compassionate people," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Dver, who  prosecuted the case. "And the defendant was not a horrible or a bad person but  a man with a serious drinking problem who acted incredibly irresponsibly."  </P> <P> Murray was driving east on Victory Boulevard when he swerved his vehicle across  three lanes of traffic, drove onto the sidewalk and struck the girl. She was  thrown about 60 feet and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.  </P> <P> Fighting to talk through tears, Claudia Morales of North Hollywood told Murray  that she does not hate him for killing her daughter. But she said she hoped  that he would be punished because he had caused herself and her family so much  pain.  </P> <P> Murray, who according to a probation report has not held a steady job in  several years, pleaded guilty before his preliminary hearing Aug. 18 to one  count of vehicular manslaughter in the death. No special sentencing favors were  promised in exchange for the plea, Dver said.  </P> <P> Dver characterized Murray as "extremely remorseful about what he had done." The  probation report quoted Murray as saying he feels intense guilt.  </P> <P> Murray's attorney, Robert Crider, asked the court to give Murray probation and  sentence him to an alcohol treatment program. But Van Nuys Superior Court Judge  Kathryne A. Stoltz said she believed that the seriousness of the crime mandated  a prison sentence.  </P> <P> Murray, who has two prior drunk-driving convictions in another state, could  have received a maximum sentence of four years in prison, but Stoltz said she  balanced aggravating and mitigating factors in determining the sentence. The  aggravating factors were the two earlier convictions and that Murray was  driving without a license and was an alcoholic. Mitigating factors were  Murray's remorse, his age and the lack of a criminal record other than the two  drunk-driving convictions.  </P></p>

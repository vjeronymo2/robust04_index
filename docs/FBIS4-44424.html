			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ma Xiaohe (7456 2556 3109), affiliated with the </F> State Planning Commission's Economic Studies Institute: "The  GATT and China's Agricultural Development"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  I. Favorable GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture </H5>   Once we "recover our GATT seat," Chinese agriculture will  first acquire the proper profit and development opportunities,  mainly in the following areas:    1. It will contribute to the export of Chinese farm  products and their manufactured goods. As China is a large  agricultural developing country, farm products and their  maunfactured goods have always occupied a crucial position in  our export trade. Meanwhile, most Chinese farm products still  have a clear price advantage in export trade, with most of our  domestic farm product prices now being generally lower than  their international market prices. If we export these farm  products to the international market, they will be highly  competitive. So China must and can sharply expand its export  trade in farm products and their manufactured goods. Once we  "recover our GATT seat," we will win many preferential terms,  such as tariff concessions, and reduction and elimination of  nontariff measures and barriers, including quantitative  restrictions. It is of particular importance that as a  developing country, China will also enjoy according to pertinent  GATT provisions its differentiated and more favorable treatment  toward developing countries. That is, that quantitative  restrictions by developed countries on export trade with  developing ones should be more flexible, and that developed  countries should fulfill their promised committment to  developing ones to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other  barriers. The acquisition of these favorable terms will be bound  to stimulate sharp growth in the export trade of Chinese farm  products and their maunfactured goods. In addition, the  conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral GATT  negotiations will bring a sharp liberalization of farm product  trade on a worldwide scale. This will obviously be even more  favorable to farm product foreign trade.    2. It will help China to utilize foreign investment,  introduce technology, and upgrade our traditional agriculture.  GATT trade accomodation limits are now expanding from tariffs  and nontariff measures on traditional goods trade to new fields,  such as service trade, intellectual property rights, and  trade-related investment measures. The conclusion of trade  agreements in these new fields will bring definite growth  opportunities to Chinese agriculture. In the 1990s, China's  agricultural development is in an exceptionally crucial period,  during which farm product growth will need much funding and  technical support. But due to China's current stage of  industrialization, we are experiencing related domestic funding  and technology shortages. Once we "recover our GATT seat,"  China will be able to exploit our signatory status, based on the  unconditional MFN principle and the special terms for developing  countries, to win technical, economic, and financial aid from  GATT members and international financial institutions for the  development of Chinese agriculture. Economically developed  countries and certain international business and trade  organizations are now all paying more attention to the  improvement of agricultural development conditions in developing  countries to resolve their subsistence-climate issues. In these  areas, they are all willing to provide aid, such as funding and  technology. Obviously, as a developing country and a GATT  member, we will have the full opportunity to completely utilize  such aid to build our domestic agricultural infrastructure and  improve our agricultural production conditions, in order to  reinforce our agricultural development stamina.    3. It will be favorable to China's use of developed-country  management and agricultural-development experience. China is  now in a reform period, in which our overall economy is  preparing for the transition to a socialist market economy.  Meanwhile, this period is also one in which Chinese  industrialization is making the transition from an initial stage  to an intermediate one. Faced with this reform and development  climate, we still lack experience in agricultural management and  development. But once we "recover our GATT seat," China can  learn and understand from GATT members, particularly  economically developed countries, their agricultural development  principles, policies, and measures in the intermediate  industrialization period on market economy terms, drawing on  their experience to reform and forumulate China's agricultural  development policy, to promote domestic agricultural development.    4. "GATT recovery" will be beneficial to Chinese imports of  farm products, particularly grain. China is a country with a  relative shortage of agricultural resources, where economic  development and rapid population growth have always made  farm-product supply and demand relations very tight. To balance  these supply and demand relations, China has been a net  grain-importing country since the 1960s. Looking to the  future, as our population enters its third childbearing peak and  our economy grows quickly, our society is likely to have to  steadily increase its exports of farm products, especially  grain. According to GATT principles on concessional tariffs,  free trade, and reciprocity, China will certainly win many  concessional terms in importing such farm products from GATT  members.  <H5>  II. Negative GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture </H5>   Once China acquires GATT standing, our enjoyment of the  various GATT rights will win certain favorable terms for our  agricultural development. But meanwhile, as China will have to  assume corresponding committments, such as lowering our tariffs,  reducing or eliminating nontariff barriers and measures, and  opening domestic markets, this will likely have certain negative  impacts on Chinese agricultural development, mostly in the  following areas:    1. Once China lowers tariffs and eliminates or adjusts  certain trade-restriction measures, certain low-cost and  high-quantity farm products with relative quality advantages  from other GATT countries will be bound to gain access to  Chinese markets, to compete sharply with Chinese farm products.  This will be a definite shock to certain Chinese farm  products. The most-impacted will be ones, such as food-use  vegetable oils, nonfood-use vegetable oils, rubber, lumber,  sugar, tobacco, soybeans, milk products, and tropical fruits.  In this case, domestic production of high-priced but  relatively low-quality farm products will probably be confronted  with the danger of shrinkage. And the sag in production of  these products will directly impact peasant job and income  growth.    2. Once we "recover our GATT status," GATT members will  certainly demand that China open its farm product markets wider,  which will mean weakening our many import-protection measures  for farm products in ways, such as lowering tariff rates, and  reducing all tariffs and nontariff barriers and measures that  have a negative impact on farm product trade. This is likely to  have certain negative impacts on China's future agricultural  development. Since China has a huge population, a severe  shortage of agricultural resources, and an exceptionally weak  agricultural foundation, requiring domestic agriculture to  produce enough to meet most industrialization needs under these  conditions will obviously require much agricultural support, by  taking the route of protection of agriculture. Even if we  adjust our urban-rural relations and stabilize our rural social  environment, China is sill likely to have to take the route in  the future of protecting our agricultural development, which  will certainly clash with GATT principles. Based on the  regulations drafted in the previous seven rounds of GATT  negotiations, the negative impact on Chinese agriculture from  GATT reentry would seem to be not too obvious, or to be only  local. This is because we could make use of pertinent GATT  provisions to request exemption from GATT obligations, to  protect our staple farm product production and trade. But as  the Uruguay round of negotiations has been concluded, making  farm product trade more liberal, all measures that impact market  access and export competition will fall under stronger and more  effective GATT regulations and disciplines. In which case,  faced with trade liberalization and open farm product markets,  with Chinese agriculture unable to be protected more strongly,  the steady rise in production costs will very quickly dissolve  our competitive price advantage. Then subject to overseas farm  product pressure, our domestic agriculture will certainly be  faced with a stiff challenge. The first to be affected by this  challenge, and the area that will be most deeply impacted, will  be Chinese grain production. Since reform and opening, China's  domestic staple food production costs have generally risen at a  rate of more than 10 percent a year. This rise in grain  production cost has clearly brought our grain prices closer to  international grain-market prices. In the future, as farm  product marketization intensifies and production costs continue  to rise, our domestic grain prices will very quickly exceed  international market prices. At which time, with open markets  and less protection, large amounts of international grain are  likely to flood the Chinese market, which will certainly pose a  severe threat to Chinese grain production.    3. GATT reentry will affect our domestic farm product supply  and demand balance, sharpening the shortages of certain farm  products. As stated above, while most domestic farm product  prices are still generally lower than international market  prices, "GATT reentry," winning us many preferential treatments,  will mean that China's farm product exports with competitive  price advantages will certainly grow sharply. But while this  growth will bring China a huge foreign exchange income, it is  also likely to quickly reduce domestic supplies of similar  products to create shortages. This is because limited by a  severe shortage of agricultural natural resources, farm product  growth is also limited, while rapid domestic economic  development and population growth will make farm product demand  ever sharper. Under these conditions, large-scale exports of  certain farm products will be bound to reduce domestic farm  product supplies, and even cause shortages.    4. In the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations, a series of  farm product trade liberalization measures were set forth, one  of the most important being the lowering of farm product  production and export subsidies by preset deadlines. While  differences exist on the extent of subsidy reduction by the  Keynes group composed of 14 countries, such as the U.S.,  Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and Canada, with the EC, GATT  members unamiously agree that subsidy reduction is imperative.  Once production and exports subsidies are lowered, the direct  impact on farm products will be higher prices. Concerned  international economists have specially studied this, holding  that the corresponding liberalization of grain trade among  industrially developed countries alone will likely bring an  average increase in world farm product prices of 22 percent.  This will include price increases of 37 percent for wheat, 26  percent for feed, 21 percent for beef and mutton, 12 percent for  pork, poultry, and eggs, 26 percent for dairy products, and 37  percent for sugar. Undoubtedly, higher farm product prices will  benefit net farm product exporting countries, enabling them to  export less farm products in exchange for more foreign exchange  income. But conversely, it will be adverse to net farm product  importing countries, as they will only acquire less farm product  imports for more foreign exchange. Since China is generally a  net farm product exporting country, reducing the various  subsidies will benefit us. But as China is a net grain  importing country, higher grain market prices will certainly  increase our foreign exchange spending on imported grain, which  will be adverse to maintaining a domestic balance between grain  supply and demand.   <H5>    III. Development Policies That Chinese Agriculture Should </H5> Choose    1. From now on, China should conduct active adjustments and  reforms in areas, such as macroeconomic organization and farm  management system, in full preparation for a positive acceptance  of all GATT impacts on agriculture. I hold that the greatest  current issues for Chinese agriculture and farm-related  industries are decentralized macroeconomic control, system  disorder, and a lack of organizational coordination mechanisms.  In such a state, China not only cannot make very good use of  the favorable terms brought to agriculture by the GATT, but also  will find it very hard to cope with the adverse impacts that it  will have on our agricultural development. So it is suggested  that China could start by organizing a policy, advisory, and  coordination agency integrating production and trade of farm  products and their manufactured goods, which agency would set  and coordinate policy related to production and trade of farm  products and their manufactured goods, providing agriculture  with policy advice and macroeconomic control in areas, such as  utilizing foreign investment, introducing technology, and  importing and exporting products.    2. We need to draw up as quickly as possible good  farm-related development policies and plans, to pave the way for  our taking full and good advantage of the favorable  opportunities brought to Chinese agricultural development by our  "GATT reentry." For instance, once China "regains our GATT  seat," as to its export advantages for certain Chinese farm  products and their manufactured goods, we should draw up  corresponding development plans, and adopt certain incentive and  support policies. In the areas of using foreign investment,  introducing technology, and importing farm products, we could  make certain advance plans, to keep from missing opportunities  and creating unnecessary losses.    3. As to the possible negative impacts of the GATT on our  agriculture, we should also take corresponding countermeasures,  which I hold to be as follows: A. As a developing country,  China should make full use of pertinent GATT provisions, to  provide suitable protection for our production and trade of  staple farm products, by strengthening state support for  agriculture, investing the necessary funding and technology, and  actively cultivating our agricultural development capability.  B. While observing GATT provisions, and within GATT-allowed  limits, we should give our agriculture the proper support. We  need to take certain active legal, economic, and technical steps  to encourage and support farm operators in consciously reducing  material consumption, conserving labor, and raising product  quality, to ultimately improve our farm product competitive  capability. In addition, to lower agricultural production  costs and improve our product competitive advantages, China also  needs to begin to achieve land economy of scale and raise labor  productivity, by applying certain effective principles and  policies to shift our surplus agricultural workforce to other  industries. China could suitably deregulate urban job markets  and speed up nonfarm production and development, to absorb the  large amount of surplus labor that is stuck in the farm sector.  This would eliminate the waste and surplus in our agricultural  workforce, expand the operating scale of our farm workers, and  raise their labor productivity. C. Due to land-resource  limitations, China's agriculture will be able to neither produce  all of the farm products needed for our economic development, or  meet all other economic development needs as to farm product  volume. So it is recommended that starting now, China should  choose farm products with domestic production advantages and  strong links to the national economy, for priority support and  development. We should correspondingly phase out those farm  products with no domestic production advantages and weak links  to the national economy, appropriately conceding the domestic  markets for these products.    4. We need to take the initiative to lower certain farm  product import tariffs, and reduce certain nontariff measures.  Except for a few staple products, such as grain, China's current  tariff rates on most farm products and their manufactured goods  are 50-70 percent, and in some cases even as high as 150-180  percent, which is obviously too high. Once we regain our GATT  status, we will have to lower our tariff rates on certain farm  products and their manufactured goods. What method should we use  to lower tariffs that would have the minimum impact on China's  agriculture and its product trade? I hold that the more ideal  method would be to first lower tariffs on those farm products  that are less tied to our national economy. Moreover, we could  consider lowering these product tariffs more sharply.  Conversely, as to those farm products that are more tied to  our national economy, we should strictly control  tariff-adjustment times and degrees. Only in this way can we  reduce to the minimum the negative impact on our agriculture of  lower tariffs. In addition, based on GATT demands, China is  also going to have to reduce certain nontariff measures against  farm product imports. In this area, we can act in accordance  with the links between farm products and our national economy,  by taking the initiative to eliminate certain administrative  measures, such as product licenses and import examination and  approval, and by streamlining technology health-criteria  examination and customs entry formalities.</p>

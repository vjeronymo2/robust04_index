			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aquileo Sanchez Viquez] </F>   [Text] [Costa Rican] Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus arrived  on Thursday in Santiago de Chile. During a news conference,  discussing his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general,  he indicated he has the support of 22 nations, which guarantees  his election.    He denied St. Lucia, Dominican Republic, and Ecuador had  changed their opinion, adding that these rumors only seek to  dilute support for him. The official reported having the  support of the Central American bloc, Caribbean community,  Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Chile, whereas Venezuelan  Miguel Angel Burelli has the support of two nations, and  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, the support of eight.    During a subsequent interview with LA REPUBLICA, Niehaus  said  Chile backs him. He announced he will try to meet with  Brazilians and Uruguayans to try to get their endorsement. The  foreign minister dismissed as mere rumors the reports that an  international pressure campaign -- in which the U.S. Department  of State is reportedly participating -- is forcing several  countries to withdraw their support for the Central American  candidacy.    He noted, however, that manifestations of this strategy have  been the "ridiculous" ideas that the Central American isthmus  and the Caribbean want to have control over the inter-American  system or that Caribbean islands are disgruntled over the banana  problem.    Niehaus indicated that many countries that have endorsed  President Gaviria already feel uncomfortable with a pledge that  will have a negative outcome. Further, the official said that  on 28 March, after he is elected, he will visit the authorities  of the countries that did not vote for him so that together,  recognizing the will of the majority, they can work to make the  OAS regain a protagonist role in fighting poverty and developing  the entire continent.    As for other pending matters, he indicated the main factor  will be national unity regarding this candidacy. [Costa Rican]  President-elect Jose Maria Figures gave the best example when he  set aside his partisan stance and publicly endorsed him. Along  these same lines also, the rumors of another Costa Rican  candidacy were dispelled when former President Oscar Arias  publicly backed Niehaus at the start of the campaign for the  OAS. "Any other Costa Rican or Central American candidacy would  break the existing bloc. [no closing quotation mark as published]</p>

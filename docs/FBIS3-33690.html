			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mas'ud Barzani, chairman of the Kurdish </F> Democratic Party, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof in Arbil, northern  Iraq; date not given: "Just Like Before an Execution"]    [Text] [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Mr. Barzani, there is an  elected regional government in northern Iraq and de facto  autonomy for the Iraqi Kurds. However, the economic situation  is terrible. Is your experiment doomed to fail?    [Barzani] We cannot enjoy our freedom without a functioning  economy. I am afraid that the Kurds will soon flee again to  other countries in masses.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you want to threaten the friendly  allies, who protect you, with this?    [Barzani] No. But if the misery here increases, the people  will again move to Iran or to Turkey -- or perhaps even to the  south.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] To Saddam Husayn's Iraq?    [Barzani] If the people are starving....    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] The UN economic embargo against Iraq  also hits you, because, despite its autonomy, Kurdistan  continues to be Iraqi territory.    [Barzani] Yes. I have asked the United States several times  to lift the embargo against us. The answer always was: We know  that you are not involved in Saddam's criminal acts, we will  continue to talk about that. But nothing has happened. There  is a lot of Iraqi money abroad. We have demanded that some of  this frozen money is given to us -- in vain.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Are you in favor of lifting the embargo  against Iraq in general?    [Barzani] It is of no advantage to us that the Iraqi people  suffer. If the embargo were lifted under UN control, and if the  sale of Iraqi oil benefited the people in the country and not  the regime, we would be in favor of it.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Iraqi Kurdistan is protected against  Saddam Husayn's attacks by the Allies. Every six months, the  question of the protection zone is decided anew. Does this not  create uncertainty?    [Barzani] Our situation is like that of a person sentenced  to death waiting for execution in his cell. The period of  protection is again and again extended, of course. However, the  uncertain wait has fatal psychological effects on the population.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Until 1992 you negotiated with Saddam  Husayn. Then the talks were suspended. Can you envisage a  resumption?    [Barzani] Actually, we only want to negotiate with a  democratic government. But if the Kurdish people are threatened  with destruction..., then negotiations with Baghdad will perhaps  be necessary.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] Do you really believe that Saddam Husayn  will be overthrown?    [Barzani] This is not so simple. Thirty states were unable  to overthrow Saddam. But I believe that he is suffering from  the international isolation.    [Hoffmann-Ostenhof] A colorful Iraqi opposition front, which  is mainly active in exile, presents itself as an alternative to  dictatorship. Your party is part of it. Is this opposition  mature enough to take over the government if Saddam is toppled?    [Barzani] No matter how I assess the opposition's political  maturity -- we do not have anything else.</p>

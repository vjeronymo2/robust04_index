			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INQUIRY URGED ON CHEMICALS USED BY TRAFFICKERS  </P> <P> A senator Thursday called on the Bush Administration to investigate whether  chemicals exported by U.S. manufacturers are being used by drug traffickers in  Latin America as an ingredient to produce cocaine.  </P> <P> Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a letter to Drug Control Policy Director  William J. Bennett that his concern was prompted by a Dec. 5 report in The  Times that the vast majority of the chemicals used in cocaine production  originate in the United States.  </P> <P> "If these reports are true, major American companies are making a buck off of  the drug epidemic," Reid wrote to Bennett.  </P> <P> "As drug czar, you must investigate this abhorrent possibility," he said. "You  must also take immediate action to stop this murderous and unlawful activity if  these reports are . . .true."  </P> <P> The senator raised particular questions about the role played by the Exxon  Corp., a principal exporter to Colombia of a solvent known as methyl ethyl  ketone. The Times reported that 90% of the MEK imported by Colombia is believed  to be diverted for cocaine production.  </P> <P> Bennett was traveling with President Bush on Thursday and had not yet seen the  letter, his spokesman said.  </P> <P> The anti-drug strategy that Bennett drafted this year calls for stringent  controls on the export of MEK, acetone and other "essential chemicals."  </P></p>

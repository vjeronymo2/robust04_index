			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Tories stress independence in Euro poll THE CONSERVATIVE party yesterday sought to tackle the difficulties it faces in next year's elections for the European parliament over its relationship with the European People's party, the alliance of right-of-centre European parties. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the Foreign Office minister, emphasised that Tory candidates would campaign on the basis of a Conservative manifesto in the Euro-election, not on the basis of the federalist EPP manifesto, in spite of the links between the two parties. His words will come as a relief to Tory Euro-sceptics who have been lobbying to make sure that the June 1994 campaign is not fought on an EPP platform. The EPP is sympathetic to the social chapter, a European single currency and the extension of majority voting to allow for the development of joint action on foreign policy. Whatever the formal separation of manifestos, the campaigns will not be unrelated. The EPP is represented on the Conservative European elections committee, chaired by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. The committee will meet for the first time later this month. The EPP also has an office in the Conservative party's London headquarters in Smith Square, Westminster. Mr Heathcoat-Amory was careful yesterday to spell out how useful the alliance with the EPP at Strasbourg had been to the Tories so far, saying that it had frustrated attempts by the left-of-centre majority to undermine the UK's presidency of the Community last year. In a speech yesterday to the Conservative Political Centre, a party discussion group, he also set out some of the central themes for the campaign, intended to unite the party around a vision of the EC almost all Tories can share: de-centralised, open, free-trading, and based on inter-governmental co-operation. The importance of the single market and of greater powers for the European parliament will also be highlighted in the campaign.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (13): Slow but steady take-off - Patrick Blum discusses Madeira as an offshore business centre IT HAS not exactly been plain sailing for Madeira's offshore business centre. Establishing a new legal framework to cover financial institutions, manufacturers in the free trade zone and a new international shipping register has taken up more time and encountered more bureaucratic obstacles than expected. Nevertheless, Madeira is slowly taking off as a viable alternative or addition to existing offshore centres in Europe and elsewhere. 'If you look at the early years of other centres, their own development was not any faster than ours. Early days are always difficult,' says Mr Francisco Costa, chairman of the Madeira Development Company (SDM), which is responsible for developing the island's offshore activities. In spite of initial problems, Madeira already has attracted a good number of businesses including 13 banks, 231 service and trading companies, and 10 manufacturing companies. Another five banks have applied to set up an offshore branch, 10 more service companies have applied for a licence, and three more manufacturing companies are waiting for authorisation to operate in the free trade zone. Response to the shipping register has been slower with only five vessels registered so far. Initially, only branches of banks and investment companies could operate in the offshore centre. This was later extended to all financial institutions. Now new laws are being prepared to allow funds to be domiciled locally and to enable the local incorporation of full banks and insurance companies as opposed to only branches. Mr Costa expects these to be in place this year. The shipping register has posed bigger problems. Until now, all crews for Portuguese registered ships had to be 100 per cent Portuguese, a standard requirement in Portugal. This is in the process of being changed so that crews will only need to be 50 per cent from the European Community. Restrictive and uncompetitive Portuguese mortgage regulations were another problem, and this is also being changed to allow ship-owners to choose the law under which they will operate when registering a ship. New legislation will also allow private yachts to be registered. Mr Carlos Sousa, general manager of Steermar, a ship management services company, says he expects to register 80-100 ships in the first year after the new law is approved. 'Foreign shippers are waiting for the change. We've had many enquiries, especially from Germany,' he says. The free trade zone has had more success with a mix of companies from as far apart as Brazil (plastics), Ireland (gold and jewellery), Lebanon (textiles and marble), Liechtenstein (precision optical instruments), Hong Kong (garments), and Portugal (construction materials, tobacco, electronics, food, and chemicals). Only a handful have started work, the others are building their own factories or in the process of installing machinery. The free zone is on a 120-hectare site on Madeira's eastern coast some 8km from the airport and 30km from Funchal, the island's main town. Next to the smaller town of Canical, it is easily accessible though the roads and a tunnel leading to the site are having to be widened and upgraded to cope with the heavier traffic. About half the initial 40 hectares to be prepared in a first phase of development have been completed: the land levelled, roads and infrastructures including water supplies and telecommunications installed. Work on a new deep sea port directly serving the site began in October 1990 and is due to be completed by the middle of next year. The island's main airport will be expanded to enable it to receive bigger aircraft and to improve freight facilities. Officials say rents are competitive at Dollars 13.50 per square metre of land per year for a minimum of five years for companies building their own installations, and Dollars 40 per square metre for ready-made building. Offshore financial business is centred in Funchal. So far all but one of the bank branches established are Portuguese. The exception is Lloyds Bank Fund Management of Guernsey, to be joined soon by Banque Franco Portugaise of France. Mr Costa believes this is to be expected of the centre's development. 'It is important to have Portuguese banks. It has a demonstration effect showing Portuguese banks are confident about the centre's prospects.' The banks do any type of business from taking deposits - there is strong competition for remittances of emigrant Portuguese workers and the savings of the wider Portuguese community around the world - to trade financing, fund management and granting credit. There are considerable attractions for investors and companies. Incentives include full tax holidays until 2011 for all financial institutions, trading and manufacturing companies setting up offshore or in the free zone. This allows banks, for example, to offer better conditions to their customers at no extra costs. Foreign exchange rules have been liberalised. However, this has caused some concern to the financial authorities in Lisbon. Accordingly, the central bank has asked for clarification on regulations covering the operations of Portuguese non-banking institutions which it argues should be treated under the same tax regime as their mother companies and not as foreign companies. The central bank would like all non-financial Portuguese companies wishing to operate offshore to first seek the bank's approval. 'There's a hole in the legislation on this,' a bank official says. Several Portuguese or Madeiran companies, such as Companhia Insular de Moinhos (CIM), a biscuit and pasta manufacturer, are moving into the free zone to take advantage of the favourable tax regime. CIM is also using the opportunity to restructure and modernise its production. Requests for information have been 'pouring in', according to Mr Joao Luis Dias, director of Dixcart Management (Madeira), a subsidiary of the Dixcart group. He says establishment procedures have greatly improved, making it possible to incorporate a company within a little more than two weeks. Office space has been scarce, but supply is improving. Dixcart recently moved into new premises while The New Madeira Investment Servicos, another management company, prepares to make its own move. The original optimism appears unchanged. 'The centre is well regulated and we keep standards high. I don't have any doubts about the future,' Mr Costa says.</p>

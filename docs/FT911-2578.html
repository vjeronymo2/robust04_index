			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Institutions' gain seen in buy-outs INSTITUTIONAL investors in management buy-outs have achieved an average annual rate of return of 54 per cent from buy-outs subsequently sold, floated on the stock market or placed in receivership, according to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the accountancy firm. KPMG, which includes only buy-outs valued at Pounds 10m or more in its statistics, expects that rate to be depressed by the economic recession. Institutions have so far realised their investments in 93 of the 299 buy-out deals which have been completed. The overall rate of return conceals sharp divergences between the different types of buy-out company. Businesses bought from the government as part of its privatisation programme produced an annual return of 116 per cent, while buy-outs which took listed companies private produced an average annual loss on the investment of 25 per cent. Listed company buy-outs have proved the most controversial. They have practically dried up because of the opposition by institutional investors to deals which were seen as unduly favourable to the sitting management. 'These figures are likely to prove the nail in the coffin (of that view),' said Mr Chris Beresford, head of buy-outs at KPMG.</p>

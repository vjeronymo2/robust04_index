			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Multitone Electronics falls sharply to Pounds 40,000 at midway Multitone Electronics, the paging equipment manufacturer which is the subject of a Pounds 21.5m recommended bid by Champion Technology, the Hong Kong-based telepaging group, yesterday reported sharply lower interim profits. The group warned last month that it expected to report a small pre-tax loss in the first half because a new distribution agreement had taken longer to come into full effect and there had been a delay in the introduction of an important new product. In the event the group said turnover was better than expected in October, generating pre-tax profits of Pounds 40,000 in the 26 weeks to October 31, down from Pounds 875,000 last time. Turnover was flat at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 12.1m) while operating costs were higher, particularly the cost of imported components, and market conditions prevented these increased costs from being passed on. As a result, operating profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 2.05m). Development expenditure at Pounds 1.16m was little changed in real terms and trading profit dropped to Pounds 184,000 (Pounds 932,000). A disproportionate tax charge of Pounds 209,000 (Pounds 271,000), reflecting the high level of tax on profits earned in Germany and ACT written off, resulted in a net loss of Pounds 169,000 or 1.12p per share, compared with earnings of 7.17p a year earlier. The interim dividend of 1.5p is maintained. The share price was unchanged yesterday at 140p, compared with the 143p Champion offer.</p>

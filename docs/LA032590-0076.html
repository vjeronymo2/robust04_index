			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA SAYS IT'S NOT FORMING ARMY;  </P> <P> SECESSION: FORCE IS UNWARRANTED, LANDSBERGIS TELLS GORBACHEV. THE REPUBLIC'S  PRESIDENT ALSO WARNS MILITARY DESERTERS THAT HE CANNOT PROTECT THEM.  </P> <P> Lithuania's leader assured President Mikhail S. Gorbachev after an  extraordinary spate of Kremlin saber-rattling Saturday that his breakaway  republic is not forming paramilitary units and warned Lithuanian deserters from  the Soviet army that he cannot protect them.  </P> <P> As night fell on this Baltic capital, there were no signs of the early morning  armored convoys that had shocked and angered Lithuanians in the tensest 24  hours since their declaration of independence two weeks ago. But there was also  no indication that Moscow's ire over the secession drive is waning.  </P> <P> Two deadlines set by the Soviets also expired Saturday, but it was not  immediately clear whether the Lithuanians' reaction would placate Moscow.  </P> <P> President Vytautas Landsbergis, speaking to foreign reporters outside the  Parliament building, said his government's campaign to restore the independence  that Lithuania enjoyed between the world wars would continue.  </P> <P> "We consider us as a part of Eastern Europe, not a part of the Soviet Union,"  Landsbergis said, speaking in English. "These processes cannot be stopped."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who says the secession is illegal, demanded Thursday that  Landsbergis halt the sign-up of volunteers to replace Soviet police officers  and KGB border guards and gave him until Saturday to inform him of the steps  taken.  </P> <P> Military authorities, similarly brushing off Lithuania's professed  independence, gave deserters until Saturday to return to the barracks, or risk  arrest. Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's military adviser, said the  conscripts would be returned to duty whether they liked it or not.  </P> <P> In a telegram to the Soviet president, made available to reporters by the  Glasnost group of independent Soviet journalists, Landsbergis said Gorbachev  was misinformed if he believed that Lithuania, independent from 1918 until the  Kremlin absorbed it in 1940, was again forming an army.  </P> <P> "People are registering who agree, if necessary, to help in the maintenance of  social order and controls on the roads," Landsbergis said in his telegram,  which denied that armed groups were being formed.  </P> <P> He concluded that "for the tanks that are now approaching the capital of the  Lithuanian republic, there is nothing to do."  </P> <P> About 100 Soviet military vehicles rumbled through the center of this hilly  capital at 4 a.m., their roar bringing legislators meeting in an all-night  session of Parliament outside to watch the column speed along the highway.  </P> <P> A duty officer at Sajudis, the grass-roots nationalist group that spearheaded  the independence drive, said the 58 infantry fighting vehicles and 50 trucks  entered a military base at Siaures Miestelis in northern Vilnius.  </P> <P> For Landsbergis, the display of Soviet military might highlighted the danger  that hangs over his government. "This is a constant threat, and no one knows if  they are going to use force," he told Parliament members after they reconvened,  bleary-eyed, at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The previous day, Soviet military helicopters dropping leaflets branding the  secession illegal roared over the Supreme Council building, and the Interior  Ministry announced it had deployed units loyal to Moscow throughout the West  Virginia-size republic.  </P> <P> Soviet officials have repeatedly said they will not use force in Lithuania, and  a senior Soviet diplomat Saturday said his government will do everything in its  power to resolve the crisis peacefully.  </P> <P> "For the time being, we are not using any force in the republic, and we will  try to keep that line, but what will happen I don't know," Deputy Foreign  Minister Yuri B. Kashlev told reporters in Lisbon.  </P> <P> In Washington, about 200 people rallied in front of the Lincoln Memorial to  express their solidarity with the new Lithuanian regime. They carried placards  reading "Thanks . . . But No Tanks" and "Give Lithuania Freedom."  </P> <P> For many in this republic of 3.7 million people, the fate of deserters from the  Soviet army is an issue heavy with symbolism. Not only should Lithuanian boys  not have to serve in the army of what is now a foreign state, they argue, but  conscripts from the Baltic states are often submitted to brutal hazing that has  driven some to suicide.  </P> <P> Landsbergis has said that at least 840 deserters have recently come back to the  republic. He had said earlier that authorities of his government would try to  guard them, but he admitted Saturday that task is impossible, given the might  of the Soviet army.  </P> <P> "We cannot physically protect every young man who is trying to hide," he told  Parliament. He advised deserters not to stay at home, since their addresses  might be known to military police, and said that if deserters are threatened,  "they could seek sanctuary in churches."  </P> <P> What succor churches could offer, beyond spiritual aid, is unclear, since they  are awarded no special status as places of sanctuary by the officially  atheistic Soviet state.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian leadership had been concerned that the army and KGB would use  Saturday's deadline for deserters to return to their units as pretext for mass  arrests and even violent provocations, the Washington Post reported. But there  were few arrests, and nearly all of the deserters stayed at their homes, with  friends or at a psychiatric hospital in the suburbs of Vilnius, the newspaper  said.  </P> <P> In the midst of the showdown with Moscow, elections were held in Lithuania on  Saturday for more than 9,000 posts on city and village councils. The Soviet  news agency Tass said that from 50% to 60% of voters had cast ballots by late  afternoon, showing that Lithuanians were taking their political  responsibilities under independence seriously.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in the neighboring Baltic republic of Estonia, Communists argued  over the future of their party, which local journalists say seems certain to  split like Lithuania's party into a pro-Moscow faction and a group demanding  independence.  </P> <P> A decision by the Estonian Communist Party's extraordinary congress was  expected today.  </P> <P> Free-lance journalist Schrader reported from Vilnius and Times staff writer  Dahlburg reported from Moscow.  </P></p>

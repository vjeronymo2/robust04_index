			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> UAW Ratifies Chrysler-Mitsubishi Contract: The United Auto Workers ratified a  three-year contract with Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture of Chrysler Corp.  and Mitsubishi. Exact vote totals were not released, but officials said the  pact was approved Sunday by a margin of about 3-to-1. The agreement, worked out  over five months of negotiations, covers 2,300 production and maintenance  workers at the plant in Normal, Ill. The raises will bring salaries at the  plant into line with wages of auto workers at other plants represented by the  UAW. The $650-million Diamond-Star plant began production of the Plymouth Laser  and Mitsubishi Eclipse about one year ago.  </P></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Shares plunge as the Fed loosens its lips - Wall Street So, the Federal Reserve decided to tighten monetary policy after all. It was not a particularly dramatic move, just a nudging in the Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks led money to each other - up from 3 per cent to a new target of 3 1/4 per cent. The Fed, however, was determined to make sure the financial markets got the message, so in an unusual step, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, issued a public statement explaining that the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee had voted this week to slightly tighten monetary policy. This was most out of ordinary. Normally, if the Fed wants to change its stance on policy (without resorting to the obvious move of an increase in the discount rate) it allows the Fed funds rate to move up or down a few percentage points. It then waits for the markets to work out the implications of this move for themselves. By explaining directly what the central bank was doing, Greenspanwas delivering on the promise he made to Congress at the start of the week - that the Fed would soon raise interest rates to keep inflationary pressures in the economy in check. The markets took the news badly. The Dow tumbled30 points after the Fed announced its decision late yesterday morning, and ended the day 96 points down - its biggest one day fall for more than two years. Although bond prices at first held up relatively well, this was because themarket had already experienced a sizeable sell-off earlier in the day after the30-year government bond surrendered the one-point gain it had made following a weaker-than-expected January employment report. Later, however, they lostall their early gains as analysts and traders came to grips with both the jobs figures and the Fed's move. While the means by which the Fed communicated its actions was surprising, the timing was not. All this week the expectation was building that a strong January employment report on Friday would provide theFed with the perfect reason to raise interest rates. Anticipation of a Fed move heightened on Thursday because that morning the central bank had taken no action to prevent the Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend money to each other - from rising above its 3 per cent target to 3 1/8 per cent. In thepast, when Fed funds have traded above 3 per cent, the Fed has added reserves to the banking system to bring the rate back down to its target. The Fed's inaction on Thursday was interpreted as a sign that the central bank wanted theFed funds rate at 3 1/8 per cent. Yields on short- term Treasury securities rose sharply on the belief that the Fed was setting the stage for a tightening of itsmonetary policy screw. The theory sounded so convincing because Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress at the start of the week that the Fed was ready to tighten monetary policy. After the chairman's warning, both stock and bond markets were watchful, and as the week wore on, the announcement of employment figures on Friday morning lookedmore and more like the event that would spur the Fed into action. Atfirst glance, however, it appeared that there was not enough ammunition in the January employment report to load the Fed's gun. While economists had been looking for a gain in monthly payrolls of 200,000, the actual increase in January was only 62,000. The reaction from bond traders was immediate: they pushed prices of government securities sharply higher on the thinking that the Fed could not raise rates after a weak employment report. Nothing, however, is ever cut and dried when it comes to economic statistics, and the January jobsdata came with the usual set of qualifications. Economists said the figures were skewed by two factors - the Los Angeles earthquake, and the very cold weatherconditions in the East - which they believed made it difficult for companies to accurately report payroll numbers last month. It was also noted that while the headline figure was below expectations, other important measures, such as the average work week and average hourly earnings, were strong in January, suggesting that underlying conditions in the labour market continue to improve. It was these considerations, plus a desire to be seen as vigilant against the threat of inflation, that probably persuaded the Fed to make its move yesterday, and announce the first tightening in US monetary policy in almost five years.  ------------------------------------------------- Monday         3978.36    +      32.93 Tuesday        3964.01    -      14.35 Wednesday      3975.54    +      11.53 Thursday       3967.66    -       7.88 Friday         3871.42    -      96.24  -------------------------------------------------</p>

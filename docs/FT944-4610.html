			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Nervousness remains at LME - Market Report Base metal trading was quieter at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon but traders were still nervous of the possibility of further sharp downward corrections. The recent big mover, NICKEL, had its wings clipped by Norilsk, the big Russian producer, saying power problems were not as bad as western traders claimed. Meanwhile ALUMINIUM traders were disturbed by the possibility of Monday's news that Coca Cola was switching to steel can sheet in some areas might herald similar substitution moves by other consumers. COPPER's fundamental tightness made it more resistant to the downward pressure.

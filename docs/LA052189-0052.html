			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WHOLE LOTTA TESTIN'  </P> <P> Mass appeal: Orion Pictures is shooting a more upbeat ending to "Great Balls of  Fire" -- the Jerry Lee Lewis musical bio starring Dennis Quaid, due to open  June 30 -- after test audiences voted thumbs down on the original, downbeat  finale.  </P> <P> That conclusion had the once-triumphant Lewis reduced to playing at one of the  old honkytonks where he'd gotten his start, after his skyrocketing career  fizzled with his scandalous marriage to his 13-year-old cousin (played by  Winona Ryder).  </P> <P> In the new ending, Lewis will perform in an unnamed auditorium -- in  celebratory style -- jumping joyfully atop his piano.  </P> <P> "The idea is that the music goes on," said exec veep Mike Medavoy, "and it  does, to this day."  </P> <P> He added, "In tests, audiences told us that they loved Dennis Quaid (as Lewis),  they loved the music and they loved the movie -- except for the ending. They  wanted something more upbeat, so, we are reshooting."  </P> <P> Don't look for an epilogue bringing moviegoers up to date with the still-wild  life and times of Lewis, a.k.a. The Killer.  </P> <P> Said Medavoy: "We'll do that in the sequel." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

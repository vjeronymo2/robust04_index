Well-informed Interior Ministry sources  disclosed that Fourth Army Region Commander Lt-Gen Kitti  Rattanachaya has told the Interior Ministry that "a third party"  was responsible for the attack. However, the police and the  southern authority have submitted preliminary reports to the  Interior Ministry blaming southern separatist bandits.    The sources said Lt-Gen Kitti in his report to the Interior  Ministry said the bomb attack was not the work of members of  Pattani United Liberation Organisation [PULO] but that of a  "third hand" who wanted to create more problems for the  Government. However, Southern Border Provinces Administration  Centre Director Wisut Singkhachonworakun and the police said  PULO separatists were behind the attack. Mr Wisut said it has  yet to be established which faction of the group was responsible  for the attack on the railway track in Chana District of  Songkhla Province.    Local officials have been instructed to gather information  to  find out if this faction is a new or old group of the PULO, he  said. Mr Wisut said no promises had been made to the separatist  bandits as suggested by some news reports. It was reported that  the group claimed in a letter left at the scene of the attack  that the Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre had  promised the bandits they would speed up the investigation into  the torching of schools in the South last year. He said the  centre would try to prevent a similar recurrence but admitted  that the task would be difficult.    Police Department deputy chief Phong-amat Amattayakun said  it  was believed that the separatists might have received support  from overseas. Pol Gen [Police General] Phong-amat said local  politicians should be able to help play a role in solving the  problem of subversive activities in the South as they were  familiar with local problems. "The incident (the bomb attack) is  a political problem. The local politicians should know it well  and should help solve it," Pol Gen Phongamat said.    Meanwhile, deputy Police Department chief for crime  suppression Phot Bunyachinda yesterday ordered security to be  beefed up at public buildings as well as bus and train terminals  after Tuesday's attack. In his order to the regional police  headquarters in the South, policemen are to set up highway  checkpoints and conduct random searches of vehicles of  suspicious looking people around the clock to prevent another  attack.    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled  out speculation that the bomb attack at Songkhla was designed to  discredit him. Gen Chawalit said the police have submitted a  preliminary report but he would have to wait for a detailed  investigation and analysis to determine if the attack was really  conducted by the PULO, as stated in the letter placed at the  blast site.    Gen Chawalit said it was probably the work of certain  movements that have been operating for 40-50 years already,  which have begun using weapons. The New Aspiration Party leader  said the public should understand that such movements are not  ordinary criminal cases, therefore, it is not possible for  officials to take immediate action against the culprits. Gen  Chawalit said it was difficult to prevent such incidents from  happening because of the continuous flow of war weapons and  aliens across the border. He said the police were doing well in  the fight against the sale and smuggling of war weapons, but the  battle was still far from won.    Gen Chawalit said it is noticeable that the groups are  beginning to come out of the woodwork. "The people should  carefully watch their movements without being shaken about it."  The Interior Minister said one should understand that the bomb  blasts have occurred in many places and would continue to happen  because there are many kinds of people in society, where there  are different kinds of conflicts, both concerning personal  issues and business.    The Interior Minister said he had also received reports  about  the bomb blast at Labour and Social Welfare Ministry permanent  secretary Sawai Phrammani's house in Nakhon Ratchasima, but has  not yet spoken to Mr Sawai about the matter.    Asked about a committee set up to look into incidents  occurring in the South, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Banyat  Banthatthan, with the interior minister as deputy chairman, Gen  Chawalit said the committee was at the administrative level.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW, GM AGREE TO EXTEND CONTRACT;  </P> <P> LABOR: UNION TAKES ACTION TO CONTINUE TALKS ON NEW PACT, IGNORING STRIKE  DEADLINE. SETTLEMENT WOULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR OTHER AUTO MAKERS.  </P> <P> The United Auto Workers union, apparently confident a settlement is near,  ignored a midnight Friday strike deadline and said it would keep bargaining  toward a new contract covering 300,000 active workers at General Motors Corp.  </P> <P> The UAW notified local union leaders around the country to stay on the job or  report to work as scheduled "until further notice," extending indefinitely the  three-year agreement that expired at 11:59 p.m.  </P> <P> Bargaining at GM headquarters in Detroit continued past midnight and the  negotiators agreed to continue talks this morning. In letting the deadline  slip, the union in effect was giving itself until Monday to conclude an  agreement. That is when 300 union leaders convene here to vote on any new pact.  </P> <P> There was no indication of what was preventing a settlement, but two issues  reflecting the steady decline of jobs at GM -- job security and limiting the  auto company's practice of farming work out to subcontractors -- have been the  hardest to resolve.  </P> <P> Union officials would only say late Friday night that "we are continuing our  efforts to reach a settlement." But Alfred S. Warren, GM's top bargainer, said  he thinks "meaningful progress has been made" and that an agreement will be  reached.  </P> <P> The fact that the contract expired on a Friday night meant that a strike would  have had little impact before Monday anyway. Only one GM plant, in Bowling  Green, Ky., is scheduled to work today, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The contract with GM covers workers at 240 plant sites in 33 states. Included  are about 3,500 in California, of which 3,200 are at the Van Nuys assembly  plant.  </P> <P> An agreement without a strike has been expected all along in the talks, which  have appeared unusually harmonious since the UAW last month chose GM as the  company it would focus on first in the round of negotiations with the Big Three  auto firms.  </P> <P> The union's national contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also  expired Friday night, but they were automatically extended. The UAW will  attempt to duplicate its GM agreement at Ford and Chrysler, but hard-pressed  Chrysler has served notice that it needs relief and would demand a cheaper  contract.  </P> <P> Few details of the negotiations have become public. But wages and other  traditional economic issues were secondary to the union's demand for additional  safety nets for displaced workers and GM's emphasis on finding ways to reduce  the cost of making cars.  </P> <P> GM has tried in the bargaining to cut its health care costs, for example,  saying the medical tab for its middle-aged work force and huge ranks of  retirees comes to $622 per car. By comparison, the foreign auto firms that have  set up assembly plants in this country and hired a new, younger work force face  health care costs of just $60 per car.  </P> <P> But the biggest conflict was in reconciling the UAW's demand for a "no-layoff"  policy, in effect, guaranteeing pay for workers who lose their jobs, and GM's  goal of slashing its work force by another 60,000 workers over the next three  years.  </P> <P> Since 1979, GM's U.S. blue-collar employment has tumbled by some 170,000, or  nearly 40%.  </P> <P> The base wage for a GM assembler is $14.01 per hour. Bargainers were believed  to be negotiating a 3% raise the first year and lump-sum "bonuses" in  subsequent years, similar to the agreement signed in 1987.  </P> <P> In Toronto, contract talks between Canadian Auto Workers union and Ford's  Canadian subsidiary ended for the day without a settlement, paving the way for  a walkout. Those talks also faced a midnight deadline, but Canadian Ford plants  are closed weekends. The CAW represents about 12,800 Ford workers.  </P> <P> A strike at Ford of Canada would quickly cripple up to seven U.S. assembly  plants at Ford that make some of Ford's most successful vehicles. A glass plant  in Niagara Falls, Ont., for example, makes all the windshields for Ford's  F-series pickup truck.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Rise in savings volume at east German banks TOTAL interim savings volume for Ostdeutscher Sparkassen und Giroverband, eastern Germany's savings banks, rose 5.4 per cent to DM116.3bn (Dollars 69.2bn) compared with the same period last year. The rise over the first six months of the year, fuelled largely by an increase in savings among private account holders, coincides with growing unemployment and fears that any upswing in the economy will take longer than expected. A spokesman for the 137 banks grouped under the OSGV, said personal savings rose by DM3.9bn to DM94.4bn. He said the high rise in personal savings reflected the end of the 1990-91 consumer boom, as well as uncertainty about future jobs prospects. 'People are putting aside money for their future security,' he said. The OSGV also recorded a rise in loans, which grew nearly 12 per cent to more than DM30bn. About 19 per cent of the total credits were earmarked for setting up small businesses. This reflects a rise of DM2.2bn to DM14.1bn. More than 26 per cent of loans went to the services sector; 18 per cent to small workshops; 14 per cent to trade; and 1 per cent to agriculture.</p>

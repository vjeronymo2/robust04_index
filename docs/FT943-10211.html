			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Right, proper and perplexed: Japan is struggling to reconcile conflicting views of its history August in Japan is the month for remembering. This morning, at 8.15 in the Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima, the nation's leaders will gather across the river from the monument marking the spot where the A-bomb exploded, to commemorate the precise moment 49 years ago when the 'black rain' fell. There will be solemn speeches restating Japan's renunciation of war for ever. Nine days later, 500 miles away in central Tokyo, there will be a rather different ceremony. At the Yasukuni shrine in the heart of the capital, on the 49th anniversary of the Japanese surrender, another group of dignitaries will pray before the Shinto deities of the nation's war dead. But the devotees at Yasukuni will be stirring a political controversy. For the shrine is not simply Japan's Cenotaph, or Arlington Cemetery. It is the resting place of the souls of all those who died defending the mother country - ordinary soldiers, but also kamikaze pilots, officers who oversaw the construction of the Burma railroad, and Class A war criminals executed by the Allies. At first sight, the two ceremonies seem very different. Hiroshima is an official event, supported by socialists, liberals, conservatives. They will be attended by pipes of peace and the mood will be reflective. At Yasukuni, rightwing politicians, including half the current cabinet, and war veterans will be watched by shaven-headed youths in military regalia. Buses sporting the Imperial Rising Sun flag will fill the air with noxious black smoke and broadcast rightwing propaganda. In fact, though, the two are related. Both represent the selectivity of Japan's historical memory. Hiroshima presents Japan as the victim of the 'worst atrocity of the century', blotting out its causes; Yasukuni commemorates the heroism of the men who died, blotting out the evil deeds of many enshrined there. Neither acknowledges Japan's guilt. This selective amnesia has been in evidence since the war. Japan has never felt nor expressed the contrition of Germany. No Japanese prime minister has ever fallen to his knees in remorse as German Chancellor Willy Brandt did in the Warsaw ghetto in 1970. For years, this amnesia, though condemned by the rest of the world, was largely indulged by the west. While the cold war continued, Japan's role as the one friendly unarmed nation in the hostile east seemed almost to expiate the historical offence. But in the post-cold war world, Japan is edging towards a global role. In the past year, the prospect of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council has moved within sight. The Socialist party of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has, in the last month, ended its opposition to Japan having any military capability. Japanese troops have been involved in UN peacekeeping efforts in Cambodia. Most importantly, Japan increasingly sees itself as providing leadership in Asia. This last trend is forcing a gradual change in Japan's official version of history. For many Asian countries - the principal victims of Japan's war - Japan cannot assume a regional political role until that change is complete. As Mr Haruki Wada, professor of history at Tokyo University, puts it: 'Japan will never have normal relations with its Asian neighbours as long as it continues to try to hide its past.' A test of Japan's capacity for self analysis will come next year when the country marks the 50th anniversaries of Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the surrender. But a step towards reappraising its history has already been made. Elections last year swept away 40 years of Liberal Democratic party rule and appeared to herald the first significant change in Japan's official attitude to its history. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the leading architect of political reform, said at the time: 'We cannot deny the part aggression has played in our history in Asia.' But Japan's leaders have failed to follow up words with actions. For example, 'comfort women', the thousands of Korean and other women forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers, continue to press without success for compensation. Many Japanese see no need for Japan to feel remorse. They argue that their fight was honourable, scarred by no more than the usual brutality of war. Some go further. In a newspaper article in April, Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's justice minister who is himself a 70-year-old war veteran, described accounts of the 1937 Nanking massacre where Japanese soldiers murdered tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Chinese civilians as a 'hoax'. After a few days' embarrassed silence from the government, Mr Nagano was forced to resign. But he maintains his views represent those of most Japanese. He does not see the war in terms of aggression. 'Japan fought to liberate Asia. In some ways, it could be said we did liberate Asia - look what happened to India and Burma after the war,' he says. He is on far less controversial ground when he explains the problem for Japan in dealing with its past. Unlike Germany, he says, Japan has not been able to cut itself off from events of 50 years ago. The postwar constitution reflected the Allies' desire to maintain continuity in Japan to avoid complete disintegration. So the emperor was left in place. This continuity has led, most crucially, to weaknesses in the education system. For decades, Japanese school-books glossed over much of Japan's war record. But in the last few months, small victories have been won on the path to openness. Last year, the supreme court ruled that government attempts to censor history textbooks were illegal - a decision against which the education ministry has not appealed. This summer, a school history curriculum came into effect in high schools which, for the first time, describes Japan's war as one of aggression. The scale of the task of re-educating the Japanese is illustrated by one of Japan's best-selling computer games, Decision of the Commanders, which re-enacts Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour and the invasion of Asia. The players assume the positions of imperial commanders, and use forced labour to fortify their positions. The software caused a furore when it was launched in 1989, but has sold more than 100,000 copies. Its author, 24-year-old Mr Ryohei Tanaka, says: 'The game was produced from the perspective of the aggressors, and the Japanese are enjoying it.'</p>

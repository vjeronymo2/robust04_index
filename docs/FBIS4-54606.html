			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- Polish and Russian transport  ministers signed in Warsaw on Friday [29 April] a memorandum on  the development of cooperation in transport between Poland and  the Russian Federation. The memorandum envisages that the two  countries will set up a joint committee to prepare a policy on  road, air, sea transport as well as inland waters transport.  According to Russian Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, the  lack of money does not allow for the realisation of transport  investments such as the construction of highways and border  crossings. The Russian minister said that Russia would decrease  fees for flights over its territory which are higher than the  prices of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation).  Yefimov denied that Russian prices are higher.</p>

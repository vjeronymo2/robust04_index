			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JONES MAKES PLAYOFF A BIG PAYOFF IN HOPE  </P> <P> Steve Jones said he was ready to go home to Phoenix after shooting a 76 in the  first round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.  </P> <P> But he stayed, made the cut, and surprisingly won the tournament Sunday on the  first hole of a sudden-death playoff with Paul Azinger and Sandy Lyle at  Bermuda Dunes.  </P> <P> Jones owns the PGA Tour at this early juncture of the year, having also won the  Tournament of Champions last week at La Costa.  </P> <P> It was only the third tour victory for the 30-year-old pro from Phoenix. He had  won the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach pro-am last year in a playoff against Bob Tway.  </P> <P> Jones received a first-place check of $180,000, to go along with his payoff of  $135,000 at La Costa, by making a 4-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole,  No. 14, a par 4 of 385 yards.  </P> <P> Azinger had a 1-stroke lead over Jones, a playing partner, and Lyle, who had  already finished, going to the 18th hole, a par-5, 513-yard layout.  </P> <P> But Azinger, who had apparently taken command of the tournament with a birdie  at the 15th hole, missed a 6-foot putt for a bogey to force a playoff.  </P> <P> "I hit the putt exactly where I wanted to, in the right center of the hole,"  Azinger said. "And it was in with about a foot to go. Then, it leaked on me and  I couldn't believe it.  </P> <P> "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would make a bogey."  </P> <P> Jones just missed a birdie putt on 18, but easily saved his par.  </P> <P> "I didn't know that Lyle was in the playoff, or that there would be three of  us," Jones said.  </P> <P> On the playoff hole, Azinger hit a driver into the left rough followed by a  pitching wedge that carried to within 18 feet of the hole, where he 2-putted.  </P> <P> Lyle drove into the right rough and his second shot was about 30 feet from the  hole. Like Azinger, he 2-putted.  </P> <P> Jones hit a 1-iron off the tee and then skillfully used his 7-iron to draw the  ball to within 4 feet of the hole.  </P> <P> "I shook it in there," Jones said of his putt. "I don't know how it went in."  </P> <P> Jones seemed slightly dazed by his victories, the first time someone has swept  the first two tournaments since 1983 when Gil Morgan won the Tucson and Los  Angeles Opens.  </P> <P> "It was thrilling," he said. "I couldn't believe it after the way I started."  </P> <P> He was referring to his 76 on PGA West Wednesday when he was 5 over par after  16 holes.  </P> <P> Moreover, Jones said he has not played well here.  </P> <P> "I've only made the cut here once in 5 times. No, make it 2 times now," he  said.  </P> <P> Jones qualified for his tour card in 1982, but because of an injury, he didn't  distinguish himself and had to re-qualify at the start of the 1985 season.  </P> <P> A 6-foot 4-inch, 185-pound former all-state high school basketball player from  Yuma, Colo., Jones said he didn't believe that he was ready for such an  auspicious start.  </P> <P> "I'd only won 1 tournament in 5 years. Then, boom, boom I've won 2," he said.  </P> <P> Jones, Lyle and Azinger finished regulation play at 343, 17 under par. They  each shot a 69 on the final day of the 90-hole tournament.  </P> <P> Jones, after shooting a course-record 63 at Eldorado Saturday, was 2 strokes  behind Mark Calcavecchia, the fourth-day leader, at the outset of Sunday's  round.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia, who played with Jones and Azinger, had a 1 stroke lead over the  field after 12 holes. However, he bogeyed the par-5, 564-yard 13th hole.  Azinger and Jones got birdies.  </P> <P> Azinger then became the 1-stroke leader at 17 under par and improved his lead  to 2 strokes over several contenders with a birdie at the par-4, 15th.  </P> <P> Jones closed to within one stroke of Azinger with a 20-foot chip shot for a  birdie on the par-3, 212-yard 17th hole. He was emulating Calcavecchia, who  made his birdie chip shot of about 17 feet a few minutes earlier.  </P> <P> Calcavecchia was 2 strokes behind Azinger before the 18th hole. And he had a  chance to get into a playoff, but he missed a 6-foot birdie putt as Jones  parred the hole and Azinger bogeyed it.  </P> <P> Azinger's approach shot on No. 18 was his undoing. He skulled his wedge, his  third shot, and was about 50 feet from the pin. Then he three-putted, seemingly  shocked that that the ball didn't drop from 6 feet.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I'm disappointed," Azinger said. "After not playing well last week  at La Costa, I wasn't confident this week until today. I played well today, but  I made a mistake that I shouldn't have made. I should have won."  </P> <P> Lanny Wadkins, playing ahead of Jones, Azinger and Calcavecchia, probably was  also muttering about what might have been.  </P> <P> He was 2 strokes behind Azinger, when he lined up an eagle putt of about 50  feet on the 18th hole. He was short of the hole by 3 feet and then missed his  birdie try.  </P> <P> As it turned out, a birdie putt would have put him in the playoff.  </P> <P> Wadkins finished at 344 along with Kenny Knox, Fred Couples and Calcavecchia.  </P> <P> As for Jones, he's heading to his hometown for the Phoenix Open next week.  Three in a row? Not likely. But neither was two straight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOB HOPE CLASSIC: THE TOP 10  </P> <P> * Steve Jones 76-68-67-63-69 -- 343  </P> <P> Paul Azinger 69-68-70-67-69 -- 343  </P> <P> Sandy Lyle 70-68-68-68-69 -- 343  </P> <P> Lanny Wadkins 68-70-68-70-68 -- 344  </P> <P> Kenny Knox 68-71-69-67-69 -- 344  </P> <P> Fred Couples 65-71-71-68-69 -- 344  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia 71-67-67-67-72 -- 344  </P> <P> Hubert Green 73-70-65-68-69 -- 345  </P> <P> Tom Kite 68-69-68-69-71 -- 345  </P> <P> Bernhard Langer 70-68-68-69-70 -- 345  </P> <P> * Won playoff.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease in wake of auction US Treasury prices were down slightly yesterday after a relatively positive auction of two-year notes. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at 92 27/32 yielding 8.135 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 11/32 , yielding 7.223 per cent. With little economic news to be released this week, Wall Street looked to yesterday's auction and an auction of five-year notes today for a measure of investor sentiment. Few expect the market to shed its generally bearish outlook, but traders were for the most part pleased with the modest demand shown for the two-year notes. Uncertainty in the market and a spread of about 120 basis points above the Federal funds rate helped make the shorter-term notes attractive. Volumes are expected to be extremely low all week, however, as traders and investors take the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The market will close at 2pm on both Wednesday and Friday. Also, the market has already begun to look forward to an additional increase in the target Fed funds rate. Although the Federal Reserve boosted the rate by a greater-than-expected 75 basis point last week, the language of the communique announcing the increase left open the possibility of another near-term increase. The market seems convinced that inflationary pressures will warrant a higher target rate. The UK government bond market was largely unmoved by an October non-EU trade deficit which was larger than expected. The trade gap was Pounds 410m compared with forecasts of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 275m. In late trading the December long gilt future moved up  5/32 of a point to trade about 102 1/2 . The yield spread over bunds had widened out slightly by 2 basis points to about 120. Mr Stephen Dulake at PaineWebber in London said some underperformance of gilts was inevitable after their strong showing last week. He said that strong GDP data released on Friday meant 'an interest rate rise is on the cards'. German government bonds shifted up in lacklustre trading as investors waited for the money supply figures due out this week. The December bund futures contract traded at around 90.10 late in the day, a rise of 0.24 of a point, which Ms Alison Cottrell at Kidder Peabody attributed to technical trading before holidays in Japan on Wednesday and the US on Thursday. Italian government bonds were unmoved despite the unpopularity of pension reform as evidenced by the poor showing of Mr Berlusconi's party in local elections. Mr Dulake at PaineWebber said any support for the market was largely domestic.</p>

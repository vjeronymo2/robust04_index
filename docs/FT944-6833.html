			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: Warm welcome for Khovanshchina No harder to pronounce than 'Khrushchev' (and much easier than 'Shchedrin'), Mussorgsky's ultra-Russian Khovanshchina earned a warm welcome to the English National Opera repertoire last week. Perhaps for budgetary reasons, the ENO seems to have staged fewer historical epics of late than it used to, though its Cinemascope stage invites them. Still, the number of epic-historical operas that have been composed is hugely disproportionate to the number of masterpieces; and among those few, Khovanshchina - a bag of 'unfinished' sketches though it is - must stand near the top in any thoughtful ranking. In the ENO programme-book, Paul Griffiths argues persuasively that 'unfinished' and fragmentary was just what Khovanshchina had to be. It is the Russian opera about the looming impact of Peter the Great; but neither Peter nor his close relatives could be depicted on the stage. Therefore Mussorgsky gave his dispassionate attention to the lesser players and their factions, drafting his own libretto as he went: the worried conservative boyars, the Westernising sophisticates, the unregenerate Old Believers in ancient orthodoxy. Since they all lost, they could not shape the ultimate story, which neither began nor ended with them. In Francesca Zambello's cool, skilful production, the rival groups strut their forces and connive in turn, none favoured above the others. The focal point of Alison Chitty's sets is a metal-frame pillar which unfolds to become walls, bridges, bleachers; the only elaborate costumes are those needed to establish roles and ranks. The complicated plotting is rendered unusually clear - and mercifully it takes three and a half hours instead of the predicted four. The leaders are cast from strength: Willard White's imperious, dignified Prince Khovansky, Kim Begley's dandyish Prince Golitsyn, Gwynne Howell's lofty Dosifey, the Old Believers' leader. For greater depth of character, we should probably need to have real Russians. The young bass-baritone Paul Whelan makes a striking debut as the sinister boyar Shaklovity, with Howard Haskin a clever Scribe, and as tragic Marfa Anne-Marie Owens is all anxious urgency and warmth. Cathryn Pope and Maria Moll make creditable work of their shrill, ungrateful roles as Emma and Susanna. On Thursday the conductor Sian Edwards found vivid touches in many scenes, less in the way of steady breadth. The sense of panoramic unfolding was unconfident: she tends to run at things. (Even the marvellous 'dawn' prelude stammered slightly, with a singularly pallid clarinet and a misfired climax.) Later performances should expand more grandly. The second act risked sagging, though at the start of the third the sight of Khovansky dallying with his Persian slave-girls in a swimming-bath cheered everybody up. The ENO has opted for Shostakovich's version. Mussorgsky got no further with a full orchestral score than two short passages; as with Boris Godunov, Rimsky-Korsakov published his own version after the composer's death - more expertly bright than the amateur Mussorgsky could have devised (or might have wanted to), much cut and with many fussy 'corrections' to the stark harmonies. In the latter respects Shostakovich is incomparably more faithful, but he indulges a very sweet tooth for chiming effects. (Mussorgsky had been dead ten years when Tchaikovsky first introduced the celesta for his Sugar-Plum Fairy.) They supply instant theatrical Affekt, of course  - just as Rimsky's prinked-out orchestration did, and no less of a modern distortion. This fine ENO production should gain depth and patina with time, without need of those dubious cosmetics.</p>

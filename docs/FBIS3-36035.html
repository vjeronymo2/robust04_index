ITAR-TASS learnt from Valeriy Gerasimov, head of the State  Duma's office, that "the meeting between the two lasted 45  minutes instead of the planned ten". The sides discussed  cooperation between the president and the lower house.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about the meaning of the notion  "succession of the State Duma" which will be debated at the  Duma's session this Friday, Gerasimov replied that "we mean  succession from pre-revolutionary time, since the present State  Duma is not the first in Russian history".    According to Gerasimov, legislators intend to study valuable  experience accumulated by Russian dumas before and after 1917,  mindful also of positive achievements of the former Russian  parliament.    Gerasimov refuted rumours about a possible intention by the  State Duma to put forth property claims, saying that the lower  chamber intends to dissociate itself from petty property issues.    According to Gerasimov, the State Duma will deal only with  projects which cannot be financed from local budgets, including  the State Duma library in St. Petersburg as well as the  Tavricheskiy Palace in the same city where inter-parliamentary  assemblies of the Commonwealth of Independent States are held.</p>

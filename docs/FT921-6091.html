			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Reconstruction planned for Govett Atlantic Govett Atlantic Investment Trust yesterday unveiled plans for a reconstruction following pressure from shareholders to produce proposals to eliminate the discount to net assets at which the shares have been trading, writes Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor. The plan is for the trust to be wound up and for the assets to be divided among two successor funds. Part will transferred into a limited life investment trust, to be called Govett American Smaller Companies Trust, but the majority will be transferred into one or more Govett-managed unit trusts, including a North American fund. Unit trusts trade at asset value so by selling their units for cash, investors will be able to realise over 50 per cent of their holdings in Govett Atlantic at asset value. Two investment groups, ST Partners and Buchanan Partners, recently requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting calling on the managers to produce reconstruction plans. Details of the proposals will be posted to shareholders by March 12.</p>

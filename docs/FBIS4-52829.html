			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] A climate has been created for resuming the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, which remain stalled. On  12 May, Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, met separately with  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and  Industry [MITI] Minister Eijiro Hata. "During his meeting with  Foreign Minister Kakizawa, the U.S. ambassador took a flexible  attitude toward resuming the stalled framework talks by putting  forth no conditions for their resumption" (says a U.S.  Government source). Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is eager to  resume the stalled framework talks and pave the way for Japan  and the United States to reach a set of agreements at the talks  prior to the Naples summit scheduled for July. However, "It is  impermissible to break off the framework talks again" (according  to a senior MITI official), and Japan and the United States are  expected to continue to negotiate the resumption of the stalled  framework talks through informal behind-the-scenes contacts.  The full-fledged resumption of the stalled framework talks,  however, hinges on whether or not the two countries will reach  an agreement on the interpretation of the objective criteria and  whether or not Japan will be able to put forth concrete plans  for income tax reductions and a macroeconomic policy.    During past Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United  States asked Japan to implement macroeconomic measures to expand  Japan's domestic demand and reduce Japan's current account  surplus, continue income tax reductions, and establish an  "objective criteria" under which numerical targets are set for  the three priority sectors of the government's procurement  (telecommunications and medical equipment), automobile and auto  parts, and insurance. In response, Japan reacted against the  U.S. proposal for establishing the objective criteria that  premises numerical targets, breaking off the framework talks.    Since the beginning of this month, however, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor has repeatedly stated: "The United  States is not seeking any numerical market share." During a  telephone conversation with Prime Minister Hata on the evening  of 9 May, President Clinton stressed the need to resume the  stalled framework talks at an earlier date. According to the  same U.S. Government source, during a separate meeting with  Foreign Minister Kakizawa and MITI Minister Hata, U.S.  Ambassador Mondale stated: "It is good even if the objective  criteria to be applied to the three priority sectors is not all  the same." In this way, the U.S. ambassador's statement can be  taken as the readiness on the part of the United States to make  concessions to what Japan has advocated.    Both Japan and the United States are said to have no  disagreement on the continued income tax cuts, but it still  remains unclear whether or not the government will set forth  clear plans for the continued income tax cuts by the end of June  because of a problem with financial resources.    The same senior MITI official warily says: "We do not expect  the United States to drop its proposal for the objective  criteria so easily."</p>

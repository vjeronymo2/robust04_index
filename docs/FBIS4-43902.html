			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  rejected employers' demands for social cuts as well as drastic  cuts in the social network. In the SAT-1 program "Let's Get  Down to Business, Chancellor," Kohl said on Wednesday [22 June]  that he does not at all share the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl,  president of the German Industrial and Trade Association (DIHT),  who had advocated drastic social cuts, among other things.  Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of Employers'  Associations, had taken up this demand and suggested cuts in the  social benefits for welfare recipients who are able to work.    In the television program, however, Kohl advocated that  abuse  and the "propagation" of social benefits "according to the pork  barrel principle" be eliminated. Social benefits are reserved  for those who are really poor, Kohl said. His proposal to  introduce more part-time work must not be misunderstood as a  panacea for the elimination of unemployment. The chancellor  advocated that apprentices immediately get a part-time job after  they have concluded their training if it is not possible to  immediately employ them permanently.    Kohl promised to reconsider the 20-percent investment  allowance for enterprises owned by former GDR citizens. It is  conceivable for him that this allowance will not be completely  abolished, but it might be degressively shaped.    The chancellor explicitly paid tribute to the attitude of  the  employers and trade unions when the latest collective  negotiations were concluded. "In the past few weeks, we  received very wise and reasonable collective agreements," he  said. After an economic decline, there is "a tendency" toward  an upswing. Moreover, he expects an increase in the gross  national product that exceeds the forecast of 1.5 percent.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: Luisa Miller - Opera in Geneva When a tenor is on form, it is the tenor's opera - even when it is named after the soprano. This was the case with Neil Shicoff's performance in Luisa Miller at the Grand Theatre, Geneva (broadcast live by Radio 3 on Saturday evening). Verdi could have written the part of Rodolfo for Shicoff. He may not fit the conventional picture of a romantic suitor: the neurotic expression, bookish spectacles and delicate build conjure visions of an operatic Woody Allen rather than the squire's son who falls hopelessly in love with a village girl. But he still looks youthful enough for the part. The key, of course, is the voice: Shicoff remains the focus of attention simply through the emotive power of his singing. The American tenor's trademark is his tragic, tearful vocal timbre. He does not overwork it, and despite the Italianate ardour of his delivery, he never resorts to the sobs, scoops and other mannerisms that all too many Italian tenors equate with feeling. Nor does he force the tone. On a good night like this, he hits the notes accurately, fearlessly, musically. He also gives you the impression that he is totally committed to the part, rather than sailing through it en route to the next celebrity concert. Where Shicoff appealed to the heart, the German film director Werner Schroeter succeeded in making Verdi's first bourgeois drama appeal to the head. Schroeter's staging, designed by Alberte Barsacq and first seen last season in Amsterdam, uses period costumes, but otherwise dispenses with the customary anecdotal trappings. In their place is a permanent multi-level construction of platforms and staircases, a metaphor of the complexity and claustrophobia of Tyrolean village life. The chorus watches from side-galleries as the emotions of the principals are systematically laid bare. The result may strike some as clinical, and until the final scene the characters remain stereotypes; but the story is intelligently told, the music never crowded out. That meant ample opportunity to appreciate the style and sparkle of the accompaniments under Carlo Rizzi, who lifted the responses of the Geneva orchestra and chorus a good notch or two above normal. Kallen Esperian's rapturous Luisa was more successful in the lyrical outpourings of the second part of the evening than the coloratura of the first. Paul Plishka, in fine voice, captured the domineering selfishness of Count Walter. Even more impressive was the crisp, penetrating delivery of the Polish bass Romuald Tesarowicz, whose Wurm recalled Obadiah Slope in the Barchester Chronicles: beneath the oily hauteur lies a scorpion. Antonio Salvadori, replacing Thomas Allen, was a workmanlike Miller. Grand Theatre, Geneva. Final performance on Sunday</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japanese brokers declare a new-found confidence - Doubts remain about the durability of the rally on the Tokyo stock exchange WHEN executives of Japan's leading brokerages paraded through the stock exchange building yesterday, announcing downward revisions of optimistic profit forecasts, they tentatively suggested that the worst of the three-year stock crisis may be over. The revisions left only Nomura Securities expecting a net profit this year, a modest Y2bn (Dollars 17m), but the figures were not as unsightly as was likely in early February, when daily turnover on the Tokyo exchange was a mediocre 200m shares and the government intensified its campaign to prop up stock prices. Japanese brokers' new-found confidence comes from an unexpected surge in trading volumes this month and from a turnaround in their own share prices. However, doubts remain about the rally's durability, and there are fears that a large wave of selling will knock the market down again when the new fiscal year begins on April 1. 'It is difficult to predict the future, but things may be getting better,' said Mr Takashi Emmei, vice-president of Yamaichi Securities, which expects a pre-tax loss of Y39bn, following on a Y53.2bn setback in the previous year. It had forecast earlier that it would break even this year. Like the other Big Four brokers, Yamaichi's losses would be larger but for the stock market's renewed vigour and the robustness of the domestic bond market. Nomura expects profits of about Y35bn from its bond operations and will be helped by a Y18.48bn extraordinary profit on the sale of an Osaka office building to another member of its group, Nomura Land and Building. Despite yesterday's announcements, brokers' final results will be heavily influenced by the movement of the Nikkei index over the next two weeks. The higher the year-end close, the lower the amount they will be forced to write-off as stock appraisal losses, which a friendly finance ministry allowed them to defer at the end of the first-half. These write-offs could be particularly damaging for the 10 second-tier brokers. They forecast losses ranging from Y9.2bn at Tokyo Securities to a daunting Y50.3bn at Kankaku Securities, which had previously expected a more modest loss of Y21bn. The second-tier brokers are more reliant on commissions, making their profits more vulnerable during periods of weak prices and turnover. At it lowest moments this year, turnover was one-tenth of that seen during the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Credit Suisse Research Japan, said the recent surge in turnover was due partly to increased interest in shares, but brokers were also trading heavily on their own accounts and public funds were still being pumped into the market. She said that, at present income levels, one of the mid-sized brokers would have to cut staff by 90 or more per cent to ensure a profit. Until now, Japanese brokers have announced 'restructuring' plans seemingly based on expectations of a market turnover of around 400m shares a day, far above the level for much of this year. If the houses interpret the present revival of the market as a reason to delay deeper cuts in expenses, they will find it difficult to avoid a third year of embarrassing losses. But Mr David Snoddy, financials specialist at Jardine Fleming, said the brokers were fortunate in that, unlike Japanese banks, their problems were to be found in the profit and loss statement, not on the balance sheet. 'It's easier to address the P&amp;L problem - they just have to keep cutting costs.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            JAPANESE BROKERS                Estimates for year ending March 1993 (Ybn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    REVENUE        PRE-TAX PROFIT        NET PROFIT                 1993    1992      1993      1992      1993      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nomura           345   421.7         0      44.1         2      31.6 Daiwa            240   321.1        -8       9.3       -10     -43.5 Nikko            230   287.9         0       3.1       -11     -25.9 Yamaichi         185   231.4       -39     -36.5       -48     -53.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

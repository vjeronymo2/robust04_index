			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Brokers' pilgrimage fails to stop the fall: Mysticism and some material facts affecting the stock market Sixty officials from leading Japanese brokerage houses made a pilgrimage earlier this month to the Grand Shrine of Ise, the sanctuary of the Shinto sun goddess, to try to stop the fall in the Tokyo stock market. It didn't work. Yesterday the Nikkei 225 index fell to an eight-month low of 17,384.84, down 14 per cent from a month ago. 'It feels like August last year (when the market hit a six-year low),' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. 'Liquidity is being drained from the market and the government is doing little to help.' The catalysts for the fall have been technical, as they were last year. The October listing of East Japan Railway, the largest flotation since 1987, drained liquidity from the stock market. A shift in trading from the Nikkei 225 index to the Nikkei 300 index has also caused investors to unload stock excluded from the new index, which has exaggerated the fall. Such selling has been felt strongly in a market lacking support from public pension and insurance funds. In addition, overseas investors, who were attracted to the market since the yen's appreciation against the dollar earlier this year, are no longer buying as the yen has started to retreat. Technical factors aside, underlying confidence over the economy and corporate earnings has continued to deteriorate and investors have become increasingly uneasy at the price of shares. After a spate of poor earnings estimates for the year to March, prospective price-earnings ratios were pushed as high as 95 at the end of October. Many of the companies that reported interim earnings during the past few weeks have revised downward their profit estimates for the latter part of the year. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, pre-tax profits at 1,237 leading businesses are expected to fall 21 per cent for the year to March and there are fears a recovery may not be seen until late next year. Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer, says the market's support levels lie around 17,000 on the Nikkei 225 or 1,430 on the Topix index, 4.2 per cent below yesterday's close. Many analysts are disinclined to predict how low the market could fall if shares do pass through these points. With bank lending already weak from slack demand for funds, government officials have repeatedly refused to support the stock market, arguing that the effects on the financial system are limited. However, the impact of a further market fall on business sentiment could be devastating as companies may no longer be able to treat unrealised profits on shareholdings as a buffer against poor earnings. Further erosion of such unrealised gains could spark profit-taking. Banks, which want to use profits on long-term shareholdings to cover losses from write-offs of their mounting bad loans, are also likely to need to realise profits before share prices fall further. For a full recovery in share prices and investor confidence, an upturn in the economy is essential but, what is more important, corporate leaders need to implement aggressive restructuring to cut unwanted costs. For the past year, leading companies have been announcing cost-cutting plans consisting of restraining capital investment, shuffling staff and curbing production. All have seemed half-hearted by western standards. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, says the stock market will bottom out around April next year when companies depart from the Japanese corporate tradition of life-time employment and start shedding staff. 'The stock market is sounding its bell, warning that earnings will not recover unless companies make that big decision,' he says. See World Stock Markets, Page 43</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DELAY ON HOSTAGES TIED TO GULF  </P> <P> A pro-Iranian leader said today that the deployment of U.S. troops in the  Persian Gulf will delay the release of American hostages in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "I don't see . . . that the American hostages will be released soon because  America is in a state of clear aggression against the Islamic nation," Hussein  Moussawi, a senior member of Hezbollah (Party of God), said.  </P> <P> "Releasing the American hostages now would be a reward to the Americans for  their invasion of the gulf," Moussawi said.  </P> <P> "As for the other European hostages, be they Britons or others, their situation  is different than that of the Americans," he added.  </P> <P> A Beirut newspaper reported today that all Western hostages in Lebanon could be  free by the end of the year. The leftist As-Safir newspaper said secret  contacts are taking place between Tehran and Lebanese and Palestinian groups  with links to the hostage-takers.  </P></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Ankara warned on trade taxes Turkey has made big strides in liberalising its trade regime over the past decade, but the economic benefits have been marred by rapid inflation, swollen budget deficits and insufficient competition in the domestic market, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In a report on the country's trade policies and practices, the Gatt secretariat says rampant inflation - currently exceeding 70 per cent a year  -has been hard to restrain because the authorities have printed money to finance large public deficits. The government is also over-reliant on trade taxes, Gatt says, noting that their share in the total tax revenue has risen from 12 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1990. As trade taxes become a diminishing source of revenue, Ankara will have to find other ways to reduce the budget deficit and service its foreign debt. Turkey hopes to reach customs union with the European Union in 1995, which will mean duty-free entry for EU goods and adoption of the EU's common external tariff. Gatt also notes that real wage increases, unmatched by productivity gains, have eroded Turkey's competitiveness, leading to big trade deficits. The report, the latest in a series on Gatt members' trade regimes, came at the end of a week which saw a plunge in the value of the Turkish lira following a downgrading of the country's credit rating by two US ratings companies.</p>

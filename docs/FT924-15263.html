			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Sultan marks 25 years of wonderful wealth THE Sultan of Brunei does not like being called the world's richest individual. But with a fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.7bn), it is hard to deny being among the wonderfully wealthy. His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, is celebrating 25 years as absolute monarch of this small but financially well endowed state on the west coast of the island of Borneo. Yesterday was the main event to mark the anniversary of the sultan's 'ascension' to the throne. The sultan also serves as prime minister and defence minister. Government is very much a family affair. One brother is minister of foreign affairs, another is finance minister. Lavish is one word to describe the Sultan of Brunei's palace. Large is another. A banqueting hall where 6,000 sat down to an anniversary meal yesterday. A palace with 257 lavatories and a total of nearly 1,800 rooms. Several sultans, princes and princesses, Asian heads of state and other dignitaries watched the sultan ascend his throne. Tiaras were de rigueur. Diamonds dazzled. There have been no elections in Brunei for more than 30 years. A state of emergency has been in force ever since British troops were brought in to put down an uprising in 1962. Brunei only became fully independent in 1984. The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, made a royal anniversary statement. The present system of monarchical government had served Brunei well. There would be no change. That means no elections and no political parties. Islam would continue to be emphasised. The sultan would donate Dollars 1m of his own money to help the Moslems in Bosnia. One of the sultan's many Rolls Royces purred outside. The monarch was taken a short distance and then off-loaded onto the royal chariot, a rather unwieldly vehicle the length of a cricket pitch pulled and pushed by a small army of courtiers. The sultan is an ex-Sandhurst man. The guards slow-stepped in perfect formation. The band played Malay music. It played 'Colonel Bogey'. Cash from oil and gas has transformed Brunei. With a population of only 250,000 the country has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.</p>

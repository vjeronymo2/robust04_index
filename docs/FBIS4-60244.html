			<p>BFN     [Text] The address at the Johannesburg mosque by PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat causes doubt regarding his intention to  keep the agreement with Israel. A tape of his address contains  remarks in which he says that the fate of the agreement signed  with Israel will be similar to that of the agreement Prophet  Muhammad signed with the Quiraish Tribe. Professor Moshe  Sharon, an expert on the history of Islam, explains that  Muhammad signed a nonbelligerency agreement with the tribe which  was in control of Mecca. But two years later he violated the  agreement, conquered Mecca, and killed the leaders of the tribe.  The segment of the tape was given to our correspondent Gil  Litman.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 22 May  carries a similar report by Gil Litman that includes the  following recorded passage in English from the address by  'Arafat: "And I am sure, sooner or later, we will pray in  Jerusalem together. This agreement, I am not considering it  more than the agreement which had been signed between our  Prophet Muhammad and Quiraish." Prof. Sharon says in the report  that "this set a legal Muslim precedent, according to which you  sign an agreement with the enemy when it suits you, and you  violate it when you can. That is to say: Any agreement between  Muslims and non-Muslims can be violated when it is convenient  for the Muslim party."    [Quoting further from the recording, Litman says that  'Arafat  made the following remark: "There is no permanent state named  Israel."]</p>

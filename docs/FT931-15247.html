			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Tokyo to review future of peace constitution THE Japanese government yesterday decided to open up the country's most sensitive political issue, the future of its post-war peace constitution, by approving plans for a bi-partisan commission to review it. The decision is likely to spark a vigorous debate over the merits of the key Article Nine in the 1947 constitution which renounces war, as well as the threat of, or use of, force to settle international disputes. The debate will crystallise positions within Japan on how it should develop a wider international role in the wake of the end of the cold war. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy affairs council, who proposed the commission, said revisions to the constitution would be necessary if Japan was to respond to its allies' calls for it to play a larger role in peace-keeping operations undertaken by the United Nations. Mr Mitsuzuka is backed by several other LDP leaders including Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the party's powerful general secretary, and Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the young former general secretary who recently founded his own faction. The Socialist party, which has traditionally opposed revision of Article Nine, has recently indicated it is prepared to reconsider the issue. However, older LDP leaders, led by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, are opposed to tampering with the constitution. Significantly, the decision to set up the commission was taken in Mr Miyazawa's absence on a tour of South-East Asia. The debate will be as tortuous as it is heated. The government last year passed a bill, only after two years of wrangling, which would allow Japanese troops to be sent abroad. Any revision to the constitution would it in itself mark an important step for Japan towards a more independent foreign policy. The constitution has never been amended since it was introduced by the US occupying force after the Second World War. Amendment would require the support of two-thirds of both houses of the Japanese parliament.</p>

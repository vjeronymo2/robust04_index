			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Kohl Never Wanted To Attend Normandy </F> Landings Ceremony"]    [Text] In London on Wednesday [27 April], Chancellor  Helmut Kohl reiterated that he has never tried to get himself  invited to the ceremonies marking D-Day, the day of the Allied  landings in Normandy. "I would never go, even if I were  invited," he said following British-German consultations with  Prime Minister John Major at Chequers, the British prime  minister's country seat. But Kohl left no doubt as to the fact  that he would attend next year's VE-Day celebrations, the 50th  anniversary of the end of the war. He said he would be there to  pay his respects to the World War II dead. Needless to say, the  British side claims that preparations for the VE-Day  celebrations have not started yet. Following domestic squabbles  about the D-Day celebrations, Major must make sure he reaches  agreement with the war veterans associations in his country.    Apart from this, the German-British consultations, which  were  also attended by several ministers, took place in unusual  harmony. Major reported that at no time had there been any  disagreement. According to both Kohl and Major, the only open  question, that of choosing a successor to European Union [EU]  Commission Chairman Jacques Delors, had not been settled. In  any case, it became clear during fringe talks that the Germans  would not support the candidacy of the British favorite, Sir  Leon Brittan. But Kohl claimed that the German Government has  not yet made up its mind about this.    The heads of government reported at length on the subject of  the future expansion of the EU. According to London, once  Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have become members, many  years will pass before further members can be considered. "It  is quite clear," said the Chancellor, "that there will be a long  pause following the ratification of the new membership  applications." Hungary and Poland are among the potential  applicants for EU membership. The path to a further opening of  the EU should be paved during Germany's presidency of the EU,  which begins on 1 July and will last six months.    The two government heads agreed to suggest to Hungary the  holding of a trilateral military exercise in peace protection in  1995, as part of the Partnership for Peace. "We will invite the  NATO command to take full part in the planning of this exercise,  and at the same time we hope to create the prerequisites for  other interested parties to take part as well," said a joint  statement. Apart from this, the government heads promised their  full support for the American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement and  expressed their concern for the successful conclusion of the  effort to help Ukraine destroy its nuclear weapons. "We will  exchange information and experiences from our respective aid  programs to make a maximum contribution to the collective  objective of security and partnerlike relations in the entire  region," it was said. For this purpose, the two men want to  share their experience they have already gained, especially  concerning the German retraining and accommodation construction  programs for Ukrainian military personnel.    The situation in Bosnia also figured prominently in the  talks. The chancellor said he could see a "light at the end of  the tunnel in former Yugoslavia." On the other hand, other  crises are possible, he said. "Nobody should think that the  evil spirits we have seen in the Balkans have already been  exorcized," said Kohl.</p>

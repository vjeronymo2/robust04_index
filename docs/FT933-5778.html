			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late firming of bonds helps Dow to rise Wall Street US STOCK markets edged near or into record territory yesterday, supported by a late firming trend in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent all day in a narrow trading range a few points either side of opening values, was up 7.26 at 3,651.25, less than a point shy of its all-time high. Other leading indices set new records. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.66 firmer at 463.56, the American SE composite 2.33 higher at 458.60 and the Nasdaq composite 5.46 stronger at 742.82. New York SE trading volume was 252.8m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,168 to 774. Prices drifted for the second consecutive day, analysts noting that the markets traditionally move in narrow ranges in the days before the long Labor Day holiday weekend, which signals the end of summer. Initially, investors failed to respond positively either to stronger markets overseas - Tokyo, Frankfurt and London shares were all higher overnight - or the Commerce Department's upward revision of its estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product from an original 1.6 per cent increase to 1.8 per cent. The upward revision caught Wall Street off guard, because analysts had been predicting that the GDP figures would be revised downwards ever since the June merchandise trade data revealed a sharp weakening in export sales. The lack of a strong reaction from equities was probably due to a decline in Treasury prices that was sparked by the GDP data. When longer-dated Treasuries recovered later in the day, however, equities also firmed. Additional good economic news on consumer confidence (the Conference Board's index rose this month) and manufacturing activity (the National Association of Purchasing Management's August index was also up) may also have helped prices. Airline issues were in demand: UAL rose Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 148 1/2 , Delta Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 and AMR, parent of American Airlines, Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 67. Among mostly firmer drug shares, SmithKline-Beecham fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 after broking house Wertheim Schroder downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'sell', citing concern about possible weak sales next year. Another stock moving on a broker's report was WMX Technologies, which climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 32 7/8 in busy trading after Prudential Securities repeated its 'strong buy' recommendation on the shares and predicted that earnings growth would accelerate over the coming year. Chemical Waste Management, a WMX unit, put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 9 1/8 . The Limited added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 23 3/8 in volume of 3.1m shares after the retail group announced a restructuring that includes shrinking or closing 360 stores by the end of 1995. Canada TORONTO finished the day mixed after fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was off 1.2 at 4,137.5 but advances narrowly led declines by 388 to 366. Volume totalled 60.6m shares valued at CDollars 633m. The transportation sector showed the largest swing among the sub-group indices, climbing 2.24 per cent.</p>

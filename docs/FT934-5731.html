			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Brazil near debt accord A large majority of Brazil's foreign bank creditors support the Dollars 52bn (Pounds 34.8bn) debt agreement due to be signed in Toronto today, writes Richard Waters in New York. By the end of last week, creditors accounting for 86 per cent of the debt had backed the deal, said Mr Bill Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank. With more European and Japanese banks expected to communicate agreement by this morning, the proportion should reach 90 per cent, he said. The deal needs 95 per cent support to be triggered but banks supporting the deal are confident it will go through. Brazil has yet to reach an agreement with the IMF, on which the bank deal depends. Economic reforms outlined last week are intended to form the basis for such an agreement.</p>

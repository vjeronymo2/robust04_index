			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Builders cautious on upturn TWO of the UK's leading building materials and housebuilding groups reported higher profits yesterday, but both urged caution in assessing the recovery. Wilson Bowden, one of Britain's most successful housebuilders, said it sold 28 per cent more houses in the first half. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 16.8m, from Pounds 10.3m, with help from a pension surplus. But Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, said the group had yet to see any evidence of house price rises and suggested that its higher volumes in part reflected the group's success in increasing market share. This year, with the total UK new housing market expected to reach about 170,000 units, he expected his group to sell 1,750 houses, against 1,367 last year. He believed firmer demand for new houses over the next few months would enable house-builders to remove the incentives - including discounts and free carpets - they have been offering. Between now and Christmas he suggested house prices could firm by about 3 per cent as the special discounts ended. Next year he believed prices could rise by 5 per cent. After good house sales in August, he said: 'I think we are moving out of recession, but we are not there yet.' Mr Geoffrey Higham, chairman of Rugby Group, the UK's third largest cement manufacturer, is even more cautious about the construction and building materials sectors. Although Rugby reported marginally higher first-half pre-tax profits at Pounds 30.5m, he noted that the construction industry remained depressed and the group's UK cement sales and profits were both lower in the first six months. He also cautioned that year-on-year comparisons could be misleading because the 1992 first half was relatively buoyant while the second half was 'a disaster'. 'There appears to be patchy improvement in the UK economy,' he said, but added that it would be 1994 before the construction industry showed any growth. In the meantime some analysts, such as Mr Mark Stockdale of Warburg Securities, believe the market has already fully discounted the cyclical recovery. Most building and construction stocks have risen sharply over the past 12 months. With more building and construction results due this week, Mr Stockdale said: 'I think it is too late for recovery plays.' Details, Page 22</p>

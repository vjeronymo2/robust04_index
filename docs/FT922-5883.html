			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (1): Wrapped up in the law - The industry has reacted with dismay to being depicted as a polluter in a wave of environmental legislation that has swept the industrialised world. But its high visibility and throw-away culture connotations have made it a prime target MR HANS Rausing, the chairman of the Swedish Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval group, whose great height and business reputation means that he towers over the packaging industry both physically and symbolically, tells a simple story to illustrate the necessity of packaging products. Browsing through an English 1920s detective novel in his father's library, he came across a passage in which a group of upper-class women in London were discussing how to get good milk. 'As late as the 1920s, in the richest city in Europe, these well-to-do women could not find decent milk,' he says incredulously. 'The reason? Lack of packaging.' According to Mr Rausing, between 1912 and 1937 there were 65,000 deaths attributable to infections from raw milk in England; between 1951 and 1980 there were just four. Effective packaging was at least partly responsible for this substantial reduction. 'The food industry and food distribution could not function without packaging,' he says. Throughout the third world, millions of people have accepted the truth of this remark, and are desperately trying to make the same move up the packaging ladder to a situation where food products are safely processed, packed and distributed. In central and eastern Europe, too, there is a vast need for improvements in the management of food distribution to help prevent the appalling squandering of resources. Even in the most dilapidated parts of the former Soviet empire, there is rarely a shortage of produce at the farm gates but there is invariably a deficit of goods on the shop shelves. Given the essential tasks that it believes it performs, the packaging industry has therefore reacted with a sense of dismay, bordering on disgust, to being depicted as a dirty polluter in a wave of environmental legislation that has swept across the industrialised world. Used packaging looms large in the eyes of consumers, as they daily see it as litter on street corners and cram it into their dustbins - Americans probably hold the world record, generating four pounds of rubbish every day. Because of its high visibility and connotations with a 'throw-away' culture, the packaging industry has been a prime target for environmental campaigners who have found it easy to stir up popular passions. Politicians have naturally responded by introducing legislation. In Germany, the forceful environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, has effectively coerced industry into establishing a massive recycling scheme called the Duales System Deutschland (DSD). This system promises to recycle ever-increasing proportions of used packaging and drastically reduce the volume of waste going to landfill sites. The industrial architects of the scheme stress that it is experimental and will be fine-tuned over time, but its introduction has, nevertheless, provoked furious controversy within the European packaging industry. Companies outside Germany complain that mountains of waste products - which cannot yet be absorbed into existing recycling schemes within Germany - are being dumped on foreign markets, destroying the fragile economics of indigenous recycling projects. One leading figure in the packaging industry recently described the DSD system as 'absolute lunacy', because it devoured more energy in recovering and re-using waste packaging than it saved - resulting in a net negative impact on the environment. Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, have also introduced stringent environmental legislation affecting packaging products. The European Commission is also polishing up the final drafts of its directive for the avoidance of packaging waste, which is expected to be published later this year. The legislative picture is, if anything, even more confused in North America. At a packaging conference earlier this year, Mr John Bence, a senior vice-president of Stone Container Corporation, described the difficulties of dealing with the 'crazy quilt' of state and local laws that had been created in the US. In 1990, he said, 38 states enacted 140 recycling laws, most with different stipulations. But many independent industry observers are now pausing and seriously questioning whether this onslaught of popular and legislative pressure is addressing the real problems associated with packaging and the environment. Professor Bill Rathje, an American garbologist from the University of Arizona, who spends his days digging up old landfill sites to examine what lies within, says there is a vast discrepancy between public perceptions of the problem and the realities. In consumer surveys in the US, most people believed that fast-food packaging, such as McDonald's clam shells, accounted for more than 20 per cent of the volume of landfill sites, with polystyrene foam representing more than 30 per cent and disposable diapers - or nappies  - filling more than 25 per cent. The real figures in an average landfill site, according to Prof Rathje, are 0.25 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. Almost half of landfill sites are stuffed with newspapers and other paper products - which only decompose very slowly. Construction rubble and organic waste also account for a substantial proportion. In the grand scheme of things, therefore, domestic packaging waste ranks low in the list of environmental priorities, representing perhaps only 2-3 per cent of the total waste generated by modern industrial economies. Nevertheless, such facts certainly do not absolve the industry. There is undoubtedly far more that it can sensibly do to reduce the environmental impact of packaging. Much more progress can be made in 'lightweighting' products by using less raw material, redesigning packages to include more recycled, enlarging them to increase the ratio of volume to area, and even changing the nature of the contents by introducing concentrated detergents, for example. In general, the response of the packaging industry to the environmental onslaught has been pretty pitiful, as many in the industry privately admit. Trade associations in each different sector of the packaging industry - including glass, aluminium, tinplate, plastics, paper and board - have all lobbied hard to 'prove' the environmental acceptability of their own products - often maligning their rivals products in the process. But this has only exacerbated tensions in what has always been a highly fragmented industry. No one has yet acted effectively to adopt a broader perspective and campaigned for the most desirable industry-wide solution. Yet such solutions are perhaps possible if only the industry would sit down with environmentalists and government and agree on an accepted framework of debate. Many observers accept that life-cycle analyses, which assess environmental impact from 'cradle to grave', can be an effective tool in determining the right balance between different packaging products. But such analyses often run the risk of subjectivity, and there is a need for them to work on an accepted set of premises. At present, there is no single packaging industry, according to one leading supplier, only separate sectors. But there must be one - not only for the sake of the environment but the future prosperity of the packaging companies themselves.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Georg C. Goy of the General Directorate for </F> Energy (DG XVII), European Communities Commission, THERMIE,  Brussels: "THERMIE: EC Aid for Nonnuclear Energy Technologies;  Small and Medium-Sized Companies Given Preference; Goals Are  Energy Conservation and CO2 Reduction"]    [Text]  HANDELSBLATT-TL, 23 Nov--For more than 15 years now the EC has  been providing aid for the development, demonstration, and,  lastly, also the first steps in introducing new, innovative, and  efficient energy technologies on the market in Europe. In the  process, almost 3,000 projects have so far been financially  supported by the EC with a total of about 1.9 billion ECU  [European currency units], initially through various  demonstration programs and since 1990 through the new THERMIE  (Energy Technology for Energy Control) program.    The THERMIE program (EEC Council Decree No. 2008/90, ABL No.  185 of 17 July 1990) is designed for the five-year period,  1990-1994, and thus ends next year. It is provided with an  average volume of about 700 million ECU; that is, about 150-170  million ECU a year are available to promote nonnuclear energy  technologies in the member countries.    The current debate in the Commission and the Council of  Ministers on the inclusion of a successor tto the THERMIE  program in the EC's fourth general research program and the  effects of the budget in connection with it will decide what  sort of role aid for energy technologies will assume within the  Community area in the future and also, based on it, to a greater  extent in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe bordering  on the EC as well as the countries bordering on the  Mediterranean.    THERMIE concentrates on three main areas:        -  Financial support for projects that promote innovative  energy technologies that are ready for application;    -  Measures for the introduction into the market and deployment  of  new energy technologies;    -  Coordination of EC-wide as well as national, regional, and  local activities in this field.       The THERMIE program enables the EC to provide financial  support for:    a) innovative projects: These projects are  expected to develop new kinds of technologies, methods, or  products (TMP) for which the research and development stage has  been essentially completed to the point of readiness for  application and to promote new kinds of applications for already  known TMP. This type of project is expected to prove the  technical and economic viability of new technologies by means of  an initial production run on a sufficiently large scale.    b) dissemination projects: The goal of these  projects is to promote innovative TMP that have already  undergone an initial production run, but which, because of  ongoing risks, it has hitherto not yet been possible to  successfully market and for which there are now really good  chances of their wider application in the Community, whether it  be under other economic or geographical conditions or with the  aid of different technical versions.    c) targeted projects: If the Commission considers  it necessary and has identified an unfilled public need, that  is, significant technological advances are to be anticipated  through cooperation between persons or firms from at least two  member countries, the implementation of special projects, which  must be oriented in terms of the Commission's detailed  specifications, may be sponsored on the initiative of the  Commission, that is, their coordination may be financially  supported (so-called "targeted projects").  <H5>  Aid for Projects and Accompanying Measures </H5>   The THERMIE program covers all nonnuclear energy  technologies  that can make innovative contributions in the sectors:        -  Energy conservation, that is, efficient use of energy,  specifically in the subsectors: - buildings, - industry, - the  energy industry, - transport and communications;    -  New and renewable sources of energy in the subsectors: -  photovoltaics, - solar energy, - biomass, - geothermy, - small  hydroelectric power plants, - wind energy;    -  Solid fuels, and;    -  Hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas).       About 85 percent of the funds is earmarked for direct  project  aid and about 15 percent for "accompanying measures." The aid is  provided in the form of a direct subsidy which does not have to  be repaid even if the project is a commercial success,  specifically, up to 40 percent of the costs that qualify for  subsidization for innovative and "targeted" projects and up to  35 percent for dissemination projects.    The projects are to be implemented within the confines of  the  Community, but there may be exceptions. In any case, safety  provisions and those relevant to the environment in effect at  any given time must be complied with. When the cost of a project  exceeds an investment figure of 6 million ECU, the applicants  from at least two member countries must come to document the  European dimension of the project. Furthermore, while, of  course, basic technical feasibility and marketability of the  technologies are required, there must also be difficulties in  financing because of technical and/or economic risks in  realizing the projects for which subsidies are applied for to  obtain aid.    Projects that materialize through the collaboration of firms  from several member countries, are to be implemented by small  and medium-sized companies, and/or are established in  economically less developed regions of the Community are given  preference. The more of these criteria the applicant meets, the  more chance he has of influencing the success rate of 1:4  (selected versus applied-for projects) in his favor.    This is to be viewed as a reform of the present program  vis-a-vis its predecessors in that support for efficient energy  technologies is not limited to only those projects that have  already been subsidized by the EC. But rather THERMIE also  provides aid for the introduction into the market of  technologies that have already been readied for market as part  of national or other public programs as well as by industry  alone, that is, without any public subsidy.    The "accompanying measures" that are included in the THERMIE  program as an additional reform are expected to in particular  see to the dissemination of the results of the projects or  reports on the respective technologies. They may not  discriminate against any firm, but are available largely free of  charge to interested parties as a service of the program and to  improve market openness.    The most important tasks, which are covered by the  organizations for the promotion of energy technologies, the  so-called OPETS, set up to take care of them, apply to:        -  The effecting of market studes as well as analyses of  the chances of introducing innovative energy technologies and  studies of the effects of environmental policy during  on-the-spot operation as well as the importance of regional  policy for them, and more besides,    -  The dissemination of reports on the projects and technologies  through the collection, editing, and preparation of  informational material (brochures, leaflets, technical reports,  translations into the language of the country); the organization  of and participation in appropriate events, seminars, and  conferences; the organization of project tours for, for example,  journalists and interested parties from inside and outside the  country; and the development and maintenance of data banks  (Sesame, etc.).    -  The construction of tranfer points (public and private) at  local, regional, or national levels.       In selecting these OPETS, of which there are, at present, 40  throughout Europe, the Commission chose a decentralized approach  that could fall back on individual organizations specializing in  energy sectors in the member countries. They form a network of  private firms (in many cases engineer's offices), professional  organizaitons, public (energy) agencies and institutes that are  active on regional or national levels and can if necessary fall  back on a potential total of about 3,000 energy experts.    These OPETS receive financial support form the Commission  for  their cooperation in the amount of from 13 to 15 million ECU a  year to carry out 200 actions within the framework of the  THERMIE program.    In addition, with the Commission's decision of December  1991,  some OPETS were commissioned to establish so-called EC energy  centers in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and to  coordinate their activities. To date 14 energy centers in  national or regional capitals of the former CEMA have launched  their activities. Their job consists of in particular  facilitating and promoting the transfer of knowledge and  technology between the European Community and these countries.    Each of these centers is headed by a director appointed by  the Commission who is supported by a local representative, a  number of energy experts, and the necessary administrative  personnel. In addition, if necessary energy experts from the  member countries are also employed in them for certain missions  subject to time limits.  <H5>  Priming for Reproductions </H5>   Recent analyses commissioned by the Commission and conducted  by independent experts prove that energy savings of or an  energyproduction amounting to 1.5 million tons of crude oil  units (ROeE) could be obtained with the help of the THERMIE  program and its predecessors through the projects themselves  (first application), and especially, of course, in the areas of  efficient use of energy and exploitation of renewable sources of  energy. This amounts to 0.2 percent of the EC's energy needs.    If we consider how the EC intends to allocate funds for  this,  namely by providing strong support through the THERMIE program,  especially for all technologies for which a great potential for  reproduction can be presumed, we get a more impressive picture  of the situation. if we include those reproductions of  successfully completed EC projects that have to date already  been launched and are yet to be anticipated with a high degree  of probability, up to 18 million tons of ROeE--and, if the at  this time known potential for these energy technologies is fully  exhausted, theoretically even as much as 120 million tons of  ROeE--a year can be saved or replaced with the aid of renewable  sources of energy throughout all of Europe. In the process,  CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  emissions in the EC could at the same time be  reduced by as much as 15 percent and, of course, be applied to  the current level of about 3 billion tons of CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  emissions in the EC. An achievement, therefore, that would have  to make people sit up and take notice if we bear in mind the  EC's goal of stabilizing CO&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  emissions in the  Community at the 1990 level by the year 2000.    Realistically viewed, however, we have to assume that this  potential would only have a chance of coming to nearly full  fruition with extraordinary efforts on the part of all those  involved and substantially more favorable background conditions,  which could benefit these energy technologies in, for example,  the form of a constantly rising energy price level as they  penetrate the market. Increased efforts are also necessary in  areas other than immediate support for projects only insofar as  they offer a realistic chance of attaining reduction targets as  concerns CO2 emissions through combined action.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |EC-Supported Technology Projects in Energy Sector Up to End of 1992       |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Number of Pro-|Percentage of |Aid Funds in 1|Percentage of |  |              |jects         |Total         |,000s of ECU  |Total         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Energy conser-|793           |27.7          |359,653       |20.5          |  |vation:       |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Buildings     |149           |5.2           |31,475        |1.8           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry      |469           |16.4          |233,164       |13.3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Energy indust-|95            |3.3           |57,732        |3.3           |  |ry            |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Traffic       |80            |2.8           |37,280        |2.1           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Renewable sou-|1,085         |37.9          |371,943       |21.2          |  |rces of energ-|              |              |              |              |  |y:            |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Solar         |374           |13.0          |84,573        |4.8           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Biomass       |223           |7.8           |109,361       |6.2           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Geothermy     |153           |5.3           |75,017        |4.3           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Water power   |152           |5.3           |37,543        |2.1           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Wind          |183           |6.4           |65,449        |3.7           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Solid fuels   |221           |7.7           |419,199       |23.9          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil and natur-|767           |26.8          |600,218       |34.3          |  |al gas        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total         |2,866         |100           |1,751,012     |100           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: THERMIE.                                                          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Venture capitalists must be more realistic Sir, Your article 'Unhappy returns' (Management, February 9), warning that many companies are in danger of under-investing, has particular relevance to the venture capital industry. In our experience many venture capital fund managers, when negotiating with unquoted companies with a view to investing in them, will state that they are seeking internal rates of return of more than 30 per cent. These rates have remained broadly unchanged and unchallenged for many years in spite of recent substantial falls in the real cost of money. The venture capital industry needs to adapt to the present cost of money if it is to increase its deal flow to compete with those trade purchasers which have adjusted.

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Increase in orders lifts hopes of sustained recovery HOPES that Britain's economic recovery may prove to be sustained were boosted last night by news that UK manufacturers' order books are at their best levels for 3 1/2 years. The Confederation of British Industry said overall demand improved and the number of companies expecting output to increase over the next four months rose in August compared with June and July. Although the employers' body expressed some concern about sluggish investment growth, it raised its forecast for growth of UK gross domestic product next year to 3 per cent from 2.6 per cent previously. The CBI expected economic growth this year would be 1.7 per cent compared with 1.6 per cent predicted in May. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs, said 'the outlook for the economy over the remainder of this year and next is for steady growth accompanied by low inflation'. The Treasury said that the latest economic indicators provided 'clear evidence' that recovery 'is well under way'. It said growth in 1992 is likely to be 'a little stronger' than the 1.25 per cent forecast in the March Budget. Meanwhile revised official figures from the Central Statistical Office indicated that the recession of 1991 and 1992 had been slightly less deep than previously thought. The CBI survey of 1,520 manufacturers, carried out between July 27 and August 18, found a majority were still complaining that orders were below normal. But order books were at their best level since February 1990, before the recession. Some 35 per cent of companies said their order books were below normal compared with 17 per cent reporting above normal orders. The difference between the two figures, which indicates the trend, was a negative balance of 18 per cent compared with minus 28 in July and minus 52 in August last year. Details, Page 8</p>

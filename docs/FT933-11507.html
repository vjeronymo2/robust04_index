			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / People: Non-executive directors - Graham Consulting Sir Eric Parker, the former chief executive of Trafalgar House, is renewing his longstanding ties with the construction industry by taking on the chairmanship of Graham Consulting, a privately-owned firm of consulting engineers. Sir Eric, 60, who left Trafalgar House last month following a boardroom reshuffle, has spent most of his working life in the construction industry. He joined Trafalgar House in 1965 and, along with founder Sir Nigel Broackes, transformed the company from a stock market minnow into a major conglomerate with Pounds 4bn of sales. By contrast Graham Consulting, set up by Frank Graham in 1967, is a relatively small operation even by the standards of the consulting engineering business. It employs 650 staff and in the year to end March made operating profits of Pounds 718,000 on revenues of Pounds 22m. However, the company has carved out a niche for itself as the leading consulting engineers specialising in maintaining Britain's motorways. Traditionally, the job has been done by local government highway departments but starting in 1986 the Department of Transport started to privatise the business and Graham Consulting now oversees the maintenance of several large highway networks in West Yorkshire and London. Sir Eric becomes non-exec-utive chairman on September 1 and replaces the late Sir Roy Watts.</p>

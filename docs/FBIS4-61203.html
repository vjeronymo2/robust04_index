			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Ardayev in Alma-Ata [Almaty] and </F> Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov in Tashkent: "President Akayev  Reconciles Presidents Nazarbayev and Karimov"]    [Text] The presidents of Kazakhstan, Kirghizia  [Kyrgyzstan], and Uzbekistan spent last weekend [30 April-1 May]  at the resort city of Cholpon-Ata on Lake Issyk-Kul's north  shore.    The meeting was initiated by Askar Akayev, who, judging from  unofficial sources, acted as a kind of "peace refereee between  the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. After Nursultan  Nazarbayev came out with the idea of a Eurasian union in Moscow  it was abruptly rejected by Islam Karimov, specifically during a  news conference in Tashkent when Francois Mitterrand's visit was  going on here.    The Uzbek press severely criticized the neighboring state's  leader: Having returned from Kirghizia, why did he, without  consulting other participants in the trilateral treaty on a  single economic area, propose that the old USSR be revived?  Karimov observed, in particular, that on the shores of Lake  Issyk-Kul they had agreed henceforth to act in a coordinated  fashion before putting forward something within the CIS  framework. In short, relations between Tashkent and Alma-Ata,  which had cooled somewhat in recent weeks, were put right.    The three Central Asian republics' presidents signed a  communique saying that the three leaders had briefed each other  on the sociopolitical situation in their countries and discussed  a wide range of questions concerning the general situation in  the region and CIS as well as a number of international  problems. The main result of the talks which took place, the  joint communique notes, was that Kirghizia acceded to the treaty  on creating a single economic area which was previously  concluded between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The trilateral  treaty on a single economic area between Kazakhstan, Kirghizia,  and Uzbekistan completely conforms to the provisions of the  treaty on creating an economic union of CIS countries, and it is  open to all CIS states to join it. At the same time further  progress toward economic cooperation, the communique says,  requires a more active and constructive mechanism for  collaboration.    The three Central Asian countries' presidents discussed  specific measures to deal with the damage caused in Kirghizia  during the current spring landslides, floods, and other natural  disasters. Uzbekistan was the first to give the Kirghiz  humanitarian aid by sending food, medicines, and tents.    While the presidents are seeking new ways to cooperate and  to  deepen integration, the first days of May have found thousands  of people in Alma-Ata with cold gas stoves -- Uzbekistan has yet  again reminded Kazakhstan of its debt for the delivery of gas  and has stopped supplies. This is in the capital, while in  certain oblasts there has been no gas in homes for months.  Serious problems have occurred in Kazakhstan with fuels and  lubricants too -- at the moment in Alma-Ata fuel is being  supplied only to vehicles ensuring the city's security and vital  activities, the militia, the ambulance service, and other  special services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jacques Jacquet-Francillon editorial: "Not So Simple"] </F>   [Text] Everything is not quite as simple as it might have  appeared the other night in Brussels when, after Greek,  Canadian, and British reticence, among others, had been swept  aside, the firm French initiative gained U.S. approval, and for  a moment some people thought that merely an "ultimatum" imposed  by NATO was required to "save Sarajevo," at the same time  resolving the problem of squaring the Bosnian circle.  Unfortunately, things are not so simple.    The response by the Bosnian Serbs was not short in coming:  "Our artillery will not move one inch...." French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe undoubtedly has a ready reply on his lips,  in the form of the alexandrine: "The cannon of the Gascons  never retreat." However, NATO's fighter-bombers are no officers  of Gascony [region in southwest France]. They obey regulations  which are not as clear as one might have liked to think they  were on Wednesday evening in the Belgian capital.    In order to launch an air strike once the ultimatum deadline  has passed, in 10 days' time, or before, or even very soon if  necessary, if the Serbs use their mortars once again, one order  is needed from French UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander  General Cot, and another order must come from the operational  commander at NATO, U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda. However, both of  these orders must be approved by UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    All of this is possible. All of this has been provided for.  However, it remains the case that the UN secretary general only  derives his authority from the Security Council, and that one UN  resolution may quite evidently cancel out another.    The Russians lost no time. Just several hours after the  Brussels "ultimatum," they -- quite legitimately, in the light  of their permanent member status -- called an emergency meeting  of the Security Council, with the clear objective of saying that  they do not really see why NATO -- to which they do not belong  -- should have become the executive body, the armed wing, of the  United Nations. It is hardly likely that the Beijing government  of China, another permanent member of the Security Council,  which also has a right of veto, will oppose the arguments put  forward by Moscow.    At the same time, the Bosnian Serbs have already found  another answer. When Alain Juppe launched another appeal in  favor of a political settlement, once more asking the United  States to become more closely involved in French diplomatic  efforts, Mr. Radovan Karadzic laid down a precondition for any  continuation of negotiations in Geneva, namely that an  international inquiry be held to establish who had really been  responsible for the massacre that occurred at the central market  in Sarajevo. This constituted a roundabout way of pointing a  finger at the Bosnians.    Impudent though this may be, the tactic is not lacking in  astuteness. While Bill Clinton has suddenly managed to find  some virtue in the French position that he contested just a week  ago, this is only because his public opinion would not have  conceded that he remained indifferent to the unbearable images  broadcast all day long on television in households across the  United States.    Is nothing easier to do than turn around U.S. opinion?</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Hotels chief faces 16 fraud charges The former managing director of Resort Hotels, Mr Robert Feld, was charged yesterday with 16 offences after a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the company. The charges relate to financial information published about the hotel company's Pounds 20m rights issue in April 1992 and a preliminary announcement of its profits for 1991-92. Mr Feld, of Rottingdean, Sussex, was charged at Brighton magistrates court with three offences under the Financial Services Act and 13 offences under the Forgery Act. At the company's request the Stock Exchange suspended trading in Resort Hotels shares in July 1993. The company has since sold most of its business to Jarvis Hotels.</p>

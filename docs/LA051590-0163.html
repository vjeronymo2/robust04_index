			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: THREE OF THE GOOD GUYS: KING, CHUNG AND LEAR  </P> <P> CAN WE write an entire column about the good guys? Let's see.  </P> <P> It was very fine news to hear that Playboy is making that super-civilized  talker -- Larry King of USA Today, Mutual radio and CNN -- its interview for  August. Excerpts from the talk show King's fourth book, "Larry King: Tell Me  More," will be seen in the September issue of Penthouse, and the tome has been  accepted as an alternate for the Book of the Month.  </P> <P> Someone asked me this very week -- Why is Larry King so popular? Here are a few  reasons -- he is a truly nice human being, he listens, he is intelligent, he  has a brilliant sense of humor. He is kind, he is fair-minded, he is on top of  his life and gives us confidence that we might be that way as well.  </P> <P> SELDOM HAS my faith in a public person been so well placed as in Connie Chung.  It was great hearing of her recent Nielsen success when CBS moved her "Saturday  Night" show into the Monday spot for a special. Connie has one of the highest Q  ratings for popularity in all of TV.  </P> <P> In private life, she is funny, warm, amiable, offbeat, even zany. It is fun to  see this beautiful woman turn up at stuffy parties and spend most of the  evening holding hands with her husband, "A Current Affair's" Maury Povich. I  knew Connie's show was a winner the minute her producers dropped the  "re-creations" of news and decided to just let Connie be Connie. Her close-up,  intimate and simple approach is unbeatable. (Who could ever forget her  bombastic interview with Donald Trump, wherein she trounced him good naturedly  with remarks like, "Are you kidding?")  </P> <P> Later, I understand Trump said the reason Connie didn't "like" him was because  she was taking revenge on him for the failure of an early interview with Marlon  Brando. How's that again?  </P> <P> NORMAN LEAR is the genius who changed the face of television. ("All In the  Family" and its spinoffs, for example -- in these troubled times, a show so  frank, funny and daring might not even be able to get on the air.) Anyway, it  is fitting that Norman also founded People for the American Way. And now Norman  himself will be honored with that same group's First Amendment Award.  </P> <P> This column has often covered the PFAW benefits, at which such worthies as Bill  Moyers, Walter Cronkite, Barbara Jordan and Robert L. Bernstein have been  honored. These nights often make news; last year Cronkite surprised us with his  paean to liberalism. On Nov. 18, it will be Norman Lear's turn to accept rather  than present. And they're moving to New York's Waldorf for comfort and class.  </P></p>

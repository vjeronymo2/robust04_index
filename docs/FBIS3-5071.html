			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says the  Malaysian Government is disappointed over the British  Government's silence on the lies spread by the irresponsible  British media. The British Government also did not act well to  deny or give a true explanation on the claim by the  irresponsible media in that country that the Malaysian leaders  were corrupt. British newspapers frequently attack Datuk Sri  Dr. Mahathir and other Malaysian leaders of having received  pay-offs for approving privatized projects to British companies.    The prime minister however said that the Malaysian  Government  had no quarrel with the British Government and British companies  when it decided not to offer any new contracts to British  companies. He made the remarks when breaking the fast with UMNO  [United Malays National Organization] Youth leaders in Kuala  Lumpur last night.    In another development, the Health Ministry will no longer  import medicine produced in Britain under the cabinet's  directive to bar British firms from getting government-funded  contracts. This was stated by its minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai.  He said, however, existing contracts with British companies  would be honored. He said this after presenting a check for  100,000 ringgit to the nongovernment council on AIDS at its  office in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. [passage omitted]</p>

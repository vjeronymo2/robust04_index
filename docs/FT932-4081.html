			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Clough denies backhanders from transfer deals Mr Brian Clough, the former Nottingham Forest football club manager, yesterday denied allegations that he liked a 'bung' - a personal payment - when arranging soccer transfer deals. The claims were made in the High Court by Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar who is fighting chief executive Terry Venables for control of Spurs. The Spurs chairman said Mr Venables told him of Mr Clough's payment preference. Mr Clough, pictured outside his Derbyshire home, said: 'Not a penny was passed between Terry Venables and me.'

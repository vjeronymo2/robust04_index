			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> ANIMAL TEST BAN BILL BLASTED  </P> <P> University researchers opposed legislation that would outlaw certain animal  tests for product safety. "Animal zealots have flooded the Legislature, the  press and the public with an intimidating deluge of mail, propaganda and  information," Tom Hamm, director of animal research at Stanford University,  told a Capitol news conference.  </P> <P> "(But) in many instances, there are no adequate alternatives to animal testing  and research to allay human pain, suffering, disease and injury." AB 2461, a  measure by Assemblymen Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Norm Waters  (D-Plymouth), would make it a crime to use three tests now used to measure the  safety and toxicity of a wide range of household products. Hamm, joined by John  Lamb, a health educator at UC Davis Medical Center, said that of more than  1,000 Californians polled by the Public Policy Research Group of Dallas, 74%  would oppose the legislation.  </P></p>

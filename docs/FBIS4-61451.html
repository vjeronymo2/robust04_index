			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Popovkin, chief of the department dealing </F> with shaping socioeconomic strategy: "Ukrainian Economy: Are  All Resources Exhausted"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] During the first quarter of  1994, in comparison with the same period last year, the national  income was reduced by 36 percent, the industrial output by more  than 38 percent (machine building industry by 47 percent;  chemical industry by 45 percent; light industry by 100 percent:  ready made garments by 60 percent, and shoes by 66 percent).    The general production of consumer goods fell by some 40  percent, while nonfoodstuff goods by 45 percent.    Production of essential products of the black metallurgy  shrunk by 30-70 percent. Let us not forget that over 1993 it  fell by 20-40 percent. We can see how the entire sector --  producing essential products for the machine building industry  -- that is the basis for the technological progress is dying.  The development of transport is unthinkable without metal  products.    Cuts in production in the fuel-energetic sector is  continuing. Coal extraction fell by 16 percent, production in  the oil processing industry -- by 45-60 percent. The production  of electrical energy decreased by 17 percent.    In our opinion, skyrocketing prices were and continue to be  the key reason for this critical situation. They limit the  demand and opportunities of trading in products. Despite the  catastrophic reduction in production, the warehouses and trading  facilities continue to amass huge amounts of unsold products.  For example, this especially concerns the production of  furniture and tiles, 70 percent of which are not in demand.  Given the reduction in the volume of crediting within the  framework of the governmental antiinflation program, mutual  debts of enterprises considerably increased. Only over  January-February 1994, the general volume of debts between  enterprises and organizations of Ukraine increased by one third  and exceeded 300 trillion karbovanetses. The mutual nonpayments  of debts increased by 2.6 times. A specific proportion of loss  making enterprises increased from 16 to 24 percent.    Despite the stable prices on imported energy resources, the  increase in wholesale prices in industry (by 54 percent since  the beginning of the year ), prices for construction and  installation work (in 2.3 times by the fourth quarter of 1993),  and retail prices is continuing. The emission of money is in  full swing.    The crisis in the investment sector is deepening. The  production of the most important types of building materials  fell to 40-70 percent, capital investments and costs of  construction and installation work was reduced by 37-38 percent,  and the volume of contractor work -- by almost a half.    The Ukrainian transportation system is experiencing a total  crisis. Due to a reduction in production and extremely high  transportation tariffs, cargo shipments by vehicles was reduced  by 55 percent and by railroads -- by 65 percent.    In comparison with the first quarter of 1993, the volume of  retail turnover fell almost twice. Figures representing cuts in  average wages in the state sector of the national economy look  extremely absurd. Notably, the highest wage was registered in  the banking and social insurance sector -- it exceeded the  average wage three times and was 3.2-times higher than the wage  of a researcher. People, who produce material and spiritual  values, have been totally excluded from priority compensations.  Motives for conscientious work have been wrecked. However,  very soon we will not have anything that could be redistributed.    The situation demands the adoption of extraordinary  measures,  first and foremost, regarding a decrease in prices to liberalize  the consumers' demand, the lessening of the role of the state in  the regulation of prices for essential goods to raise work  motivation, correct and stabilize the national currency rate,  and liberalize the taxation policy.    Apparently, the government is convinced that both the  national resources and people's patience are inexhaustible.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Canada rides high on economic optimism  -Stocks have set new records A lunch-hour visit to the offices of Green Line Investor Services, Canada's biggest discount brokerage, in one of downtown Toronto's vast underground shopping malls reveals a queue of investors lining up near the entrance for a peek at the share quotation machine. Off to one side, another group waits to open trading accounts and place orders. Business has never been better for Green Line. It is opening twice as many accounts as at this time last year, and in recent weeks trading volumes have set new records. Bulls would argue that the explosion of interest among small investors augurs well for equities: money is pouring into the market, especially through mutual funds and new stock issues. Green Line reports that the ratio of buy to sell orders has climbed to 1.3 to 1 this month, from 1.1 to 1 in October. 'The best place is still Canadian stocks,' says Ms Jill Parrett, executive vice-president at CIBC Investment Management, which runs a stable of mutual funds for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Ms Parrett forecasts that the TSE-300 composite index, which closed at 4,220.61 yesterday, could rise to 4,500 by late 1994, producing returns well above those likely on fixed-income securities. Richardson Greenshields, a Toronto-based securities firm, is even more optimistic, predicting that the index could reach 4,800 next year. But could the stampede by small investors also be a sign that the smart money is sitting on the sidelines for the time being? Mr Neil Johnson, portfolio strategist at Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto, for instance, expects a significant correction in share prices over the next 6-8 months. Pension and mutual fund managers report that they are having to search much harder for attractive investments. In the absence of bargains, many funds have raised the cash portion of their holdings in recent months. It took almost six years for the TSE-300 to regain its August 1987 peak of 4,112. But since last summer the market has roared from one record to another. The latest high was 4,303, reached on November 12, representing a 28 per cent climb since the start of 1993. The case for another surge is based largely on optimism about Canada's economic prospects and commodity prices. The economic growth rate is expected to accelerate to over 3 per cent next year. While the TSE's advance has so far centred on gold, energy and other export sectors, stronger domestic growth could also propel the shares of consumer-oriented companies. Third-quarter earnings have buoyed investors' spirits. Banks have reported that their portfolios of non-performing loans are starting to shrink. Bombardier, the Montreal-based transport equipment maker, boosted third-quarter income by almost a third. PWA, the financially-stretched parent of Canadian Airlines International, enjoyed its best operating performance in six years. Furthermore, low interest rates - the yield on 3-month treasury bills is presently heading down towards 4 per cent - have sparked interest in real estate stocks. The optimists are also looking to a recovery in 1994 of long depressed commodity markets, such as nickel, zinc, newsprint and pulp, as a combination of production cutbacks and rising demand takes effect. Natural gas producers, which have already benefited from a steep climb in prices over the past 18 months, remain a long-term favourite among fund managers. But the voices of caution can marshall an equally impressive array of arguments. They point out that the TSE has enjoyed a virtually uninterrupted climb for the past three years. 'The Canadian market is giving everyone a bit of vertigo,' said one mutual fund manager earlier this month as the TSE-300 broke through another record. In spite of the pullback in recent weeks, shares of companies included in the TSE-300 are trading at an average p/e of about 25, on higher than projected 1993 earnings, compared to an average p/e ratio of less than 20 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Although the economy is improving, a succession of prominent companies have surprised the market with hefty restructuring charges. They include Royal Bank of Canada (the country's biggest financial institution), Laidlaw (waste management and transport services), Northern Telecom (telecommunications) and Inco (nickel mining). Most unsettling is the recent tone in the US Treasury bond market: any rise in US interest rates is likely to pull down Canadian bond prices, as well as the TSE. But even Nesbitt Thomson's Mr Johnson predicts that the setback, if it materialises, will interrupt, rather than abort, the bull market. He says that the combination of a long period of steady economic growth and low inflation, followed by rising commodity prices in 1995, could kindle a new fire under stocks. The resource-based TSE normally outperforms US stock markets only towards the end of a business upswing, as raw material shortages come to the fore. With this in mind, the investors lining up at the Green Line offices might fare better if they wait a few more months before jumping into the market.</p>

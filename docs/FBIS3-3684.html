Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,  and Sulayman al-Sulayyim, visiting minister of commerce of Saudi  Arabia, addressed the meeting. Both expressed the hope that the  bilateral economic and trade ties would be further expanded.    Wu noted that the Chinese Government attaches great  importance to its relations with Saudi Arabia.    The two economies are highly complementary and the ties  between them have seen marked development since the two  countries set up diplomatic relations in 1990, Wu said.    According to Chinese customs statistics, the bilateral trade  reached 690 million U.S. dollars-worth in 1993.    Wu expressed the conviction that the Saudi Arabian  minister's  visit and the conference would enhance the mutual understanding  between the two governments and business people, and help  promote bilateral economic and trade cooperation.    Saudi Arabian businessmen are welcome to invest in China in  any form, she said.    Al-Sulayyim noted that the Saudi Arabian Government and  businesses are highly interested in developing economic and  trade ties with China.    Later, Wu and al-Sulayyim had a working meeting.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the estimate of need should not be based on numbers of seals. Rather, it should be based on the quantity of meat that is required for subsistence needs. The commenter provided data indicating that, by its calculations, approximately 450&hyph;570 fewer seals could have been harvested on St. Paul Island in 1993 had the harvest estimates been based on the amount of meat required by residents of St. Paul, rather than based on a number of seals required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter's estimate of the number of seals that need not have been killed in 1993 (450&hyph;570) was based on an average maximum percent-use value of 60 percent. This value was a result of a 1987 study in which 83 seals were weighed before and after virtually all consumable parts (including many parts that are only marginally edible, such as connective tissues, etc.) had been removed (i.e., everything was taken except for the pelt, blubber, skull, neck, inedible internal organs, and body fluids). This butchering technique is referred to as a whole cut, and a mean 53.3 percent of each animal (maximum approximately 60 percent) was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 1987 harvest, 101 carcasses were also weighed before and after butchering had removed only the front flippers, shoulders, breasts, hearts and livers (referred to as the butterfly cut), the parts historically eaten. A mean 29.1 percent of each animal was dressed out under these circumstances (53 FR 17773, May 18, 1988). Thus, it was determined that the range of percent-use values between animals that have been butchered to remove only selected parts, and animals that have been butchered to remove virtually all consumable parts (including many parts only marginally edible), lies between 29.1 and 53.3 percent of the initial carcass weight. Whether the harvest is being conducted in a wasteful versus non-wasteful manner focuses on whether or not the butterfly cut method of butchering is interpreted as a wasteful manner as defined in the regulations. NMFS determined, based on a 1992 study, that the butterfly cut does not represent a wasteful manner of taking (discussed in greater detail at 58 FR 42027, August 6, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the 1992 harvest, NMFS weighed the whole carcass, as well as the weight of each major body part (breast, shoulder, arm, ribs, backbone, and hindquarter as well as heart, liver, front flippers, rear flippers, head, guts and pelt), to determine the proportion of edible meat that was available from the different parts of the body for each of six fur seals. In summary, the mean weight of the parts taken in a whole cut totaled 54.9 percent of the beginning weight of the seals, and the mean weight for the parts constituting a butterfly cut was 32.5 percent, indicating a mean percent-use difference of approximately 22 percent. However, using mean values from the 1992 study, the total amount of edible meat (excluding bone, minimally edible connective tissue, and inedible tissue) available from a whole cut seal was 29.6 percent (range 26.8&hyph;31.6) of the beginning weight of the animal compared to 21.1 percent (range 18.9&hyph;23.4) taken from a butterfly cut seal. Therefore, the average difference in the amount of edible meat between the two butchering techniques is approximately 8&hyph;9 percent of the original body weight of the animal, not the 22 percent difference that has been widely used to characterize the two different techniques, and that was used in the commenters calculations. As NMFS explained in the 1993 document of final subsistence estimates, while a whole cut does result in more meat being made available for subsistence use than does the butterfly cut, both cuts result in a substantial portion of the edible parts of the seal being used for subsistence, and the real difference in edible meat being made available to the user has been greatly exaggerated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter cautioned that NMFS must guard against economic incentives that might lead to higher harvest levels. The commenter continued to state that NMFS should retrieve all seal penis bones or bacula to assure that potential trade in these items will not result in excessive seal killing. The commenter did not feel that this was either unreasonable or burdensome on the part of NMFS. Moreover, some Pribilof residents have suggested this approach as a means to reassure concerned parties that the commercial value of seal bacula is not an incentive for harvesting fur seals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS' position is that the subsistence harvest and the estimates of subsistence needs must not be based upon commercial interests. There is no indication that the harvest is being driven by commercial interests; however, NMFS will continue to monitor the disposal of carcasses, and the removal of bacula from animals taken in the harvest, to ensure that commercial interests are not factors in the subsistence harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the subsistence harvest methods used by the Aleut sealers do not need to be monitored or regulated to ensure compliance with NMFS' standards for substantial use of seal carcasses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations governing the subsistence harvest of fur seals require that NMFS' representatives monitor the harvest and collect information on the number of seals taken and the extent of utilization of the fur seals taken (51 FR 24832, July 9, 1986). NMFS believes that alternatives to the present fur seal management regime should be considered and discussed during the development of a cooperation management program under section 119 of the MMPA. The commenters' concerns will be considered further in these discussions and in any future rulemaking to revise these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Tracking Virgin's vapour trail: Richard Branson is selling parts of his empire. Bronwen Maddox examines this strategy After several years of turning down offers for Virgin Music Group, Mr Richard Branson is on the verge of selling a majority stake in the record label, the largest and most profitable part of his empire. At the same time he wants to sell stakes in other companies - prompting Virgin watchers to ask whether the UK's second-largest private group is strapped for cash. The music industry expects that the Virgin Music Group deal will value the record label at more than Pounds 570m. Mr Branson also hopes to raise Pounds 55m from the sale of a 20 per cent stake in his airline, Virgin Atlantic Airways; and he is seeking a 20 per cent partner for his continental European record stores, known as Megastores. His communications companies have just sold their largest profit-earner, the computer games company, Mastertronic, for Dollars 60m (Pounds 34m). Mr Branson's rivals, as well as those who see him as a rare British entrepreneur, are intrigued. Do his airline and record shops need cash urgently? If not, why is he selling? And what will he do with the money? Of the four separate Virgin enterprises - music, retail Megastores, airlines and holidays, and communications - the airline raises the most pressing questions about financial stability. It is operating in the worst airline recession for decades, and is involved in a bitter commercial and publicity war with British Airways. It has also borne the heavy start-up costs of flying from Heathrow airport since July. Created in Mr Branson's image - young, cheerful - Virgin Atlantic started flying to New York from Gatwick in 1984. Its executives feel it came of age last year after winning access to the Heathrow slots. 'People think you need a lot of money to run an airline but it isn't true,' Mr Branson said. The airline's latest results, for the year to July 1991, show it has been hit hard by the recession, and that without more cash it will not be able to expand. But they also establish that the airline's debt did not soar last year, contrary to the expectations of competitors. Voyager Travel Holdings, the holding company for Virgin Atlantic Airways, and its linked tour operator, Virgin Holidays, made an Pounds 800,000 pre-tax profit in the year to July 1991 compared with Pounds 8.5m for the corresponding period of the year before. Its executives described this as a 'considerable relief', as the Gulf war had pushed up fuel prices and the Heathrow start-up had meant acquiring aircraft and more staff. The figures indicate Virgin Atlantic made a Pounds 3m loss, offset by a Pounds 3.3m profit at the tour operator. Despite this squeeze on profits, Mr Branson stuck to his philosophy of low fares and 'add-on' incentives, such as a free economy ticket with a business ticket. He credits his success with business travellers - who now account for 36 per cent of its revenues - to this philosophy. Voyager points out that it scraped into profit with only eight aircraft, while British Airways, with more than 200 aircraft, made a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 10m in the 12 months to June 1991. However, BA's loss contains Pounds 120m of exceptional costs and the airline rebounded with pre-tax profits of Pounds 285m for the last nine months of 1991. But the pressures on Voyager are clear. Its interest bill of Pounds 1.3m was only just covered by operating profits of Pounds 2.1m. The decline in airline profits cut operating cashflow to Pounds 1m from Pounds 29m. It was still able to spend Pounds 27m on new equipment, only slightly less than the previous year, but that was partly financed by selling an aircraft for Pounds 27m. Even so, net debt at July 1991 was up by Pounds 9m during the year to Pounds 39m. Virgin executives see last year as a short-lived trough. They are projecting Pounds 4m pre-tax profits in the year to October and Pounds 29m the following year as conditions improve and start-up costs are left behind. Now they want to apply for routes to Johannesburg, and perhaps San Francisco and Washington DC. They insist that Virgin will always be a 'point-to-point' service and that the airline is not trying to build the expensive 'hub and spoke' networks of the world's largest airlines. But the expansion will take more money. 'If we stick with the routes we have now, we're fine - we don't need more cash. But it's an exceptionally good point to buy aircraft cheaply while the market is depressed,' according to Mr Trevor Abbott, group managing director of the airline and retail companies. Some industry observers are sceptical about Virgin's expansion plans. They argue that the company's existing services already tap into the world's busiest routes and that profits from those routes will come under increasing pressure. By moving into Heathrow, Virgin has taken on US carriers such as American Airlines and United, which were also granted rights to fly to the airport for the first time last year. These giant carriers are expected to launch a second marketing onslaught on transatlantic routes this summer, putting pressure on yields. Despite such reservations, it seems likely that the airline can avoid serious financial difficulties, provided that Voyager manages to attract a 20 per cent investor. Virgin's Megastores also have heavy investment plans but these pose less risk and the shops probably offer less potential than the airline. The Megastores, while accounting for a fifth of all the Virgin companies' Pounds 1bn turnover last year, made a small pre-tax loss. The earnings from the UK and Japanese stores are offset at the moment by the development costs of the continental European stores. Looking at the investment plans in the airline and Megastores, one of Virgin's former City advisers points to Mr Branson's policy of joint ventures as a sign of his financial prudence. In 1988, Mr Branson sold 25 per cent of Virgin Music Group to Japanese conglomerate Fujisankei, for Dollars 150m; this year he has agreed a 50:50 venture in the UK shops with retailer W H Smith. 'He doesn't seem to have the hang-ups some tycoons have - insisting on total ownership - in fact he's shown a real knack for using other people's money to do what he wants,' said the former adviser. Even so, it will take years to see whether the investment in airlines and Megastores will match the striking success of Virgin Music Group, or whether, five years from now, they will seem an expensive hobby. Virgin Music Group still dwarfs its younger sister companies, with turnover last year of Pounds 350m and estimated pre-tax profits of some Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m. Selling a majority stake will mark a turning point in the Branson companies and, on a more personal note, in Richard Branson's life. Mr Branson said: 'It just seemed the right point not to keep shutting the door on these offers.' According to Mr Abbott, the willingness to consider selling the group also marked Mr Branson's new confidence that he had built other businesses - the airline and Megastores - to replace it, and that they were here to stay. Clearly the sale is a wrench, and his preferred deal would be one that allowed him to keep a small stake, Mr Branson said. But his colleagues pointed out that he had not been closely involved in the music group for years. One, who asked not to be named, said: 'Richard may have got to that age where he thinks there's more to life than music. Please don't say he's grown up - he's just changed.' How will Virgin spend the cash? The record industry's giants, including Thorn EMI, the UK leisure conglomerate, and Bertelsmann, the German media group, have pushed the bidding higher since serious negotiations started this year, and Mr Branson could realise up to Pounds 428m on the sale. The group's broadcasting ambitions seem unlikely to swallow much of this new cash - Virgin failed to win any of the new ITV licences when they were auctioned last year, although this did not deter it from applying for the second national radio franchise. But the word that gets Mr Branson excited is railways. He has made no secret of his dream of running a high-quality train service, aimed at the business market, on British Rail's longest routes. Or Virgin could simply sit back and enjoy having cash in the bank. Mr Abbott said: 'It could be really rather a lot of money, couldn't it? And we're not short of ideas, you know.'  ---------------------------------------------------------- THE BRANSON EMPIRE  ---------------------------------------------------------- VIRGIN MUSIC GROUP  ---------------------------------------------------------- Recording (80% of turnover) Music publishing (18%) Studios (2%) Turnover: c.

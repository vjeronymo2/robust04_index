			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Civilian Fascism is </F> Further Intensifying"]    [Text] The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique revealed its  criminal attempt to further intensify the suppression of the  labor movement in the beginning of the new year.    According to reports, the puppet Labor Ministry set labor-  management stability as the prime goal for this year's labor  policy and growled that it would take stern legal measures on  illegal labor disputes, and invoke the right for emergency  mediation on strikes in key industries even if they are legal.    It also said that it would use the full extent of the law in  force concerning the ban on the intervention of a third party to  prevent the intervention of outside forces. This shows that the  fascist clique's suppression maneuvers to the workers' just  demand and struggle will be further intensified. It is not a  coincidence that South Korea's main radio station reported that  government measures on labor-management dispute were expected to  become harder.    As in any society, those who create material wealth are  workers, and therefore, those who enjoy the wealth should also  be the workers. However, South Korean workers are driven to  long hours of hard labor in adverse conditions where there is no  basic protection facilities for workers. They are only targets  for exploitation and suppression. It is inevitable for them to  struggle for their right for existence and democracy.    Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique brands their  just struggle illegal and intends to brutally suppress them.  The one who pretended to support the workers' struggle during  his days with the opposition party, is betraying the workers and  suppressing them now that the sword is in his hands. Traitor  Kim Yong-sam, who said in the commitment of his election  campaign that he would make a society where workers are honored,  once advertised as if he would do something for workers putting  out the signboards of civilian government after he seized power.  However, his nature is not the one that can side with working  people.    Suppression of people is a way to survive for the puppet  clique. That the puppet clique intensified suppression of the  people in the very beginning of the new year by throwing away  the nominal labor- management data which it once showed around,  and invoking the emergency mediation right that even the  preceding military dictator regimes, which were notorious for  suppression, could not have dared to attempt to use, proves that  it has undisguisedly drawn the sword of suppression completely  casting off its civilian skin.    Could there be any fascist more brutal than this? The Kim  Yong- sam traitor clique is a rare fascist tyrant more brutal  than its predecessors.    The reason that Kim Yong-sam's clique ran amuck to brutal  suppression in the beginning of the new year is not elsewhere.  As it has been exposed, during his junket to the United States  in November last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam promised to open the  South Korean rice market to his master backing down on his  commitment that he would keep the rice market with his  presidential post. Subsequently, he formally accepted the demand  to open the rice market in the Uruguay Round negotiations.    It is not simply to ruin the South Korean agriculture and  drive the six million farmers to death. As described by the  South Korean publications that the Uruguay Round storm was  coming, South Korea has no choice but to open not only the  agricultural products market but also the South Korean economy's  overall market including clothes and industrial products.    Therefore, this year in South Korea, it is inevitable for  not  only farmers but also many people from all walks of life to come  out to an antigovernment struggle against Kim Yong-sam clique's  treachery and traitorous acts.    Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's uncovering of its suppression  attempt from the beginning of this year is a precaution for fear  of the people's struggle that is expected to explode like a  volcano in the future.    However, it is merely the last rave of those who have no  future. The more brutal the suppression, the stronger will be  the people's struggle against it. South Korean people will  never cease before the end of the struggle against the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique that sold out the dignity and interest of  the nation and country to a foreign force for its own comfort  and good and ran amok to fascist suppression.    The day the people's fascist will stand on his trial by the  people and be thrown to history's night soil bin is not far away.</p>

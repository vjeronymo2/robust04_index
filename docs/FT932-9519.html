			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff improves 28% to Pounds 4.5m PITTENCRIEFF, the natural resources and communications company embroiled in a hostile bid for USM concern Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.5m for the year to December 31. Sales were 83 per cent ahead at Pounds 18.7m. Mr Terry Heneaghan, the chief executive who warned last week that annual profits would not meet analysts' expectations of Pounds 5.5m, said the lower than expected return was entirely due to difficulties in integrating the 13 communications businesses acquired for Dollars 23m (Pounds 15m) last year. 'We had a bit of indigestion trying to take on those 13 acquisitions,' he said. However, the problems had been tackled and the group was currently making savings of more than Dollars 100,000 a month from measures implemented since the year-end. The communications division, which will be floated in the US this summer, saw a rise in monthly revenues from Dollars 1m to Dollars 2m. Oil and gas production rose by 9 per cent in 1992. Mr Heneaghan said the group expected to spend Dollars 2.8m this year on capital expenditure in this division. Net debt rose from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 11.7m. Mr Heneaghan said the group had more than adequate banking facilities to finance its offer for Aberdeen, which includes a cash alternative valuing the target at Pounds 8.7m. The final dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4p, for a total of 7p (6p). Earnings per share fell 5 per cent to 15.63p.</p>

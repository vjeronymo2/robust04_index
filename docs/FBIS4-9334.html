			<p>BFN     [Text] British Prime Minister John Major has sent a letter  to Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which, among other things, he refers to  the current aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina.    I am horrified by the brutality of the Bosnian Serb  offensive  on Gorazde. The basic task now must be a cease-fire not only in  Gorazde, but throughout Bosnia. To this end Great Britain is  actively taking part in the discussions in NATO and in all  organizations in which a solution to this is being sought. A  cease-fire by itself is not sufficient. A cease-fire must be  followed by an agreement on a final solution that will require  important territorial concessions by the Bosnian Serbs. The  tragic events of the past few days stress the urgent need for  the renewal of the peace process, the letter from Britain's  Prime Minister John Major to President Izetbegovic says.</p>

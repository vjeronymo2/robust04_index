They have accused the Moldovan president of treachery and  duplicity, the president's Press Secretary Vasile Grosavu told  INTERFAX.    He said that the opposition had also accused the president  of  making public the conflict in Moldova's eastern regions in the  summer of 1992. Meanwhile, it was Snegur who invited CSCE  experts to get acquainted with the situation and help settle the  conflict between Transdniestria and the central authorities, he  noted.    Moreover, Snegur favors further quadripartite talks between  Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Tiraspol, said Grosavu.    The press secretary also denied media reports laying the  blame for the current economic crisis in Moldova on Mircea  Snegur.    Grosavu said that the president's support for the idea of  dissolving the parliament and holding early parliamentary  elections was motivated by his plans to lead the country out of  the economic crisis as soon as possible.    Moldovan Prosecutor General Dumitru Postovan has denied  reports that Snegur was involved in the "dirty deals" linked  with the notorious Seabeco company.</p>

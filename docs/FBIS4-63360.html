			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Palaria] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe who is on a  visit in Moscow, discussed the situation in "flash points" in  the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Speaking of the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation, Grachev  said that the conflict has a trend for expanding, which affects  Russia's security as well as its vitally important interests in  the region.    The defence minister stressed that Russia has been  constantly  playing a mediator's role aimed at settling the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict politically but, regrettably, it  does this mission single-handed.    Neither international peace-making organisation nor members  of the Commonwealth of Independent States take an active part in  its settlement.    Grachev also said that 2,500-3,000 blue helmets will be  dispatched to the region in compliance with the agreement on  ceasefire and disengagement of forces in Abkhazia, signed in  Moscow on May 14.    They will be stationed along the Inguri River on the  Abkhazian side as well as in the Galskiy district and the  Kodorskoye Gorge.    As for the Armenian-Azeri conflict, Grachev informed Juppe  of  the drafted plan for a Karabakh settlement which was signed by  Russia, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow on May 17.    Azeri Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mammadov was recalled to  Baku on the same day all of a sudden. According to Grachev,  this was evidently prompted by the aggravation of the situation  at the republican parliament.    At the same time, he did not preclude a chance that this was  done for political purposes in order to win time and to invite  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to  participate in a peace mission and to settle the Karabakh  conflict under its aegis.    If the plan for settling the conflict was signed, Grachev  noted, Russia would dispatch a peace-keeping force to the region  on May 24. According to the minister, the Azeri defence minister  is already in Moscow for the second day.    In Grachev's opinion, the essence of his arrival is to sign  the plan for ceasefire and disengagement of the sides in the  zone of the Armenian-Azeri confrontation by June 1 after some  allegedly domestic issues are settled by President Geydar Aliyev.    Grachev stressed that Russia would not step back on the plan  in any way. "The plan is very good. It can really bring  peace," the minister noted.</p>

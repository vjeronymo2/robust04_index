			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: Sevens brings home the cash - Rugby Union NED HAIG and David Sanderson are the two Scotsmen credited with inventing seven-a-side rugby late in the last century - the first tournament was held at Melrose in 1883. I wonder what their reaction would be to the World Cup Sevens tournament which began at Murrayfield, Edinburgh, yesterday morning and finishes tomorrow afternoon? Perhaps it is better not to ask. On the other hand, the Scots themselves have given it an emphatic vote of approval. Tickets worth more than Pounds 1m have been sold and many more would have been sold if the rebuilding of the west stand been finished. As it is, ground capacity is limited to 37,500. The Sevens are brought to you by the same people who ran the full-scale World Cup in Britain in 1991 - Rugby World Cup Ltd. ITV is transmitting several hours each day. The sponsors are similar: Famous Grouse, Mizuno, Bass Breweries and South African Airways. In subsidiary roles are Unisys; Gilbert, the ball manufacturer; Umbro, the equipment maker; Medisport, the supplier of medical equipment, and Citroen. The World Cup Sevens is an ambitious title for an event that might in time become as all-embracing as its name suggests but is little more at present than an upstart cousin to the real sevens tournament the Hong Kong Sevens, which was staged recently. The World Cup Sevens to that event is as margarine is to butter. There will be similarities, one of the most likely is that southern hemisphere countries will dominate at Murrayfield as they did in Hong Kong where the semi-finalists were Fiji, Australia, Western Samoa and New Zealand. Fiji, in particular, concentrate on sevens these days, perhaps to the detriment of their performance at the 15-a-side game. They have competed in 25 events already this year and, in Waisale Serevi, they have the outstanding sevens player in the world. Watch for him. He has a most distinctive style: one minute he is lurking at the back of his team, some way from the ball; the next, he will be running in for a try. The Australians are making a big effort to win at Murrayfield, the undoubted incentive being the chance of adding the sevens to their World Cup title. Their team is built around David Campese (who is even more devastating at sevens than at 15-a side), Michael Lynagh and the huge, strong and fast forward Willie Ofahengaue. Sevens is a lot more than half as enjoyable and half as good as the fuller version. At its best, it can be sublime: seven men weaving intricate patterns on a full-size pitch until one or two of them, by deft handling and quick interplay, work a man clear. Then, watch him go  - sometimes, from 60 or 70 yards. I grew up watching Ian Laughland mastermind London Scottish to victory in the Middlesex Sevens in the 1960s, and then Gerald Davies dazzle his opponents with speed and footwork when he helped London Welsh dominate this event 10 years later. Those days are gone, along with pounds, shillings and pence and the three point and four-point try. No longer are speed and guile the two most important characteristics in sevens. A substantial physical presence is just as important. The Fijians and Samoans have brought a physical edge to sevens that has turned it from a sort of high-speed touch rugby to a high-speed, highly-physical game. The final in the recent Hong Kong tournament was described by Dick Best, the England coach, as one of the most brutal games he had ever seen. Each player needs to be fast, most should be robust, and one or two in each team must be play-makers. These are the characteristics needed to cope with someone like Fiji's Mesaka Rasari who is 6ft 5in, more than 17 stone - and a sprinter. While the World Cup Sevens provides a feast of rugby, it is an organisational nightmare: 24 teams - including many hardly known for their rugby such as Latvia, the Netherlands, Korea and Spain - compete in four pools of six. Minutes are vital. The semi-finals tomorrow start at 15.32 and 15.49 and the final iself at 17.16. Blink and you miss a match. Weather permitting, the tournament will demonstrate the attraction of sevens rugby. But there are doubts it will catch on in Europe as it has in the southern hemisphere. Weather, fixtures, and the strength of the 15-a-side game are all against the growth of the shortened game. So, you had better make the most of it while you can.</p>

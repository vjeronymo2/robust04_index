			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts tumble on fears over UK government borrowing BUDGET and political worries dealt a sharp blow to the UK government bond market, with gilt prices tumbling by as much as one percentage point during the day. The market fell back on speculation that the March 10 Budget may contain tax cuts and lead to higher borrowing by the government over the next couple of years, according to traders. While a cut in income tax could be seen as increasing the chances of the Conservative party winning a general election and therefore could be interpreted as positive for the gilt market, traders pointed out that instead the market appears to be focusing on the funding implications. 'Already we are expecting a public sector borrowing requirement of at least Pounds 23bn in 1992-93, so a tax giveaway in the Budget does not look good for the market,' said one dealer. Yesterday's drop in the gilt market was futures-driven. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 97.26, breached the important support level of 97.08, which in turn encouraged further selling of futures. The contract traded at 96.21 by late afternoon. Futures volumes were heavy at about 49,000 contracts, well above the average level of 19,000. In the cash market, long-dated issues dropped heavily with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 falling from 116.00 to 114 7/8 . Short-dated issues were not as badly hit, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 slipping from 101.00 to 100 29/32 . US TREASURY markets bounced back from early weakness yesterday, aided by weak auto sales and sporadic short-covering. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  3/32 at 101 1/16 , yielding 7.90 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, down 1/32 at 99 13/16 , yielding 5.459 per cent. Although the market held its ground for the early hours of trading, the cumulative effect of recent data suggesting the economy was pulling out of recession - in particular Tuesday's leading indicators and new home sales figures - eventually took its toll. By midday, the long-bond was more than half a point lower. Retail investors were again sidelined, unwilling to return until tomorrow's important employment report for February. It was the professional dealers who turned prices around. Against the background of poor 10-day car sales figures, speculative traders moved to cover short positions, lifting prices across the board. GERMAN government bonds drifted lower, taking their lead from the US and UK markets. Traders said there was some dismay at the Bundesbank's decision to drain DM2.5bn from rities repurchase tender. Dealers had expected the Bundesbank to replace fully two securities repurchase pacts worth DM44.5bn which expired yesterday, but the central bank allocated only DM42bn. Technical factors also pushed the market slightly lower, according to traders, as the March futures contracts were rolled over into the June contract, which has now taken over as the main contract. The June bund futures contract opened at 88.83 and slipped back to 88.56 by late afternoon on a volume of 44,000. YEN weakness against the US dollar continued to weigh on the Japanese government bond market yesterday. The dollar ended at Y131.50, despite intervention by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange markets, up from Y131.03 in New York late Tuesday and Y129.94 in Tokyo on Tuesday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond moved in a range of 5.435 to 5.475 per cent, but it closed almost unchanged on the day at 5.45 per cent.</p>

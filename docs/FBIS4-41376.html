			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 24 June [date as received] -- More than 77  percent of the electorate took part in the presidential  elections in the Republic of Belarus. Announcing the first  preliminary information to a BELINFORM correspondent, the  Republic's central electoral commission made one thing clear:  One can conclude from the data coming in that none of the  candidates has secured the necessary number of votes.    At present, one can only talk of an indicated preference for  two candidates: About 30-32 percent voted for Aleksandr  Lukashenko, and 24-26 percent voted for Vyacheslav Kebich. The  remaining four candidates lag significantly behind, and the  order of preference for them is: Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav  Shushkevich, Vasiliy Novikov, and Aleksandr Dubko.    The highest voter activity was recorded in Brest oblast,  where over 83 percent of the eligible citizens went to the  polling stations. The most passive people were in Minsk, where  the figure was 69.3 percent.    The central electoral commission expects to give the  preliminary results at about 0700 [0300 GMT] in the morning,  Moscow time.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Mid 250 driven to new peak The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering medium-sized companies on the London stock market, was driven to a new peak yesterday by heavy options-related buying, estimated at up to Pounds 1bn. The sight of the Mid 250 leaping forward 135.5 to 4,148.8 helped drive the FT-SE 100 Index of the UK's most highly valued companies to a new closing peak of 3,475.1, up 38.1 points. Senior traders said UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, had been buying Mid 250 stocks ferociously since the end of last week, ahead of the issue of a large covered warrant on the index. A warrant is a derivative instrument which allows investors to exercise an option to buy the underlying shares at the price on the day of purchase. Dealers believed that word of the strategy leaked into the London market yesterday morning, prompting rival dealers to mark up share prices, and triggering a rush of buying by UBS in the afternoon as it sought to complete its order. The head trader at a leading UK securities house commented: 'It's been an opportunity to lose a fortune - you couldn't buy anything for love nor money. This is the latest in a chain of events pointing to the increasing importance of derivatives and other instruments.' UBS was said to have been keen to carry out the deal ahead of the February 4 launch of OMLX, a London-based equity derivatives exchange which plans to deal in Mid 250 contracts. SG Warburg Securities and NatWest Securities were also said to have been active.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Gardening: Cyclamen need friends, too - Trawling the Mediterranean world for attractive varieties THE ROYAL Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, will today host an open day for cyclamen. Starting at 11.30, visitors will have a chance to see many of the best wild forms in full flower or leaf. You can buy young plants and also join the Cyclamen Society (otherwise based at Tile Barn House, Iden Green, Benenden, Kent.) Cyclamen need friends, not just because the many wild forms are such wonderful plants outdoors and in pots. In the wild, they are also being stripped and collected ruthlessly. The numbers of cyclamen being pulled up for the trade has risen vertically in the wake of new botanical discoveries. It might seem incredible, but new species are continuing to be found in areas travelled as widely as western and southern Turkey. Two new forms have turned up in the past 20 years, one of which is especially noteworthy. Called Mirabile, this lovely form shows its pink flowers and toothed leaves in September, and looks like a graceful variation on the better-known Cilician variety. Luckily, it is proving to be hardy in British gardens, although its small flowers are also happy in a pot in an unheated greenhouse. No sooner had gardeners woken up to it than enthusiastic Turks began to bring it to the market in quantity. I have heard and seen amazing stories - how peasants in the pine woods are paid piece-rates to lob tubers of newly-wanted Mirabile into baskets; how casual labour bussed-in from the East for cotton-picking has been turned loose on this new plant for the west European trade. Naturally, respectable growers, nurserymen and society members grow cyclamen only from seed raised from their stock plants in captivity. Not so the egregious Turk to whom I was introduced some while ago in Izmir. Wild flowers, he told me, were the crop of the future; he went south every year to organise 'harvesting.' But did I think there would also be a market for snowdrops, which he had located by the thousand in woods near the Black Sea? When amateur growers gather together, everyone has a horror story from the wild. I must emphasise that no good nursery would ever knowingly offer mass-collected stock; but accidents can happen and rules can be broken because of intermediaries who have bought from Turkey and sold quietly to the wholesale trade. So: where to buy safe stock, and which varieties should you choose for the greatest pleasure? The expert firm of Potterton and Martin issues lists from Nettleton, Caistor, Lincolnshire, and sells cyclamen as growing plants in pots. The present list runs to nearly 30 varieties which would otherwise be local to Libya, Cyprus or the Lebanon. They are raised within the trade, not imported from the wild, and make the most rewarding presents for anyone whose greenhouse is not heated. Under glass, wild cyclamen can take you right round the calendar, flowering in almost every month and outperforming almost any other indoor plant. When gardens are banned in due course for being cruel to weeds, I will pot-up my 10 best varieties and withdraw them indoors to an unheated window sill. In catalogues or at Wisley, watch out for the splendid Lebanese cyclamen. This is not really hardy outdoors but grows easily in a shallow pan of leafy soil that just covers the tuber. Cyclamen libanoticum is in full flower this week and its clear pink flowers are large by the standards of a wild variety. Soon, the wild persicum form will take over, flowering after the leaves have faded and reminding you of qualities which breeders have lost in their florist varieties. Persicum is scented sweetly and its small petals are reflexed - like Piglet's ears in a high wind, in Ernest Shepherd's drawings. Plants cost up to Pounds 3, but are grown easily and last for years. Outdoors, we are blessed at the moment with the remarkable coum, a totally hardy variety with a white form available separately from Potterton and Martin. Soon, it will be the turn of repandum, which runs wild from Turkey to the south of France; then, there will be the neglected purpurascens, which I have seen in hundreds during summer in north Italy. Autumn brings the best of all: Naples cyclamen, abundant all over the Mediterranean - except in Naples. All of these forms are among the hardiest and are amazingly easy to establish if you buy them growing in pots. Dry tubers are a false economy and their origins are sometimes rather dubious. Absurdly, the thousands of plants which have been dug up, dried and re-sold into the trade have had the least chance of survival in gardens. Proper nurseries sell stock which damages nobody and is raised in cultivation. I would never garden without them, and this weekend is a chance for Wisley visitors to see how many more small varieties have been isolated, named, and brought to our attention.</p>

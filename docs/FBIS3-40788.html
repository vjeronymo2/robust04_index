			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, December 25--To make every serving  personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) sensitive  to violations of human rights, a special three-day capsule  course has been introduced by its training branch.    The course is to be conducted at regular intervals.    Training is any day more beneficial than punishing the  erring  personnel, said the paramilitary force's officiating director  general, Mr S.V.M. Tripathi, while addressing the annual press  conference here.    "That is why we decided to correct our men at the beginning  itself. This capsule course will not only teach them the basics  of human rights but even familiarise them with the international  scenario," explained Mr Tripathi.    Every personnel of this paramilitary force is also being  supplied a booklet of guidelines regarding the human rights.  "This booklet will tell the personnel about the dos and donts in  particular situations," he added. As of now, our men at times do  not know how to proceed in peculiar situations, said Mr Tripathi.    He reiterated the organisation's attitude towards the  errings  officials as also the jawans. He said numerous men and officers  were summarily dismissed from service or they suffered reduction  in rank and pay and even compulsory retirement, in cases where  charges of human right violations got substantiated against  them. He said during the last year, there have been no reports  of such violations by the CRPF.    The paramilitary force, mainly deployed in Punjab, Jammu and  Kashmir, the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh and north eastern  part of India, has had significant success while handling  counterinsurgency operations. Till November, this year, the CRPF  liquidated 150 militants and caught another 645. Over 450 fire  arms, including AK 47, 56 and 74 assault rifles and rocket  launchers, were seized by the CRPF personnel during this period.    Talking about the Rapid Action Force (RAF), Mr Tripathi said  in another three months time the remaining five battalions of  RAF too would be raised. At the time of its inception, RAF was  to have ten battalions but due to commitments, only five could  be raised.    The CRPF has also taken over nearly 25,000 hectares of  forest  area in Orissa, where the organisation would not merely be  responsible for the protection of it but even make efforts for  its upkeep and maintenance, he revealed.    The officiating director-general also disclosed the recent  approval by the government of their proposal to convert two  battalions into Training battalions. With this, the CRPF would  now be in a position to give training to its men on rotational  basis, which so far has not been possible because of pressures.</p>

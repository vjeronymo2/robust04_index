			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL COMICS TO PERFORM AT IRVINE SERVICES BENEFIT  </P> <P> Three comedians, including local-boys-made-good Jerry Miner and Chris Verwiel,  perform tonight at 8 at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center in a benefit for the  Irvine-based Community Service Programs.  </P> <P> Tom McGillen, an Improvisation favorite, headlines the event, which is to raise  money for programs targeting child abuse, drug abuse, homeless youths and  victims of crime.  </P> <P> Once a doorman at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach, Miner now headlines comedy  clubs nationwide and took first place at a recent comedy contest at the Irvine  Improv. His observational material focuses on everyday experience, like the  predatory instincts aroused when a group of friends confronts the last piece of  pizza.  </P> <P> Miner, thinking out loud: "Joe's already fat. Why's he looking at it?"  </P> <P> Verwiel, a former Fullerton resident, also tours nationally. McGillen boasts  extensive television credits.  </P> <P> Community Services Programs is a nonprofit agency serving Orange County. Among  other things, it provides shelter for troubled and runaway youth; assistance to  victims and witnesses of crime; professional child abuse intervention, and  cross-cultural education for Vietnamese families.  </P> <P> Tickets to tonight's show are $15 and can be purchased at the door.  Information: (714) 250-0488. RICK VANDERKNYFF  </P></p>

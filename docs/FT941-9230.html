			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Supporting role for Mr Hurd Every prime minister needs a Willie, the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher once said in a comment that was as true as it was infelicitous. Mr John Major, the prime minister, should pay heed to his predecessor's advice. Lady Thatcher was referring to the pivotal role played by Lord Whitelaw during her first two terms in Downing Street. As home secretary and subsequently leader of the House of Lords and deputy prime minister, Lord Whitelaw provided the countervailing common sense to her ideological drive. His qualities have been well documented. In her memoirs Lady Thatcher recounts that 'he could often sense my mood even before I had realised it myself'. More importantly he combined loyalty with acute political instincts. Lord Whitelaw was the man who could tell Lady Thatcher when to stop. In her account of the Downing Street years, however, she omits to say that it was after his enforced departure through ill health in December 1987 that her administration fell victim to the hubris which contributed to its demise. The later rows with her chancellor over the exchange rate, her unflinching faith in the poll tax and the cabinet battles over Europe could all be attributed in part to the absence of a steadying hand on the tiller. Lord Whitelaw still has an influence. His opposition earlier this month to some of the key provisions of the police bill forced an immediate government retreat. More importantly he is consulted by the Tory party's men in grey suits on the state of the government and prospects for Mr Major's premiership. Mr Major consults him less than he should. Lord Whitelaw's voice will be the one to listen to most carefully if the results of the local and European elections are as bad as many Tory MPs now fear. The prime minister cannot re-engage Lord Whitelaw even though his wisdom could prove a welcome addition to a cabinet hardly overflowing with intellect and political instinct. But Mr Major can do the next best thing. Without waiting for his planned summer reshuffle, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, could be given the additional title of deputy prime minister. The title has no formal place in Britain's constitution, but it carries a powerful message about relative authority of those in the cabinet. By giving Mr Hurd power to act on his authority, Mr Major might considerably strengthen his own embattled position. The political advantages are obvious. The foreign secretary is a safe pair of hands. He carries weight with all sections of the party. Like Lord Whitelaw before, he was defeated by the incumbent of Number 10 in a leadership election. But his standing has risen rather than fallen in the intervening period. In a cabinet of tacticians, Mr Hurd stands out as one of the few strategists. As foreign secretary he spends much of his time fire-fighting. But he has a concept of conservatism which stretches beyond tomorrow's headlines. The praise should not be overdone. Mr Hurd, travelling with the prime minister in Moscow yesterday, could not fail to be reminded during talks at the Kremlin of the mistakes he has made over Bosnia. More generally, Britain's foreign policy is in some disarray. Tensions with Washington and Tory animosity towards Brussels has left the government straddling an awkward divide. Mr Hurd is also a natural toff in a party led by a self-proclaimed champion of meritocracy. But his brand of Toryism is close to the prime minister's. He is an advocate of reform rather than revolution, the community as well as the individual, of Europeanism rather than isolationism. He has the rhetorical talents to give form to such concepts. Mr Major might raise objections to promoting him, however. As foreign secretary, Mr Hurd spends too much time travelling the globe to get to grips with the squabbling in the cabinet over domestic policy. Promoting him now might also be misunderstood. Mr Hurd would again be a principal contender for the leadership if Mr Major were to fall. But the prime minister is in trouble. For all his determination to ride out the expected summer storms he needs to restore control over his cabinet, his government and his party. In short, Mr Major needs a Douggie.</p>

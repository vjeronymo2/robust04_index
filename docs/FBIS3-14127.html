The aircraft was met at the airport amid  magnificent ceremonies attended by the Air Force commander, the  deputy foreign minister, and the charge d'affaires of the  embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Moscow, who has lost  all members of his family in that heart-wrenching tragedy.    The funeral ceremony of these martyrs was staged at noon  today in the burial ground of Chizar's martyrs, in the presence  of Foreign Minister Velayati, and with the participation of the  masses of people.    Referring to the cause of the crash, one of the people who  has just returned to Tehran from the scene of the crash told our  correspondent: In view of the sensitivity of the issue, the  mission of the investigation team has been extended to enable  them to complete their investigation. He added: Preliminary  investigations in the area have shown that the crash was not due  to a technical fault, and the aircraft was in fact shot down.    He also denied reports issued by a news agency, and said:  The  downed aircraft was not moving toward the war zone with a  particular objective. However, due to the rapid and sudden  change in air pressure which led to windows being broken, the  pilot was forced to divert the plane to low altitude areas to  reduce the pressure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kukanov: "Results of St. Petersburg Ballot </F> Will Be Counted by...the Courts"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- Elections in the city on the Neva  could be ruled valid in only half of the 50 districts. And even  there, whether they are legally valid or not, will have to be  decided by the city court, since city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has  rejected a protest from the prosecutor's office over the  extension of the voting hours in the ballot, which took place 20  March. The fate of a further 25 seats will be decided in the  fall. However, the new organ of representative power could  prove noncompetent -- its legal authority is determined by the  presence of two-thirds of elected deputies.</p>

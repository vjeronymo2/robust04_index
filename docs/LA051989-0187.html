			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS PULSE;  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> FOES OF TIGHTER REIN ON COUNTY GROWTH OUTNUMBER BACKERS  </P> <P> In late March -- after months of deliberation -- the Orange County Board of  Supervisors adopted a growth-management plan designed to defuse one of the most  divisive issues in years.  </P> <P> Had it been up to the county's small-business owners, however, the plan might  not have passed at all.  </P> <P> Exactly half of the 522 participants in The Times Small-Business Survey said  they opposed "having Orange County officials place stricter controls on local  growth and development."  </P> <P> Even so, most were willing to spare some change to deal with the consequences  of growth: Nearly two in three supported a sales-tax increase to fund road  improvements.  </P> <P> On other issues, poll respondents said the general outlook for small business  is bright, expressed concern about inflation and interest rates and questioned  the effectiveness of the government's efforts to keep illegal immigrants out of  the work force.  </P> <P> The growth-management plan, adopted at about the same time that the  Small-Business Survey was sent to business owners, forbids developers to build  houses, offices and other buildings unless they first pay to widen roads and  otherwise offset the impact.  </P> <P> Among survey participants -- who were asked about growth controls in general  and not about the plan under consideration by the county -- 50% said they  opposed imposing restrictions. Only 39% favored tighter controls. Another 11%  checked the "don't know" box.  </P> <P> Times pollster Mark Baldassare concluded that small-business owners, many of  whom sell directly to the public, believe that controls would mean fewer  customers for their restaurants, shops and service companies.  </P> <P> In response to another poll question, for instance, 74% of the owners said  population growth would benefit their businesses. Only 17% predicted a negative  effect.  </P> <P> Those results are hardly surprising. Outside the building industry, it would be  difficult to find a group more dependent on a growing local population.  </P> <P> "I want growth left to the free enterprise system," said Kenneth E. Stevens,  president of Irvine's $700,000-a-year All Care Services, which provides in-home  care to the elderly.  </P> <P> "I don't like the traffic any better than the next guy on the freeway, but I've  seen communities where they restricted growth. You get a type of decay there,"  said Stevens, who described himself as a moderate Republican.  </P> <P> That feeling is not unanimous, though. Ervin R. Cooley, for example, believes  growth in the county has finally gotten out of hand.  </P> <P> "I'm not against a moderate amount of growth, but our public officials are not  paying enough attention to how people are going to get in and out of our  communities," said Cooley, president of Fountain Valley's SBI Inc., a  $1.5-million-a-year microfilm company.  </P> <P> "I guess they're listening to the developers and not to us," said Cooley, a  registered Democrat who said he often votes for Republicans.  </P> <P> Stevens said he was not aware of the county's new growth management plan;  Cooley said he was.  </P> <P> On another public issue, small-business owners said voters should approve a  proposed half-cent sales tax to pay for expanding freeways and roads. The poll  found that 62% favor such a tax, 33% oppose it and 5% checked "don't know."  </P> <P> A measure under consideration by county officials would increase the sales tax  from 6 cents on the dollar to 6 1/2 cents and raise about $3 billion over 20  years. But that's only if it gets on the ballot for a special November election  and voters approve it.  </P> <P> The county's builders strongly support the tax, since it would relieve them of  some of the financial burden of building roads.  </P> <P> It would also probably help defuse the local slow-growth movement by offsetting  its most effective weapon, the increasingly frequent traffic jams that anger  voters.  </P> <P> Slow-growthers defeated a similar tax measure at the polls in 1984. They called  it a boondoggle designed to open up more of the county to developers.  </P> <P> Some other recent polls also show voters in favor of a tax increase. But  experts say that support may be soft and subject to shifts during a hard-fought  political campaign.  </P> <P> Barbara A. Ormand, manager of the Anaheim branch of Pasadena's $1.3-billion  Community Bank, said the bank favors the tax.  </P> <P> "If the congestion gets much worse, it's going to cause problems for our  employees and our customers," Ormand said. "A tax on everybody seems the  easiest and fairest way to get it."  </P> <P> That is also the perspective of William P. Ficker, senior partner at the  $2-million-a-year Newport Beach architectural firm of Ficker &amp; Ruffing.  </P> <P> "I think it's fairer than a gas tax, for example, because the number of people  on the road are probably there in inverse proportion to their ability to pay a  tax," he said.  </P> <P> In other words, affluent county residents often live close to their work and  hence, use less gas, said Ficker, who described himself as a Republican. The  less affluent often have to commute long distances from housing they can afford  to their jobs.  </P> <P> A sales tax could have the same effect, though. The poor tend to spend a  proportionately larger share of their money than wealthier people on purchases  of items subject to the sales tax. So they still could wind up bearing more of  the road improvement burden.  </P> <P> Fairness was also a chief concern of tax supporter Chuck Bearden, president of  3-year-old Executive Horizons Inc., an Irvine placement firm that finds jobs  for laid-off executives.  </P> <P> "A sales tax spreads the burden around," said Bearden. "And it's a small price  to pay compared to our big need for roads."  </P> <P> All three respondents were aware to some degree of the growing debate over the  county's 20-year transportation plan and the half-cent increase in the sales  tax that is supposed to help fund it.  </P> <P> The Small Business Survey questions were designed to elicit philosophical --  not highly specific -- answers. They do not pinpoint soft support or opposition  and should not be considered the final word on attitudes toward these issues.  </P> <P> On the economic front, surveyed small-business owners were guardedly  optimistic, much like counterparts at larger companies who have participated in  similar polls.  </P> <P> When questioned about the general outlook for small businesses this year, 33%  responded "excellent," 54% "good," 12% "fair" and only 1% "poor."  </P> <P> On specific economic issues, 56% of respondents said inflation is likely to  have a negative effect on their businesses this year, while 53% felt the same  way about interest rate changes.  </P> <P> Only 21% thought that the inflation outlook is favorable, and a mere 14% saw  interest rates headed the right way.  </P> <P> The U.S. budget deficit is expected to have a negative effect on small business  by 44% of survey participants, while only 4% saw positive movement on that  issue. But a majority of 52% said the deficit was simply no big deal for  businesses like theirs.  </P> <P> Despite concern in some quarters about purchases of U.S. real estate and  business ventures by foreigners, 49% of the poll participants said foreign  investment in Orange County should have a positive effect on their firms. Only  9% saw it as a problem.  </P> <P> Survey respondents were skeptical, though, about the effectiveness of the  federal government's recent immigration reform law, which imposed new sanctions  against businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RESULTS OF GROWTH-MANAGEMENT SURVEY  </P> <P> </P> <P> Is Amnesty Law Working ?  </P> <P> "From your experience, has the federal amnesty law eliminated illegal aliens  from the workplace in businesses such as yours?"  </P> <P> No Comment 15%  </P> <P> Yes 34%  </P> <P> No 51%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Business Outlook  </P>

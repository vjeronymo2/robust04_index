			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries drop on fresh inflation fears US Treasury prices plunged at the long end of the maturity range as investors reacted negatively to news of an increase in the purchasing managers' monthly price index. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 15/32 at 93 9/32 , yielding 6.774 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 5/16 at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.824 per cent. Traders blamed the selling on the National Association of Purchasing Management's February report. Although the NAPM's index of nationwide manufacturing activity fell from 57.7 in January to 56.6 last month - normally good news for bonds - this was mostly explained by analysts as the result of the severe winter weather that struck large parts of the US in February. Instead, investors focused on the sharp jump in the association's price index, which climbed from 59.8 to 67.0. This, plus a big increase in the NAPM's employment index, spooked the market, which is extremely sensitive to signs of inflation, particularly wage inflation. The result was heavy selling of bonds. The day's other news was an upward revision in the government's estimate of the growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product of 5.9 per cent to 7.5 per cent. This was clearly bearish for bonds but traders said it ultimately had little impact because it had already been priced into the market. Later in the day, comments from Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, further unsettled sentiment. He said the Fed's recent 25 basis point reduction in short-term interest rates would probably not be enough to ensure that it achieves its long-term goal of keeping inflation low. European government bonds fell sharply on the back of weak US Treasuries and a smaller than expected monetary easing in the Bundesbank's latest open market operation. At the Bundesbank's allocation of two-week securities repurchase agreements, the minimum repo rate fell by three basis points to 5.97 per cent. That was less than the five to 10-basis point fall most traders had been calling for and was seen to indicate that the Bundesbank's pace of easing remains extremely cautious. In the afternoon, selling was fuelled by the sharp drop in US Treasuries triggered by the NAPM report. 'This confirms my medium-term scenario that Europe can't decouple from the US,' said Kirit Shah, international strategist at First Chicago. New supply in several European markets put a further damper on prices. 'With no buyers around, how are governments going to finance their deficits?' questioned one trader. Europe's high-yielding bond markets were especially hard-hit by yesterday's sell-off. The Italian long bond future on Liffe fell by 2.10 points to 111. Following the dismal reception of Monday's three and five-year auctions, the prospect of L7,500 of new 10 and 30-year bonds triggered a sharp sell-off in the morning. In the event, the result of the long-dated auctions was better than feared, but traders said the paper would continue to weigh on the market. Spanish bonds did even worse, pounded by heavy foreign selling, the long bond future in Madrid falling by 2.20 points to 99.59. French bonds also slid by more than a point on the back of the German repo and US Treasuries weakness. The March notional bond future's breach of technical support at 126.36 opened the floodgates for further selling, mostly by foreign accounts, traders said. It fell by 1.22 points on the day to close at 125.74, but slipped further to 125.10 in after-hours trading. UK gilts fell by two points at the long end, under-performing core European markets. After falling in line with other bond markets, talk of large overseas selling knocked prices even lower. The March long gilt future fell by 2 1/8 points to close at 111 3/8 . 'After outperforming on the upside over the last few days and getting lulled into a false sense of security, gilts outperformed on the downside yesterday,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'The market fell two points on absolutely no news or fresh supply - that has to be a cause for concern,' he added. German bonds also weakened on disappointment over the repo and the slide in US Treasuries, and were further pressured by the sale of DM3bn of new 10-year bonds for the Treuhandanstalt. Another tranche of the issue is due to be auctioned today. In after-hours London trading, the March bund future was down 1.06 points from Monday's close at 95.86.</p>

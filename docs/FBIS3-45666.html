Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech  entitled "Clearly Understand the New Situation and Seize the New  Opportunity to Win New Victory in the Second Pioneering  Program." In his speech, he set forth general demanda for this  year's economic work, that is, to deepen reform, expand opening  up, and improve the quality of economic operations by  accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economy  in order to ensure that the national economic plan is fulfilled  and new victory in the second pioneering program is won this  year.    Yue Qifeng said: The most conspicuous characteristics of  this year's economic situation are: The province is about to  make a big step in reform; in macroeconomy, the state is about  to carry out reforms in finance and tax, banking, foreign trade,  investment, and management of state-owned assets; and in  microeconomy, the province is about to make a substantive step  in changing the mechanisms of enterprises with the purpose of  establishing a modern enterprise system. This year, we will not  only face the old problems of conspicuous structural  contradictions, stagnated technological transformation, heavy  historical burdens, low economic efficiency, and extensive  management but will also meet new problems in carrying out new  major reform measures. The mix of new and old contradictions  will impose a rigorous test on the province's economic  development.    Yue Qifeng said: Whether we can achieve new and even greater  progress in the economy this year depends primarily on whether  we can make a big breakthrough in reform. Therefore, in  conducting economic work in 1994, we should not only give  prominence to reform by regarding it as the major line running  through the whole process, but also persist in the idea that  only development constitutes the essential criterion, seize the  new opportunity, face up to new challenges, and achieve new  progress. We should not only give prominence to grasping the  focal and difficult points of economic work and continue to run  large and medium-sized enterprises well but also energetically  cultivate and develop new economic growth points.    Yue Qifeng said: The tasks on reform, opening up, and  economic construction we face this year will be very arduous,  and the reform measures to be set forth this year will be more  numerous, extensive, profound, and difficult than those set  forth in any of the past dozen of years. This has set on us a  demand higher than those set on us in the past. To adapt  ourselves to the new situation, leaders at all levels must  conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and must further emancipate the mind, enhance  spirit, change the style of work, and truly attend to work. So  long as our minds are emancipated, our road of development is  set correctly, and our work is practical, we will certainly  realize sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national  economy and win new victory in the second pioneering program.    The conference was presided over by Xiao Zuofu, vice  governor  of the province. Vice Governor Wen Shizhen relayed the  guidelines of the national economic work conference. Attending  the conference were provincial leaders Gu Jinchi, Wang Huaiyuan,  Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo, Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu,  and Xu De.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Having solved a series  of technical problems, Chinese scientists have started to  promote soilless cultivation of vegetables and crops across the  whole country.    This was learned at the "International Seminar on Soilless  Cultivation" held here last week.    Vegetables like tomatoes, aubergines, peppers and cucumbers  raised in soilless hothouses have been supplied to markets all  the year round in some provinces and cities. Rice is the main  grain crop grown using this technique.    China's Agriculture Ministry began to research soilless  cultivation in 1985, with more than 30 colleges and agricultural  research institutes taking part in the project.    Vegetables grown this way have many advantages, such as  saving water and fertilizer, high output, fine quality and  resistance to pests.    Meanwhile, progress has been made in planting rice on water  surfaces. Such rice in Zhejiang Province has an output of 7,500  kg. per ha.    Soilless cultivation helps to makes good use of China's  inland water resources and build them into grain production  areas, which, it is hoped, will help China to solve the  contradiction between population increase and the shrinkage of  arable land.    If the technique were spread to China's current  10-million-ha  lake surfaces and 4.3-million-ha reservoir water surfaces, it  would bring about great economic and social benefits, according  to specialists. They predict that soilless cultivation will  become the next trend in agricultural development in both China  and other parts of the world.</p>

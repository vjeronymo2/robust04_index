			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / End of power struggle could be catalyst for reforms: Mr Wong's departure could prove as significant for change as the 1987 crash THE RESIGNATION of Mr Philip Wong marks the end of an era for the Hong Kong stock market. It might prove to be as significant a catalyst as the 1987 world markets crash, which temporarily closed the exchange and was followed by the resignation and subsequent jailing on corruption charges of Mr Ronald Li, then the exchange's chairman. The significance is that the departure of Mr Wong - who was expected to become chairman in October - could ease the way for reforms of the exchange's structure and council aimed at reducing the power of small local brokers. These brokers have regained control since 1988 when structural changes were introduced and, led by Mr Wong, have been blocking the further reforms aimed at underpinning Hong Kong's image as an internationally important financial centre. But Mr Wong's resignation has a wider importance because he is believed to have been using the stock exchange as a stepping stone to other influential posts elsewhere. He has links with Peking and is widely thought to have ambitions for high office after 1997. He has been expected to be elected to the Legislative Council in September as the nominee of the pro-Peking Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Some colleagues believe his real target is to be the first post-1997 chief executive of the new Hong Kong government. Others say that this is shooting too high, and rate him as part of an inner cabinet. Either way, Mr Wong has been playing for high stakes and seems to have felt the need to clear his name for partaking as a member of the pre-crash stock exchange council, in the council members' then practice of receiving preferential share allocations. His unsuccessful attempt in the past two weeks to legalise the practice appears in this context to have been an attempt to wipe the record clean, rather than a serious attempt to reintroduce the practice and line his and other council members' pockets. In the securities markets Mr Wong is regarded as being a staunch defender of local brokers against expatriate influence. He has thus used the old guard of the stock exchange as a political constituency, first for his ambitions to become the exchange chairman, and then to develop influence elsewhere. In the past six days he has thrown two large dinners for more than 150 brokers a time in order to canvass support for his cause. At the peak of his influence, Mr Wong is believed to have controlled 380 to 390 votes out of 700 involved in stock exchange council elections, many through proxies. Large international (mostly expatriate) brokers have been progressively replaced by small brokers (mostly ethnic Chinese locals) in the elections so that, according to officials, the council's 21 members now represent only 8 per cent of the exchange's turnover compared with 34 per cent in 1988. This has led to led to accusations from officials of the colony's expatriate-dominated watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, that the stock exchange sees itself as a trade association protecting its members' rights, rather than the interests of investors and the market. In effect this is a toned down version of a criticism made after the 1987 crash by an official inquiry which said that the old stock exchange committee was an 'inside group that treated the exchange as a private club'. One of the reforms which have been blocked is to change the exchange's articles and end its limited company status which carries a profit-making role. At present its members have a right to a share in its accumulated surpluses of more than HKDollars 226m (Pounds 17m), built up from seat purchases and transaction levies. It would become a publicly incorporated non-profit making body. At the same time about 150 non-trading members - who are believed to form part of Mr Wong's vote bank - would be ousted. This issue has been fought through the courts. But the primary aim is to reconstitute the council to include listed companies and institutional investors as well as larger international brokers. Voting in council elections might also be weighted to take account of a broker's turnover. The SFC has pushed these reforms and led the attack on the old-style brokers at the same time as it has been waging a separate battle with the stock exchange and the Jardine Matheson Group over allegations of over-regulation in listing rules and the rights of Hong Kong companies domiciled and listed overseas. Together with the government it now hopes that the crisis over Mr Wong will act as a catalyst for a consensus on the reforms. The question now is whether Mr Wong's resignation will hinder this political career. The pro-China chamber will have to decide whether he should be its Legislative Council candidate. That could well depend on whether Peking decides to continue to back him. It may take a line often heard in the past and decide that he deserves support as the latest of a series of victims attacked by Britain in order to keep control in Hong Kong out of ethnic Chinese hands.</p>

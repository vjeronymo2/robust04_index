			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SANDERLING'S MAHLER WITH L.A. PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> As Mahler's works have become standard repertory through the last generation,  they have become oddly homogenized. The composer's character as the eternal  angry young man has been exaggerated, while his music has been increasingly  reduced to hyper-romantic stereotypes.  </P> <P> Trust Kurt Sanderling, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's grand old man of the  central European tradition, to right things. Seldom has Mahler the man sounded  saner and his music more radical than in Sanderling's Ninth Symphony, as  presented Thursday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> Sanderling's approach, at least for the first three movements, was to banish  conventional integration. Let the instrumental colors clash rather than blend.  Let the transitions jerk violently, and leave the contrapuntal thickets  unpruned.  </P> <P> The results restored the uncompromising originality of the music in purely  sonic terms. This was high-risk Mahler, flirting with discontinuity and aural  overload at almost every turn.  </P> <P> Yet the interpretive effect remained emotionally centered -- earthy, vibrantly  physical and filled with positive energy. Gone for the most part was the  embittered mockery and metaphysical Angst many conductors find omnipresent  here.  </P> <P> Instead, Sanderling's Ninth was knowing, satirical and often exultant. Outraged  at times, to be sure, and shadowed with the certainty of mortality, but never  defeatist.  </P> <P> The finale became an impassioned hymn, richly layered with subtexts but  ultimately poised in finality rather than swoony or shattered.  </P> <P> Sanderling elicited playing of impressionistic vividness from the Philharmonic.  The inventiveness of Mahler's scoring is a commentary commonplace, but not  often made so apparent in performance.  </P> <P> This was not Mahler for apologists, and the orchestra presented it with raucous  conviction, sometimes strident and mistuned but never inhibited. For three  movements the strings were almost totally buried except in sectional solos, but  emerged in ripe, tensile glory in the Adagio.  </P> <P> Mahler could -- probably should -- have stood alone. Sanderling, though,  attached a quirky prefix in the form of Haydn's Symphony No. 39.  </P> <P> Contrast was clearly the aim here. But although Sanderling sharply downsized  the band and included a seldom audible harpsichord, this was not Haydn for the  period purist.  </P> <P> Basically a sectional concerto for the first violins, this retro Baroque  symphony was given unexceptional direction, and not surprisingly proved  soft-grained and largely monochromatic in execution.  </P> <P> This program, the final one of Sanderling's current three-week engagement, has  its last performance Sunday afternoon.

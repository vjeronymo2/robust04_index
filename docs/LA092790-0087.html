			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORAN NAMED TO SUPERIOR COURT  </P> <P> The presiding judge of the Glendale Municipal Court, honored earlier this year  as a top Los Angeles County jurist, has been named to the Los Angeles Superior  Court.  </P> <P> The appointment last week of Charles Horan, who will take the Superior Court  bench on Oct. 1, leaves empty the second of three Glendale judgeships.  </P> <P> The first fell vacant Aug. 25 when Judge Cheryl Krott died.  </P> <P> The third judge, Barbara Burke, and three commissioners will handle all cases  until Gov. George Deukmejian appoints two new judges, which may occur by the  end of the year, said Karla Olson, Glendale court administrator.  </P> <P> Horan, 39, was appointed to the Municipal Court bench in April, 1988, after  seven years as a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney. The Los Angeles  County Bar Assn. this summer named Horan the county's Municipal Court judge of  the year.  </P> <P> Horan was well-known as an intelligent, no-nonsense judge whose sense of humor  often put attorneys and defendants at ease, court officials said. The jurist  also became known for playing guitar in a rock 'n' roll band called "Use a  Guitar and Go to Prison," in which his wife and several attorneys played.  </P></p>

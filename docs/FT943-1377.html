			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Breedon rises 56% to Pounds 1.5m Breedon, the limestone quarrying and housebuilding group, raised pre-tax profits 56 per cent from Pounds 960,000 to Pounds 1.5m in the six months to July 31. Turnover grew 30 per cent from Pounds 5.05m to Pounds 6.59m. The company said that while first time buyers had fallen away, sales of its top of the range properties were increasing. Once conditions improved, its low cost land bank would enable it to 'maximise profit contribution'. Earnings per share were 3.53p (2.26p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.75p.</p>

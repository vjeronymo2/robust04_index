			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Finnish markka firms A sharp upward move in the Finnish markka was the dominant event on the foreign exchanges yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. The currency is benefiting from good economic fundamentals, and polling evidence suggesting that the Finnish electorate will support European Union membership when it votes next weekend. The other move of note was a sharp turnround in sentiment in the short sterling markets. Prices rose after weaker than expected UK manufacturing and industrial production figures for August suggested no need for a near-term tightening of monetary policy. Market activity, however, was generally very muted, with most attention focused on the release today of the US employment report and the Columbia University inflation index. The dollar traded in a narrow range, ending at Y99.75 from Y99.47 and DM1.5444 from DM1.5426. Sterling also had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index finishing unchanged at 80.2. In New York the US currency closed at Y99.835 and DM1.5440. The Italian lira had a calmer day after Wednesday's political jitters, ending at L1,014 from L1,016 against the D-Mark. The rouble continued its recent slide, trading at Rbs2,833 to the dollar on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, from Rbs2,808. A senior central bank official predicted that the currency could breach the Rbs3,000 level 'long before the year-end'. The Finnish markka was again in the spotlight after new EU polls showed an increasing majority of Finns in favour of the EU. One poll had 48 per cent of Finns favouring membership. Mr Niels Christensen, analyst at Technical Data in London, commented: 'The polls triggered a move from FM3.11 to FM3.0850 (against the D-Mark) immediately at the opening of the European session. This move was capped by intervention from the Finnish central bank and the rate moved back to FM3.09. 'Renewed moves are expected in the next 10 days before the Finnish EU referendum on October 16. A move through FM3.08 and on toward FM3.05 seems very likely unless the Finnish central bank intervenes more seriously.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said its Finnish customers reckoned the markka could reach FM3, while he thought it could go as far as FM2.80, its best level in the last two years. The currency has risen from around FM3.32 in mid-August. According to Citibank figures, out of 16 leading currencies, the Finnish markka performed the best in the period from the start of the year until September 29. It rose 5.6 per cent against the D-Mark. Mr MacKinnon said Finland's economic fundamentals were very attractive. 'The key that is driving this is the very high export receivables Finnish companies are getting.' Allied to this is a good inflation outlook, and a strong growth performance, both in 1994 and 1995. The Finnish markka has pulled other Nordic currencies with it. Yesterday the Swedish krona finished at SKr4.759 from SKr4.788 per D-Mark, while the Norwegian krona appreciated to NKr4.356 from NKr4.359. Mr MacKinnon warned, though, that the size of Sweden's budget deficit - the structural deficit (which ignores the effect of economic cycles) is estimated to be 9 per cent - made the Swed-ish currency vulnerable to depreciation. Both volume and price movements in the short sterling market were favourable, especially in the shorter dated contracts. The December contract traded nearly 44,000 lots to finish at 93.30 from 93.18. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said the improved tone of the market was a result of the weak economic figures - well below consensus forecasts - and the market rebounding from an oversold position. He added that a lot of traders were squeezed out of short positions when prices started to rise. Short sterling prices have also benefited from the better performance of gilts this week. Analysts report portfolio switches from equities to gilts, while unease about the dollar, and nervousness about the D-Mark ahead of German elections, has also lent sterling an unusual safe-haven aura. Although sentiment has improved, the futures prices are still pricing in a 70 basis-point increase in UK rates by December. In the cash market, the sterling three-month LIBOR rate came back to 6 per cent from 6 1/16 per cent, after starting the week at 5 7/8 per cent. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 805m assistance, after declaring a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 3/4 and 5 7/8 per cent. In the US today, attention will focus as much on the Columbia University inflation index as the payroll figures. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has cited it as an indicator he watches, and last month it overshadowed the employment report.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE UPHOLDS DECISION TO FIRE OFFICER WHO SHOT DRIVER  </P> <P> Torrance City Council members voted unanimously Tuesday to sustain the decision  to fire a police officer who shot a man during a routine traffic stop and then  allegedly lied about how the shooting took place.  </P> <P> Officer Timothy Pappas and two colleagues were fired in December after a Police  Department investigation into the shooting of construction worker Patrick  Coyle, who was partially paralyzed as a result of the May 9, 1988, incident.  </P> <P> Pappas had previously appealed his dismissal to the city's Civil Service  Commission, which also voted unanimously to uphold the department's decision.  If Pappas wishes to continue seeking reinstatement, City Atty. Kenneth Nelson  said, he must pursue his case in the courts.  </P> <P> The council hearing on Pappas' case, like each previous hearing on the matter,  was held behind closed doors.  </P> <P> Attorney Daniel Cassidy, who represented the city, said Pappas' lawyer, Doug  Otto, argued that the penalty for the apparently accidental shooting was too  severe.  </P> <P> Otto did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the case.  </P> <P> Pappas and Officer Mark Holden also face criminal charges for their part in an  alleged cover-up of how Coyle was shot. Initial police reports said Pappas  pulled the trigger after Coyle made a sudden grab toward a metal object in his  pocket.  </P> <P> A third officer at the scene, Timothy Thornton, later told his superiors that  Coyle made no sudden moves before he was shot. Investigators said they believe  Pappas pulled the trigger accidentally.  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing for Pappas and Holden began in Los Angeles Municipal  Court on Oct. 12, but will not resume until Oct. 24.  </P> <P> Criminal charges were not filed against Thornton.  </P> <P> Thornton is scheduled to appeal his dismissal to the City Council on Nov. 14,  Civil Service Administrator William Ghio said. Holden's hearing before the  Civil Service Commission is scheduled to begin Oct. 23, Ghio said.  </P></p>

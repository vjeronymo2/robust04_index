			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago futures battered Rising interest rates and higher oil prices battered most agricultural and metals markets on Monday, with commodities as diverse as soyabeans, silver, and lumber coming under pressure as investors liquidated positions. In New York, silver futures lost more than 19 cents a troy ounce, while in Chicago, soyabean futures tumbled 30 cents a bushel, the largest decline allowed at the Board of Trade. Lumber futures also dropped their daily limit of Dollars 10 a thousand board feet. In early trading yesterday commodity prices had stabilised, but few markets were rebounding from Monday's losses, despite a recovery in the US stock market. Analysts said falling bond and stock prices forced some large hedge fund investors to liquidate commodity positions to meet margin calls. Silver and soyabean futures, popular as hedge fund investments, bore the brunt of the selling. Lumber prices tumbled because higher mortgage rates were expected to discourage new home construction. Soyabeans came under particular pressure in the wake of a government report that showed US farmers intend to plant 61.1m acres to the crop this spring, about 3m more than last year. The report was released after Thursday's close but futures markets were closed on Friday. With a record soyabean crop being harvested in South America and forecasts of higher US plantings, Mr Richard Feltes, senior grains analyst with Refco, the commodities brokerage firm, forecast that stocks would rise to 339m bushels in the US this year, significantly higher than in the past two years. He said global production estimates would warrant soyabean futures prices closer to Dollars 5.50 a bushel, far lower than Monday's close of Dollars 6.53 1/2 for July delivery.</p>

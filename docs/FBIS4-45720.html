			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover, environment editor: "Most People </F> Are Now Exposed to Ozone Pollution"]    [Text] On sunny days most people in England and Wales are  exposed to unsafe levels of low-level ozone pollution, an  independent study for the Department of the Environment said  yesterday.    Low-level ozone -- caused by sunlight acting on nitrogen  oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by cars and, to a  far lesser extent, industry -- has doubled in Britain this  century, the report shows.    High concentrations of ozone have been shown to damage the  lungs in people who take heavy exercise. Ten per cent of the  population are extra sensitive to ozone, and in them the  pollution may trigger respiratory diseases.    Scientists say that ozone at these levels is likely to cause  billions of pounds of damage to paint and building materials,  disease in trees and plants and crop damage of more than  &pound;34  million a year.    The report, which shows that peak levels of ozone pollution  reach the same levels in the south of England as in smog-ridden  Los Angeles, will inevitably add to pressure for tougher curbs  on car emissions.    Prof David Fowler of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology's  laboratory near Edinburgh said that ozone pollution -- half of  which is drawn in from the Continent -- was "a European problem."    The first maps of ozone exposure to be compiled by the  Photochemicals Oxidants Review Group show that parts of England  and Wales are exposed to harmful levels of ozone for up to 800  hours each year. Levels of exposure either exceed or are very  close to safe limits, thought to be 60 parts per billion for  humans and 40 parts per billion for plants and crops.    The study also shows that levels of nitrogen oxides,  produced  by cars and power stations, are now double the level of sulphur  pollution in Britain. Britain exports 75 per cent of its  nitrogen oxides to the Continent.    Professor Fowler said that present reductions in pollution  from cars expected as a result of new standards for cars in 1996  "will not be sufficient" to improve air quality after the year  2,000.

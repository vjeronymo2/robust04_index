			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / De Klerk hits back at right with poll plan PRESIDENT F W de Klerk confronted South African whites yesterday with a stark choice of continuing his political reforms or facing his resignation. In an attempt to seize the political initiative after his National party suffered a crushing by-election defeat at the hands of the rightwing Conservative party, he announced plans for an early whites-only referendum on political reform and said he would resign if the vote failed to go his way. His move amounts to a challenge to the Conservative party to muster widespread opposition to the reform programme, which has led to multi-party negotiations on a constitution which will permit one-person one-vote elections. The National and Conservative parties had elevated Wednesday's Potchefstroom by-election to the status of a barometer of the views of white voters on constitutional change. The CP turned a 1989 NP majority of 1,583 into a 2,140-vote defeat, a result which allowed it to claim that it was now the party which spoke for the majority of whites. Mr de Klerk said it had become crucial to decide 'whom white voters wish to entrust with negotiations on South Africa's constitutional future. 'If I lose the referendum, I will resign, the government will resign and there will be an election,' Mr de Klerk said. The referendum will be held before the end of next month. Mr de Klerk said blacks should not view it as a white veto on political reform, but conceded that democracy talks could be derailed if he lost. Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the CP, said the party accepted the referendum challenge 'on condition . . . that the playing field is level.' He insisted on equal access to state-controlled radio and television and a say in drafting the text of the question to be posed in the referendum. The African National Congress, which is negotiating a new constitution with the government, condemned the notion of a whites-only referendum as racist and said the poll would delay reform. The government will announce next week the date of the referendum and the question to be asked. National party sources suggest it is more likely to be phrased in terms of principles rather than personalities or parties. South African financial markets fell steeply following Mr de Klerk's announcement. There are fears a victory for the CP, committed to returning to full apartheid, could provoke civil conflict on a scale not yet seen in South Africa.

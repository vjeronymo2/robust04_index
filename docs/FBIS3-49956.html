			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Croatian Defense and National Security Council  held its 35th session in the Presidential Palace today with  Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, in the  chair. The Council was briefed on the results of the latest  round of Geneva talks on the former Yugoslavia and on the  declaration on the normalization of relations between the  Republic of Croatia and the FRY, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro.    The Council supported the declaration, and assessed the  normalization of Croatian and Serbian relations as in the  strategic interest of the Republic of Croatia and a prerequisite  for the establishment of a new international order in the former  Yugoslav territory and in this part of Europe and the Balkans.    The signing of the declaration based on the UN Charter and  the main CSCE documents is of great political importance, and at  the same time confirms the readiness of both sides' signatories  of the declaration that the problem of Serbs in Croatia will be  resolved in a peaceful way, by reintegrating UN Protected Areas  in the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of  Croatia.    International factors supported the declaration, and  assessed  it as an important step in the process of finding a permanent  political solution in this region.    The government of the Republic of Croatia will do everything  in its power to ensure that the provision on the establishment  of official representative offices is implemented as of 15  February this year.    As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- despite all  peace proposals on the part of the Republic of Croatia and the  European initiative -- the conference failed to reach a  permanent solution because of the Muslim side, but the talks  will continue and the next conference has been scheduled for 10  February this year.    Having given full support to the Croatian delegation's  consistent stands, the Council expressed hope that the  resumption of such policy on Croatia's part would bring about a  permanent and just solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

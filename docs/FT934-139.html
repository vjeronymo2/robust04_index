			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Industrial leaders and MPs dominate new year honours Politicians, captains of industry and top civil servants have again dominated the leading awards in the New Year's Honours List, despite the prime minister's recent call for a broader range of individuals to be decorated. As part of his mission to create a 'classless society', Mr John Major said that the biannual honours lists should increasingly reflect exceptional achievement rather than status, with more awards going to people who have done voluntary work and fewer to state servants. However, although this new year's list contains a larger number of awards for voluntary workers than previously, most of the top decorations have again gone to leading public figures and company chief executives. Moreover, less than a quarter of the list is made up of individuals who have been nominated by a member of the public, under a scheme launched by the prime minister in March. Downing Street officials said yesterday that the public had recommended about 7,500 individuals for a decoration. But only 200 of the 900 awards made today were backed by the public - and in only 70 cases were awards generated solely by an external nomination. Officials said they were still scrutinising about 4,000 of the original nominations, but they expected the number to increase in future years. The awards to industrialists reflect a greater admiration for Britain's established companies rather than for the acquisitive conglomerates singled out in Lady Thatcher's honours lists in the 1980s. Mr Iain Vallance, the chairman of BT, is one of five leading business figures to receive a knighthood. The others are Mr Michael Perry, the chairman of Unilever, Mr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo Holdings, Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of the Midland Bank and Mr Ian Wood, managing director of John Wood group, an offshore oil company regarded as one of Scotland's fastest growing corporations. Sir David Nickson, chairman of the Clydesdale Bank and former president of the Confederation of British Industry, is one of only two new life peers in the list. The other is Sir Patrick Wright, a former head of the Diplomatic Service. Mr Archie Hamilton, the former minister for the armed forces and a former parliamentary private secretary to Lady Thatcher, is one of three MPs to be knighted for political service. The other two are Mr Peter Fry, Tory MP for Wellingborough, and Mr David Madel, Tory MP for Bedfordshire South West. Mr Kenneth Warren, former Tory MP and chairman of the all-party trade and industry select committee, also receives a knighthood. Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary who is due to leave next year, is made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. The Labour party has again not put forward any MPs in protest at the system. Leading the awards in the world of arts are Dame Janet Baker, the opera singer, who is made a Companion of Honour and Mr Derek Jacobi, the actor, who is knighted.

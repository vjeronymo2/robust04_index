			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cost controls help CIA to 27% rise at Pounds 1.9m CIA Group, the independent media-buying concern, bucked the sector trend in the first half of 1992 with a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 1.87m. Tight control of costs was given as a principal cause for the improvement. Further, the USM-quoted group revealed that this time a higher proportion of its profits were from trading - 56 per cent, against 46 per cent - and that this growth was both organic and by acquisition. Turnover rose to Pounds 116.3m (Pounds 79.3m). Of this, organic growth accounted for Pounds 10m domestically and Pounds 14m internationally, with new companies - Maedia Solutions and the 20/20 Media joint venture - contributing an extra Pounds 13m. The group put on Pounds 48m of new business and lost only Pounds 5m. The group increased its cash by about Pounds 1m to Pounds 8m. Earnings per share expanded to 8.59p (6.82p). The interim dividend is raised from 1.15p to 1.32p.</p>

Smirnov, Scientific Research  Institute of Micro-biology at the Russian Ministry of Defense,  Kirov; UDC 575:577.21]    [Abstract] The marked protective action of the I-fraction,  also referred to as FI-antigen, to the plague microbe is well  known; atypical forms of the Yersinia pestis agent  which do not synthesize the I-fraction and are found in natural  foci can usually be produced from preparations on the basis of  antibodies to the mice toxin or T-antigen. Consequently, an  attempt is made to construct special producer strains of FI- and  T-antigen to the plague microbe using genetic engineering  methods. To this end, pFra/Tox plasmid DNA are isolated from the  monoplasmid version of the K-I vaccine strain of Y.  pestis, and cloning is performed in the cells of strain 803  of Escherichia coli using the pBR328 vector and cos36  (rep R1162) cosmids and a restrictase and DNA ligase set. The  experimental procedure is outlined. The protective action of the  purified preparations of the FI-antigen produced from  recombinant strain cultures is assessed using conventional  techniques, and statistical data processing is carried out  according to Ashmarin and Vorobyev. The mice toxin gene is  cloned on the pBR328 vector in the HindIII-fragment (6.0 MD) of  the pFra/Tox plasmid. An in vitro deletion  mutagenesis analysis shows that the sequence encoding the mice  toxin has two Bg1 II sites and one Eco RI site. Hybrid pKT328  plasmid is considerably more stable compared to the pBR328  vector. A restriction chart of the 30.3 kD long pFra/Tox genome  area which houses the fra and tox genes is plotted, and it is  established on the basis of the diffusion precipitation reaction  in agar that the recombinant E. coli strain cells  produce no more than two units of T-antigen (mice toxin). The  area responsible for the incompatibility of the pFra/Tox plasmid  and correct distribution of its copies among the daughter cells  is identified. The results make it possible to state that by  increasing the gene dose and expression level of the cloned  gene, FI- and T-antigen producing strains which are  distinguished by a stably high synthesis level and the absence  of a number of contaminating antigens have been constructed. The  recombinant strain cells produced from Y. pestis EV  (3P[.sup]-[/]) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis PI  produce four-to-eight times more FI-antigen than the cells of  the NIIEG line, while purified FI-antigen preparations produced  from the recombinant strains' cultured liquid (KZh) have at  least as high a protective ability as the preparation isolated  from NIEEG strains.

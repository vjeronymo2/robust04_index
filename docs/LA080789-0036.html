			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANGE TO RESIGN AS PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND  </P> <P> Prime Minister David Lange said today that he is resigning but plans to remain  a member of Parliament.  </P> <P> Lange, 47, who underwent a heart operation last year, told a news conference  that medical advice had influenced his decision to resign.  </P> <P> Lange, prime minister since 1984, said he will tender his resignation to  Governor General Paul Reeves on Tuesday and will then ask the ruling Labor  Party to elect a leader and deputy leader.  </P> <P> Lange said he expected the new prime minister to name a new Cabinet by the end  of the week. He said he would not take a Cabinet post himself.  </P> <P> Lange, who used to relax by racing motor cars before an operation to widen a  heart artery in July, 1988, said his doctor had told him: "My not continuing  (as prime minister) would be compatible with my health."  </P> <P> There was no immediate indication if Lange's decision to resign was connected  with a bitter row with former Finance Minister Roger Douglas that has  threatened to split the Labor Party.  </P> <P> Lange dismissed Douglas, once his closest ally, last December over the scope  and speed of New Zealand's drastic economic reforms.  </P> <P> Douglas has been fighting back ever since and last week won a new place in the  Cabinet after topping a poll among Labor members of Parliament.  </P> <P> Lange responded with a pledge that Douglas would not be given a portfolio that  enabled him to influence economic policies.  </P> <P> The New Zealand dollar fell sharply after Lange's resignation was announced.  </P></p>

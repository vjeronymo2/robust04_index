			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (8): Group B - Brazil Many football fans, even those under 24, can recite more names from the winning side in the 1970 final than from both teams combined from the 1990 final. The 1966 final, exciting and emotional as it was, is embedded in the memories of television viewers in shades of grey. The 1970 final glows in sunlit greens, yellows and blues, as if the Brazilians had invented colour. That 4-1 win over Italy is the yardstick by which all subsequent World Cup matches have been judged. It is a heavy load for a team to bear and for 24 years Brazilian teams have failed to carry it. This year's squad offers grounds for optimism. Although it is well stocked with defenders - Mozer (Benfica), Aldair (Roma), Jorginho (Bayern Munich), Ricardo Gomes (Paris Saint German) and so on - it still seems shakey in defence, perhaps because the backs lack confidence in Claudio Taffarel (Parma), the goalkeeper. Over the last year this frailty has encouraged Brazil to put their faith in attack where they are burdened with traditional riches. The best known strikers are Bebeto (La Coruna), Muller (Sao Paolo) and, above all, Romario (Barcelona). There may be more complete players at the World Cup, but none who can do more damage in more ways in one second than Romario. The 1970 Brazilians could draw confidence from Pele and their World Cup wins in 1958 and 1962. The current Brazilians carry the weight of years of relative failure, the expectations of a nation and the hopes of fans around the world. The team is bickering. Brazilian fans and media are whining about coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's selections. The Brazilian federation is procrastinating over payments to players. But the talent is there ..</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UN set to approve Iraqi asset seizure THE United Nations Security Council appears certain to approve, perhaps as early as next week, a western proposal to seize a large sum in frozen Iraqi oil assets abroad to fund humanitarian relief and compensate victims of the invasion of Kuwait. Diplomats said last night that no one had a reliable estimate of the amount involved - mostly assets in the US - but sums between Dollars 200m and Dollars 1bn or more were mentioned. The US is leading the effort and some sources said it appeared to be yet another 'get tough with Iraq' exercise motivated by the current presidential election campaign. Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, said Britain supported the move and hoped the Security Council would approve it within a few days. The money raised would go into an escrow account under tight UN control. The US move follows the failure of persistent efforts by UN negotiators to complete agreement with Baghdad for the sale under strict UN control of up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil to help meet the world body's heavy expenses under the Gulf ceasefire resolution. Following a closed-door meeting yesterday the Security Council again decided that Iraq had done nothing to justify lifting or modifying sanctions. The world body reviews the situation every 90 days. Iraqi assets proposed for seizure would pay for food and medicines for needy Kurds and, among other things, compensate foreign workers expelled by Baghdad after the imposition of UN sanctions. All of the funds would come from oil sales completed or in progress when international sanctions were applied against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. Sir David Hannay said after the meeting that this was not a case of expropriation. The assets would be restored to Iraq once it complied with the relevant UN resolutions.</p>

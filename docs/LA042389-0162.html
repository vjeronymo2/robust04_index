			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GROUP URGES PLAN TO KEEP MARINE BASE AS SPRAWL BARRIER  </P> <P> As Southern California -- from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border -- continues  to boom and sprawl, many San Diego residents look at Camp Pendleton as the last  remaining open-space barrier against a future "San Angeles."  </P> <P> Now a well-known volunteer urban planning and environmental group in San Diego  wants to make sure that the Marine Corps base's 125,000 acres (more than 195  square miles) remain open and free from development if the base is ever closed.  </P> <P> The group, called C-3, for Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, is urging U.S.  Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson, as well as San Diego County's  congressional delegation, to safeguard the area by introducing legislation this  year that would convert the base to federal parkland if it is ever closed.  </P> <P> The request was made in letters that arrived at most congressional offices  earlier this month. At least two of the officials, Wilson and Rep. Jim Bates  (D-San Diego), think the idea has merit and will consider seeking congressional  approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seems to Make Sense'  </P> <P> "At first blush, we think it's a splendid idea that seems to make sense," said  Wilson's spokesman, Otto Bos. He said Wilson's office will examine the proposal  more closely, with the idea of introducing the necessary federal parkland  legislation.  </P> <P> Although there is no indication whatsoever that the federal government plans to  give up the base, home to about 38,000 troops, Bos said that "if some time down  the road it were to be closed, we should probably have it so designated" as  parkland.  </P> <P> Bates called the proposal "a great idea" and said he will support it. Bates  said he would defer to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose district includes  Camp Pendleton, to introduce a parkland-designation bill. But if Packard  declines, "I will be glad to introduce such legislation," Bates said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Packard said his office is aware of the proposal, has talked  briefly with Wilson's office about it and "we're interested in it." Packard  will probably have a more specific response in the next few weeks, after he has  studied the proposal, his spokesman said.  </P> <P> Response from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton was noncommittal. Camp  spokesman Lt. Col. John Shotwell said the Marines are also aware of the  proposal. "We're currently studying it to see if it would be appropriate to  take a stand on this issue if requested by congressional representatives."  Shotwell said the Marines "don't envision a time in which Camp Pendleton, with  its unique and ideal features for amphibious training, would not be vital to  this nation's national defense as a Marine Corps base."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Use by Marines  </P> <P> And that would be just fine with C-3 President Don Wood, who wrote the letters  to the senators and congressmen asking for the parkland designation. Wood said  he and C-3 support the use of Camp Pendleton by the Marines, as it ensures that  urban sprawl will not spill over from Orange County.  </P> <P> It is precisely because the government has no plans to close Camp Pendleton  that now is the best time to designate the property -- which contains  environmentally sensitive lands and is home to much wildlife and endangered  bird species -- as future federal parkland, Wood said.  </P> <P> "It doesn't cost anyone anything right now. It's a painless thing. Developers  don't have rights to it; there is no controversy about its development," Wood  said.  </P> <P> His organization points to the Presidio in San Francisco as an example of what  can be done. Several years ago, members of the Bay Area congressional  delegation introduced and helped pass a law to turn the Presidio, a historic  Army base on spectacular ocean-side property adjacent to the Golden Gate  Bridge, into parkland should the base ever close.  </P> <P> "Now the people of the area can look forward to the base being redeveloped into  public parkland," Wood said.  </P> <P> C-3 members fear that forces spurring rampant growth are so great in Southern  California that, in time, corridors between San Diego County and the counties  of Riverside and Orange will be a continuous swath of housing tracts and  commercial development.  </P> <P> "I don't think we want to be an integrated suburb of Los Angeles in which we  lose our identity as a separate community," Wood said. "Camp Pendleton provides  the perfect buffer."  </P> <P> What C-3 members fear is that unless Camp Pendleton is specifically protected  it will go the way of many other former military bases in San Diego County,  such as Camps Elliott, Kearny and Matthews. Those bases were turned into the  vast housing tracts known as Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch and Tierrasanta.  </P> <P> Because of that, Wood said, C-3 believes that local politicians would not be  able to resist the pressure to develop Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> "You can't trust local politicians to persevere against development pressures.  I think the record is clear on that point. You can't depend on the free market  to do it," Wood said.  </P> <P> For many years, developers and others have attempted to make inroads at Camp  Pendleton. The most recent proposal called for the construction of an airport  capable of meeting the future needs of both San Diego and Los Angeles. Like  most other plans for the Marine base, it quickly died. The Marines take such  proposed encroachments seriously and have an officer whose full-time job is to  counter such piecemeal efforts.  </P> <P> C-3 officials said the group's proposal would give the Marines an important  tool to fight off attempts to use the base for private development.  </P> <P> "This is the only thing we have left of this magnitude," Wood said. "We'll  never get anything like Camp Pendleton again."  </P></p>

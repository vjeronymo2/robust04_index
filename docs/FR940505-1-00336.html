These exempt compounds have been determined to have negligible photochemical reactivity. For purposes of determining compliance with emission limits, VOC will be measured by test methods given in this section. Where such a method also measures compounds with negligible photochemical reactivity, an owner or operator may exclude these negligibly reactive compounds when determining compliance with an emission standard. However, the U.S. EPA may require such owner or operator, as a precondition to excluding these compounds for purposes of determining compliance, to provide monitoring methods and monitoring results demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the U.S. EPA, the amount of negligibly reactive compounds in the source's emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Usage directions  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the text or graphics on the product's principal display panel, label, or accompanying literature which describes to the end user how and in what quantity the product is to be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wasp and hornet insecticide  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means any insecticide product that is designed for use against wasps, hornets, yellow jackets or bees by allowing the user to spray a high volume directed stream or burst from a safe distance at the intended pest or its hiding place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wax  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means a material or synthetic thermoplastic substance generally of high molecular weight hydrocarbons or high molecular weight esters of fatty acids or alcohols, except glycerol and high polymers (plastics).

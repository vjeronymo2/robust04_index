			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Mirko Tremaglia, chairman of the </F> Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, by  unidentified correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] "Fascism is dead. It is a 50-year-old piece of  history that is closed for ever. We do not call ourselves  neofascists, and we are against all forms of totalitarian  regime," said Mirko Tremaglia, who was elected chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Chamber of Deputies  last Wednesday [1 June]. His election gave rise to much  negative comment in the international press, and Tremaglia has  been branded a neofascist.    For 22 years he has been a popularly elected deputy for the  MSI, the Italian Social Movement. The MSI has always been  described as a neofascist party. Tremaglia has been a member  since the party's foundation. His party chairman, Gianfranco  Fini, does not talk about neofascism, but prefers the term  "postfascism." "Whatever that might be," Tremaglia said,  throwing his arms in the air. But "Mussolini belongs to  history," he told AFTENPOSTEN.    In the elections in March the MSI was the senior partner in  the National Alliance (AN), which in electoral cooperation with  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the  federalist Northern League under Umberto Bossi achieved a  landslide victory. The neofascists found themselves in a  position of power for the first time since the end of World War  II.    Tremaglia believes that corruption broke the back of the  Italian First Republic. Prime Minister Berlusconi's right-wing  coalition will give society the renewal that is needed. The AN  has its priorities clear:    "We are aiming at reforms in order to introduce a republic  with presidential rule in which a section of parliament is  reserved for political parties and another section is for  citizens. In the days of the First Republic we had no  representatives from that world," Tremaglia said.    When AFTENPOSTEN asked if this means that he is talking  about  the corporate state, he replied brusquely that "I have already  said what the AN stands for."    [AFTENPOSTEN] How long will the coalition government stay  together? Northern League leader Bossi did not even want to  acknowledge people from your party during the election campaign.    [Tremaglia] Yes, but now he is no longer saying no. Things  have changed. Now national interests have been given top  priority. It is important to have reforms implemented; to  create a republic with the involvement of those Italians who  work and produce things -- that is, the forces which have been  subordinate to the power of the politicians. This is something  which we now have to turn on its head," Tremaglia said with  Italian passion.    He also told AFTENPOSTEN about a meeting he had with  industrialists immediately before coming to Norway last Friday.  At the meeting there was a mood of support for the course he --  without wanting to use political labels -- is advocating.  "People no longer want to give carte blanche to the  politicians, but want to assume responsibility themselves and  attend to things political. This is `the new Italy.' This is  why Clinton is saying that people must give us a chance and  support us. People must be judged on what they do, not on the  basis of labels," Clinton has said.    "Since the MSI was founded in 1946 we have never had any  intention of rebuilding the fascist regime there was before.  Over the years the MSI has gained legitimacy through democratic  channels, through free elections," Tremaglia said.    He has been in Oslo for a meeting of NATO's parliamentary  assembly. He has been a member of this assembly since 1984, and  has had regular contacts with Norwegian politicians.    He also told AFTENPOSTEN with pride that he met the king  when  he was in Norway in 1987. "I have met many people over the  years and no one has objected to me. Now many people are  crying: `You were in the war. Fascist.' I was 17 then," the  67-year-old said resignedly. He believes that it is "the  crisis-hit Italian left" -- among others -- which is trying to  plant unfavorable allegations abroad about him and others from  the AN.    "Some people have said that it is strange that a person with  such a past can be elected chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee. What do people actually mean by this? I have never  done anything criminal. We will be asking for explanations of  such comments," said Tremaglia, who is happy that the chairman  of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee, Hakan Blankenborg,  has said that he does not want to be involved in any witch hunt  or any persecution of individuals.    He believes that the at times violent reactions from abroad  to what is being called the neofascists' entry into the  corridors of power are out of place. "We have been elected by  the Italian people in democratic elections, and do not have a  mandate from anyone else," he said. He is happy that Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino has made it clear both to French  President Francois Mitterrand and to others that Italy will not  have any interference or threats.    Tremaglia is not always as careful when he makes statements.  Last month he said that the Treaty of Osimo which fixes Italy's  borders with Yugoslavia should be torn up. Many took this to  mean that he wants a revision of the borders in order to regain  areas where people of Italian extraction live.    "We are not asking for any border changes. It would be  anachronistic to make such demands," he said emphatically. But  he also pointed to the Berlin Wall, the divided Germany, and to  the fact that no one thought that reunification would come,  given the situation.    [AFTENPOSTEN] What political "kin" do you feel your party  has  in Europe?    [Tremaglia] An important question for the future  . "The AN has received an envoy from (Jacques) Chirac's party,"  he said. He was hinting that the AN now feels at home in the  same pigeonhole as the French Gaullists.    Tremaglia simply laughed and shook his head when AFTENPOSTEN  asked whether the AN does not feel some kinship with Le Pen and  his racist French nationalists.    "The MSI has dissociated itself from the racist legislation  from Benito Mussolini's days."    AFTENPOSTEN reminded him that party chairman Fini has spoken  of Mussolini as the greatest statesman of our century. A  well-prepared Tremaglia trotted out two quotes from Britain's  wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill -- one from 1933 and  one from 1943 -- to show what respect Mussolini enjoyed. It was  clear from both quotes that Churchill believed that Mussolini  effectively and laudably saw to it that the Socialists and the  Bolsheviks were kept out of power.    The problems of the Mediterranean are also close to  Tremaglia's heart. He fears a serious crisis in the wake of the  "terrible immigration" from North Africa. That is why he is a  strong advocate of a 30-year plan for European investment in  North Africa, "instead of our taking in 20 million North  Africans. It is not right that people should have to move away  from their own countries to find work."</p>

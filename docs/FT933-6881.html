			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Prolonged pangs of a difficult birth: Martin Wolf asks whether the gestation of Emu is following the Maastricht timetable, or could delivery be easier? Is the European Community's project for economic and monetary union alive or did it die with the old exchange rate mechanism? The achievement of Emu is indeed doubtful, but not because of the change in the ERM, which is perfectly compatible with a move to Emu. The breakdown in the ERM matters more because of what it signifies. Ultimately, a move to Emu requires a political decision to forge a common monetary policy. The Maastricht treaty did not ensure that this decision would be taken. Events since then have cast serious doubt on whether the political will to do so exists. A monetary union could be forged tomorrow. All that would be needed is for the central banks of two or more EC member countries to make an open-ended commitment to support one another's currencies and, by implication, pursue a joint monetary policy. To the extent that investors would try to convert one money into another, the quantity of the weaker currency would shrink, while that of the stronger would grow. But aggregate money supply of the union would be unaffected. Since a central bank can always create its own currency without limit, such a union is secure, provided the mutual commitment remains in force. The difference between such an arrangement and the ERM is like that between chalk and cheese. With a limited commitment by the central bank responsible for the strongest currency, the cost of maintaining the weakest falls principally on those responsible for the weaker ones. To reinforce their exchange rates they must increase the cost of speculation, which also raises the costs on domestic borrowers. Since there is a limit to the monetary stringency political realities will allow, no narrow-band parity can be fully credible. An open-ended mutual commitment is not the only way, in principle, to ensure the main benefits of monetary union. One alternative would be a 19th-century gold standard; another would be a currency board, which is an obligation to convert foreign currency into its domestic equivalent at a fixed price. But the former was successful because it originated from the use of gold as domestic money, developed via a commitment to convertibility of paper money into gold and, above all, flourished when the political commitment to price stability was unquestioned. As for the latter, it demands a credible subordination of one country's money to another. That may be plausible for the Hong Kong dollar vis a vis the US dollar, it is not for the French franc vis a vis the D-mark. The EC, in short, cannot be a little bit pregnant with Emu. However protracted and complex the courtship, participants must achieve consummation, conception, pregnancy and birth at one specific moment. That moment need not be indicated in advance. But there must be a decisive shift from separate monies with separate monetary policies to a single monetary policy and perhaps a single currency. The apparent precision of the Maastricht treaty about how this is to happen is deceptive. In fact the treaty represented a series of awkward, probably unworkable, compromises: between the ostensible German willingness to accept the ultimate goal of Emu, if, like Saint Augustine, 'not yet', and the desire of the French to move as quickly as possible; between the need for universal participation and German suspicion of some participants, such as Italy; and between the desire to eliminate the Bundesbank's hegemony and its determination to preserve it as long as possible. To put off the evil day, while weeding out those deemed unworthy, the Germans insisted on tough convergence criteria; to ensure their happy day would come, the French and Italians obtained what looks like a binding 1999 deadline; to give hope to all who want to join Emu, the convergence criteria are ambiguous; and to give them still greater hope, the European Council is to decide whether a country meets the conditions on the basis of a qualified majority vote. It is difficult to imagine a treaty more conducive to mutual recrimination. The transition laid out in the treaty contained three principal elements: Convergence criteria on inflation, long-term interest rates, fiscal deficits, public debt and participation in the ERM; A time-table that is both long - up to six years - and inflexible; and A leap from the ERM to Emu managed by an untried and as yet non-existent institution. The most problematic of these is the first, not merely in light of events, but even in principle. The convergence criteria neither make much sense in themselves, nor, at least as important, help Germany to include those it wants to include and exclude those it wants to exclude. They do not, in other words, help to solve the fundamental political challenge posed by the move to Emu. The criteria in the treaty were that a country shall possess: A currency that 'shall have respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the ERM of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination'; 'An average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage point that of, at most, the three best-performing member states in terms of price stability'; An average rate of inflation that 'does not exceed by more than 1 1/2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member states'; and A sustainable government financial position. This is defined, first by 'whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds' 3 per cent, 'unless either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to' 3 per cent or 'the excess . . . is only exceptional and temporary'; and, second, by 'whether the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeeds 60 per cent, 'unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching' 60 per cent 'at a satisfactory pace'. Is the fate of Europe to hang on such obscurities? Consider just a few of the problems. The interest rate criterion is not independent, since it will be met if Emu itself is credible. Meanwhile, the inflation criterion is merely a relative, not an absolute, one; and assessment of whether or not it has been achieved is not to be qualified by economic performance. Most important, however, are the fiscal tests, the ones being most comprehensively violated at the moment (see chart). These tests, too, have only limited logic behind them. Above all, as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, has realised, they do not differentiate satisfactorily between countries the Germans might accept inside Emu and those they would not. If Belgium, for example, were to be included, despite its fiscal policy failure, how could Spain be excluded, just because it failed some other test? These defects in the criteria are a matter of some importance. This is not because successful passing of the tests is a necessary or sufficient condition for a workable Emu. On the contrary, some seem irrelevant, even perverse. The limitation on fiscal deficits in a monetary union with exiguous fiscal transfers seems particularly inappropriate. Interestingly, almost the only criterion that might make sense - the limit on fiscal debt - is the one over which Mr Schlesinger has indicated greatest flexibility. The explanation for this must be political, since the insolvency of a member state might indeed imperil the European Central Bank's independence. The reason the defects matter is rather different. The tests are essentially an initiation ritual. Applicants for Emu are required to show how committed to monetary stability they are. The problem is that it may prove impossible to agree on who will have passed, unless, as now seems rather probable, everyone is agreed to have failed. The collapse of the old ERM does not change much directly. On the contrary, it would almost certainly be easier to meet the ERM criterion with 15 per cent bands, if these became 'the normal fluctuation margins', than with the 2 1/4 per cent bands, which were deemed normal before. What the collapse of the ERM shows is that the initiation itself has been too hard. This undermines mutual trust and shakes the political commitment to Emu. For this, there have been two reasons. The first is that the institution in charge of this rite of passage has an incentive to ensure everyone fails. The second is that German unification has given the Bundesbank the opportunity, almost the obligation, to pursue policies likely to ensure they all do. Ironically, German unification was both a spur for the Maastricht treaty and the main reason why it will not be achieved in the way once assumed. Unification disrupted the ERM by giving the anchor country relatively high inflation, which drove real short-term interest rates to intolerable levels elsewhere in the ERM. Unification also demanded a short-term real appreciation of the D-Mark, in order to transfer resources from the current account surplus into eastern Germany. In a fixed exchange rate regime, the needed appreciation could only be achieved by higher inflation in Germany than elsewhere, which, given the Bundesbank's objectives, also imposed a fierce disinflation on Germany's partner countries. Finally, that pressure also created the vicious circle of speculation, higher interest rates and still more speculation which dissolved the old ERM. What are the alternatives now? One possibility would be to press on regardless. Participants might hope that the problem posed by German unification is now slowly passing, as interest rates fall and the D-Mark depreciates against the dollar, the yen and even the currencies of other EC member states. It would then be possible either to move back into narrow bands, however tentatively, or, more sensibly, to leave the ERM as it is until the move to Emu. Presumably, the failure to meet the fiscal criteria would be judged with the benevolence implied by the treaty's ambiguities. A second option would be to accept that the political will to make this transition is lacking. Emu entails a high degree of mutual trust. While the move to Emu could indeed continue more or less as planned, at least on paper, the political committment to it must be doubted. This is not just a matter of the difficult passage of the treaty in many member countries, though that is revealing. Nor is it a question of the lack of enthusiasm of the Germans, important though that must be. The most significant point is that the Bundesbank policies which disrupted the ERM were pursued, without serious internal protest, on the basis of that institution's debatably extreme view of German monetary and economic developments. Never mind Mr Kohl's pro-European rhetoric. Never mind Germany's ostensible commitment to the ambiguous Maastricht treaty. Just look at the reality of German fiscal and monetary policies. A third option then would be to force the issue. Those who do trust one another (if any) could make the needed mutual commitment now. There is nothing to suggest the decision would be any easier in 1997 or 1999. Worst of all, if member states just stagger on, pretending to try to achieve these criteria, the political and economic costs for Europe could prove prohibitive. Whatever the economic advisability of Emu itself, it must be senseless to spend six years, perhaps more, subordinating everything to that aim within a recession-mired, high-unemployment EC economy. Emu requires the making of an irrevocable decision. The Maastricht treaty appeared to mean that the decision had already been made. But this was deceptive. Those countries that could plausibly share a successful Emu - a far smaller number than the 12, both now and for the foreseeable future - should either take the leap or shelve the idea. If this marriage is to happen at all, it should be made now.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The ERM dissolves  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -1962:  European Commission sets out goal of Emu  -1970:  Werner plan aim of Emu by 1980  -1973:  Final break-up of Bretton Woods system  -1979:  European Monetary System (EMS) starts  -1987:  European Single Act takes effect, laying down goal of Emu.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Observer: Picking a new president Among the many European decisions that John Major has to make over the next few months, picking the next president of the European Investment Bank is unlikely to be high on his agenda. But it would be a pity if the job falls into the hands of another faceless bureaucrat. After all, it is not every year that Britain gets to choose the boss of a leading international financial institution. And since an Italian, Frenchman and a German have done the EIB job, it is about time that the controls of the biggest borrower in the Euromarkets were handed over to someone who knows what it's like to be heavily in debt. Ernst-Gunther Broder, who took over the EIB presidency from Yves Le Port in 1984, has turned 65 and wants to go as soon as a successor is found. The front-runner is Sir Brian Unwin, 57, chairman of Britain's Customs and Excise. He's worked in the Foreign Office and the Treasury, but he doesn't have Broder's private-sector experience. No doubt he is an excellent administrator but perhaps the EIB could do with someone with a bit more charisma. The Americans picked one of their best bankers, J P Morgan's Lew Preston, to head the World Bank, and the French chose a man of ideas, Jacques Attali, to run the EBRD. How about ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock? It would be a nice consolation prize for not getting the EC commissioner's job and he would certainly raise the EIB's profile.</p>

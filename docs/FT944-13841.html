			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / London-wide co-ordination of buses urged Some central control of London's buses will still be needed after privatisation to ensure that they continue to provide an efficient service, the Chartered Institute of Transport said yesterday. The institute, which represents people working in the transport sector, said in a report that priority measures such as special bus lanes would need to be co-ordinated on a London-wide basis by local authorities and the bus companies. There would also be a pivotal role for London Transport in setting standards for infrastructure such as stations, stops and shelters, in providing passenger information, and supervising ticketing arrangements which allow passengers to make journeys on buses owned by different companies. Six of the 10 companies which make up London Buses have been sold in the past two months. Completion of privatisation is expected before the end of the year. The institute said local authorities should adopt traffic schemes which gave priority to buses. This would increase bus use, reduce congestion and cut environmental pollution. It urged the government to modify the system of tendering for bus contracts. When an existing operator lost a contract it could face large redundancy costs. The institute suggested that 'some marginal preference' for existing operators could provide for greater continuity without discouraging competitive bids for routes. Whither the Clapham Omnibus.

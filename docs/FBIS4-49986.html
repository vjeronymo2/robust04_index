			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Cutting Off Oxygen"] </F>   [Text] Information is the oxygen of financial markets.  Reduce the flow, and they slow down. Cut it off, and they die.  This is a truism with which those who govern China's still  young markets were becoming very familiar.    But there is a now real concern that press activity in China  is becoming much more regulated since the Xi Yang imprisonment,  and the outspoken reaction which followed in Hong Kong. Threats  of boycotts have been responded to with threats of exclusion.  In this sort of game there are no winners. If it escalates,  one of the losers will be the ambition of China to see its big  companies comfortably listed and traded on foreign stock markets.    So it was an ominous development when journalists from Hong  Kong attending a Beijing conference on the coming international  listing of 22 mainland enterprises, organised by the China  Securities Regulatory Commission, found themselves under  apparent threat.    The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office told the organisers  that those reporters who were not fully accredited through  Xinhua (the New China News Agency) might be regarded as  unwelcome guests, even though they had been formally invited by  the organisers. Given the current atmosphere, prudent  newspapers recalled their reporters.    The Hong Kong journalists' anger was legitimate when the  organisers said foreign journalists had not been formally  invited to report on the symposium. It was the second time in a  week that Beijing had played it tough with journalists covering  events on the mainland.    The result was that valuable information and interpretation  of the programme for floating these companies was lost to the  international investment field. Beijing has hurt, rather than  helped, these firms by excluding the Hong Kong media from  covering the event.    Instead of making journalists nervous about covering the  plans for the corporatisation of China, the authorities should  be looking at the role that the press plays in financial  markets. There is an enormous demand from investors, both  professional and private, for information about markets and  companies. This is especially true of emerging markets, which  are far from transparent.    Official statements, and even brokers' circulars, are only  part of the information dissemination system. The press plays  the bigger role of offering impartial reporting and analysis,  which for many potential investors is the preferred source of  information.    This is recognised by many mainland companies (and many  government officials) who welcome journalists to their plants  and offices to explain their businesses and outline their plans.    The regular conferences and symposiums held inside China are  valuable sources of quality information about corporate  developments. If China were to silence this essential dialogue  it would quickly be noticed by the international investment  community. No newspaper would be so arrogant as to claim that  this would lead to a total investment drought, but it would  undoubtedly add an item to the minus column of investors  calculating their portfolio strategies.    It is in China's interest for Beijing to loosen the Hong  Kong  media's activities in the mainland -- not tighten them.</p>

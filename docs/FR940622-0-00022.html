			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 9122 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, all Medicare hospitals are now required, beginning January 1987, to participate in CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA as authorized providers (that is, they must bill CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA and accept the CHAMPVA/CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount as payment in full, less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Broadly speaking, a veteran can only receive services from a non-VA hospital for a service-connected disability when there is a medical emergency or when a VA facility is not available. In such cases, the VA in the past paid for the services based on usual and customary charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As this type of payment is more expensive than payment made on a prospective basis or based on reasonable costs, the VA has implemented a national prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To alleviate hospital expenses for the VA, Congress passed section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act of 1986  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pub. L. 99&hyph;576). This section requires Medicare hospitals to be participating providers of medical care to veterans eligible to receive care at the hospital. The hospital then receives payment for the services under the applicable VA payment system, in accord with the recent regulations concerning the payment methodology and amounts that the VA provides for those hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital care to veterans whose care has been authorized or will be sponsored by the VA (55 FR 42848). This rule was developed jointly by VA and HHS, and the VA payment system conforms to Medicare's hospital inpatient prospective payment system in most cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the prospective payment system became effective for the Medicare program, we began to hear allegations that Medicare beneficiaries were discharged too early from the hospital. We also began to receive complaints that patients did not understand their rights as Medicare beneficiaries in cases in which they were advised that discharge was appropriate but they disagreed. On April 17, 1985, we revised 42 CFR 466.78(b)(3) to require all hospitals to provide Medicare beneficiaries with information about Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) review, including beneficiary appeal rights (50 FR 15331). In further response to concerns about early discharges and lack of adequate appeal information, we began requiring all hospitals to furnish each Medicare beneficiary upon admission a specific statement developed by HCFA (that is, ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (see Appendix I)) telling a beneficiary of his or her rights to be fully informed about decisions affecting Medicare coverage or payment and about his or her appeal rights in response to any hospital's notice to the effect that Medicare will no longer cover the care. The ``Message'' we developed also advises the patient of what to do when he or she receives such a hospital statement and how to elicit more information. The requirements relating to ``An Important Message from Medicare'' were incorporated into the program's operating instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress subsequently passed section 9305(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 86). Now, as part of its participation agreement with Medicare, each hospital (including those not paid under the prospective payment system) must agree to furnish each Medicare beneficiary with a notice, at or about the time of admission, that explains the patient's rights in detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

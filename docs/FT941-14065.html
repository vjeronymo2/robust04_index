			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Domestic investors drive markets Turnover in the leading European equity markets accelerated in December as share prices were driven higher by investors hoping for lower interest rates in the new year. Trading volume rose 12.2 per cent after increases of 2.9 per cent in November and 10.1 per cent in October. The strong December rise accompanied an 8.2 per cent gain in the FT-A Europe index as all eight markets rallied on hopes of a further cut in German interest rates. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities comments that it was a fitting end to a year in which turnover in the markets rose by 40.3 per cent over 1992 as the FT-A Europe index rose 32.2 per cent. Excluding the UK, turnover was up by 50.3 per cent and the index put on 39.9 per cent. However, turnover in European stocks traded during December on Seaq International, the London screen-based system, fell by 2 per cent on the month. 'This contrast to strong volume growth in domestic markets suggests that the strength of equities is increasingly being driven less by international buying and more by the flow of funds from domestic investors drawing down bank accounts and money market funds as interest rates fall,' says Mr Cornish. During December, international institutional investors were still heavily committed to the south east Asian region, where huge rises were seen during the final quarter of last year after US and Japanese banks and brokers pointed to their potential. Events during December could point to volatility in the European markets in the months ahead. 'Continuing heavy flows of domestic money into the markets as interest rates come down further could make foreign investors even more reluctant to return as valuations climb,' says Mr Cornish. 'The result could be a broad correction, perhaps during the summer, as private investors, unnerved by markets that are not rising any further, decide to pull their money out.' Germany recorded the month's biggest gain, with turnover up 18.6 per cent to levels surpassing the previous record set in March 1990, although that peak immediately preceded a sharp correction after the unification euphoria. The market was buoyed during last month by a stream of corporate news and results which took the Dax index to a series of record highs. Speculation, in the event ill-founded, about rate cuts ahead of the month's Bundesbank council meetings, also played a part. Italian turnover surged 17.9 per cent on the month, representing a 12.3 per cent rise over the average for the previous three months, as investors recovered their confidence after the surprise rout of centre parties in November's local elections. The pick-up also accompanied signs that the budget was winning a broad measure of support in parliament and strong demand for privatisation candidates. In the Netherlands, turnover fell 6.6 per cent, although this was still 7 per cent higher than the average for the previous three months. Spain's 7.3 per cent decline came as little surprise after November's record level, and turnover was still 20.8 per cent higher than the average of the previous three months.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                Sep       Oct        Nov        Dec       US                      1993      1993       1993       1993   Dollars bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium             86.99     77.87      78.39      91.60      2.53 France             184.37    201.93     191.05     218.65     37.03 Germany            150.42    183.24     177.99     211.05    121.57 Italy            44,009.6    31,410   35,092.8  41,385.60     24.18 Netherlands         18.90     25.10      27.20      25.40     13.08 Spain              825.61  1,042.89    1,384.6    1,267.5      8.87 Switzerland         19.80     28.30      29.60      31.30     21.09 UK                  49.82     49.32      52.61      55.79     82.62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Italian data adjusted to include off-market trading.

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / High-tech group to create 175 jobs CONTROL Techniques, designer and producer of electronic drives and controls, announced yesterday that it intends to expand research and production facilities at its headquarters in Newton, West Glamorgan, creating 175 jobs, Alan Cane writes. The Development Board for Wales is spending Pounds 8.5m to build premises which will be leased by Control Techniques - a 60,000 sq ft extension to the company's existing premises to house a printed circuit board plant and an automated factory, and a 25,000 sq ft research and development headquarters. The announcement was made by Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary. The company is to invest Pounds 4m in fittings and equipment. Mr Trevor Wheatley, Control Techniques chairman, said that sites in the US, Italy and Asia Pacific had been considered but the development board's proposal was both attractive and acceptable. Control Techniques makes drives and control mechanisms for a range of electric motors. Its products are used by AEG, Molins and Simon Engineering among others. Last year the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m on sales of Pounds 88m. Analysts expect pre-tax profits this year to be as much as Pounds 9m.</p>

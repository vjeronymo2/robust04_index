			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["kr"-signed report: "Capital Yield Tax Brings Less Than </F> Expected"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 18 January -- The Bundesbank says  in its latest monthly report that monetary conditions will not  prevent an unexpected extensive economic recovery. It promises  again to cautiously explore the scope of action for interest  rate policy moves. It resolutely rejects forced interest rate  cuts to boost the economic cycle, and refuses, equally  resolutely, to solve Germany's economic problems through a  devaluation of the German mark by means of lower interest rates.    The Bundesbank says in its report that it remains the most  important monetary policy task to return to price stability. It  stresses that this would also provide a basis for lasting growth  and would be a contribution to the safeguarding of Germany's  economic base. To make it successful, however, it must be  supported by a moderate wage policy and by an economic and  financial policy seeking stable framework conditions. The  Bundesbank believes that the money supply target for 1994, which  has been set at between 4 and 6 percent, can be reached.    In its monthly report, the Bundesbank also examines the  question of how German savers have reacted to the capital yield  tax. Before the new tax was introduced, there were massive  evasion reactions and "evasion deals" through financial centers  in the neighbor countries. Unlike the "withholding tax" of 1989,  however, most of them were not accompanied by definitive capital  outflows.    In view of no more than 11 (as against an estimated 24)  billion German marks in gross earnings from the capital yield  tax, the Bundesbank criticizes the federal finance minister for  having underestimated the extent of the evasion reaction. It  admits, however, that probably only the smaller part of the  deficit can be explained by tax evasion abroad. The wrong  forecast has above all something to do with the applications for  tax exemption by which a larger part of the income was exempted  from tax than originally expected. Another factor is the  extensive decline in the average yield since the spring of 1992.    According to the Bundesbank, the largest vehicle by far for  portfolio shifts are foreign investment funds. The second most  important "evasion instrument" were investments in the  Euromarket.</p>

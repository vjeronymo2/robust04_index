			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Magistrate quits over interference Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate, resigned yesterday in protest over increasing interference by the Berlusconi government in the Milan judiciary. His resignation raised the temperature of the long-running confrontation between Milan magistrates and the right-wing coalition. The value of shares on the Milan stock exchange fell 2.3 per cent amid fears of increased political uncertainty and the lira slipped to near-record lows against the D-Mark. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sought to play down the resignation, praising the man he asked six months ago to be a cabinet minister. He said Mr Di Pietro's decision 'leaves a bitter taste in the mouth'. But opposition politicians voiced alarm over the future of the 'clean hands' investigations that have been spearheaded by Mr Di Pietro since February 1992. Mr Massimo D'Alema, leader of the party of the Democratic Left, former communists, said: 'We can't but see a link between this resignation - a source of bitterness to us and millions of citizens - and the increasingly vicious assault directed against the magistrature in recent months.' Mr Di Pietro announced his resignation in an emotional letter to Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the chief Milan public prosecutor, who has co-ordinated the past 2 1/2 years of corruption investigations. Mr Borrelli subsequently confirmed the resignation, suggesting that Mr Di Pietro was unlikely in spite of pressure, to change his mind. He also gave a strong political twist to Mr Di Pietro's move, attacking the government for mounting a campaign of hostility against the magistrature and warning that the corruption investigations would continue. In his letter Mr Di Pietro placed more emphasis on his exasperation over the high-profile role he had been forced to play. 'Whatever I do, my duties as a magistrate seem to be interpreted as a personal competition,' he said. 'I refer in particular to the numerous recent demonstrations in the piazzas which, whether for or against the group (of anti-corruption magistrates), have viciously personalised my role to a point where my each and every judicial action is interpreted for or against someone.' Mr Di Pietro said he hoped his resignation would help to depersonalise the judicial inquiries. A Milan court yesterday sentenced ex-prime minister Bettino Craxi in his absence to 5 1/2 years in jail for corruption. All 12 defendants were found guilty over payments the prosecution said were made by insurance company SAI for contracts with Eni, the state energy group. Mr Craxi, who lives in Tunisia and claims to be too ill to return to Italy, was also sentenced to 8 1/2 years in July for fraudulent bankruptcy. Currencies, Page 40 Stock prices, Page 47</p>

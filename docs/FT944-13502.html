			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Stanhope to show positive assets Stanhope, the property development company which is in last-ditch refinancing negotiations with its banks, is expected to return to positive net assets when it announces full-year results. Such a result would strengthen the company's position as it searches for a partner willing to inject up to Pounds 100m of equity on terms that will satisfy banks owed Pounds 140m. A refinancing must be agreed if its syndicate of 16 lending banks, led by Barclays, are to extend credit lines beyond December 19. Stanhope's main assets are held in its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. Broadgate Properties' results, which are due to be published today, are expected to show a rise in net assets, including loans from shareholders, to more than Pounds 230m, from Pounds 148m last year. Analysts estimated yesterday that this would be enough to lift Stanhope into a position of positive net assets, even though some of its investments - notably its joint venture development with Trafalgar House in Chiswick - may have fallen in value. Last published figures showed that Stanhope had negative net assets of Pounds 15.7m at June 30 1993. While a large rise in the value of Broadgate would be encouraging for Stanhope, Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive, is still searching for an investor willing to make the necessary cash injection. Earlier this month the company issued a statement which said that potential rescuers were unlikely to match the prevailing 29p share price. Yesterday the shares closed at 12p. British Land, the investment company run by Mr John Ritblat which bought a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope in February, has made no secret of its willingness to step in. But Mr Ritblat's main interest is acquiring Broadgate, which Stanhope is reluctant to sell while the property market is moving in its favour. A forecast commissioned by Stanhope from Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, suggested that Broadgate Properties' assets could be worth anything up to Pounds 1.3bn in three years time, against an estimated Pounds 1bn today. If the banks believe such figures they may agree that selling 50 per cent of Broadgate now would not be the best way of realising value from one of the City's best office developments. Others understood to be interested in investing in Stanhope on the right terms include Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which both run substantial property funds.</p>

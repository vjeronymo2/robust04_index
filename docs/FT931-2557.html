			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Three Chinese newspapers say they believe China's explanation of Anglo-Chinese row The Oriental Daily, Hong Kong's biggest selling newspaper, Tin Tin Daily, the colony's No 3 daily, and the Economic Times, one of the two business papers, said yesterday they believed China's explanation of the present Anglo-Chinese row and not that of Mr Chris Patten, the governor, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong. Between them the three newspapers sell about 700,000 copies a day. The Economic Times said it was 'convinced' that the explanation of recent events given by Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, was correct. Most newspaper commentaries since last Friday have refused to support the governor in what he describes as his 'principled' stand that talks between Britain and China could not proceed if Hong Kong officials were not full members of the UK negotiating team.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Companies may have to review internal controls COMPANIES WOULD be required to provide a statement in their annual accounts describing any significant weaknesses in their internal financial control systems, under strongly-worded proposals issued yesterday. They would be required to attempt to quantify the weaknesses and describe corrective action, according to draft guidelines developed following recommendations of last December's Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance. The 66-page document, drafted by a working party under the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is likely to prove highly controversial and provoke substantial opposition from companies which feel the guidelines are too detailed and impractical. Many smaller companies are concerned because they do not have strong formalised internal control systems and the requirements could impose considerable extra costs. The guidelines do provide some concessions for smaller businesses. The proposals are open for consultation until February 28 next year, and are likely to be subject to considerable delays before becoming mandatory. KPMG Peat Marwick and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, two of the UK's largest accounting companies,yesterday welcomed the statement, as did the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland which has called for greater emphasis on internal controls. But the Institute of Internal Auditors criticised the guidelines for not requiring directors to provide more detailed information on other aspects of their companies' operations.

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COIN WASHING MACHINE BY ANY OTHER NAME  </P> <P> Although many people use the word "Laundromat" to generically refer to  coin-operated laundries, the first washing machine for public use was actually  called a "Washateria."  </P> <P> An enterprising entrepreneur named J.F. Cantrell opened the first Washateria in  Ft. Worth, Tex., on April 18, 1934, according to the book "Famous First Facts."  </P> <P> The facility had four electric washing machines that customers could rent by  the hour. Hot water and electricity were supplied, but users were obliged to  bring their own soap.  </P> <P> The name "Laundromat" was first registered as a goods and services trademark by  Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1940. White Consolidated Industries Inc.  acquired the trademark in 1975 when it purchased the major-appliance division  of Westinghouse.  </P> <P> But White Consolidated, a Cleveland-based industrial and consumer products  company, stopped making commercial laundry equipment about two years ago and no  longer builds coin-operated laundries or markets commercial washers or dryers,  according to H. Ted Fritz, vice president of Westinghouse brand management.  </P> <P> Westinghouse dropped out of the commercial laundry business, Fritz said, after  Maytag and Speedqueen began to dominate the industry in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Today the trademark name "Laundromat" is only being used on a new line of  consumer laundry equipment, Fritz said. However, he noted, White Consolidated  still has a European subsidiary making commercial laundry equipment, and White  Consolidated has not ruled out the possibility of one day re-entering the  commercial coin-operated laundry business.  </P></p>

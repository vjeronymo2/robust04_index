			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--The Director of the  Financial Research Institute under the People's Bank of China,  Mr Qin Chijiang, said that enterprises should turn the pressure  resulted from the financial reform in the country into a driving  force for changing their operational mechanism in ten ways.    First, they should realize a change of their property rights  system, enabling themselves adapted to new practices required by  a commercialized bank system.    Second, their industrial structure should be re-adjusted  because commercial banks will examine the assets structure of a  particular enterprise and confirm its payment ability when  offering loans to it.    Third, their debt structure should also be regulated and  their money-raising should be conducted in multi-ways. They  should not entirely rely on bank loans.    Fourth, they should have flexible policies for their  funding.  Their equipment and other goods and materials unsuitable for  their use should be sold out. Their technological achievements  can also be transferred with pay to other entities.    Fifth, their fund-accumulating mechanism must be  re-adjusted.  Enterprises in Japan are practicing a high depreciation rate  system and they realize renewal of their property through  depreciation to promote their development. China's enterprises  should learn from them to raise depreciation rate through  reducing their profits.    Sixth, their organization structure should become more  adaptable.    Seventh, their accounting system should be reformed and  their  accounts should be made open. They should practice a  shareholding system.    Eighth, they must get more information and their sources of  information should not only rely on government departments but  should be gained through more channels.    Ninth, their trust for funding should be raised. They must  keep their promises in payment of debt.    Tenth, their risk sense must be enhanced. They must pay much  attention to risks from foreign debts, exchange rates and  interests rates, besides that from their production.</p>

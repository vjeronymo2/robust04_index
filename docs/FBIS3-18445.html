The talks  between the two men lasted 20 minutes. Mr. Aristide said that  he was "very satisfied" with the attitude adopted by France,  which promised, according to him, that it would "not support" a  new plan backed by Washington for the settlement of the crisis  in Haiti. This plan provides for the anticipated retirement of  General Raoul Cedras, Haitian Armed Forces chief of staff, and  the creation of a new government, but does not guarantee the  return of President Aristide.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hungary awards phone contracts Alcatel, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, US Telecom East and other foreign telecom providers are among the winners of eastern Europe's first tender to operate local telephone services, Hungary announced yesterday. The telecommunications ministry said the auction of the eight-year exclusive local concessions had raised Ft8.2bn (Dollars 80m). Foreign-led consortia won in 15 of Hungary's 54 telephone districts, committing themselves to invest Ft20bn in the first three years alone. Bidders committed themselves to increasing line density by 15.5 per cent a year and promised that by 1997 users would not have to wait more than a year for a line. CGE, the French public utility group, paid the highest single fee, of Ft1.3bn, for the rights to Szeged, the largest city in south-eastern Hungary, and won one other district. United Telecom Services - a partnership of French telecoms equipment maker Alcatel and US Telecom East, a local telecommunications operator based in the US - was the winner in four areas. Central Euro Telecom and Hungarian Telephone &amp; Cable Corporation, both US-led consortia, won two districts each. The capital, Budapest, and 38 other districts are retained by Matav, the national telecommunications operator, in which Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US took a stake of 30 per cent for Dollars 875m in December. The tender is an element of Hungary's relatively liberal line in telecoms policy. Allowing separate local and national providers of telephone services, the pattern in the US, is unusual in western Europe. The telecommunications ministry also said it would be prepared to grant licences for local telephone operators to provide cable television services in parallel. Hungary would be one of few countries where the barrier between telecommunications and television has been breached.</p>

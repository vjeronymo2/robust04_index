			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: COVINA;  </P> <P> MALL DEVELOPER WINS DELAY  </P> <P> The City Council has given the developer of Covina Town Square Shopping Center,  Alexander Haagen Development Co., until next June to file the final tract map  of the project.  </P> <P> The slightly modified map the City Council approved Monday divides the 36-acre  property on North Azusa Avenue into 14 lots. When the project is completed in  about a year and a half, 13 main buildings housing either retail shops or  department stores will stand on individual lots, and a 14th lot would include  common areas and an existing Sears store.  </P> <P> The subdivision of the property is important to simplify financing of the  development and the sale or lease of separate portions of the complex, Planner  Hal Ledford said. He added that the city encouraged the project partly because  of fears that Sears might move, if improvements were not made.  </P> <P> A tentative map with the site divided into eight instead of 14 lots was  approved by the council in 1987, but that approval was good for only two years.  The developers have until June, 1990, to file a final map with the county,  Assistant Planner Shelby Williams said.  </P></p>

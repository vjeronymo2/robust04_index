			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "eb": "For Extraordinary Situations; Slovakia, </F> Too, Has a State Material Reserves Administration"]    [Text] Bratislava--One of the central bodies of state  administration that had to be established in the independent  Slovak Republic following the partition of the CSFR is the State  Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) of the Slovak Republic,  the founder of which is the government. The Administration is  made up of eight organizational units, four warehouses, and EAN  [European Article Numbering] Slovakia, a budget-funded  organization. The SSHR employs 200 people.    As SSHR Chairman Peter Ryska stressed at a news conference  yesterday, it is not necessary to keep the SSHR's existence and  operations secret, as was the case until recently. Quite the  contrary, citizens should know that there exists a state agency,  whose objective it is, in cooperation with individual government  departments (economy, health care, transportation, and so  forth), to secure an adequate level of supplies in order to  ensure the operation of the economy and to supply the population  with vital basic provisions in extraordinary situations (natural  disasters, epidemics, local conflicts, and the like). The state  material reserves consist of several thousand items, among which  are, for example, fuels, cereals, pharmaceuticals, staple foods,  industrial raw materials, and nonferrous metals. Essential food  reserves are generated so as to last 10 days and fuel reserves  so as to last up to 40 days. As transpired from SSHR Chairman  Peter Ryska's words, however, even this specific agency must  today contend with a deficit, which amounts to 200 million  korunas. With respect to some items, the SSHR's budget does not  reach even 50 percent of the 1993 level.    The SSHR regards as its priorities this year the approval of  the bill on state material reserves and the passage of the law  on mandatory reserves of oil, oil products, and the distribution  system. The task for the next few years will be to follow the  example of advanced countries and to transfer the burden for  generating material reserves from the state to producers and  retailers and, with respect to specific reserves, such as staple  foods, for example, to the population.</p>

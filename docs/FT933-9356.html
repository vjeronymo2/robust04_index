			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Unisys president quits in shake-up UNISYS, the US-based mainframe computer company which broke back into profit last year, yesterday announced an organisational shake-up to give more autonomy to its two fastest-growing business units. The shake-up also resulted in the resignation of Mr Reto Braun, president and chief operating officer. Mr James Unruh, chairman, said: 'The intention was to flatten the corporate structure. We eliminated the need for a chief operating officer function.' The two businesses being given greater operational freedom cover consulting services, and the provision of open systems. Together, they accounted for 29 per cent of the company's Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) sales in 1992. 'We're trying to achieve the advantages specialised companies have, without losing the advantages of economy of scale and the breadth of market of large companies,' Mr Unruh said. He added that the move was not a prelude to the eventual hiving-off of the two units, though he added: 'Ten years from now, the company will no doubt look very different.' The two units will have full control over their businesses, and will have their own dedicated sales forces around the world. Unisys also said that its business was being regrouped into three broad divisions. These cover government systems, combining the former government and defence systems groups; information services and systems, which includes the three sales groups around the world and four product groups aimed at different industry sectors; and computer systems, which would continue to act as the mainframe manufacturing arm. With the departure of Mr Braun, Mr Unruh said he was taking day-to-day control of the information group, the largest of the three. Unisys, created by the merger of the Burroughs and Sperry mainframe computer businesses in 1986, experienced heavy losses from 1988 to 1991. Cost-cutting had taken 'at least Dollars 1bn' out of the company's cost base since then, Mr Unruh said. He called yesterday's changes the second phase of Unisys's rehabilitation, designed to boost income by making it more responsive to market developments. In a separate announcement, Moore Corporation, a Toronto-based business form group, said that Mr Braun would be joining as chief executive at the beginning of September.</p>

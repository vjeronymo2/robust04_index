			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The 1st Corps Information Service reports that  artillery shells fired from Chetnik positions at parts of the  defense lines suggest that today too will probably see the  aggressor using all available means to enter the city.    This morning, an all-out artillery barrage is being directed  at the region in and around Zuc, which the [Serbian] aggressor  is targeting with howitzers, tanks, mortars, and other heavy  artillery from several positions. The residential areas in the  northwestern part of the city have also been targeted, while  shells carrying chemical charges have landed on Glavica.    Everything points to the fact that infantry attacks could  follow, so citizens are warned to restrict (?their movements).  The general alarm has been sounded and citizens are asked to  exercise maximum caution.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 While campaigning to convince the new legislature of the value of  Russian accession to NATO's Partnership for Peace, Russian  government officials continue to portray the program as merely an  interim step toward broader European security measures that will  provide prominent status for Russia.  Influential members of the  Duma, on the other hand, are taking a skeptical attitude,  expressing concern that the terms of Russia's association with  NATO will be dictated, rather than negotiated, and will harm  Russia's security interests.  Although the Defense Ministry  newspaper has supported joining the program, other media  commentary across the political spectrum appears to reflect  nationalistic fears that Russian interests will be damaged  whether or not it joins the Partnership.                             END SUMMARY      Testifying at 16-17 March Duma hearings, government officials  promoted accession to the NATO Partnership for Peace program,  arguing that Russia will gain influence by joining but risks  isolation if it does not.  Yuriy Nazarkin, head of the  coordination and interaction department of the Security Council's  staff; Yuriy Ushakov, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'  (MFA) Department for European Cooperation; and Major General  Pavel Zolotarev from the Defense Ministry all stressed that to  "disregard" Partnership for Peace would mean a disastrous self-  isolation that would damage Russia's security.  Nazarkin and  Ushakov warned that refusing to join would strengthen those who  were pushing for NATO expansion and argued that in joining Russia  could influence the program (Interfax, 17 March).   In  enumerating a long list of membership advantages, Zolotarev  contended that by joining Russia would demonstrate to the world  its interest in collective security and "neutralize" the anti-  Russian forces that are seeking to exclude Russia from the  international arena (Krasnaya Zvezda, 18 March).   Moscow's Mixed Signals      Despite this supportive testimony and Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev's statement that Russia would join the program soon,  other signals from the government suggest that it is unsure about  how fast to move ahead.  After his 17 March meeting with U.S.  Defense Secretary William Perry, Grachev told reporters that  "groups of experts" are "already completing work" on Russia's  membership application, adding optimistically that "we shall be  able to join the concept by the end of the month" (ITAR-TASS, 17  March).  More cautiously, however, First Deputy Defense Minister  Andrey Kokoshin said it was "too early" to discuss when Russia  would sign on to the program (Interfax, 18 March).  A 19 March  Nezavisimaya Gazeta article, discounting speculation that Grachev  meant that Russia would "definitely" sign in March, cited a  Foreign Ministry "clarification" that the signing might take  place in late March or more likely later.  The article attributed  the delay to the need to finish drafting the documents, "wind up  interdepartmental consultations," and "solve a number of  technical problems"--including who would sign, Grachev or Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev.      In addition, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other senior  officials have continued to express reservations about the  program--particularly its implications for NATO expansion--and to  press for movement toward alternative European security measures:   -- In his 24 February address to the Duma, Yeltsin warned against  any NATO expansion without Russia and made clear that, while  Moscow supported Partnership for Peace, it viewed the program as  a waystation to building a pan-European partnership "open to all  states of the greater Europe" in which CSCE would take the lead  and NATO would be relegated to a subordinate role (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 25 February).   -- After a meeting with FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in  Berlin on 11 March, Grachev intimated that he views the program  as only a stopgap measure until new European security structures  emerge, touting the CSCE as the "main peace-keeping organization  in Europe," and noting that "time will tell what the [NATO]  structure will be like" (ITAR-TASS, 11 March).  These remarks  echoed his suggestion to reporters on 2 February that the program  was transitional, providing for a coordinated effort to defuse  tensions in Europe by NATO and other countries, including Russia,  during "an interim period following the breakup of the Warsaw  Pact."  He also reiterated his previous warnings against the  accession of former Warsaw Pact members and the Baltic states to  NATO (Interfax, 2 February).   -- Kozyrev, likewise, has continued to warn against NATO  expansion and laud CSCE merits.  In an address to a 10 March MFA  Foreign Policy Council session, he complained about  "NATOcentrism" within the alliance which has led to a push for a  "mechanical" expansion, adding that this demonstrates a "vacuum  of strategic thought" and undermines the goal of "moving toward a  single, Greater Europe" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily,  11 March).  Although Kozyrev said Russia is close to signing  Partnership for Peace documents, he continued to argue that CSCE  should become the core of Europe's security system.  Like  Grachev, he hinted that collaboration within a NATO framework  might be only temporary, saying that a "necessary historical  period" perhaps "two to three years in length" had "opened up" to  "elaborate and implement cooperation programs."  Similarly in a  17 March Izvestiya article, he said that NATO was "inadequate"  and "unsuitable" for "current purposes" and contended that while  Partnership for Peace would provide "a partial answer" to  security problems, it could not "be considered the pinnacle of  achievement."      In a sign that not all of Yeltsin's administration share the view  that Russia has more to gain than to lose by joining the program,  Presidential Council adviser Andranik Migranyan, in a 15 March  Nezavisimaya Gazeta article titled "Why Join, If It Is Better Not  To Join," strongly opposed Russian accession.  Claiming that  there is no consensus on the issue within the Foreign Ministry,  he listed numerous adverse consequences if Russia joins.  He  contended that the program would deepen Russia's isolation and  "sharply limit its freedom for foreign policy maneuvering."   Doubts in the Duma      Many influential members of the Duma apparently remain ambivalent  about the Partnership plan, opposing what they view as NATO's  "dictat," and worried that a broad range of security interests  from the competitiveness of Russia's defense industries to its  security arrangements with other CIS countries will suffer:   -- Former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a  member of the moderately reformist Yavlinsky bloc and chairman of  the Duma's international affairs Committee, conceded the  Partnership idea was good, but said the "devil was in the  details," which had been insufficiently thought through (Moscow  radio, 17 March).  He said that Russia, "instead of trying to  "push to the head of the line" to join,  should carefully analyze  what should be done for a more active rapprochement with NATO and  closely follow NATO's reorganization.  Lukin also expressed  concern that involvement with the Partnership program could wreck  Russia's "strategic intentions to create security structures  within the CIS framework" (Krasnaya Zvezda, 18 March)   -- Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Duma's defense committee and  a Russia's Choice member, said while in Washington with a Duma  delegation that he objected to membership on the grounds that  "the framework agreements were drawn up without [the Duma's]  participation and do not conform to Russia's status" and that  NATO standardization would be "simply destructive" for Russia's  defense industries.  He advocated instead a security alliance  between Russia and other countries in which the guidelines would  not be set by NATO, as in the case of Partnership for Peace, but  would be worked out "jointly" (Interfax, 9 March; Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 18 March).  More recently, however, he appears to have  changed his position on joining.  During the Duma hearings  Yushenkov said he supports Russian membership, but maintains it  should be carried out on special terms given Russia's "status as  a nuclear power."  Like many government officials, he contended  that the NATO program should be viewed as "the beginning of a  path toward a common security system" (Interfax, 17 March).   -- Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Duma's CIS affairs  committee and co-chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord faction, warned the MFA Foreign Policy Council session  that Russia's participation in the "Partnership" program would  dash its hopes [unspecified] in the "near abroad," because even  now CIS countries were trying to "blackmail" Russia by appealing  to the West for help (Kommersant-Daily, 11 March).   Media Reaction      Russia media commentary on the Partnership for Peace program has  reflected fears about isolation if Russia fails to join,  suspicion that Russian interests may suffer if it does join, and  resentment that Russia's options thus are limited.  NATO bashing  has been a staple of procommunist newspapers like Pravda and has  intensified in the wake of the February NATO ultimatum to the  Bosnian Serbs, but even reformist and pro-Yeltsin newspapers  appear ambivalent toward membership, although the Defense  Ministry newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, supported it:   -- The procommunist newspaper Pravda printed a long diatribe on  16 March by retired general Viktor Chudov, who charged that  Partnership for Peace was designed as a cover for "peace U.S.-  style" and "world domination."  The article, which claimed that  planned U.S.-Russian exercises were designed to counter  "reunification sentiments" in former Soviet republics and to  inspire "separatists and nationalists" to "vigorous activity,"  lambasted the Defense Ministry's "top brass" for engaging in such  exercises instead of carrying out its own war games designed to  repel aggression "by a coalition of nuclear powers."   -- The reformist newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which printed the  highly critical Migranyan article, frontpaged another article on  15 March titled "Russia's Partnership With NATO Is A  Misalliance."  The article maintained that Russia could have  received better terms if it had held out longer before agreeing  to join, claiming that there had been growing sentiment in the  West to offer Moscow something more in line with its "great  power" status.  Now, the article warned, Moscow confronts a new  dilemma:  to face isolation and discrimination if it does not  become a full member of NATO, or to place its armed forces,  military plans, and budget under the command and control of the  United States if it does join, since "under a long-standing  tradition, the NATO commander in chief has always been and  remains an American general."   -- A 23 March article in the mass-circulation newspaper  Komsomolskaya Pravda contended that, although Moscow had little  choice, it would be "humiliating" for it to follow "in the wake  of U.S. policy," "jostling for space on the margins."  Complaining that "Washington is the banker and Russia is "forced  to play blind," the article noted sarcastically  that "you can judge for yourselves how far such 'partnership' can  be called mutually beneficial and equal."   -- A 16 February article in the usually pro-Yeltsin newspaper  Izvestiya warned that Russia could lose its arms market in  Eastern Europe as countries switched to NATO standards.  A 19  March Izvestiya article admitted that the program was not popular  in the Duma and gave minimal support to the government's campaign  to promote it, confining its advocacy to pointing out that  without Russia the program was "meaningless" and that Moscow had  made clear to Secretary Perry that Russia intends to join "on its  own terms."   -- On 22 March, prominent Krasnaya Zvezda commentator Aleksandr  Golts, echoing the government's line, strongly backed Partnership  for Peace and criticized the "emotional" arguments of its  opponents.  Claiming that the actual partnership program had  emerged because Washington "was forced to take Moscow's tough  stance [on NATO expansion] into consideration," Golts stressed  that the main point in the program was that each country would  develop its own relationship with NATO on a bilateral basis and  that Moscow is elaborating terms "which will take maximum account  of Russian interests."  Golts insisted that "the fears that  Russia condemns itself to a secondary role by signing the  partnership program scarcely hold up," while the risks that  Russia faces if it does not join "are as clear as can be": the  program would "acquire an unambiguously anti-Russian thrust."   Outlook      While government officials support joining the NATO Partnership  for Peace program as beneficial to Russia's security interests,  they clearly view the program as a stop gap measure and hope it  will foster the creation of a European security system in which  Russia will play a major role.  Influential legislators, in  contrast, appear more fearful that NATO affiliation will further  marginalize rather than foster Russian influence in Europe.  This  reaction from the legislature, coupled with the skeptical  reaction from even the independent press, may pressure the  government to demonstrate that it remains an equal and assertive  player in the working out of the terms of any NATO partnership.

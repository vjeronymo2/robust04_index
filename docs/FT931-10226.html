			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Highveld cuts its dividend HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, the South African steel producerin the Anglo American group, reported steeply lower profits for 1992 and is to cut its dividend. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said demand for all products had deteriorated. He did not make a specific profit forecast for 1993 but said he expected the bottom of the cycle would be reached this year. While 1992 turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.49bn (Dollars 477m), pre-tax income fell by 32 per cent to R74.4m. A sharp fall in the tax bill to R3.6m, from R13.6m, limited the decline in attributable income to R70.8m from R95.6m. An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, saw earnings per share fall to 80.1 cents from 130 cents. Mr Boyd said the group had faced poor steel export conditions owing to oversupply. Vanadium consumption - Highveld is the world's largest producer - remained weak, owing to low consumption in the steel industry, and Mr Boyd noted that the Vantra division operated at only 25 per cent of capacity.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECTS RELEASED IN HATE-CRIME BURGLARY  </P> <P> Two reputed members of a skinhead gang were released from jail Thursday while  investigators attempted to gather more evidence that they broke into a Palmdale  woman's new home and scrawled threats, swastikas and satanic symbols on the  walls, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Michael Todd Evans, 18, of Palmdale, and Thomas Conroy, 19, a transient, were  arrested Tuesday on suspicion of burglary and vandalism after deputies said  their footprints resembled those found at the crime scene, Sgt. Ron Shreves  said.  </P> <P> The men were released because detectives did not have enough evidence, he said.  </P> <P> The vandalism was discovered Tuesday by a contractor working in the development  that Mary Termini, 66, was moving into.  </P> <P> Sheriff's gang experts have determined the graffiti apparently came from a  local skinhead gang, Shreves said. Investigators theorized that the house of  Termini, who is white, was randomly selected by the vandals.  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Venture Plant suspended ahead of statement SHARES IN Venture Plant Group were yesterday suspended at 8 1/2 p, shortly before the USM-quoted plant hire business said it would soon announce a substantial acquisition. Venture is expected to announce the purchase of a materials handling business in the mining industry, funded with a rights issue, by the first week of May. The deal will represent the first significant move by Mr Richard Cameron and Mr Brian Thompson, Venture's joint chief executives, who both joined the loss-making company from Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor of earthmoving equipment which was bought by BM Group in 1990. Venture was seen as an attractive 'shell' by Mr Thompson and Mr Cameron, who each own 7.6 per cent of the company. The group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.5m in the year to end-September, but eight of the 11 branches have been closed, and there have been substantial redundancies and sales of surplus equipment and land. At suspension, Venture had a market value of Pounds 2.6m.</p>

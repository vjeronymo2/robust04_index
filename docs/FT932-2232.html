			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures expiry overshadows trading HEAVY arbitrage dealing between stock index contracts and the underlying blue chips provided the backcloth yesterday to the close of the two-week trading account in the UK stock market. The first half of the session featured the expiry of the June contract on the FT-SE Index and of June Share Index options. The September contract on the Footsie then took over the lead, moving to a strong premium against the underlying cash market. Both futures and equities appeared to run out of steam towards the close, however, and traders said the second half of the day had been less exciting. At the day's best, the Footsie touched 2,887.6, confidently challenging the higher reaches of its trading range. But this level was reached in the wake of the settlement in stock index futures, when the market was distorted by heavy basket trading by the big investment houses; basket trades involve balancing large deals in the stock index future with a basket of the underlying blue chips. The market remained firm throughout the day although progress became more erratic. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,879.4, for a net gain on the day of 3.7 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 2.3 to a new peak of 3,215.8. Over the two-week account, the FT-SE 100 Index has added 1.7 per cent and the Mid 250 1.3 per cent. Strategists said that equities were helped by the generally very favourable reception for UK unemployment and inflation statistics released on the previous day. These were seen as convincing evidence that the recovery in the domestic economy is being sustained. Strong demand for the September futures contract on the Footsie from a leading Japanese house provided support for confidence in the outlook for UK equities. Seaq trading volume jumped to 712.5m shares, but was distorted to some extent by the index basket trading; non-Footsie business dipped to around 56 per cent of the total. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 555.4m shares was worth Pounds 1.36bn at retail level, continuing the recent improvement in customer activity in equities. Government bonds firmed up behind a steady performance by sterling, conventional gilts gaining at the longer end of the range. Index-linked government bonds, their attractions less visible as the latest data indicates that inflation remains subdued, held steady.</p>

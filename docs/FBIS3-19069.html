			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lefkosa, Mar. 10 (A.A.) -- Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas criticized on  Thursday [10 March] a report of U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, on the indirect talks being held in Cyprus  concerning the confidence-building measures.    In a statement from the TRNC capital, Denktas also announced  that he had postponed a meeting scheduled for this afternoon  with U.N. envoy Gustave Feissel, to Friday.    He said that he was to review the draft document given to  him  by the envoy, together with the prime minister and consultants.    "An incomphrehensible haste prevails in U.N. circles," he  said. "This is not an issue that could be resolved in such a  haste. Even a single word needs emphasis."    Denktas pointed out that the Butrus-Ghali report attributed  a  title to one of the sides, which is unacceptable to the other  and that they would not accept Kliridhis being called  "president," while he himself is referred to as "leader."    "The course of events are directed to support the `Cyprus  republic' and to just mend us to it. [sentence as received]  Therefore we shall continue to review the document put before  us, very minutely," he said.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Channel 4 fined for refusing to disclose source CHANNEL 4 yesterday escaped possible sequestration of its assets and the threat of closure for refusing to reveal the source behind a television documentary on Northern Ireland. Instead Lord Justice Woolf imposed a total fine of Pounds 75,000 on the channel and Box Productions, the company which produced Committee, a programme alleging systematic collusion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Loyalist death squads. Channel 4 and Box, which argued that they could not identify their main source without endangering his life, will decide how to share out the fine. They will also have to pay costs estimated at between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 200,000. Lord Justice Woolf said in the High Court that Channel 4, which was found to be in contempt under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, should have borne in mind that the programme would undermine the reputation of the RUC and the rule of law  - just what terrorists were trying to do. He had decided against sequestration of assets, which could have destroyed Channel 4 and Box, because it was clear they were not going to disclose the name of 'Source A'. No one could doubt the dilemma the companies faced or their desire to co-operate with the law so far as they were able, the judge said. The fine was therefore substantially smaller than it might have been. Even more significantly Lord Justice Woolf said there should be no further proceedings either against the companies or any individuals involved. Sir Richard Attenborough, Channel 4 chairman, said the judges had recognised the company's dilemma. 'Although they had no real option but to fine the companies for contempt, and although there remains a gulf between the views we and the court take on the duties of serious journalists, no draconian penalties were levied.' Lord Justice Woolf hoped both companies would reconsider their positions. While accepting they had a genuine dilemma, it was of their own making.</p>

The cable says: The immortal epic of the Mother of Battles,  fought by great Iraq, has charted a course for the Arab nation  to prove its cultural and historical presence and safeguard its  rights and dignity in a changing world dominated by forces of  evil, falsehood, and serfdom, led by the United States and its  ally, world Zionism.    The cable adds: By virtue of your God-given faith,  leadership, and wisdom and the people's deep love and true  allegiance, you, the inspired knight, were qualified to lead  this major, historic confrontation. Tyranny and aggression were  defeated at your own hands. In your sacred name, strugglers and  fighters uttered the biggest "No" in the history of mankind, and  through you the voice of human justice rose above all other  voices and the banner of God is Great fluttered over all other  banners.</p>

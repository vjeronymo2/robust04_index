			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Housing recovery hopes damped A significant recovery in the housing market is very unlikely before the spring, according to the Halifax Building society, which releases its house price index today. The Halifax says even a recovery in spring 'will require some upturn in general consumer confidence which is not helped by speculation about higher interest rates. The housing market now needs a reasonable period of stability in interest rates.' Most lenders have increased mortgage rates, following last month's rise in base rates to 5.75 per cent. According to the Halifax house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in September. That small rise contrasts with the 2.9 per cent fall recorded by the Nationwide Building Society's rival index, released on Monday. The two indices have often diverged but neither has shown much sign of a housing market recovery this year. While the Nationwide reports that house prices have risen by 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to September, Halifax records a 0.7 per cent fall in the same period. Meanwhile, mortgage lending grew slightly in August, according to figures released by the Bank of England. Gross lending by banks and building societies was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.58bn in August, compared with Pounds 4.54bn in July.</p>

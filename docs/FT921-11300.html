			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BAe begins rationalisation with Pounds 47m sale British Aerospace is selling its Aerostructures Hamble aircraft components subsidiary for Pounds 47m to a new company to be set up by Legal and General Ventures. This is a first step in BAe's rationalisation policy of concentrating on its core defence, commercial aircraft, Rover cars and property and construction businesses. Aerostructures was set up in 1989 to produce components for civil and defence aircraft. It employs about 1,700 and supplies parts for BAe aircraft programmes as well as to other customers, including Saab McDonnell Douglas, and Westland, the helicopter group. Last year its turnover was Pounds 66m and pre-tax profit Pounds 4m. BAe outlined its strategy of disposing of certain peripheral activities in its prospectus for its controversial Pounds 432m rights issue last September.</p>

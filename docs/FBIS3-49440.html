			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- We welcome the  decisions of the Atlantic alliance which, despite the  Franco-British initiative to exert pressure on the Serbs, has  given priority to the negotiating process, Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, told Radio  Obrenovac today.    Although we continue to have a critical stance vis-a-vis  some  NATO moves, we do not conceal our satisfaction at the fact that  the "Sixteen" in Brussels have advocated negotiations --  something we have been in favor of from the very beginning,  Krajisnik added.    He pointed out that the Serb side will continue to reject  any  planned resolutions that might imperil the strategic interests  of the Serbian people.    Commenting on the possibility of the withdrawal of the "blue  helmets" from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that  UN forces ought to remain until peace is achieved.    He added that the Serbs will not protest if the  peace-keeping  forces withdraw, because, he added, they have not been  protecting the Serbs in any case, but the Muslims.    He recalled that it was with this protection that the  Muslims  had armed themselves. Peace could be achieved more easily and  quickly, according to Krajisnik, if such support were withheld  from the Muslims.</p>

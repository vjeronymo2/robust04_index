			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow has put forward new proposals for a  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "A meeting of the (U.N.) Security Council convened at the  initiative of Russia has decided that the decisions made by NATO  in response to the request of the U.N. secretary general to  protect Gorazde and other 'safe havens' in Bosnia were correct,"  a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement issued  in Moscow on Monday. "Grave as the present situation is,  military measures must not replace the principal line, that  towards a peaceful settlement. We expect that the Bosnian  parties and our partners seeking a settlement will be actively  involved in the process."    Russia's settlement program has the following principal  elements, the spokesman said:    1. Tighter regulations for safe havens in Bosnia on the  basis of U.N. Security Council decisions.    2. An agreement between Serbs and Muslims for an indefinite  and universal cease-fire. Such a document has already been  drafted and must be signed as soon as possible without any  reservations. All parties to the conflict must realize that the  international community will tolerate no more provocations or  barbaric responses to them. Both mean disregard for the United  Nations.    3. Embarking on a comprehensive peaceful settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Such a decision must take account of the  legitimate interests and equal rights of all three peoples of  Bosnia. A Muslim-Croat federation would form no basis for the  future of the Bosnian Serbs. The sharing of territory must be  based on earlier plans and be carried out only by negotiation.  A political agreement must naturally involve all humanitarian  aspects of the Bosnian problem.    4. Progress towards peace in Bosnia must be accompanied by  weaker sanctions against Yugoslavia.    "There is a need for active work both on the part of special  envoys to the former Yugoslavia and on the part of the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union,  with the participation of the United Nations. This would  provide a basis for convening in the near future a summit on a  settlement in Bosnia," the spokesman said.</p>

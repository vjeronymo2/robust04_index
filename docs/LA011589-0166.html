			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER IRVINE RIGHTS ORDINANCE  </P> <P> Regarding the fight of four lawmakers against the Irvine ordinance on gay  rights: Gay people do not choose their sexual orientation any more than  heterosexuals choose theirs; it just develops. The only thing they can choose  is to be honest and open about it, which takes great courage in our society. If  the lawmakers' constituents understood that, perhaps some of them would not  vote for such loudmouth, un-Christian bigot-demagogues as Reps. Dannemeyer and  Dornan and such gutless, me-too political mediocrities as Assemblymen Ferguson  and Frizzelle.  </P> <P> ARNOLD T. SCHWAB  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

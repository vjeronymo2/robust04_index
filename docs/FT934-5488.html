			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The IRA Connection: Paisley suspended from Commons The Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, was yesterday suspended from the Commons for accusing the government of 'falsehoods'. Mr Paisley challenged Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary: 'The people of Northern Ireland today demand that you explain why you issued falsehoods yourself, got officials to issue falsehoods, and Downing Street backed up those falsehoods.' Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, intervened and asked Mr Paisley to withdraw the word falsehoods since it meant only one thing: 'lies'. After he refused to do so the Speaker again intervened to insist he withdraw the word 'falsehood'. But he told her: 'Because of the seriousness of the situation, I cannot oblige you. And I stand by what I said - it was a falsehood. It was worse - it was a lie.' Miss Boothroyd then ordered Mr Paisley under Commons standing orders to leave the precincts of the Palace of Westminster for the rest of the working day. When the DUP leader remained in his seat, she named him and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, put the motion that led to Mr Paisley's suspension. The vote was overwhelmingly carried and Mr Paisley left the chamber.</p>

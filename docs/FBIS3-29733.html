Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says this reflects  the  worldwide caution against Japan, which has surfaced as a new  nuclear war force in Northeast Asia.    What the Japanese reactionaries intend is to stockpile large  quantities of weapon-grade nuclear materials and mass produce  and possess nuclear weapons any time, the analyst says, and  continues:    Japan's nuclear armament has reached a danger line today. It  plans to possess plutonium enough to make 6,200 nuclear bombs in  2010. It is now fully prepared to manufacture nuclear weapons.  Japan has more than 150 companies and 3,300 factories engaging  themselves in nuclear activities. It set up a nuclear-launching  system long ago, and recently developed even a long-range  missile, a means of delivery of nuclear weapons.    Japan's scheme of nuclear armament is all the more grave and  dangerous because it has opened the way of overseas dispatch of  troops.    Its accelerated nuclear armament is a grave threat to peace  and security of the Korean peninsula and the rest of Northeast  Asia. We must never be Japan's nuclear victim. We will cope  with Japan's dangerous nuclear armament with heightened  vigilance.    The promotion of the nuclear armament of Japan, our  neighbour, in a dangerous stage renders the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula meaningless. To denuclearize Northeast  Asia including the Korean peninsula is vital to the building of  a nuclear-free world.    The world, not to speak of Asia, must pay due attention to  Japan's nuclear armament and launch an international campaign to  check it.</p>

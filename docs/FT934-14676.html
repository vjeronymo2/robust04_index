			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Management: Avoiding the IBM trap - Christopher Lorenz continues a series on corporate creativity by looking at EDS's tough self-analysis ON THE face of it, you might not expect Les Alberthal to be a worried man. EDS, the company which he heads, has an enviable reputation in the fast-growing global market for information technology services and an impeccable financial record - including a 16 per cent increase in sales and net income last year. But that very success is the problem. Alberthal's fear is that if it is not careful EDS could become as proud, inward-looking and unresponsive to change as General Motors, IBM and countless other successful large companies. 'We don't want to make the same type of mistake that they have,' he says. To pre-empt that risk well ahead of time, he has just led the Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn) Dallas-based company, founded 31 years ago by Ross Perot and now owned by GM, through the toughest self-analysis it has undertaken since it first broke into systems integration, network management and other areas of IT services. By EDS's traditionally authoritarian standards, the exercise has been remarkably participative. The resulting revitalisation process is still under way - if revitalisation is the right term for such a successful company. For competitive reasons, many of the review's consequences are still secret. But it has already loosened EDS's thinking, catapulting it into several strategic steps over the past few months which it would not have taken two years ago, before the review began. They include a direct move into management consulting, and an alliance in digital video-on-demand with Spectradyne, a leading US and international provider of pay-TV and other information systems for hotels. Alberthal denies vehemently that any of this is old-style diversification. Instead he calls it a very focused 'leveraging' of its core competences - both its technology and its people's entrepreneurialism. The EDS chairman and chief executive is in no doubt about why almost all successful large companies lose their edge, and many eventually come a cropper. 'When you're extraordinarily successful, when you can do no wrong, when you are dominating a marketplace and you've built something that's really fantastic and the world says 'isn't this wonderful', the natural human tendency is to start institutionalising it,' he says. 'Everything becomes inwardly-focused: the process of research, development and designing, your process of thinking about the market, your education process. You say this is 'the GM way' or 'the EDS way'. While some of that speaks to your core competencies, once you become totally preoccupied with it you ignore the marketplace. You wind up with a Cadillac, an Oldsmobile or a Buick all looking exactly the same because the engineers have said this is the way to do it. But the marketplace says 'we don't want that'. 'Or you do what IBM did - it ignored the personal computer and the demand of the marketplace for personalised technology and got a few years behind the curve. Once you do that, it becomes very difficult in a high-paced R&amp;D environment to catch up.' This is true however talented your people are, Alberthal emphasises - and he stresses tactfully that EDS-owner GM and IBM 'are top-quality organisations'. The way Alberthal tells it, he and EDS's other top managers had become aware by 1991 that the company was facing various risks of this kind. They were starting to wrestle with them, but could not quite grasp the exact nature of the dangers, nor what remedial action was needed. He likens this process to experiencing pain, but not being quite sure of its cause. They also did not know how to convey their sense of unease down the company, in the face of its glowing sales and profits performance. A more striking perspective is given by Greig Trosper, EDS director of strategic planning. As he describes it, the trigger for change was a course at the London Business School which suddenly opened the eyes of half a dozen EDS executives, and resulted in the course leader, Gary Hamel, being called in as a consultant. 'His question of whether we, as an industry leader, were different from GM in 1965, Caterpillar in 1975, or IBM in 1975, started us thinking', Trosper told last month's annual meeting of the international Strategic Management Society. So did the academic's analysis of why great companies surrender leadership. 'Our leadership saw itself reflected in it', said Trosper. This analysis suggests that large companies tend to lose their way as their industries start to change. They mistakenly think their greater scale and resources will enable them to continue winning in the marketplace. That reduces any sense of urgency on their part. At the same time their deep-down assumptions and lack of vision (Alberthal's 'inward focus') make them prisoners of their past. They define their problems as marginal, not central, and fail to apply adequate intellectual effort to them. As a result such companies tend to change more slowly than their industries, and fail either to see the need for, or to build, what Hamel and Trosper call 'a new economic engine'. This is in spite of the fact that such constant re-treading is obviously vital, especially in industries whose boundaries are changing constantly and in unpredictable directions. Now that a small internal 'corporate change team' under Trosper has done much of its work, Hamel's jibe about the dangers of scale-induced over-confidence bites deep within EDS. The company recently lost a large European order to a competitor - Ross Perot's new company - even though the latter had no local resources. But in 1991 too few people within EDS saw such problems looming. This was in spite of the fact that it had, since 1985, been displaying one of the classic early warning signs of future problems: a levelling-off of its rate of productivity growth. Trosper also says that 'almost no-one inside the company was giving any thought to what the next a big step should be' in EDS's growth. Between 1960 and the late 1980s it experienced several quantum leaps, thanks to a succession of sudden changes in the market. Rather than trying to convey top-down messages of concern through a reluctant organisation, the answer was to expose a much larger group of managers to the same experience of painful self-discovery as the original half-dozen. 'We decided to build a shared sense of urgency, and a common view of what was necessary, and then get out of the way,' Trosper explains. A group of 150 people were handpicked for what he and Alberthal call 'their ability to think outside the box'. In a company not exactly noted for the diversity of its leadership - most are Texans - great emphasis was placed on picking people from all over the globe, of all ages, organisational levels and lengths of service, and with different styles of thinking. They were broken into five 'waves' of 30, focusing on different issues. These included: a redefinition of EDS in terms of its 'core competencies', which Trosper says has helped it escape 'the myopia of how we currently serve the market'; an analysis of the potential forces that could be used to create radical change in EDS's industries; a search for 'white space' (uncontested new competitive areas); and planning for the changes in behaviour and systems needed to enable EDS to transform itself effectively. Given the competitive sensitivity of some of the results of this change process, Alberthal and Trosper are loath to say much at this stage about its internal effects, and the opportunities identified as a result. But Trosper says one effect is that people have realised the growing need to achieve much greater 'mass customisation' of many of EDS's services and products. Another break with EDS's past is a recognition that, in order to occupy new competitive 'space', the company does not always have to take giant steps and put itself at risk - 'bet the farm', in EDS parlance. Instead, it can move step by step, with relatively small investments. Hamel recalls the eyes of one top EDS Texan, Barry Sullivan, lighting up as this realisation struck him. He drawled: 'Ah] I see what this means - that we only need bet the pig.' The first article on corporate creativity appeared on October 4.</p>

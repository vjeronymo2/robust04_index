			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Consistent with the applicable procedure, the NRC does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not intend to hold formal trial-type public hearings on the Standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS rule or separate hearings at each reactor site before the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dry cask technology approved by the Commission in this rulemaking. Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, used by the NRC for generic approval of the Standardized NUHOMS,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the underlying NRC staff technical reviews and the opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public input, are more than adequate to obtain public input and assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection of the public health and safety and the environment. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, the NRC has taken additional steps to elicit and fully consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS technology. These steps included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC participation in public meetings near Davis-Besse and extension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment period by 45 days in response to public requests. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension provided a total public comment period of almost 4 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 133 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorizes the NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to approve spent fuel storage technologies by rulemaking. When it adopted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generic process in 1990 for the review and approval of dry cask storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies, the Commission stated that ``casks *&blank;*&blank;* [are to] be approved  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> by rulemaking <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and any safety issues that are connected with the casks are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly addressed in that rulemaking rather than in a hearing procedure''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (July 18, 1990; 55 FR 29181). Rulemaking under NRC rules of practice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in 10 CFR 2.804 and 2.805, provides full opportunity for expression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of public views but does not use formal trial-type hearings of the kind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested by commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this proceeding, rulemaking clearly provided adequate avenues for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members of the public to provide their views regarding NRC's proposed approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Standardized NUHOMS, including the opportunity to participate through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submission of statements, information, data, opinions and arguments. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this connection, technical evaluations for Standardized NUHOMS and detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented findings of compliance with NRC safety, security, and environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements were prepared by the NRC staff for public examination. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 1993, the NRC staff reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS and approved the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design for the purpose of initiating this rulemaking to grant a generic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval of the design. In addition, the NRC staff conducted a second review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in response to the public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking, again finding compliance with NRC requirements as discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to reviewing systematically and in depth the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues important to protecting public health and safety, and the environment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC has taken extra steps to obtain and fully consider public views on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS technology and has made every effort to respond to public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns and questions about the Standardized NUHOMS compliance with NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety, security, and environmental requirements. The initial public comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period opened on June 2, 1994, and was scheduled to close on August 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 29, 1994, the public comment period was extended to September 30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994. The NRC also participated in an earlier meeting near the Davis-Besse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, formal hearings would not appreciably add to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC's efforts to ensure adequate protection of public health, safety, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment and they are unnecessary to NRC's full understanding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of public views on the Standardized NUHOMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . One commenter stated that because there is not now and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there may not be a permanent high-level radioactive waste (HLWR) repository  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for commercial reactor fuel, and since the NUHOMS 24P and 52B casks are non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportable, any distinction between so called ``temporary storage'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``permanent disposal'' of this waste is moot. Because of the lack of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent repository or Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) in the foreseeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future, a case of a serious spill and the resultant contamination at an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally unsuitable site like Davis-Besse where ``short and long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floodplain *&blank;*&blank;* potential release of radioactive material during the lifetime of the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;* (and location) over an aquifer which is a major water resource'' have been inadequately dealt with.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This rulemaking to certify the Standardized NUHOMS is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for interim storage of spent fuel in an approved cask for 20 years. It does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not authorize or approve the ultimate disposal in a permanent HLRW repository,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is under the responsibility of the DOE. During interim storage, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> user (holder of a Part 50 license) must protect the spent fuel against design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis threats, and against environmental conditions and natural phenomena such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as tornadoes, tornado missiles, earthquakes, and floods. In regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooding, the Certificate of Compliance has a provision (see A&hyph;2 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance) for flood condition analysis to ensure that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no release of radioactive material from flooding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

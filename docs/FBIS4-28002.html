			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dispute Over Sipadan and Ligitan Islands </F> Should Be Settled Cordially"]    [Text] The third meeting of the Malaysian-Indonesian Joint  Commission for Bilateral Cooperation ended in Kuala Lumpur  yesterday with the two sides agreeing that no development will  be undertaken on the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan while talks  are under way to seek a solution to the dispute. The two  nations believe that the dispute over the islands should be  settled immediately to prevent it from becoming a "thorn" that  may undermine close bilateral relations.    Malaysia and Indonesia agree that there are no obstacles  standing in the way of strengthening good relations and further  expanding cooperation in any field. We are convinced that  recriminations and heated arguments over international problems  will not bring any benefit to either party, but would rather  open the possibility of outsiders interfering in their internal  affairs -- something which may complicate the situation. Of  course, many parties are awaiting to take advantage of a rift in  relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, which belong to one  family. We are convinced that the strong solidarity of the  Malaysian and Indonesian people and leaders cannot be easily  overshadowed or eroded by self-interest or the interest of any  party who does not understand the basis of the strong  relationship, although the two nations are separated by the  Straits of Malacca. Although the brotherly relationship was  once undermined by a confrontation, their historical and  cultural ties have since eliminated any useless prejudices. It  is with this intimate relationship that we seriously want to  establish a new force to face challenges and tackle various  economic and political problems to serve our common interests.    Nevertheless, we feel that the island dispute has been  dragging on unwarrantably although the matter has not been  raised at the international level. Meetings and discussions  have taken place alternately, but there has been no agreement to  settle the matter. Indeed, it is not logical that the close  relationship may be affected simply by the dispute over two  small islands. As the islands are small, we hope that only few  meetings will be needed to settle the matter in a very short  time. Will lengthy discussions mean that the two sides are not  being serious? Perhaps the postponement of a ministerial  meeting from last Saturday until next year was indicative of  their lack of determination and seriousness. The islands have  commercial value and can be developed into tourist resorts and  marine sports centers. Both nations recognize this potential  and any delayed solution will surely inflict financial losses to  both sides.    Nevertheless, we are convinced that Malaysia and Indonesia  strongly hope that something positive will come out of a  three-day meeting of the Joint Working Group on Sipadan and  Ligitan Islands due to start in Jakarta on 7 September. We are  strongly convinced that this trivial matter will be settled in a  spirit of harmony and compromise if we are serious about seeking  a solution. Izhar Ibrahim, director general for political  affairs of the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs [name  and title as published], who headed a 29-member Indonesian  delegation, said that his country was committed to seeking  whatever means is available to settle the dispute in a spirit of  friendship.    In fact, the two nations have agreed on many matters at the  negotiating table. Let's see cooperation in the automobile and  aircraft industries, which have not only demonstrated the  expertise of the Malay nations but have also contributed to  ASEAN efforts to further enhance cooperation in Southeast Asia.  We are also happy over Indonesia's full support for the  establishment of the East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] and  commitment to the establishment of a growth triangle covering  Sumatera in Indonesia, southern Thailand, and the northern part  of peninsular Malaysia, and over the fact that Indonesia has  increased the frequency of sea and air traffic between the  peninsula and Sumatera, encouraged the development of the  financial services industry, and signed an investment guarantee  agreement with Malaysia. Cooperation in trade, information,  science and technology, agriculture, and tourism can be further  developed to cover various new issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 21 SAPA--State President F W de Klerk  had abused his chancellorship of the Unversity of Potchefstroom  and the university had in an improper manner made available  first year students for his public meeting at Potchefstroom on  Thursday night, according to the Conservative Party [CP]. In a  statement on Friday CP MP Fanie Jacobs said the CP offices had  received a large number of complaints from parents of first year  students, who alleged their childrens' attendance had been  brought about by a "form of intimidation".    He said the university had defended the organisation of the  meeting as being "voluntarily", but had also acknowledged the  state president's speech was within the framework of first year  students' welcoming and orientation programme. First year  students were obliged to take part in orientation programmes  during the orientation period, Mr Jacobs said.    The university's irresponsible and insensitive conduct had  raised the polarisation among parents to breaking point, he said.    Tax payers' money, which kept universities running, had been  abused to the benefit of Mr de Klerk and the National Party [NP]  which seriously violated the principle of equal treatment of  political parties, he added. In view of the unjustified  promotion of the NP, the CP and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner  National Front] would soon apply to the university authorities  to be granted the same opportunity to address first year  students.    Mr Jacobs also challenged Mr de Klerk to address a public  meeting in the Potchefstroom town hall within the next few weeks  which, he said, would indicate how little the state president's  support was in the Western Transvaal.</p>

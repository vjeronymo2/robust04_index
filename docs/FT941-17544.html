			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Unions attack utility chiefs' pay increases Unions yesterday attacked pay rises averaging more than 10 per cent for senior executives of privatised utility companies last year. Salary increases for the highest-paid directors of the privatised water, gas and electricity companies averaged 13.9 per cent in the year to March 31 1993, but lower bonus payments pulled down the average increase to 10.8 per cent, says Incomes Data Services, the independent research organisation. Inflation was 3.5 per cent over the period. The Trades Union Congress said yesterday that the increases would fuel the growing sense of unfairness felt by public-sector workers. The TUC estimates that the government's freeze of public-sector pay combined with April's tax increases will result in public-sector workers facing cuts of 6 per cent in living standards this year. Its figures assume a zero increase in pay, a loss of 2.75p in the pound as a result of the tax increases in last year's two budgets and a 3.35p loss because of inflation. The January issue of the IDS Management Pay Review bases its findings on the latest annual reports of the 10 water companies, 16 electricity companies and British Gas. The review says almost all the utility companies are largely complying with the Cadbury committee's recommendations by separating salary and bonus information for their top directors in annual reports. IDS says pay growth was fastest in the water sector, where salary increases for the highest-paid directors averaged 16.4 per cent. Total earnings rises averaged 16.9 per cent. In the electricity companies, salary increases for top executives averaged 12.7 per cent and the increase in total earnings averaged 8.1 per cent. There were large variations in the figures. The highest-paid director at Anglian Water had a 52 per cent rise in his total remuneration. In the year to April last year he received a total package of Pounds 163,000 compared with Pounds 107,000 in the previous 12 months. However, a number of top directors saw their overall earnings fall. At British Gas, the total package of Mr Robert Evans, the chairman, fell by 12.8 per cent. The main reason for this was that he relinquished his role as chief executive and therefore received no bonus for the year. Utility executive earnings are still nearly a fifth below the average of directors of equivalently-sized private-sector firms. IDS Management Pay Review.

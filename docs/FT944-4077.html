			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BSkyB debut Initial dealing in BSkyB shares saw turnover of some 45m in the last two hours of trading in London. The stock, which was only priced yesterday morning, opened at an 11p premium to its 256p striking price and held steady to end the day at 268 1/2 p. The shares began trading simultaneously in London and New York. They will enter the UK Stock Exchange's official list next Thursday and BSkyB is expected to be an early candidate for the FT-SE 100 Index. The offer price translates to a capitalisation of Pounds 4.4bn, which at current levels would render it one of the 35 most highly capitalised UK companies. BT added 4 up at 380p as the market buzzed with talk of an immiment disposal of the group's 35.9m share stake in AT&amp;T following the US telecom group's filing of a registration statement. The disposal could bring in some Dollars 1.7bn at current prices. Turnover in BT was 8.7m shares. Retailer Great Universal Stores surprised the market with a special 30p dividend with its interim profits. The shares closed at 496p xd after active trading of 4.3m. The move followed weeks of market speculation suggesting the company would use part of its cash mountain of around Pounds 1.5bn to launch a share buy-back scheme. The one-off special payment made yesterday will cost around Pounds 300m, still leaving the group with some Pounds 1.2bn and prompted speculation that GUS may soon make another or even go for the much predicted share buy-back option. Half-time profits at Pounds 225m, against Pounds 213.2m a year earlier, came in below market forecasts. BZW downgraded full-year expectations by 3 per cent to Pounds 555m, saying its move reflected 'the weakness in the clothing market and recalculation of the interest charge'. UBS cut its full-year prediction by Pounds 10m to Pounds 575m. Takeover enthusiasm fuelled the financials area as analysts and investors looked towards a fundamental shakeout. Kleinwort Benson jumped 32 to 522p. Smith New Court, where profits were above expectations but still down 35 per cent, improved 23 to 396p - many expect the classic market-maker to attract a bid. Schroders moved 40 higher to 1460p and MAM, Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund management arm, leapt 39 to 653p. Technical pressure was behind a retreat of 7 to 426p in British Aerospace, rather than any rethink on Wednesday's monopolies referral for the bids from both BAe and GEC for submarine maker VSEL, which dipped 2 to 1336p. GEC was steady ahead of today's interim results at 275p. Yesterday's increase in duty on alcohol by the UK chancellor brought a retreat in several stocks in the sector. Whitbread gave up 6 to 553p and Guinness a penny to 438p. Bass relinquished a penny to 518p, with sentiment further hurt by a sell recommendation from NatWest Securities. Electronics group Racal tumbled 13 to 203p in 4.9m turnover as analysts found clear signs of margins pressure in the interim statement and promptly downgraded full-year profits estimates. NatWest Securities came down by Pounds 5m to Pounds 60m but found the shares attractive at present levels, against a net asset value of close to 190p. The reawakening of bid fever, prompted by the Warburg situation, spread like a virus and marketmakers were soon rounding up the usual suspects. It was harder to see a stronger rationale for stories that Glaxo was sharpening its claws for either Wellcome or Zeneca. But all three ended brighter on the day, Glaxo up 8 to 629p, Wellcome 10 to 675p and Zeneca 11 to 847p. Carlton Communications fell 10 in early dealing on worries over derivatives trading. When it was realised that the figure was minimal and Carlton was suing Bankers Trust rather than the other way round, the stock rebounded to close 4 ahead on balance at 872p. An acquisition, rights issue and promise of higher profits and dividends this year left motor distributor and bus operator Cowie 6 higher at 224p in 1.1m turnover. The rights issue will bring in some Pounds 33m, half of which will finance the purchase of the group's second London bus operation. News of the extra equity was sweetened by a forecast 16 per cent increase in dividends for 1994. Refractories maker Hewitt soared 60 to 158p as the group unveiled plans for an injection of new capital and management. Stores group Kingfisher declined 7 to 427p after BZW downgraded profits expectations. The investment bank reduced its current year prediction by Pounds 15m to Pounds 315m to take account of 'trading difficulties at Woolworths (its high street subsidiary) and a higher than expected interest charge'. A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson boosted Ladbroke, 4 firmer at 162p. Disappointing interim figures from Fine Art Developments, along with a cautious outlook on the second half, saw the shares slide 44 to 376p. Other statistics, Page 37</p>

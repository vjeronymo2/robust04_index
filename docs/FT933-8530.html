			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Sport: Battle for the gold - Athletics WITH THE world athletics championships starting today in Stuttgart there must be a suspicion that, whatever the television commentators tell us, we are probably being served something less than haute cuisine. Already attractive items have been scrubbed from the menu: some athletes are simply giving the championships a miss. The Kenyan Yobes Ondieki, who broke the 10,000m world record earlier this year, says he does not want to run a championship this year and nor does his wife Lisa, the Australian marathon runner. Noureddine Morceli, the Algerian 1,500m world record holder, has said he will not compete because there is no prize money and no glory, though there is still a chance that pressure from his national federation and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's governing body, will get him to the start line. Rumours persist that a select few athletes are being paid to appear at Stuttgart, but of those who are competing and will be given star billing, several are not at their best. International championships were once rare contests. This is only the fourth world championships. The first three were four years apart, but Stuttgart follows just two years after Tokyo. In the three years 1991-93 we will have had two world championships and an Olympic Games. Next year it is the European championships and Commonwealth games. The frequency of big championships gives athletes no respite in their training and competitive cycle, but it is attractive to television. The European Broadcasting Union paid the IAAF Dollars 8m for European broadcasting rights to events staged between 1987 and 1991. For events between 1992 and 1995, of which the Stuttgart championships is the first of significance, the EBU is paying Dollars 91m. Thanks to television and its money, athletics gives the appearance of being a rich sport. But at various levels there are disputes as to how the cash is distributed. In Britain, the British Athletics Federation has been accused by one of its own management board members of prostituting itself in staging the Pounds 200,000 100m showdown between Linford Christie and Carl Lewis at Gateshead. How, asked Derek Johnson, could British athletics lobby effectively for money from the government or the Sports Council if it was seen handling the kind of money spent on the Christie-Lewis show? At what were once known as the grass-roots of British athletics (before the advent of the all-weather track), there is little sign of the sport's new-found wealth. Impoverished local authorities are struggling to keep tracks open and fit for competition. The athletics clubs are finding it hard to meet the cost of transporting teams to and from competitions. In the international arena, athletes have been voicing discontent over whether they are getting a fair share of the sport's revenue. Tom Jennings, a representative on the US track and field council, predicts a showdown with the the IAAF. 'All it would take is one good boycott (by athletes),' he says. On the eve of the world championships, the IAAF's congress met this week in Stuttgart. Its most depressing decision was to move the IAAF's headquarters from London to Monte Carlo. This amounts to a further concentration of power in the It is hard to see how IAAF finances will be made more accountable by a move to Monte Carlo, where Nebiolo has already established the International Athletics Foundation, an off-shoot of the IAAF, over which he has even tighter control. Although the IAAF's multi-million dollar balances are supposed to be devoted to good works, their most visible use is in paying for a lavish gala at the end of each season. Arguably, there should be a publicly-agreed structure to pass revenue down from the IAAF to member federations. In practice, IAAF funds are spent as Nebiolo and his council permit, and the supposedly non-profit-making body is accumulating hefty financial reserves. The IAAF's published spending plans for 1992-95 show that of a total budget of Dollars 172.3m, Dollars 16m has been allocated to meetings - not athletics events but the gatherings of Dr Nebiolo and his committees in various parts of the world. That sum is not so far short of the Dollars 21m allocated for the development of the sport internationally, and far in excess of the Dollars 1.9m to be spent on combating the sport's drug users. The IAAF congress has rejected a proposal to make sentencing more lenient for those failing drugs tests. There has been a steady stream of athletes found using drugs - most recently Tatyana Doroviskikh, winner of three world championship gold medals. The drug-testing techniques and punishments are already insufficient deterrent when set against the financial rewards which athletics success can now bring. Canadian hurdler Mark McKoy is one of those athletes who have been convicted of drug-taking but have since been rehabilitated. Last year he won the Olympic gold medal in the 110m hurdles. This year he misses the Stuttgart championships because he fell out with his national federation and was not selected. In commercial terms, he may be fortunate. The shine of his Olympic medal cannot now be tarnished by defeat at Stuttgart, and later in the season there can be a handsomely-paid run-off between him and the new world champion.</p>

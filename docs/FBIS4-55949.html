			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandur Strezov: "How About Upper </F> Vardar?"]    [Text] According to a report in the Greek daily TA NEA,  President Clinton is said to personally support the idea  proposed by U.S. Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles to call  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  Northern Macedonia. It would be interesting to know how this  wise suggestion came about. Perhaps it is based on the  comparatively harmless example of North Carolina or North  Dakota, but an analogy may also be sought with North Vietnam,  North Korea, Northern Cyprus, or North Yemen -- all countries  that are artificially divided. It is not so difficult to  predict the Greek reaction to this proposal, which in principle  suits Skopje's theses and adds fuel to the flames that have  flared up around the name of the new republic. However, this  does not at all mean that Kiro Gligorov and his comrades-in-arms  will accept the U.S. proposal, despite the fact that they could  not wish for more -- Bulgarian Macedonia is already part of the  republic, while the Greek part looks as if it is simply  artificially separated from the small homeland.    It will be interesting to see if there is any official  Bulgarian reaction to the name of "Northern Macedonia," which in  principle also includes eastern Macedonia -- in other words, the  Blagoevgrad region. Skopje's appetite for our lands and the "2  million" Macedonians in Bulgaria is no secret to anyone. To  prevent this, at least in words, one should ask for Macedonia to  be called "Northwest Macedonia," or again, if we follow the  trends in the world, we should ask for the name of "Vardar  Macedonia" to be adopted. However, because the Vardar River also  flows further to the south, perhaps it would be more accurate to  use the name of "Upper Vardar Macedonia." However, everyone  knows that the Greeks do not want the name of Macedonia  mentioned at all. In this case, nothing remains but to call the  country "Upper Vardar," something like Upper Volta.    All this may well sound like mockery, but it is interesting  how people from across the ocean find the courage to attempt to  impose their way of thinking, without even taking the trouble to  familiarize themselves with the historical tangle surrounding  the Macedonian question. According to political circles in  Washington, the package of measures proposed, with the addition  of the new name, is the best solution, and Athens should accept  it. Athens will state its view on this, despite Washington's  optimism, but will Sofia say something too?</p>

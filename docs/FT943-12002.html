			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kodak profit fall blamed on costs and soft demand Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, continued to suffer from strongly rising costs and weak revenue growth in the second quarter, resulting in profits below those expected by most analysts. The company, in the middle of a shake-up aimed at focusing resources on its imaging business, was also held back by the weak dollar and one-off costs, including a write-down of some inventory. 'We have said before that 1994 would be a challenging year,' said Mr George Fisher, the company's recently appointed chairman and chief executive. The latest quarter's figures had also been harmed by 'a continued softness in demand in our office imaging business,' he added. Since Mr Fisher took charge Kodak has announced plans to sell its non-imaging businesses, including Sterling Winthrop, the drugs company. Selling the health businesses is not expected to lead the company to report a book loss, Mr Fisher said. Costs during the latest three months rose by 6 per cent, to Dollars 3bn, while revenues edged up only 2 per cent, to Dollars 3.5bn. Kodak also announced after-tax charges of Dollars 30m for write-downs of some inventory and servicing agreements. It refused to give further details of the charges. After-tax earnings for the period, at Dollars 264m, or 79 cents a share, were down from Dollars 371m, or Dollars 1.13, a year ago. The decline also reflects the falling US dollar. Currency differences accounted for a Dollars 57m decrease in net earnings compared with the year before, and Dollars 107m in the first half as a whole. The company said this was partly the result of the ending of beneficial currency hedges which had boosted profits last year. It declined to give details of its hedging strategy, or the other factors that contributed to the negative currency effect. For the first half of the year, net income fell to Dollars 346m, from Dollars 520m (before accounting changes) in the first six months of 1993.</p>

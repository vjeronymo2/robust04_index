			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Visions of real life in robust Rimini - Nigel Andrews takes a rest cure in his favourite Adriatic resort 'When the myriad lights are turned on at night', says the guidebook, 'you are no longer on good solid Romagna earth, but in wonderland, and the dazzled eyes of hundreds of thousands of contemporary inhabitants conjure up prohibited visions of Las Vegas or Miami Beach.' AH, THOSE prohibited visions. As a longtime withdrawal-symptoms sufferer after being prohibited from envisioning Las Vegas and Miami Beach, I am now a fully-accredited lover of Rimini, and have been for many years. Birthplace of Federico Fellini, watering place for Emilia Romagna, it has a robust cheerfulness unrivalled (in my experience) in northern Italy. I go there every year for a rest cure after two weeks at the Venice film festival. First essential: you must not think that the popular Adriatic resort is all fish and chips and Watneys pubs. True, it is fronted by four miles of noisy, polyglot sand. That is almost all that the TV travel programmes ever show you: the Lungomare Marconi (beach), the Viale Vespucci (parallel shopping street) and the interchangeable glass-box hotels between the two. Here, families on packages disport in and out of a sea that is surprisingly alluring in algae-free years. For children, the beach areas are equipped with mini-playgrounds; for grown-ups, with bars and little cafes; for passers-by, with some seriously wacky and enjoyable design features. I would especially like a few art critics to check out the Oasis Beach with its Rousseau-like jungle-painted arch and camel motif. I like this aspect of Rimini, but it would be without spiritual lungs if deprived of the beauties downtown, so take an extended stroll between bathing sessions. Sample the Malatesta Temple, with its 15th century Florentine facade by Alberti grafted on to an earlier Franciscan basilica. The interior boasts exquisite liquefactious bas-reliefs by Agostino Di Duccio, indicating that the art nouveau spirit was alive and well in Italy in the 1450s, and a Piero Della Francesca fresco. Then look at the Piazza Tre Martiri, former Roman forum with gracious 15th century clocktower; the 27 BC Arch of Augustus, claiming to be the oldest of Roman arches; the craggy Castel Sigismondo, and the elegant Bridge of Tiberius, which still allows traffic across it even though time has gnawed at its arches like rats at a wedding cake. You are now ready for your afternoon sea-bathe. But I am not going with you. I have never bathed in the sea at Rimini, preferring to spoil myself at the Grand Hotel with its quiet flower-girt pool. One cannot afford this place, goodness knows: Pounds 100 a night in the low season, more in the high. But it is only for a long weekend. And is there a more beautiful edge-of-town hotel in Italy? The rooms are cool, high-ceilinged and furnitured in walnut. And the bathrooms are so large that you can imagine yourself in one of those 'white telephone' movies of yesteryear, when Gina Lollobrigida or Silvana Mangano would pick the gleaming instrument out of the bath foam and coo down it to Marcello Mastroianni or Vittorio De Sica. As for the gardens, you will understand why I need this place after Venice. Bosky bowers of pine, the occasional willow, a dove aviary and a fountain with a stone Neptune pointing a trident at the reception desk. The garden is artfully floodlit at night, inviting the hotel's dinner guests to waft down the steps into the fragrant Arcady. You should have a car in Rimini so that you can visit nearby Pesaro (optional), Urbino (essential) and Italia In Miniatura (take the children). This last is a knee-high theme park. You wander concrete walkways between pint-size simulacra of St Peter's, the Colosseum, the Doge's Palace. Every famous Italian erection is here, with a circular monorail to allow aerial views. Make sure you also visit the woody enclosure at the park's rear where large plaster dinosaurs roam. Pesaro and Urbino offer culture. The first has a fine picture gallery and a 15th century ducal palace. The second is a hilltop town with another ducal palace that will blow your eyes out. Rising tall into the sky from a corniche on the edge of town, its sun-bleached pink stone ascends four floors, flanked by round towers. White loggias frame the windows, which gaze down on a verdant valley. You may not want to venture inside the town - enough to goggle at this 15th century masterpiece built by a Dalmatian architect for the local Montefeltro family - but if you do you will find Raphael's birthplace and the well-stocked National Gallery of the Marches. Back in Rimini, the sun is sinking and the beaches are emptying into the Viale Vespucci. Let us not be snobbish. This is a thoroughly cheerful street after dark, give or take a few English soccer hooligans and mad German families in lederhosen. One may eat at La Taverna Degli Artisti or (better) Chez Nous or (better still) La Cafe En Rose. Then one may sit at a pavement cafe sipping one of those small black bullets called espressi. The world will pass by and you can play the game called 'First person to spot a Scotsman in a kilt eating a cornetto ice while reading Il Corriere Della Sera wins a free sambuca.' I have never won such a game yet, but while there is Rimini there is hope.</p>

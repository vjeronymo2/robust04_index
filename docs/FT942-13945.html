			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Much safer in Channel Sir, Mr Kevin Shilleto (Letters, April 19) is concerned about shipping traffic control in the Channel and the risk of collision. The Channel Navigation Information Service (CNIS) is based at Dover and was introduced in 1972 and provides a 24-hour radar watch and radio safety service for all shipping in the Dover Strait and adjacent waters. Navigational safety information is provided to all safety agencies, both in the UK and on the Continent, on a reciprocal basis. The CNIS is operated by HM Coastguard to help ensure the safety of navigation in the busiest part of the Channel. Coverage extends some 110 nautical miles from the Greenwich Meridian through the Dover Strait in a north-easterly direction. Regular broadcasts give warnings of navigational difficulties, including defective navigational aids and the presence of hampered vessels and reports on unfavourable weather conditions, adverse visibility or exceptional tides. Ships using the ship movement reporting scheme (MAREP) are tracked as well as those contravening the International Collision Regulations. Their position, course and speed are broadcast to all ships in the immediate area. Offenders are identified by using Coastguard aerial patrols or other ships, and follow-up action is taken by the Marine Safety Agency through respective flag states and shipowners. In the last two decades, shipping in the Channel has become safer; the average number of annual collisions has fallen from 30 to fewer than five, despite more traffic. Mackay of Ardbrecknish, minister for aviation and shipping, Department of Transport, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB</p>

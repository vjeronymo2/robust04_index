			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cal-Almond also claimed that the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval of creditable activities means that handlers cannot change their advertising plan for the entire year. Cal-Almond also objected to the requirement that handlers submit proof of at least one approved advertising activity by January 15 of each year. Sharon Wiggin, on behalf of Wiggin Farms, also stated that the form filing requirements and deadlines contained in the interim final rule are difficult to meet. The Department has determined that these comments have merit. The purpose of the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval of creditable activities under the new program was to ensure that handlers were aware that the activity was eligible for Credit-Back prior to expending funds for the activity. In the past, the Board occasionally had to reject claims for activities that did not qualify after the promotional activity had already been conducted by the handler. The pre-approval provision was only intended to assist handlers by helping them avoid any unnecessary outlays of funds for activities that did not qualify for credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that the pre-approval provision was not essential to the successful administration of the program. As previously explained, this provision was only intended to assist handlers. Handlers will no longer be required to obtain pre-approval of creditable activities from the Board under the new program as modified in this final rule. The Board will continue to assist any handler in determining whether an advertising and promotional activity is eligible for Credit-Back under the new program prior to the handler expending funds for the activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which allows Credit-Back payments only for the portion of product weight represented by almonds or the handler's actual payment, whichever is less. The commenter claims that this provision works against those handlers who apply for Credit-Back for advertising of processed products that contain only a small percentage of almonds. The new Credit-Back program is, however, intended to allow Credit-Back only for money actually spent for advertising California almonds, not for advertising another product. As discussed previously, the Board believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler's credit originates from assessments on almonds, not on other products. Without the percentage rule, the best interests of the entire industry would not be served because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing to do with the almond industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which requires a handler's name, brand, or the words ``California almonds,'' to appear on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. The commenter contended that, because nearly all almonds produced in the United States are grown in California, the requirement that the word ``California'' be placed on the label is unnecessary and may limit marketing opportunities for some handlers in their negotiations with product manufacturers. The intent, however, of the new advertising and promotion program is to promote the sale and consumption of ``California'' almonds, not other ingredients in products or almonds not grown in California. This provision will help ensure that advertising generated by the new Credit-Back program is, indeed, for almonds grown in California. In addition, the provision is not limited to the word ``California'' being placed on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers can also negotiate with product manufacturers for the appearance of the handler's name or brand on the primary face label in order to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers have three alternatives under the new program, all of which ensure the promotion of ``California'' almonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cal-Almond, Thomas L. Motta, on behalf of Western Nut Company, Grant Ecker, and Sharon Wiggin objected to handlers being required to expend advertising and promotion funds up-front in order to be eligible for a Credit-Back refund at a later date. Cal-Almond also stated that handlers should not have to wait until February 15 of the crop year to begin receiving Credit-Back refunds and that they should not have to wait 30 days after submission of claims to receive a refund. The Department has determined that these comments have merit. Because payment practices have been changed under the new Credit-Back program, the up-front payment may not provide some handlers with enough flexibility early in the crop year to conduct their advertising and promotional activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional activities may now receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility early in the crop year to conduct their advertising and promotional activities, this final rule will be modified to allow handlers to receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

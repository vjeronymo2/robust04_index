			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Security Council is scheduled to discuss  developments in Yemen. The Yemeni Government has expressed its  resentment and stated that it viewed such deliberations as  interference in Yemeni internal affairs. More in the following  report:    Yemeni Presidential Council member 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, who arrived in Amman last night on his way to New  York to participate in the Council deliberations, said that he  will explain to the Council some points dealing with the  situation in Yemen.    He emphasized that what is taking place in the Republic of  Yemen is an internal affair that does not call for deliberations  at international forums. He said what is taking place in Yemen  is a movement carried out by elements from the Socialist Party  against constitutional legitimacy and the elections from which  legitimate establishments were set up. He said these elements  want to Yemen to return to the way it was before May 1990 when  the country was united.    He said his tour seeks to discuss with the friends and  brothers how to deal with the Republic of Yemen in accordance  with the principles of international law, which call for  respecting sovereignty of states and noninterference in internal  affairs.    The Yemeni minister [title as heard] emphasized that the  legitimate Yemeni forces are in control of the battlefields on  which the separatist forces are fighting.    In his visit to Jordan and his trip to New York,  'Abd-al-Ghani is accompanied by Yemeni Justice Minister  'Abdallah Ahamd Ghanim. The two Yemeni ministers were received  upon arrival in Amman by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting  minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Yemeni ambassador  in  Amman. [passage omitted]</p>

I have reporter Rey Rodriguez on the  line, who is accompanying the foreign minister as a  representative of the Cuban radio and television network and  PRENSA LATINA. Rodriguez will give us further details on the  foreign minister's activities, for all Cubans.    Rodriguez, I think it is appropiate to tell the Cuban people  about the initial activities in Jakarta of the Cuban delegation  headed by Roberto Robaina. Greetings from Havana, Rey.    [Rodriguez] Well. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  arrived in Jakarta tonight at approximately 1930 for an official  visit to Indonesia, the first leg of his tour of seven Asian  countries. At the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport, the  foreign minister was welcomed by Sukhari Siregar, director of  the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's American Department, and by  Latin American ambassadors accredited to this country.    When asked by the local press, Robaina said that one of the  objectives of this trip is to describe the true situation in his  country, as well as the reforms being carried out in the  economic area. Concerning Robaina's objective in the commercial  area, which is to strengthen trade relations with this country,  Robaina said:    [Begin Robaina recording] From the commercial point of view,  there are already important links with Indonesia. But above all,  there are new possibilities for investments in my country. In  the medical and pharmaceutical industry, and in the area of  (?meteorology), Cuba has obtained modest results which I think  may be of interest to you. In the particular case of Cuban  relations with Indonesia, you are aware of certain negotiations  that have already been established. These areas are as important  as rice, oil, and [word indistinct] which we hope will be  increased. [end recording]    This is all we can tell you about the Cuban foreign  minister's activities today in Jakarta. Are you listening there,  Cavada?    [Cavada] Yes. We read you clearly, Rey. We wish to thank you  for the work you are doing and for providing us with further  information on the activities of the Cuban foreign minister and  his retinue in Jakarta. This has a been a live, direct link with  reporter Rey Rodriguez who is accompanying Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina Gonzalez through several Asian countries,  beginning with Indonesia.</p>

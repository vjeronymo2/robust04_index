			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CUBAN-BORN REPUBLICANS MAKE BID  </P> <P> Two Cuban-born Republicans today entered the race for the congressional seat  left vacant by the death of Claude Pepper, the liberal Democrat whose district  came to be dominated by conservative Latinos.  </P> <P> State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and conservative businessman Carlos Perez  announced bids to become the first Cuban-American in Congress. The Miami Herald  reported today that Democratic state Sen. Jack Gordon will also run in the  special election Aug. 29.  </P> <P> In announcing her candidacy, Ros-Lehtinen pledged to carry on Pepper's "caring  conscience and conservative convictions." Pepper was a lifelong liberal who had  been vilified by Republicans in the '50s as "Red Pepper."  </P> <P> Republicans this year are hoping to win control of the district, whose  registration is 54% Democrat, down from 72% a decade ago. Latinos, including 1  million Cuban emigres, are estimated to make up nearly half the district.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> SEVERANCE PAY BENEFIT PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council voted 3 to 2 to increase City Manager Paul Brotzman's  severance pay from six to nine months if he is dismissed from his position with  the city.  </P> <P> The severance protection, part of a benefits package, was granted in part  because Brotzman had not requested a pay increase this year. Brotzman was hired  by the city in 1985. Councilman Paul Koretz, who voted against the provision,  said that nine months severance is "too long."  </P></p>

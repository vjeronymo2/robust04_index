			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / MMC fears on house valuations The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is set to publish a report detailing a number of concerns about mortgage lenders' control over the valuation profession. While the MMC broadly accepts the lenders' argument that they must retain control over valuations in order to protect themselves from fraud, the report says independent surveyors are suffering. With few exceptions, lenders select or nominate the valuer, giving borrowers no choice in the matter. This frequently forces borrowers to pay for more than one survey. According to an MMC draft obtained by the Economist magazine, the report says it has become more difficult for independent surveyors to be appointed to the panels of valuers approved by lenders. More than 80 per cent of applications by valuers to join their panels were rejected by the main lenders in 1992. The increasing difficulty in being appointed to lenders' panels is partly a result of a downturn in market demand and the need to contain the costs of panel management. Also, more valuation work is going to the lenders' in-house valuers and subsidiary companies, partly as a result of the wave of acquisitions of estate agents by building societies in the second half of the 1980s. The MMC report notes that many valuers are required to introduce mortgage business to lenders as a condition of being appointed to their panel. A survey commissioned by the MMC found that about a quarter of valuers introduced new business to lenders. This practice has provoked concern from valuers' professional associations which believe that it unfairly discriminates against valuers who are unable to introduce business because, for example, they are not associated with estate agencies or intermediaries. The MMC report also highlights the valuation fees charged by valuers associated with lenders. In 1993 an average of 60 per cent of the fees of independent valuers were lower than those levied by the lender. It also found that a number of large lenders, which together account for more than 25 per cent of the market, did not identify their administration charge in their marketing literature. The report says there is an element of cross-subsidy between different borrowers. Valuation charges are greater for properties in regions with higher-than-average house prices, such as south-east England, although the workload for the valuer is the same.</p>

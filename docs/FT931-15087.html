			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian lithium deal set to be shelved BOLIVIAN MINING officials say it is now almost certain that a deal to mine the world's biggest reserves of lithium, a light, heat-resistant metal used in the manufacture of aluminium, ceramics and glass, is to be shelved indefinitely. The collapse after five years of negotiations, between Lithco, a subsidiary of the FMC corporation, and successive Bolivian governments should be announced officially by early February. Lithco has given the government 30 days to shift its negotiating position, an eventuality now seen as extremely unlikely. This was a crucial deal for both parties. Lithco, facing competition in the lithium field from Cyprus Minerals, already present in neighbouring Chile, and needing a surface mining operation to enable it to convince foreign investors it was ready to do business, was equally eager for a deal. According to calculations by Mr Fernando Urquidi Barrau, a respected observer of the mining scene, the Bolivian government stood to make about Dollars 30m a year for the 40 year duration of the contracts. The affair will further damage Bolivia's image with foreign investors, particularly in the light of the recent fiasco over joint venture contracts between the private and state sectors. While emphasising that existing private mining ventures fare well, Mr Charles Bruce, executive vice president of mining consultants, Mintec, acknowledges this is a 'black eye for the government'. Despite appearances, however, the government is not entirely to blame. As Mr Urquidi contends: 'It looks as if Bolivia kicked Lithco out, but this is an incorrect impression'. Mr Urquidi speculates that Lithco was using both the Salar de Uyuni deposit in Bolivia and the similar Salar del Hombre Muerto deposit in Argentina as bargaining chips in a bid to secure rights to the Atacama deposit in Chile. Observers believe Lithco may have already signed a contract with Amax Minerals and Energy, the American company that owns the rights to the Chilean deposit. Lithco has been a tough negotiator with Bolivia throughout. It insisted on a 40-year contract with a ceiling of 400,000 tonnes of lithium. In addition, it demanded a 10 per cent VAT rate rather than the usual 13 per cent. The Bolivian government eventually agreed to these terms, reducing its profit share rather than openly caving in on the VAT issue. The contract was signed by the Bolivian president on February 1992 and ratified by congress, though with three additional clauses which proved unacceptable to the company. It is widely believed that Lithco had by then decided to pursue the Chilean deposit. Although Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni is believed to hold the largest lithium deposits in the world, it is apparently contaminated by high quantities of magnesium, which complicates the exploitation process. Infrastructure in Chile is far better. Furthermore, Chile is perceived to be more politically stable than Bolivia. Ultimately this was crucial in Bolivia's loss of the deal. Lithco and Cyprus are the only corporations with the capability to mine lithium on such a scale. Both have now apparently secured deposits which will see them into the next century, leaving Bolivia out in the cold.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sonja Modric: "Parliament Is No Longer Mouthpiece </F> of HDZ and President Tudjman"]    [Excerpt] Zagreb -- After yesterday' first round of talks  between the opposition leaders on the distribution of assembly  posts that the opposition is entitled to have according to the  agreement with the ruling party, the Liberals held a news  conference in the assembly building yesterday. All members of  the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] tacitly supported in  front of journalists the view of their president Drazen Budisa  that all the participants in the negotiations on the  distribution of power in the assembly and the settlement of the  parliamentary crisis "had demonstrated a high degree of  political maturity and responsibility." Budisa expressed the  hope that the agreement would indeed be respected by all sides.  He guaranteed on behalf of the opposition that this would be all  the opposition would do.    Budisa declined to reveal the details of the talks on the  opposition's candidates and the tactics of future moves in the  assembly. Stressing that he was not authorized to talk about  that yet, Budisa only conveyed the HSLS' view: Damir Zoric  should remain the vice chairman of the Chamber of Counties. The  Liberals are also demanding the post of the deputy chairman in  the Chamber of Representatives for their candidate Goran Granic,  who was nominated in a secret ballot. As Budisa said himself,  he is not a candidate for any of the available posts in the  assembly as he is involved only in the work in the party.    Asked by the NOVI LIST journalist to comment on the view  held  by a section of the opposition that the opposition did not  profit as much as it could have from the agreement, Budisa used  the allegory: A rope can be stretched to the maximum, but then  there is a danger of it snapping. It is better to have some  kind of assembly than not to have one at all. A chaos and the  collapse of the system do not suit the opposition. Only the  undemocratic forces could wish a chaotic situation. So, Budusa  takes the view that the opposition has gotten as much as it  could, and that the consequences will be significant. The  situation in the assembly, as he said, has already changed. The  Croatian Assembly can no longer function as the mouthpiece  [transmisija] of the ruling party and the president of the  republic. The rift in the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ]  will continue.  <H5>  Croatian Democratic Community Has Lost Power </H5>   The Croatian Democratic Community has lost the power it had  and one should hope that it will behave accordingly in the  future. Budisa mentioned the upcoming election of the assembly  leadership, which will include chairman and deputy chairmen of  the chambers and the heads of committees and commissions. Since  the opposition is getting a significant number of places in this  way, it is clear that its influence will be much greater.  [passage omitted]</p>

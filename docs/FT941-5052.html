			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (1): Debt control takes cash flow strain - As the UK economy recovers from recession, the need for good credit management is greater than ever. Increasingly, companies are hiring specialists - and an explosion of IT applications is making their task easier Not so long ago, a bank's guarded statement 'considered good' and two trade references would have given suppliers sufficient comfort to start shipping goods to new customers. Credit management was frequently divorced from the sales process. The credit controller was viewed as someone who impeded rather than the supported the sales force. But the economic downturn has put paid to such quaint - and arguably misguided - practices, ushering in a marked change in the way companies manage their credit controls. 'The recession has seen company margins narrow so they cannot afford either bad debts or very slow repayment,' says Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Institute of Credit Management. 'There has been a push to bring in more specialist employees to manage risk.' Five years ago the position of credit manager might have been filled by a company secretary, the finance director or even a clerk in the accounts department. But in the last few years there has been a sharp increase in the number of UK companies appointing very senior credit managers, many reporting directly to the board. Credit managers, both within companies and those who collate and supply reports in the credit information industry, are also increasingly well served by new information technology. 'A decade ago the operation was a manual one,' says Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the leading credit information supplier. 'Reports were being typed out and that barred a lot of companies from entering the business-to-business market.' Now companies such as UAPT-Infolink and CNN are using technology to present information in a manner which is breaking down the barriers to better knowledge about customers. The explosion of technology coincides with a withering assault on prices. Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the ICM agree that prices in the last 10 years have halved. Selective services - for example, a search to see if potential customers have any county court judgments against them - can cost as little as Pounds 4, says Phillips. While Dun &amp; Bradstreet remains the dominant supplier, with about 45 per cent of the business-to-business credit information market in the UK, Infocheck has leapt from nowhere in little more than a decade to control nearly a fifth of the market. Others to enter the market include Graydon (owned by leading credit insurance groups NCM, Hermes and Coface), CCN and ICC Information Group. One way in which companies have tried to combat these price pressures has been to take the expensive keying-in of information to countries which have lower labour costs. A number of credit information companies have set up operations in the Philippines or Sri Lanka. UAPT-Infolink, a company better known in the consumer credit market, but rapidly growing in the business-to-business market, has recently set up in Harare, Zimbabwe. However, cutting costs may not be enough. As technology has taken over many of the most repetitive manual functions it is becoming increasingly obvious that there is huge duplication of the industry's raw material: information. Some form of consolidation within the industry would not only make sense, but is likely. 'It is a recognised fact that there are too many players in the market and there will probably be mergers within the next year,' says one senior executive of newer credit information company. Many observers of the industry share this view. Inevitably, attention has focused on what Dun &amp; Bradstreet might do to retake some of the market share it has lost. But what is the size of the market pool in which the six largest credit providers are fishing? In spite of the marked increase in demand for professional credit managers and the increase in sales of the leading external credit information providers, there still appears to be a sizeable market to go for. Philip Mellor, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says that suppliers only seek credit information for one in 19 transactions before they start to trade. It is another mark of credit management's lack of penetration that of the 955,000 or so companies which file balance sheets (most of which offer credit terms), considerably less than 10 per cent actually use the services of an independent credit information service. Trevor Phillips of the ICM says these figures are too low. Many smaller companies take up credit references using their trade organisations or the local chamber of commerce, he says. He estimates that any business with a credit controller will be using external credit references for 60 per cent of accounts where there is exposure of over Pounds 500. Nevertheless, the ICM and the government have recognised the need for better information. A brochure on credit management called 'Making the Cash Flow,' published with the UK Department of Trade and Industry last year, sold like hot cakes and is being rushed into a second edition. But if technology is rapidly bringing down the price of credit information - and turning into something of a commodity product - how are the providers attempting to differentiate their products? One way is more user-friendly presentation and on-line credit referencing. Some groups are developing specialist knowledge; others are focusing on packaging the information in a more user-friendly manner. And at least one group is making software packages that allow a company's own credit policies to be mixed with raw credit data on customers to produce credit recommendations. One of the most exciting developments in the area is CD-ROM technology. According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Philip Mellor: 'It has really been able to provide the delivery systems and format data in a way people can understand and at a price they can afford.' While falling prices, static profits and overcapacity might suggest an industry with its tail between its legs, the reality is different. One group, Infolink, could well be seeking a stock exchange listing in the near future. The group, which has a number of venture capital companies on its shareholders' list, had hoped to float before 1991 but was thwarted by the recession. The industry as a whole has also benefited from the debate about whether there should be a statutory right to interest on debts paid late. While remaining agnostic about whether legislation is necessary, credit information suppliers have jumped - rightly - at the opportunity to point out that their services can identify persistent late payers. By arming suppliers with this information before the shipment of goods or provision of services, companies can decide if they really want the business or whether they want to renegotiate payment terms. Furthermore, the industry might be about to receive a boost from the clearing banks. In a little-publicised move, this month the clearers will change the way in which they give the traditional credit references. Until now, suppliers have been able to approach their own banks for credit references on potential customers. Sometimes the service has been supplied free, sometimes the cost is included in bank charges. From March 28, the same supplier will have to approach the customer's bank for a reference which will cost over Pounds 8. Some may find requesting permission of potential clients to seek references the equivalent of commercial suicide; others may examine what will still be a relatively perfunctory report, and realise that credit information suppliers provide a more detailed service for a similar price. But probably the industry is going to expand its market best by talking more loudly about what credit management can offer a modern manager. 'We have a big educational process ahead of us,' says Martin Williams, Graydon's commercial director. 'People out there do not understand or know what they can get with a credit reference.'</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / BR offers 4% rise to most of workforce BRITISH RAIL yesterday offered most of its workforce a basic pay rise of 4 per cent. The offer to 96,000 workers would add about Pounds 57m to BR's annual wages bill. Unions had expected bigger rises, and the Aslef drivers' union is asking for a starting wage of Pounds 22,000 a year, which is more than double the present rate. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee relations director, told union officials that the offer was in line with inflation and settlements elsewhere. The RMT union said: 'We are disappointed with the response, but we have said we will take it away and look at it.' BR said the offer would increase the basic weekly rate for drivers by Pounds 7.94 to Pounds 206.54. Typical station staff would receive an extra Pounds 5.51 a week, taking their basic rate to Pounds 143.16.</p>

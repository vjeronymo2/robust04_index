Deputy General Director Stanko  Zivkovic enumerated several problems which make the start up of  the factory's operations difficult and expressed hope that they  will not be insurmountable. The greatest problem is the delivery  of crude oil through the Iriski Venac, where the traffic is  difficult, especially for heavy tank trucks. Matroz does not  even have the minimum supply of crude oil and is unable to start  the production. Six tank trucks were supposed to arrive  yesterday, but only four did, and today only four of eight  scheduled trucks arrived.    "Just putting the machines in operation is not without  risk,"  Zivkovic says. "The machines were idle for an entire month, and  it is not easy to start even a car if it has not been operated  for that amount of time. But there is hope that everything will  be okay."    In the early afternoon hours the factory had still not  started to operate. Three to four hours are needed to start  producing the first quantities of paper. Zivkovic says that some  paper could start to be delivered to the newspaper publishing  houses as early as tomorrow.</p>

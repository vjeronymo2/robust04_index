			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Channel 4 expects Pounds 200m surcharge CHANNEL 4 forecast yesterday it would have to give more than Pounds 200m to the ITV companies during its present 10-year licence period. The scale of the cost of the 'insurance policy' to protect Channel 4's financial structure was revealed in a submission to the Commons national heritage committee, which is looking at the future of British broadcasting. Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, half of any Channel 4 income in excess of 14 per cent of total independent television advertising revenue goes to the ITV companies. The rest is placed in a reserve fund to compensate it if revenues ever fall below 12 per cent. Channel 4's board has assured the all-party committee that it intends to pay its way throughout its 10-year licence and that as a result 'there will be substantial transfers of money' from Channel 4 to ITV. If Channel 4 is successful over the first half of the licence period the level of reserves built up will more than cover any later downside risks. This year ITV will get more than Pounds 30m from Channel 4 and the total is expected to be more than Pounds 200m over the full licence period. Channel 4 expects revenue of Pounds 325m in 1993. In spite of the high cost of the 'insurance policy', Channel 4 wants to stick to the arrangement in the interests of stability. Mr Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive, appealed to the MPs yesterday for a period of stability. He also accused Sky Television of 'ripping off' the public by charging large amounts for sporting events and films and said it would be 'a tragedy' if Sky bought up events such as Wimbledon. A US cable company has raised more than Pounds 270m to invest in building cable television and telephone networks in the UK, the largest sum to be raised by the industry so far it is believed. International CableTel has raised Dollars 411m (Pounds 274m) in a mixture of debt and equity in New York to build cable networks in England, Scotland and Wales. Altogether the company, which includes the former interests of Insight Communications, holds franchises covering 950,000 homes in the UK. They are for Huddersfield, Guildford, Cardiff and Newport and west Glasgow.</p>

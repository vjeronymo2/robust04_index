			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PADRES' PITCHING HITS THE SPOT AS DODGERS WIN, 6-2  </P> <P> The Dodgers may be the worst hitting team in baseball, but they found a soft  touch Wednesday night against the Padres.  </P> <P> Facing a pitching staff that has given up more home runs than any in the  National League, the Dodgers hit three into the bleachers at San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium to power their way to a 6-2 victory in front of 29,336.  </P> <P> All three homers came off starter Ed Whitson and all came with two out.  </P> <P> The damage was early and complete.  </P> <P> Mike Davis and Jeff Hamilton hit two-run homers in the first inning and Eddie  Murray added a bases-empty homer in the fifth.  </P> <P> Davis' homer was his second in three games against the Padres, and Murray's was  his first since he hit two in a game in Philadelphia on May 14.  </P> <P> Murray had gone 35 games and 127 at-bats without a homer and had only two hits  in his previous 28 at-bats. The homer came after Murray walked in his first two  plate appearances.  </P> <P> "We just got beat by the long ball," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "We didn't  have our outfielders up high enough."  </P> <P> The victory prevented the Padres from sweeping the three-game series.  </P> <P> Starting pitcher Tim Leary (6-5) came within three outs of his first complete  game since April 16, but he yielded to Jay Howell after giving up a lead-off  single to shortstop Garry Templeton in the ninth.  </P> <P> Howell retired the first two Padres in order before a fielding error by  Hamilton on pinch-hitter Carmelo Martinez's grounder to third extended the  inning. Howell struck out Shawn Abner to end the game.  </P> <P> "It was a toss-up whether to take me out," Leary said. "But Jay was warmed up,  and they had a right-hander coming up. It was a good move."  </P> <P> In earning his third victory in four starts, Leary gave up 10 hits and two  runs, only one of which was earned. That came on catcher Mark Parent's  bases-empty homer in the seventh. The Padres' other run was unearned and came  after a passed ball in the first inning.  </P> <P> Leary disposed of most of the other Padre threats easily. He struck out Abner  to end the second with runners on second and third. And twice he got Tony  Gwynn, who entered the game as the league's leading hitter, to ground into  double plays.  </P> <P> "Those double plays were the key," Leary said.  </P> <P> The loss was Whitson's third in a row after a career-best, seven-game winning  streak and dropped his record to 9-5.  </P> <P> Even when he was winning, home runs had plagued Whitson.  </P> <P> He had given up 13 in his previous 14 starts. The three by the Dodgers raised  his total of 16, high on a pitching staff that has allowed a National  League-leading 68 home runs.  </P> <P> "As far as the home runs are concerned, it was just bad pitch selection, bad  location, too," Whitson said. "Three pitches took me out of the game."  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive start home runs had cost Whitson a game. In his  previous start, Whitson gave up all the runs on two homers in a 3-1 loss to  Houston.  </P> <P> And just as in that loss, the clincher was a two-run homer in the first inning.  </P> <P> Whitson retired the first two batters, but then walked Murray. Davis followed  with his fourth homer, a drive that carried three rows into the right-field  bleachers for a 2-0 lead. The homer was Davis' second of the series and the  ninth the Padres have allowed to a player named Davis. Eric Davis of Cincinnati  has hit five against the Padres and Glenn Davis of Houston has hit two.  </P> <P> Mike Scioscia then singled to center before Hamilton took Whitson's 1-0 pitch  into the first row of bleachers in left-center field for a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> The Padres cut the lead to 4-1 with an unearned run in the bottom of the  inning.  </P> <P> Gwynn doubled home second baseman Roberto Alomar, who had singled and advanced  to second on a passed ball with one out. Leary avoided further trouble by  striking out Jack Clark and getting Marvell Wynne to ground out to the mound to  end the inning.  </P> <P> Murray hit his homer in the fifth to put the Dodgers ahead, 5-1.  </P> <P> The Dodgers made the score 6-1 on an RBI double by Willie Randolph in the  seventh against reliever Pat Clements.  </P> <P> Parent's homer above the 370-foot mark in right-center field in the bottom of  the seventh closed the scoring. Parent was making a last-minute start in place  of Benito Santiago, who had been given permission by McKeon to miss the game to  be with his wife, Blanca, who was hospitalized to give birth to the couple's  second child.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> News of the New York Yankees' trade of Rickey Henderson to the Oakland  Athletics on Wednesday caught Fred Claire, Dodger vice president for player  personnel, by surprise. Claire said he learned of the trade from reporters  shortly before the Dodgers' game against the Padres. Claire said he had talked  to Syd Thrift, Yankee general manager, about Henderson's availability as part  of an ongoing effort to acquire an established lead-off hitter. "We'd like to  get some help at the top of our order," Claire said. "I am searching and hoping  to find an answer that will help our offense." Henderson was traded for  outfielder Luis Polonia and pitchers Greg Cadaret and Eric Plunk. "Syd was  looking for pitching," Claire said. "That was clearly a need of the Yankees."  It also is a commodity the Dodgers have in good supply. Claire said he will  continue his search for more hitting. "My desire to improve our offense gets  greater as our offensive struggles increase," Claire said. The Dodgers entered  Wednesday night's game with a .227 batting average, worst in the major leagues.  But more puzzling, Claire said, was that despite their low average, the Dodgers  are second only to the Padres in runners left on base with 506. The problem has  been that Dodgers are hitting .202 with runners in scoring position. "We're  just not getting the timely hits," Claire said. "There is a lot of pride in  defending a world championship, and at times you just try too hard." . . . The  Dodgers are off today before starting a four-game series in Cincinnati Friday.  </P></p>

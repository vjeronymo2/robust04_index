			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD CARE BILL PASSES SENATE IN SHARP DEBATE  </P> <P> Amid bitter partisan wrangling and the threat of a presidential veto, the  Senate Friday approved a Democratic-backed child care bill that would provide  $1.75 billion annually for low-income parents and some $2 billion in tax  credits for day care programs.  </P> <P> The legislation was approved on a voice vote and now moves to the House, which  is expected to begin consideration of its own child care proposals next week.  </P> <P> "This bill does not provide aid to every child in this country who needs it,"  Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine said. "But it is a  significant step forward and a true compromise with both sides. That's what  we've accomplished here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Candidate for a Veto'  </P> <P> Hours before the final vote, however, Bush Administration spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater declared that the measure is unacceptable to the President and is "a  candidate for a veto." Although Bush has not ruled out a compromise, he has  said that there are "major flaws" in the legislation approved by the Senate.  </P> <P> Senate Republicans also criticized the Democratic measure, saying that the  fight to pass a child care bill is far from over. Minority Leader Bob Dole of  Kansas warned that "we're a long way from any child care bill, because this was  not bipartisan. Anybody who breaks out the champagne should realize that what  we did today is only a first step."  </P> <P> During seven days of often vitriolic debate, Democrats and Republicans clashed  over radically different approaches to child care. They also battled for the  high ground on an issue that both parties believe is a growing national  concern.  </P> <P> Currently, the federal government spends an estimated $7 billion each year on  child care programs. But much of that is in the form of a tax credit claimed  mostly by middle-income parents and both parties contend that more should be  done for the working poor.  </P> <P> "Everybody around here is for child care, the last time I looked," Dole said.  "We just disagree pretty strongly on how to proceed. I don't know if we can  find a middle ground."  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Democrats won a showdown vote with Republicans over rival  blueprints for a child care bill. They turned back a series of GOP amendments  Friday that would have gutted the pending legislation and reinstated key  elements of the Republican proposal.  </P> <P> On a key 53-44 vote, the Senate rejected a motion by Dole to delete a  Democratic-sponsored tax credit for low-income parents who buy health insurance  for their children. In its place, Dole had proposed expanding the existing  Earned Income Tax Credit, saying that would give low-income parents more funds  to spend on day care.  </P> <P> Hoping to win Republican support, Democrats voted to incorporate some elements  of the original GOP plan into their child care legislation, including a version  of the earned income tax credit. But Republicans continued to hammer away at  the Democratic measure, saying that the two sides remained far apart.  </P> <P> Under the Democratic plan, the government would distribute $1.75 billion in  grants and direct aid annually to low-income parents for day care programs.  States would be required to establish licensing standards for child care before  receiving any aid.  </P> <P> The aid would be available for children up to age 13. California would receive  approximately $168.4 million annually in federal funds under the Democratic  measure, based on the number of potentially eligible children.  </P> <P> In addition, the measure would provide about $2 billion in tax credits for  low-income families in each of the next five years. These would include  increases in the existing dependent care and earned income tax credits, as well  as the new credit for health insurance.  </P> <P> By contrast, Bush and Senate Republicans had offered a combination of tax  credits and $400 million for unspecified day care programs. They contended that  the Democratic plan would create a massive bureaucracy for day care, while  their own proposal maximized "parental choice." More important, they said, the  GOP tax credits would provide assistance for mothers who choose to stay at home  and take care of their children.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) said that Congress should not discriminate against  women who want to work, but cited research showing that children profit greatly  when parents stay at home to take care of them, especially in their formative  years.  </P> <P> "We should be encouraging women to stay at home with children" during these  years, Wilson said, adding that the Democratic measure "does not provide enough  incentives for the stay-at-home Mom."  </P> <P> Democrats angrily responded that their measure provided ample benefits for  mothers who do not work. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a key architect of  the bill, noted that most tax benefits in the Democratic proposal could be  shared by parents who work or stay at home.  </P> <P> The Senate also rejected a proposal by Wilson that would have permitted some  states to take federal grant funds for child care and use them instead to  provide additional tax credits.  </P> <P> Wilson said that this would give states more flexibility but Dodd charged that  the amendment would "all but destroy" the $1.75-billion day care grant program  that had been hammered out during months of negotiations.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KEITA: A MEDITATIVE AFRICAN ALTERNATIVE  </P> <P> Salif Keita's impressive local debut before a capacity audience at the Music  Machine on Thursday struck another blow against the notion that all African  music sounds alike.  </P> <P> But the Paris-based singer, an albino descendant of the 13th-Century warrior  king who founded the West African nation of Mali, did more than just add a new  regional twist.  </P> <P> The devilishly intricate arrangements and cross-melodies delivered by Keita and  his superb 10-piece backing band in two one-hour sets ran counter to the  buoyant groove aesthetic characteristic of much African music.  </P> <P> A devotional, meditative flavor pervaded the performance, one reinforced by  Keita's habit of starting most of the songs with his hands clasped in front of  him as if praying. His astonishing voice didn't lessen the effect -- Keita  frequently started his vocal phrases with a pure, piercing high note before  spiraling down with Islamic-influenced melodies.  </P> <P> Keita's hybrid blending African roots with sophisticated European pop enabled  the balafon (an African marimba) to co-exist harmoniously with electric  keyboards. It was demanding but rewarding music -- no surprise that Miles Davis  and Carlos Santana are reputedly big fans -- and Keita's performance  demonstrated he's clearly opening up new dimensions to African music.

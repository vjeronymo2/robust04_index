			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has informed the Sanaa  government of the southern leaders' conditions and demands for  beginning negotiations on the Yemeni dispute.    A ranking northern Yemeni official told AFP that Lakhdar  Brahimi contacted the leaders in Sanaa and communicated to them  a list of questions and points pertaining to the guarantees the  southerners want fulfilled to initiate negotiations with Sanaa.    The official added that the working group, chaired by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and tasked with holding contacts  with Aden, will meet today to discuss these questions. The  northern official did not elaborate further on these questions.  However, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, unilaterally proclaimed by the  southerners, said that Aden calls for an unconditional and  immediate cease-fire, the deployment of international observers  to supervise its implementation, and the return of the  aggressors, as he called them, to the pre-22 May 1990 borders,  the date unity was declared.    Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said this following his meeting  with UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi in al-Mukalla yesterday evening,  who later met with southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Following  the meeting, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that he briefed Brahimi on  the deteriorating situation in Yemen, reemphasizing that  priority should be given to a cease-fire.    Lakhdar Brahimi, contrary to what the southern officials  wanted, did not visit Aden. He said this is due to the security  instability there.    Brahimi left al-Mukalla for Abu Dhabi where he arrived  yesterday evening accompanied by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. The  Emirates News Agency says that Brahimi's visit to Abu Dhabi is  part of a tour of several Arab countries in the region.</p>

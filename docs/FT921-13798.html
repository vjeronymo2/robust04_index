			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Cresson takes legal action against Le Pen MRS EDITH CRESSON, French prime minister, has taken legal action against Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, for allegedly insulting her government. She has issued an official complaint over a speech in Brittany last week, in which Mr Le Pen called the Socialist administration 'a pack of robbers, racketeers and gangsters'. Mr Le Pen, who was referring to a police inquiry into Socialist party finances, said over the weekend he stuck by his words. The government's action is believed to be the first of its type. It is based on a 111-year-old law outlawing slander against administrations, on pain of between six days and three months in prison plus a fine of FFr150 to FFr80,000 (Pounds 8,300). Mrs Cresson's attack won support yesterday from some opposition politicians as well as from her own party. 'She not only had the right to do it, but she was right to do it,' said Mrs Monique Pelletier, a former government minister and member of the UDF centre-right grouping. This is the latest skirmish in the political activity building up in France ahead of the March regional elections. The National Front is expected to come out as an important minority, while the respectable right is expected to hold on to its large majority in regional government. The row comes just as the RPR and the UDF, the two main opposition parties, are making progress in their attempts to form an alliance for the presidential elections, due in 1995. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, UDF president, and Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR president, agreed at the weekend to speed work on forming a single party of the right. However, they remained divided on the important issue of how to choose a single presidential candidate, for which post they are fierce rivals.</p>

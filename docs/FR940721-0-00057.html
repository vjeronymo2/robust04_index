			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Final Assembly Point <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _the city, state (where appropriate), and country in which the final assembly of the vehicle occurred;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Country of Origin for the Engine;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Country of Origin for the Transmission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency proposed to require specific language for the label, including a heading, two subheadings, and an explanatory note concerning the meaning of parts content. The NPRM included a sample label, consistent with the proposed requirements, which read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> For vehicles in this carline:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> U.S./Canadian Parts Content: 50%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Japan: 20%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexico: 15%  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> For this vehicle:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=3 --> Final Assembly Point: Flint, Michigan, USA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Country of Origin:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engine: U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transmission: Canada  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Parts Content of a typical vehicle makes up about (a range was to be specified in a final rule) percent of the vehicle's total wholesale cost to the dealer.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency stated in the NPRM that it believed the proposed explanatory note would clarify the meaning of ``parts content'' to consumers, and help them understand the significance of the content information provided on the label. NHTSA noted that since the percentage of a vehicle's total wholesale cost which is made up of parts content varies for different vehicles, it believed that it would be appropriate to state the information in a range, e.g., 60 to 70 percent, 70 to 80 percent, etc. Since the agency did not have this information, it requested manufacturers to provide the information for several specific vehicles, as well as their recommendation for a range to include in a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Use of the term ``parts content.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA objected to the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content'' for describing the first item of information on the label. It argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word ``parts'' is contrary to the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA acknowledges that section 210(b)(1)(A) specifies that the information ``be identified with the words `U.S./Canadian content.''' However, the agency believes the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is consistent with this statutory requirement. The statutory language ``U.S./Canadian content'' is included within the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content.'' Consistent with its authority to specify the form and content of the required label, the agency added the word ``parts'' to indicate to prospective purchasers that the identified U.S./Canadian content is for a vehicle's parts (within a carline) rather than for the vehicle as a whole. To the extent that AAMA objects to the agency breaking up the phrase ``U.S./Canadian content,'' NHTSA could instead specify a parenthetical at the end of the term U.S./Canadian content, such as (parts). However, the agency believes that the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is preferable since it is easier to read.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that AAMA also objected to use of the term ``parts'' instead of ``equipment'' in the purpose section of Part 583. That objection would presumably also apply to the wording on the label. AAMA contended that the calculations required by the statute are based on the value and content of passenger motor vehicle equipment and not ``parts.'' Since the term ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' includes all parts except minor parts such as attachment hardware, NHTSA believes that the terms ``equipment'' and ``parts'' are interchangeable. For purposes of the label, the agency believes that the term ``parts'' is preferable to ``equipment.'' The former term is shorter and therefore takes less space. Moreover, the agency believes that consumers are more likely to understand the term ``parts.'' While it is common to refer to a vehicle being made up of parts, one does not ordinarily refer to a vehicle being made up of equipment. Also, the term ``equipment'' may have the connotation of optional accessories to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Explanatory note.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency received numerous comments on its proposal to require an explanatory note concerning the meaning of parts content. As discussed below, some commenters argued that no note should be permitted or required; others agreed that a note should be provided but argued that it should be worded differently. No commenters supported the proposed wording. Numerous manufacturers argued that the ratio of parts content value to wholesale dealer cost varies so widely among vehicles that there is no such thing as a ``typical vehicle'' in this context.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA argued against including the explanatory note. It stated that the note is not required by statute and adds a measure of confusion to the consumer because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles. GM argued that there is no authority under the Labeling Act for such a note. It stated that the proposed note does not clarify the information on the label, is an approximation, and includes elemental costs not considered by the Act. Ford stated that if NHTSA believes that clarification is necessary, it should consider an explanatory brochure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AIAM stated that it is opposed to requiring information on the label concerning a parts content percentage range as it relates to the total wholesale cost to the dealer, as this additional information would only serve to confuse the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does not include vehicle final assembly labor. That organization stated that the proposed note would clarify this to some degree, but does not go far enough. It suggested adding the following words to the note: ``and does not include vehicle final assembly labor.'' JAMA also argued that the note should include an additional statement about assembly labor for engines and transmissions not being included in country of origin label calculations for those items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota stated that the proposed note would not be helpful because of the necessary broadness of the range and the potential for additional consumer confusion. That manufacturer also stated that it does not believe a required, industry-wide explanatory statement is necessary. Toyota indicated, however, that if the agency does require an explanatory statement, it believes the statement should be one that consumers readily would understand and that would avoid confusion. It suggested the following statement: ``The U.S./Canada parts content on this label does not include final assembly or distribution costs for this vehicle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Honda supported the idea of an explanatory note, since it believes that consumers are likely to be misled by the label without it. That company did not support the proposed wording, however, since the language does not clearly tell consumers that certain specific costs are excluded. Honda also stated that it believes the inclusion of a range of the percentage of parts costs would be confusing to consumers. Honda suggested the following explanatory note: ``U.S./Canadian parts content on this label does not include final assembly or distribution costs for this vehicle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

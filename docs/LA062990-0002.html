			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL WATCH;  </P> <P> VETERANS AT WAR  </P> <P> It's sad: Once soldiers side by side. Now veterans waring among themselves.  </P> <P> Who should be listed on a proposed L.A. monument to American soldiers of  Japanese ancestry? The question threatens a community project designed to honor  those who served in three segregated World War II units.  </P> <P> One group wants the privately funded monument in Little Tokyo to list the names  of all 12,000 members -- living and dead -- of the Army's all-Japanese-American  100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Team, which served in  Europe, and the Military Intelligence Service in the Pacific. An opposing group  wants to honor only the 700 killed during World War II, but to include the  names of 325 Japanese-Americans who died during the Spanish-American War, World  War I and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.  </P> <P> The debate is muddling the intent of the monument: To make a special  acknowledgement of the blood, sweat and tears of those Japanese-American  soldiers who fought hard to prove their loyalty to the United States so their  families, unjustly interned in U.S. concentration camps during the war, would  be more readily accepted by other Americans.  </P> <P> They were tested as few others were. They deserve an enduring testimonial --  one designed with the names of all the Japanese-Americans who served in World  War II as the centerpiece of the monument. The design also could incorporate  secondarily the names of others who died in combat.  </P> <P> They don't deserve to be fought over like this.  </P></p>

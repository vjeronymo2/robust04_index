			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK set to maintain cereal crop yields The UK wheat crop is expected to rise by 3 per cent this year in an overall cereals harvest little changed from last year at 19.6m tonnes, according to preliminary estimates by the National Farmers' Union. The French wheat crop is expected to be 4 per cent higher than last year, but German barley yields could be 10 per cent lower because of drought, the NFU anticipates. The NFU points out that, although British cereals output is likely to be little changed from last year's 19.5m tonnes, the composition of the crop is expected to change significantly. Wheat production is expected to rise but barley output is forecast to fall. This reflects price expectations made by farmers when planting their crops. Bad weather caused wide variations in crop yields, but affected both wheat and barley crops in a similar way. Crop yields were broadly higher in the south and south-east and lower in the east Midlands and East Anglia, where heavy rain delayed spring planting. The NFU also pointed to much higher variations in yield within each region than had been recorded in previous years. The area sown with wheat increased by 4 per cent for the 1994 harvest, but wheat yields fell slightly from 7.3 tonnes per hectare to 7.29 tonnes per hectare, producing a crop of 13.28m tonnes. Barley planting continued its downward trend with the winter barley area falling by 3.5 per cent in England and the spring barley planting dropping by 9.6 per cent. Oilseed rape sowings are estimated to have risen by 5.8 per cent but yields in England and Wales were down by 6 per cent, leading to production remaining unchanged at around 1m tonnes. In France, the area sown with cereals declined by about 3 per cent overall, but most of the drop was in the maize areas. Wheat planting increased by 2 per cent.</p>

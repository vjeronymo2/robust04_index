The  sources said the total amount to be liquidated by three  long-term credit banks and seven trust banks will exceed 1  trillion yen.    They said combined writeoffs by 11 major commercial banks,  called city banks, will top 2 trillion yen.    The sources said the total amount of debt liquidation by the  three long-term credit banks is estimated at 550 billion yen --  210 billion yen by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan (LTCB),  140 billion yen by the Industrial Bank of Japan and 200 billion  yen by Nippon Credit Bank.    The writeoff by LTCB compares with 94.1 billion yen  liquidated by the bank last year.    The amount of writeoffs by the seven trust banks is certain  to exceed 400 billion yen, the sources said.    Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. is studying whether to include  a  nonperforming loan of 80 billion yen to Azabu Tatemono in its  writeoffs in the current fiscal year, they said. The company's  writeoff will hit 130 billion yen, a record for a trust bank, if  the loan to Azabu Tatemono is included, they said.</p>

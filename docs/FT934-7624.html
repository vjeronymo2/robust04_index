			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Bonn seeks to patch up an ailing social state: Unification and recession have brought matters to a head Three weeks ago, more than 100,000 building workers descended on Bonn to protest against the loss of a crucial social benefit, in the largest mass trade union protest in the city for more than a decade. They were up in arms over the pending abolition of their 'bad weather money', a state subsidy given to the building industry to ensure workers are not simply sent home when snow falls in winter. A few days before, it was the turn of the steelworkers in the Ruhr. They took to the streets over tough new rules on unemployment benefit being introduced by Bonn. In future, earnings-related unemployment benefits (at around two-thirds of previous income) will not be available for the rest of one's normal working life. They will be restricted to a maximum four years' duration; then jobless workers will have to exist on subsistence-level social assistance. Both demonstrations revealed the tide of anger sweeping the German labour movement over what unions see as the demolition of their prized welfare state. They also underlined the remarkable generosity of the German system in recent years, and one of the reasons why it is now under unprecedented pressure. For 20 years, the crisis of the social system has been under debate. The demographic pressures of an ageing population, combined with a falling birth rate and shrinking workforce, have been clear. Today, one in five of the population is 20 or younger, and one in five is 60 or older. By the year 2000, the over-60s will total one in four. By 2030, 38 per cent will be over 60, and only 16 per cent of the population under 20. In less than 30 years, a declining working population will have to finance the social costs of roughly the same number of people who are either too young or too old to work. Two developments have now brought matters to a head. Not only the conservatives and liberals in the ruling coalition, but also the social democrats in opposition, are looking for ways to reform the social state. The first change was unification. Suddenly, almost 17m potential new claimants have been brought into the social state in east Germany, expecting full benefits, but only now beginning to make their contributions. Total social spending rocketed from DM744bn (Pounds 295bn) in 1990 to DM1,001bn (Pounds 397bn) in 1992 thanks to huge new demands on the pensions and unemployment funds. Second has come the sharpest recession since the war, and with it new levels of unemployment in both halves of the country, forecast to reach more than 4m next year, or over 10 per cent. That has reduced social insurance contributions just as the costs shoot up. A third factor has also served to concentrate the minds of the political establishment on the financing of the welfare state: the campaign to introduce a new pillar in the social system, called nursing care insurance. The scheme is intended to provide guaranteed residential care for some 1.65m old and handicapped people needing constant nursing care, at a cost of some DM13bn a year. It is supposed to stand alongside the existing pillars: pensions, health care, and unemployment and accident insurance. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his labour minister, Mr Norbert Blum, have staked their political reputations on getting the scheme made law before next October's elections. It is, in a way, a defence against the charge that they are seeking to dismantle the welfare state. Everyone agrees that such a system is desirable. But practically no one can agree on how to finance the costs, which seem certain to soar in line with the demographic trends. It has focused attention precisely on the way in which social welfare is paid for - through employers' and employees' contributions, not through the central exchequer. The result of this is that rising welfare costs are reflected instantly in rising labour costs, and thus in the fraught question of German competitiveness on the world market. Combined social insurance costs have rise from 26.5 per cent of gross wages in 1970, to a forecast 40.2 per cent next year (assuming the 1 per cent nursing care insurance premium is introduced). The entire business community is up in arms over those rising 'ancillary costs' of labour, and in particular over the plan to impose the further 1 per cent for nursing care next year. As a result, the government has promised to find some way of compensating them for the extra cost. The alternatives - either to abolish two of the 10 national holidays, or to cut holiday pay by 20 per cent - have in turn infuriated the labour movement. Mr Kohl cannot win. Yet the unions and the Social Democrats agree the system's financing needs changing. They say that because it is based on direct contributions, only registered workers - excluding the self-employed and public sector workers - are bearing the full cost of unemployment, retraining and job creation in east Germany. The answer, they believe, is to switch that burden to the taxpayer. It would be more fair and would remove the immediate visible pressure on wage costs. The SPD proposes that the tax burden should be borne by the highest income-earners, and possibly by a wealth tax. On the other hand, the contributions-based system means that workers and employers are acutely conscious of the costs of the social state, and therefore exert political pressure to keep it under control. Shifting part of the burden to taxation would not bring the real costs of the system down. Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary in the economics ministry, argues that it is essential to extend working lives, and counter the trend to early retirement. 'We need more income for the social security system,' he says. 'That need not come from higher contributions, if we can reverse the current trend, and actually extend normal working lives.' He also argues in favour of a longer working week, and a restriction on the normal time spent in higher education: the average German university graduate is 29. But at a time of rising structural unemployment, those are solutions bitterly opposed by the labour movement, which wants working time cut to create more jobs. Employers are also keen to use early retirement as a relatively painless way to reduce workforces. Meanwhile, the government is seeking to cap its social spending commitments  -for example by a 3 percentage point cut in unemployment benefits, abolishing the 'bad weather money' and putting a time-limit on earnings-related benefits - in a small way, without tackling the underlying challenge. It did the same with the package of health reforms introduced last January, restricting benefits in the short term, but not changing the open-ended structure of a system whose costs are geared to rise inexorably with an ageing population. So far, the problems in the social state have been all too clearly identified. Long-term solutions are in desperately short supply. This is the fifth article on welfare states around the world.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Cecilia Canones from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] According to Senator Aydee Castillo de Lopez,  president of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, it is highly  unusual for the United States to deny asylum to Haitian  refugees, while, at the same time, asking Venezuela to receive  them. The senator added that Venezuela currently is not in the  best of economic and social conditions to receive the Haitian  refugees.    She stressed that it was quite unexpected that a highly  developed nation such as the United States has decided not to  give the refugees asylum, and yet it has asked a country like  Venezuela--a nation facing a crisis--to receive them. She added  that what is even more unusual is that the Venezuelan Government  has decided to accept the request.</p>

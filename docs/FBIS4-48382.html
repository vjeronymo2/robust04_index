			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council decided last night to  send 5,500 peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. [passage omitted]    On the ground, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF, did not  want another UN peacekeeping mission. Nevertheless it is not  greatly worried by the mission that has been announced. Here is  Alain de Strael, RTBF's special correspondent, in Rwanda:    [Begin de Strael recording] The RPF does not feel itself in  any way bound by the different aspects of the Security Council  resolution, and in any case, it is not worried about it. It was  opposed to the sending of a buffer force that would compel it to  negotiate with a government it refuses to recognize. But now  the mission entrusted to the revamped UNAMIR [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda] is basically a humanitarian one.    The victims are the result of the chaos born of the war.  First, there are the militias, against which the UN can do  nothing. They are continuing to kill in the villages; we saw  this even in the zones conquered by the RPF. This is why the  people are fleeing.    The second exodus is that of people fleeing the advance of  the RPF, which is preceded with a reputation for massacring  civilians - a completely unjustified reputation, as we also  discovered on the spot, but one which is carefully fostered by  government propaganda.    So no UN resolution will change a thing on the ground: the  only solution that might perhaps win through in the end is for  the Rwandan Army, from a position of military weakness, to break  ranks with the government, and to negotiate. That is what the  RPF is expecting. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

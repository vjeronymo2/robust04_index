			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / House of Representatives votes to back military in Haiti The House of Representatives foreign affairs committee yesterday voted to back the US military intervention in Haiti but to demand a handover to the United Nations by March 1, writes George Graham. The committee rebuffed the Clinton administration's pleas that any time limit could endanger the operation, but Republican members still voted against the measure. They said it provided retroactive congressional backing for a misjudged policy. Republican senators have submitted a similar resolution requiring the withdrawal of US troops before December 31, but Senate leaders do not expect a vote for a binding time limit.</p>

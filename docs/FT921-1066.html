			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: Hindle and Balanchine - Ballet Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to be nurtured by Peter Wright with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. His Sacred Symphony for the company last May was a professional debut; now, with funding received by Peter Wright (the 1991 Digital Premier Award), his second creation has been made possible. Dark Horizons is set to Shostakovich's chamber symphony (the eighth string quartet in Barshai's arrangement). Its theme is the fate of North American Indians driven from their lands 'on to infertile reservations', and it is cast with nine male dancers placed against a rocky landscape designed by Peter Farley. It is all - in the current cant phrase - 'politically correct' (even the Shostakovich score bore a dedication to 'victims of fascism and war'), and staggeringly worthy in ideals. In a threnody for a people dispossessed, Hindle shows us the men (outfitted in what look like Iriquois bathing trunks, body paint and modish hair-styles) who are by turns watchful or sorrowing. There is nothing, though, suggestive of the extreme richness of tribal dance - central to the identity of the Indian races, and, in the Sioux ghost dance cult at the turn of this century, a war-like response to persecution by the white man. Instead, Hindle gives us pieties with an admixture of conventional academic movement and poses that look more cinematic than ethnic. The merits of the piece lie in Hindle's ability to make fluent lines of movement, and to set a personal stamp upon the dynamics of a phrase. That he is gifted there is no doubt, and he has inspired heart-whole performances from his cast, admirably led by Joseph Cipolla. Yet, as with Sacred Symphony, I find that Hindle has opted for a theme too static to allow the emotional or physical development which will let his creativity soar and dare braver things. This new BRB triple bill opened with a sympathetic account of Les Sylphides. Not grand, but sincere; musical (Philip Ellis, here as with the Shostakovich, guiding sure accounts of the score) and graceful in manner, and in Ravenna Tucker finding a sensitive ballerina for the mazurka and the nocturne duet: gentle, lovely dancing. The programme ended with Hans van Manen's Five Tangos, a work without which I can very well do. Sir Kenneth MacMillan's new and stunning Judas Tree is framed in the Opera House programme by two major Balanchine pieces: Stravinsky Violin Concerto and Symphony in C. The evening is one which, with the addition of Brian Elias' powerful score for MacMillan, reasserts the musical standards of our national ballet and the responsiveness of our dancers to good scores and fine accompaniment. The influence of Constant Lambert upon the identity of the Royal Ballet can never be over-estimated: as composer, conductor, arbiter of taste for two decades from the inception of the company, his imprint still lies in the civilised musical attitudes of our dancers and choreographers, even in certain felicities of style. Balanchine, most musical and most musically educated of choreographers, never put a dancer's foot wrong in relationship with a note or phrase. And though the Royal Ballet manner does not aim for the bright-edged clarity of New York City Ballet in works such as Violin concerto or Symphony in C, there is energy and rigour to the dancing in this current series of performances, and the sense of a company on fine and secure form. Part of this is owed to the vitality of the orchestral playing under Barry Wordsworth. Stravinsky Violin Concerto on two recent evenings sounded spirited and intense (and intensely poetic in the arias), with the young Israeli violinist Hagai Shaham a dazzling soloist, and the dancers' performance reflected these qualities exactly. Darcey Bussell exposed all the linear tension of the first aria; Sylvie Guillem, looking at moments like Sargent's portrait of Mme Gautreau, seemed to lose herself in the dance to potent effect. In the sunburst of Symphony in C , the refinement of the orchestral playing - textures airy, clear  - encouraged dancing that was buoyant, generous, and radiant in spirit as in step. About The Judas Tree I can but say that a second viewing revealed fresh layers of meaning and fresh richness of choreographic invention (how vivid is Mark Silver, seemingly the one sympathetic character, standing hand over mouth, denying the truth, Peter-fashion, at the action's crisis). The detail and power in the company performances is everywhere magnificent. It is an astonishing, adventurous work of art. Brian Elias' score is superbly theatrical, and it finds ideal advocates in the Opera House orchestra under Wordsworth.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Macro 4 up at Pounds 11.2m despite subdued trading Macro 4, the systems software group whose products run on IBM or IBM-compatible mainframe and mid-range computers, managed a 6.8 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits despite 'subdued' trading conditions and lower interest receipts. Pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 11.2m in the year to June 30, up from Pounds 10.5m the previous year on turnover which increased by a modest 4.8 per cent to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.3m). Earnings per share increased by 8.6 per cent to 34.2p (31.5p) and a final dividend of 11.98p (11.48p) is proposed making a total of 20p (17.75p) for the year. Despite the profit improvement and 12.7 per cent increase in full year dividend the shares, which have fallen sharply from a high of 723p in early February, closed 12p lower at 543p reflecting the market's concerns about the state of the mainframe software market. Mr Terry Kelly, chairman, said the group had continued to make progress, with turnover and contributions to group profit increasing in all the group's established subsidiaries, albeit by small amounts in some countries. He said the group was continuing to invest in its newer range of systems software designed to run on IBM's AS/400 mid-range computers. This 'places the group in a sound position for future growth'. However Mr Kelly acknowledged that the software market was 'at a bit of a crossroads' with customers uncertain about the future role of mainframe and mid-range machines as the trend towards client/server computing gathers pace. 'I continue to be cautious regarding the coming year's prospects against a background of continuing change within the computer user enviroment, change which is, partly at least, responsible for the continued rate of contract cancellations within the group,' he said. Nevertheless he predicted that the group would remain cash generative and produce a further modest improvement in profits this year. Operating profits increased by 8.1 per cent to Pounds 9.97m (Pounds 9.22m). Interest earnings slipped to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.28m) reflecting lower interest rates partly offset by interest on a delayed tax payment. Group cash balances increased by Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 22.4m at the end of June although both year-end figures benefitted from tax payments which were delayed. On a comparable basis cash balances increased from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 21.3m.</p>

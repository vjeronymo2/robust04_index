			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Leading Article: New moves in Bosnia International peace efforts in Bosnia, of which so many have come to grief, are understandably greeted with increasing scepticism. But the latest initiative of the European Union has the merit of once more directly involving governments in the negotiations, instead of putting all the onus on the two international negotiators, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg. That might just give the whole exercise more weight, particularly since US and Soviet representatives have been asked to join the twelve in the talks due to start in Geneva on Monday. The proposal agreed by the EU foreign ministers this week seeks to adopt a hard-headed approach, which is a far cry from the abortive Vance-Owen plan, with its emphasis on an equitable division of the three ethnic communities into provinces within a unitary Bosnian state. It offers a progressive suspension of international sanctions against Serbia if Bosnia's Moslems are given 3 to 4 per cent more land than they were offered in last September's plan for the partition of the country into three ethnic mini-states. That is a realistic proposition, at least in principle, since Bosnia's Moslem-dominated parliament rejected the plan precisely because it fell short by some 3 per cent of the Moslems' territorial demands. Yet it is bound to be criticised by those who feel that the Bosnian Serbs have already been amply 'rewarded' for their ethnic cleansing policies by retaining much of the land that they have conquered by force of arms. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, who has called a general election next month, would undoubtedly greatly benefit from a lifting of sanctions. These have caused immense hardship both in Serbia and its ally Montenegro, provoking serious shortages of all kinds and unprecedented levels of hyperinflation and unemployment. Whether Mr Milosevic can deliver the Bosnian Serbs, however, is quite another matter. Whereas he can probably twist the arm of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, it will be much harder to bring the military into line. The new plan has already been rejected by Gen Ratko Mladic, the hardline commander-in-chief of the Bosnian Serb army, whose contempt for agreements reached by political leaders appears to be a matter of reflex. This is a serious problem, since the military on all sides have a vital role to play in guaranteeing the safe passage of United Nations relief convoys at a time when harsh winter weather is threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands more Bosnians. Unless the talks make progress, this may be the last winter of UN involvement in Bosnia. The main contributors to UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, such as France and Britain, are now seriously thinking of withdrawing their troops next year if the political stalemate continues. Serbia would then face continued war, tougher sanctions and no prospect of an end to its diplomatic isolation.</p>

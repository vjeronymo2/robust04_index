			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ABANDONS VOW, BACKS A TAX INCREASE;  </P> <P> BUDGET: HE SAYS THAT REVENUE HIKES, SPENDING CUTS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP THE  ECONOMY HEALTHY. GOP CONSERVATIVES ARE ANGERED.  </P> <P> President Bush, formally abandoning the central pledge of his 1988 presidential  campaign, declared Tuesday that preserving a healthy economy will require new  taxes.  </P> <P> "It is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a  package that can be enacted require" a series of measures including "tax  revenue increases" as well as spending cuts, Bush said in a written statement  issued after a breakfast meeting with congressional leaders of both parties.  </P> <P> He specifically mentioned the possibility of trimming "entitlement and  mandatory" spending programs, a reference to Social Security, Medicare,  Medicaid and other benefit programs. He did not specify the type of tax  increase he had in mind.  </P> <P> With his statement, Bush abandoned his campaign pledge -- "Read my lips, no new  taxes" -- and opened the door to a "grand compromise" with Congress that could  narrow or even close the federal deficit. Richard G. Darman, Bush's budget  director, has been advocating such a compromise almost since the day Bush took  office.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Bush may have sparked a full-scale revolt among  conservatives in his party, many of whom believe that higher taxes are far  worse for the country than continued deficits. He may also have given up what  many Republican strategists see as the party's most important issue -- low  taxes.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders, by contrast, welcomed Bush's new stance, which was  prepared, word by word, during the breakfast meeting.  </P> <P> Administration and congressional negotiators, who have been meeting since May 9  to try to craft a deficit-reduction package acceptable to all parties, have  discussed a host of potential tax increases.  </P> <P> Some proposals, such as increased "user fees" and hikes in tobacco and alcohol  taxes, might be relatively easy for Bush to embrace. The Administration has  already proposed roughly $20 billion in new user fees and other minor revenue  increases.  </P> <P> But Tuesday's statement was made necessary because Democratic leaders said that  package was unacceptable. And while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said  it was up to the negotiators to decide what to do next, he pointedly refused to  rule out broader tax increases.  </P> <P> Republicans, however, may find it difficult to accept Democratic demands to  increase income taxes for the wealthiest Americans. "I can't see Democrats  agreeing unless there are (income tax) rate changes that insure that (the final  package) is not unfair to the poor and middle class," said House Ways and Means  Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> Budget negotiators hope to work out a final package before Congress leaves  Washington for its August recess.  </P> <P> Before Tuesday's developments, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser  (D-Tenn.), the budget talks "were stalemated, going nowhere. The President  broke an impasse."  </P> <P> Bush himself told reporters at the White House Rose Garden Tuesday afternoon:  "It is essential that these talks get moving and get moving faster. I want to  see this economy grow. I want jobs. I want to see the deficit down."  </P> <P> Democratic leaders had insisted when the talks began that they would not get  involved in specific negotiations unless Bush publicly admitted that a tax  increase would be needed.  </P> <P> At the time, the White House insisted that all issues were "on the table" and  that Bush would impose "no preconditions" on the talks. But Democrats had  insisted on a more explicit statement.  </P> <P> After Bush gave them what they had sought, Democratic leaders appeared solemn  and reserved as they struggled to avoid seeming to take political advantage of  Bush's retreat.  </P> <P> "We hope this is not going to be the subject of a political campaign effort,"  said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) "Someone who wants to complain  about taxes being raised will have to complain against both parties."  </P> <P> When the negotiations began, Democrats feared that Republicans would maneuver  them into a corner -- forcing them to call for a tax increase and then  campaigning against them as "tax-and-spend" liberals.  </P> <P> Many Republican candidates for the Senate this fall already have been doing  just that, much as Bush had done in 1988. In that year, Bush's favorite line --  "Read my lips, no new taxes" -- formed the centerpiece of his standard stump  speech.  </P> <P> Tuesday's statement not only abandoned that pledge but also gave up on a  central tenet of the Republican political philosophy for the past decade --  that the deficit is caused by too much spending, not by too little revenue.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, explaining Bush's decision, said that closing the deficit without  new taxes would require spending cuts so large that they "would be unacceptable  to all parties."  </P> <P> The White House estimates that the federal deficit will be roughly $160 billion  in fiscal 1991, which begins on Oct. 1. The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law  would require about $100 billion in across-the-board spending cuts unless the  President and Congress agree on a new budget plan.  </P> <P> To mollify conservatives, Bush aides spent much of the day circulating word  that the White House was not agreeing to anything beyond the approximately $20  billion in new user fees and related taxes that Bush has already advocated.  </P> <P> "I'm not changing my mind at all" on taxes, Bush insisted during a 45-minute  session with 15 Latino reporters from around the country.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle echoed the theme. "It should not be viewed as a  change of policy," he said in an interview in Los Angeles, where he was raising  money for GOP candidates. "This is a deficit reduction summit, not a tax  increase summit."  </P> <P> Asked if he would now admit that Bush was breaking his campaign pledge against  new taxes, Fitzwater responded with a laugh: "Are you crazy? . . . Everything  we said was true then, and it's true now. We feel he said the right thing then;  he's saying the right thing now."  </P> <P> Democratic leaders reacted with some anger to the White House damage control  efforts.  </P> <P> "The President's statement is clear and unambiguous," said Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). "He said that it is clear to him that tax  increases are required. This is a new statement by the President. Any attempt  by White House officials or other Republicans to describe the statement  otherwise are totally inconsistent with what occurred today."  </P> <P> Even Fitzwater conceded as much as he listed a series of factors that had  forced Bush to change his mind.  </P> <P> The most important was the weakening of the economy since Bush took office.  Fitzwater noted that economic statistics continue to show interest rates higher  and growth rates lower than the White House had hoped. Bush advisers and most  Democratic economists hold deficits at least partly responsible, a point  conservatives dispute.  </P> <P> Moreover, the mounting cost of the savings and loan bailout has swelled the  deficit, Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Not all members of Bush's party, however, were willing to abandon their belief  that new taxes are worse than continued deficits.  </P> <P> "Any tax rate increase now threatens recession," Rep. C. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach) said in a statement. "Just the prospect of a tax increase is  like a dagger pointed at the jugular vein of the American economy."  </P> <P> Within hours of Bush's statement, 90 Republican members of Congress signed a  letter to Bush declaring "we were stunned by your announcement that you would  be willing to accept tax revenue increases as a part of a budget summit  package."  </P> <P> "A tax increase is unacceptable," the GOP congressmen wrote.  </P> <P> Times staff writers George Ramos in Washington and Cathleen Decker in Los  Angeles contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GEORGE BUSH ON TAXES  </P> <P> Oct. 12, 1987: "There are those who say we must balance the budget on the back  of the workers -- raise taxes again. . . . I am not going to raise taxes  again." Announcement of candidacy in Houston.  </P> <P> Jan. 16, 1988: "I want to be the President who finally whips the budget into  shape by holding the line on taxes." Televised debate with five Republican  rivals in Manchester, N.H.  </P> <P> May 31, 1988: "I'm not going to propose a tax increase." After meeting with  campaign economic advisers at summer home in Kennebunkport, Me.  </P> <P> June 14, 1988: "That's the difference -- as plain as day -- between us. Tax  cuts vs. tax hikes. I will not raise your taxes, period." At Cincinnati rally,  comparing his position with that of Democratic front-runner Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> June 24, 1988: "I've ruled them all out." At a Cincinnati news conference, when  asked if Bush included excise taxes or other "revenue enhancers" in his  rejection of new taxes.  </P> <P> July 9, 1988: "If you go to Yosemite Park with your trailer . . . you may have  to pay a little more." At Atlanta news conference, conceding that costs of some  programs might rise for users but asserting that voters understood the  difference between user fees and tax hikes.  </P> <P> Aug. 18, 1988: "My opponent won't rule out raising taxes, but I will, and the  Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push again,  and I'll say to them 'Read my lips: no new taxes.' " Acceptance speech,  Republican National Convention, New Orleans.  </P> <P> Jan. 31, 1990: "That budget brings federal spending under control. It meets the  Gramm-Rudman target. It brings that deficit down further and balances the  budget by 1993 with no new taxes." State of the Union address, discussing  budget he proposed to Congress.  </P> <P> March 13, 1990: "You know my position and I have no intention of changing that  position." At White House news conference, when asked if he could promise no  new taxes this year.  </P> <P> May 24, 1990: "Things are complicated out there on this subject. . . . I'd like  to do it exactly the way I propose. I'm now enough of a realist to realize that  it might not be done exactly that way." At White House news conference, when  asked if he could fulfill his campaign promise.  </P> <P> June 26, 1990: "It is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem and  the need for a package that can be enacted require . . . tax revenue  increases." Written statement after meeting with congressional leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROJECTED IMPACT OF VARIOUS TAX INCREASES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:4.09IN:2.66IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>

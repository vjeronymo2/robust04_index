			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 11 TASS -- After a "breakthrough"  visit of the Russian president to China, Russia started a  dynamic broad partnership with Beijing both on the international  scene and in bilateral relations; China is a priority of the  Russian foreign policy, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview here today.    Panov was nominated to his post on December 30, 1993.    In his words, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is  expected to visit China in late January to discuss preparations  for a Moscow visit of the Chinese leader.    Russian relations with China same as with Japan "should not  be a sensation but a norm; they should be relations of normal  neighbours - two great powers," which interact in each other's  interests, in the interests of the region and the whole world,  said the official.    In the opinion of Panov, it is symbolic that 1994 starts for  Russia with a visit of the U.S. President and a Chinese trip of  the Russian foreign minister. Being different, these visits  prove the well-balanced Russian foreign policy equally oriented  to the west and to the east.    Russia has broad possibilities of cooperation with China,  said Panov. Russia has not fully studied Chinese economic  transformations to use them in domestic conditions, especially  in the area of special economic zones. This idea is being  considered in Russia, but China has done it more swiftly and the  zones have boosted Chinese economic development.    The two countries are holding border negotiations. In his  opinion, pronouncements of some politicians, especially in the  Far East, claiming Russia is making unilateral unjustified  concessions to Beijing are ungrounded. All the concessions are  bilateral and mutual.    As for military cooperation, Russia and China are discussing  the reduction of their armed forces in the border area. The  negotiations "are not a sensation as it is clear no military  preparations are underway or even possible on the borders, which  increasingly become friendship frontiers".    Russian-Chinese trade is mutually beneficial and does not  infringe Russian economic interests. It will constantly expand.  The official called for informing the public of all aspects of  the Russian-Chinese relations. In his opinion, the January  Beijing visit of the Russian foreign minister will do a lot of  good in this respect.</p>

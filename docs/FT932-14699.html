			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Lang attacks Thatcher claim MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday attacked Baroness Thatcher's claim that there was 'no such thing as society'. It marked a further distancing of the government from the former prime minister's political legacy. After a week in which Lady Thatcher has embarrassed the government over its Bosnia policy, Mr Lang said: 'Whoever said there is no such thing as society was talking nonsense.' At a meeting of the Scottish Tory Reform Group in Glasgow, Mr Lang urged the Conservative party to 're-establish its ground'. Lady Thatcher 'had a task to do: to destroy socialism and all its works. She largely succeeded and that destruction is apparent not just in Britain but around the world.' Mr Lang argued it was 'self-evident' that society existed 'in every nation or people that has found pluralistic form, whether tribal or clannish, communal or colonial, national or imperial'. He adopted a tone similar to calls by some senior Labour figures for a government that addresses the aspirations of individuals. Mr Lang urged Conservatives to seek 'the fulfilled society' in which 'talents are developed, where each has the chance to find a measure of contentment in passing through life'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Outside Servicing Contractors Permitted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GreenLine will require a greater servicing effort by lenders than the Agency's other business loan programs and two existing pilot programs. SBA recognizes that the extent of these servicing requirements may potentially inhibit the willingness of small community-based, rural, and independent banks from participating in the program. This may, in turn, have the undesirable effect of limiting access of creditworthy small businesses to the program in the areas serviced by such lenders. Therefore, the Agency is authorizing lenders to contract out for the servicing functions they do not perform themselves. Contracting does not relieve the lender of its responsibilities contained in SBA Form 750 (or 750 B) or any individual loan authorization issued by SBA. The lenders will be held responsible by SBA for the activities of their contractors. Every contractor must meet the minimum requirements, as specified below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assure that each GreenLine maintains its revolving feature, lenders agree to make initial and periodic examinations of the borrower's current assets which serve as collateral and forms the basis for disbursements. Lenders also agree to continually monitor the financial data and control of the cash generated by the borrower as a result of their having the use of the GreenLine proceeds. At a minimum, a borrower's generated cash must go to an operating account where the business can not make withdrawals without the concurrence of the Lender. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering the volatility of the collateral securing revolving lines of credit, lenders shall agree as a condition for approval that they will liquidate a GreenLine borrower's current assets prior to seeking SBA's purchase of any guaranty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Third Party Service Providers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following standards have been formulated as guidelines for lenders participating in SBA's GreenLine Program for use when evaluating and selecting an outside or third party service provider (Provider) who may perform those examination, monitoring, or control functions required to prudently administer GreenLine loans guaranteed by the SBA: Experience; Competence; Character; Equal Opportunity; Financial Responsibility; Coverage; Business Authorities; and Confirmation. These standards are numerically arranged from 1 to 8. Those standards noted by an ``a'' after the number are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform examination services.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 16. Administrator Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing Administrator testing provisions that allow EPA flexibility in determining when and where engine testing may occur. This is necessary given EPA's limited testing facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, this provision would allow EPA to require test engine testing at any given location, including at a manufacturer's facility. The Administrator would be empowered to require the manufacturer to make available such instrumentation and equipment that was specified by the Administrator. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility would be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible. Authorized EPA personnel would be given access to the facilities to observe such testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Catalyst Durability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA expects the emission controls used to meet the exhaust emission standards specified in this rulemaking to be durable so that emission reduction benefits are realized not only when the engines are new, but also during operation in-use, over time. Although EPA is not proposing full emission control system durability demonstration requirements in this notice, manufacturers are fully expected to design such systems to be effective under normal in-use operating conditions over time. Full emission control system durability demonstration requirements are expected to be included in the Phase 2 regulations for small SI engines. However, EPA has concerns that certain emission control components, namely catalysts, warrant separate consideration. Therefore, EPA is proposing durability demonstration requirements for catalysts in this notice as discussed in greater detail in ``V. U. Catalyst Durability.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 18. Information Requirements, Application for Certificate of Conformity, Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule's information retention requirements are similar to those proposed in the nonroad large CI rule. EPA believes that the proposed information requirements are sufficient to adequately determine compliance with this regulation and the appropriateness of awarding a certificate of conformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A manufacturer would be responsible for retaining certain information applicable to each test engine along with copies of the submitted applications for individual certificates of conformity. A manufacturer would also be required to submit an amendment(s) to the application or certificate of conformity whenever additional small SI engines were added to an engine family or changes were made to a product line covered by a certificate of conformity. Notification normally would occur prior to either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Selective Enforcement Auditing Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to conduct a Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program of small SI engines as authorized by section 213 of the CAA. The small engine SEA program would be an emission compliance program for new production small SI engines in which manufacturers would be required to test engines as they leave the assembly line, with EPA oversight. Through SEA testing, EPA could determine with reasonable statistical certainty whether or not tested engine families were in compliance with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that an SEA program is necessary to verify that production engines comply with applicable regulations. Since certification would be based on preproduction prototype engines which often contain specially built and installed components, production engines could still fail to meet emission standards if quality control was inadequate. SEAs would provide a means to test actual production engines as they came off the assembly line. Since no in-use enforcement program is being proposed for small SI engines, SEA provides the only opportunity for EPA to determine the compliance of production engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would assign a limit to the number of SEAs each manufacturer could receive during a model year. As in the on-highway SEA program, this annual limit would be used to provide assurance to manufacturers that EPA would not significantly overburden a manufacturer with an unreasonable number of audits during the model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each SEA would be an audit of one engine family, and each passing audit would count toward the manufacturer's annual limit. EPA is proposing an annual limit of two for each manufacturer with projected annual production of less than 100,000 engines. For manufacturers with annual production of 100,000 or more engines the annual limit would be the greater of either two or the number determined by dividing the number of engine families certified in that model year by five, and rounding to the nearest whole number. For example, a manufacturer with a projected annual United States production of 600,000 engines with 13 certified engine families would have an annual limit of three, and a manufacturer with a projected annual production of 300,000 small SI engines and 22 engine families would have an annual limit of four.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY BY U.S. NAVY, MEXICANS SHOWS NO AIDS IN 357 TIJUANA PROSTITUTES  </P> <P> A collaborative study by Mexican health officials and U. S. Navy personnel has  found that none of 357 Tijuana prostitutes tested were infected with the AIDS  virus, the Navy said Friday.  </P> <P> The results, coupled with similar findings from a separate study of prostitutes  and other Mexican citizens at high risk for AIDS, would indicate that infection  is not prevalent among prostitutes in the border city -- long a destination for  U. S. thrill-seekers.  </P> <P> "What is says is that there's a very low risk factor," said Chief Craig  Huebler, a Navy spokesman in San Diego.  </P> <P> The two recent studies reflect a growing collaborative effort between U. S. and  Mexican health officials concerned that the border region could facilitate the  spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> The Navy became involved, Huebler said, at the request of health authorities  from the city of Tijuana and the Baja California state government, who lack the  volume of sophisticated testing devices and methods found in U. S.  institutions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Navy Conducted Lab Tests  </P> <P> Mexican officials selected the participants in the survey and took the blood  specimens, Huebler said, while the Navy's role principally involved testing the  blood for evidence of the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> "The Navy was asked by the Mexican government, because we had the technology,"  Huebler said.  </P> <P> The samples were taken almost a year ago, Huebler said, but the results were  only final last week.  </P> <P> The issue is an extremely sensitive one in border areas. Any kind of "AIDS  scare" in Mexican border cities would probably frighten off U. S. tourists, who  represent a prime source of revenue. Some activists in Mexico have charged that  the government has deliberately attempted to underestimate the number of AIDS  cases -- an allegation denied by Mexican officials.  </P> <P> The Navy study tends to confirm the results of a previous binational AIDS  initiative in Tijuana, which was conducted by Mexican health officials and the  California Department of Health Services. That study found that only 2 of 415  prostitutes surveyed were infected with the AIDS virus, said Dr. Abram  Benenson, a professor at the San Diego State University School of Public  Health.  </P> <P> Mexican officials, noting the large number of AIDS cases in the United States,  have worried that U. S. citizens might spread the disease south of the border.  U. S. health authorities, meantime, have expressed concern that prostitutes  could be infecting U. S. visitors.  </P> <P> The two recent studies would tend to indicate otherwise.  </P> <P> Tijuana is considered perhaps the third-largest AIDS center in Mexico, after  Mexico City and Guadalajara. As of late last year, Tijuana reported fewer than  100 AIDS cases -- a number that many say underestimates the problem.  </P> <P> Many experts believe that a number of factors -- notably the relative social  disapproval of homosexuality -- has resulted in a vast under-reporting of the  problem south of the border. Homosexuals and people who use intravenous drugs  are among those most at risk of contracting the ailment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mexico Asked Navy for Help  </P> <P> The genesis of the Navy study, a spokesman explained Friday, occurred in 1987,  when Mexican officials approached the service and inquired about assistance in  an AIDS-testing project. (Mexican officials could not be reached for comment  Friday.)  </P> <P> The Navy had an obvious interest, a spokesman explained. Tijuana has been an  almost-legendary destination for reveling sailors and other military personnel.  About 102,000 Navy personnel are based in San Diego; only Norfolk, Va., with  120,000, is home to more sailors among U. S. ports. In fact, some San  Diego-based sailors live in Tijuana; that number is thought to be fewer than  100.  </P> <P> For Navy second class petty officers or lesser ranks, there is a Tijuana curfew  between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.  </P> <P> "We do have Navy personnel who go down to Tijuana, so that is a concern,"  Huebler said.  </P> <P> The Navy has conducted similar studies in other nations, Huebler said. The  Philippines, with its huge population of U. S. sailors and native prostitutes,  is one other area where such a survey has been done, the spokesman noted.  </P> <P> For the Tijuana study, the Navy assistance was provided by the San Diego-based  Environmental and Preventive Unit Five, which falls under the jurisdiction of  the Naval Environmental Health Center, Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> The Navy spokesman provided the following account of the study:  </P> <P> Testing occurred during a 30-day period in February, 1988. The women were  selected by Mexican officials, who also drew the blood samples.  </P> <P> In addition to the 357 prostitutes, the study also tested 360 women who were  not prostitutes, all drawn from a Tijuana family-planning clinic. Of this  group, only 2 -- less than 1% -- were found to be infected with the AIDS virus.  Both are believed to have contracted the virus via blood transfusions, a Navy  spokesman said.  </P> <P> All 717 participants are presumed to have given their "informed consent" to the  project. Three Navy officials, two from San Diego and one from Washington,  helped with the testing in Tijuana.  </P> <P> The blood samples were coded by Mexican officials and shipped across the  border. The samples were tested in a Navy laboratory in San Diego.  </P> <P> Counseling of the two persons infected is to be provided by Mexican health  authorities. The study maintained "strict confidentiality," the Navy said.  </P> <P> Asked about the cost of the study, the spokesman said it was "minimal," but he  could provide no exact figure.  </P></p>

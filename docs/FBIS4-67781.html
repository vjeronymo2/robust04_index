			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Energy Secretary Carlos Bastos by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given]    [Text]    CLARIN: Will the CNEA [National Commission for  Atomic Energy] be privatized?    Bastos: Let us begin with something more basic.  Let us discuss the prospects for nuclear energy. When organizing  the field, the state reserved for itself the role of supervising  private activities and determining policies. For most countries  where this activity is being developed with the private sector,  nuclear energy is considered one of the future options to  satisfy energy demand. In Argentina we developed our own nuclear  industry, with our own technicians, heavy water fuel, and  companies. It would be a grave mistake to waste all this wealth.  The Energy Secretariat, as the agency responsible for  determining policies, is deeply interested in seeing nuclear  energy as one of the future energy options in Argentina.    CLARIN: There is a study conducted by the  Mediterranean Foundation headed by Juan Novara saying that the  CNEA is not competitive and that nuclear energy is expensive,  dirty, and is being abandoned throughout the world. Is this not  contrary to what you just said?    Bastos: Fortunately, we have had differences of  opinion at the Mediterranean Foundation and each one can freely  voice one's opinion. Yes, it is a little bit contradictory. I  do not fully share Novara's views.    CLARIN: But the International Atomic Energy Agency  contends that 100 nuclear power plants are under construction at  present.    Bastos: I am not an expert in that field, but to  talk about 100 nuclear power plants is a bit too much. I do not  believe that such a number of power plants is under construction  ...    CLARIN: The report specifically states that there  are 72 power stations under construction and another 54, the  construction of which already has been approved ...    Bastos: I could not give you precise data. What I  do know, however, is that all industrial countries are trying to  devise ways to lower the cost of future nuclear projects by  trying to build a series of nuclear power plants having a  standard design and improving security. In this regard, I  disagree with Novara's assertion that atomic energy is  expensive. Well, it is indeed expensive now because a barrel of  oil costs $14. If the price rises to $20, things would change  completely.    CLARIN: And how will nuclear activities move ahead?    Bastos: That is the key issue. The industry's  organization is based on the participation of the private sector  in risk ventures. It does not pertain to the state engaging in  risk undertakings. The state is interested in developing  nuclear activities but without participating as an entrepreneur.  The CNEA cannot continue functioning as it is now; it must be  restructured. At present it combines control with business  activities and receives money from the Treasury for investments.  It has been decided that the CNEA will be restructured so as to  separate regulatory from business activities. This will have  been concluded by December.    CLARIN: Will they be privatized then?    Bastos: That is totally reasonable. With our way  of [answer incomplete as published]    CLARIN: Incorporating private capital or selling  the shares of the private stock company?    Bastos: In the privatization of companies in the  field, like Segba [Greater Buenos Aires Electrical Services] for  example, we made what is known as a strategic sale of shares.  We sold a percentage of the shares and the companies' control  was transferred to the buyers of those shares. We took that  line of action because it was impossible to reorganize those  public companies within the framework of the state. Is the CNEA  now in a similar situation to that of Segba? The answer is no  because nuclear power plants are in an excellent situation.  They have plenty of financial resources at their disposal,  which shows that there are top-quality operation and maintenance  groups. So what do we stand to gain by transferring the  management of these nuclear power plants? Very little. Our  first attempt to transfer the CNEA to the private sector will be  made along the same lines as YPF [Government Oil Deposits].    CLARIN: How much do you estimate CNEA Inc. would  be worth?    Bastos: The CNEA has a positive flow of funds  amounting to slightly over $200 million annually.    CLARIN: Once Atucha-II is operational its value  will increase considerably.    Bastos: That is precisely the point. It is very  difficult to make an estimate because it depends on the  investments that will be made to complete Atucha-II.  Nevertheless, let us suppose that of the $200 million, the net  cash flow totals $90 million. With a rate of return for seven  years, it would add up to $600 million, which in turn is what we  estimated is missing to complete Atucha-II.    CLARIN: That is a very low estimate. The CNEA  contributed $8.5 billion compared with the $600 million that  could be obtained from the selling of all the shares.    Bastos: We go back to the starting point, when we  said atomic energy is expensive. I said it was because a barrel  of crude today costs $14 and these estimates are based on this  oil price. If the prices climbs to $20 or $30, things will  change. Even so I would not venture to say that it is a total  loss.    CLARIN: But $600 million compared with $8.5  billion ...    Bastos: Yes, it is true. We are not taking into  account how much the Atucha-I and Embalse Rio Tercero power  plants produced, whether a very low price was paid, and whether  the benefits were transferred to consumers. State Water and  Power Enterprise and Segba had debts to the CNEA that were not  totally repaid ...    CLARIN: The CNEA argues that they owe it $500  million ...    Bastos: In all likelihood the federal government  was the one that remained as a debtor, but at the same time the  CNEA also granted some type of credit to the government [as  published]. Therefore, the best thing to do is start everything  fresh.    CLARIN: I insist, do you not think that $600  million is a very low price for two nuclear power plants that  are already operational, Atucha-II -- 70 percent of which is  already completed, and other industrial plants?    Bastos: I do not think so. It depends on many  things. We will never have a 100 percent return on investment  for Atucha-II because it is a capital-intensive sector. When  there are construction delays, the costs are terrible and one  has to forego obtaining a 100 percent return on investment. Is  the CNEA to blame for the cost of Atucha-II? It is not entirely  to blame for it. The power plant's construction involves the  handling of 40 or more contracts. During the times of  hyperinflation, most of them were paralyzed.    CLARIN: Do you approve of Manuel Mondino as a  likely executive manager of CNEA Inc.?    Bastos: I am going to give you the opinion of a  teammate. From the technical standpoint, I think that all the  CNEA staff is excellent. The only criticism I might have is  that they need more knowledge about business administration, but  they can be quickly trained in this field.</p>

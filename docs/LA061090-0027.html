			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKE A HIKE, BUT CALL FIRST  </P> <P> For the latest road, trail and weather conditions of the various hiking venues  mentioned in the accompanying story, contact the appropriate visitors center.  Since many of the state parks and national forests offer campgrounds (or some  other rustic accommodations), along with picnic facilities and nature exhibits,  you can easily make a weekend adventure from one of these outings.  </P> <P> It's particularly important to call ahead in this severe drought year (our  fourth dry year in a row). Some remote backcountry areas are closed because of  fire danger. Other paths are simply unpleasant because of the withered flora  and dusty conditions.  </P> <P>  Angeles National Forest Headquarters, 701 N.

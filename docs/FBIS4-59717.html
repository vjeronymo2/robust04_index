			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet  affairs and information minister, has said that the Council of  Ministers has decided to form a delegation of competent  ministers to hold talks with the Palestinian side. He added  that the talks will deal with the issues that should be dealt  with now to organize trade transactions between Jordan and  Palestine in light of two basic facts -- namely, the economic  cooperation agreement, signed between Jordan and the Palestinian  side on 17 January, and the developments in the Palestinian  territories in Jericho and the Gaza Strip where new Palestinian  institutions are being set up. These statements came in a  debate, aired within the Jordanian Television program "Topical  Issues," which also included PLO Economic Department Chief Ahmad  Quray' and economic expert Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir. Al- 'Anani  added: Therefore, it was necessary to lay down a flexible and  dynamic working plan that could deal with the swift changes  taking place in the Palestinian territory.    Regarding Jordanian banks, trade exchange, and joint  projects, Dr. al-'Anani said: The Palestinian side, led by  Ahmad Quray', was positive because it wanted to go into the  details after the stage in which principles were laid down,  which we defined in the economic agreement. He added: We  expect to agree on a mechanism through which people will be able  to deal with each other.    Al-'Anani said: We must quickly define the mechanisms and  issues with which we must begin and pay attention to. He noted  that the Jordanian dinar is still the main currency in  circulation in the West Bank. The minister added: We agreed  with the Palestinian side on the method of dealing with the  Jordanian dinar so as to maintain its value and purchasing power.    Ahmad Quray' touched on the dimensions of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement, signed by the PLO and Israel in  Paris recently. He said: This agreement deals with the major  issues, such as currency, banks, trade, customs, direct and  indirect taxes, tourism, insurance, agriculture, industry, and  labor. He stressed that the choice of these topics was a  Palestinian choice.    Quray' said: The most important strategy of talks with  Israel was the restoration of the strategic Arab dimension to  Palestinian relations, particularly with Jordan. He noted that  immediately following the signing of the Declaration of  Principles an economic agreement was ratified with sisterly  Jordan in which trade between Palestine and Jordan was  considered domestic. In other words, he added, no obstacles or  boundaries stand in the way of this trade in light of the  historical unity between the two countries in various fields.  Ahmad Quray' said the issue of banks and currency was dealt  with in this agreement, adding that this agreement helped us a  great deal in the talks.    Dr. Taysir 'Abd-al-Jabir expressed his belief that the  economic agreement between Jordan and Palestine would see great  activity, even during the transitional period, adding that the  size of trade exchange will reach 200 to 300 million dollars  annually. Therefore, he said, the Palestinian self-rule area  will have the largest trade transactions with Jordan.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabir said: Now that Jordanian banks have been  allowed to operate in the West Bank and Gaza, these banks will  be the basis of the banking system there and the Jordanian dinar  will continue to be the main currency in circulation. He added  that there will be other areas of cooperation between Jordan and  Palestine, such as tourism, the creation of a free zone in the  Jordan Valley, oil, energy, electricity linkup, services, and  construction.</p>

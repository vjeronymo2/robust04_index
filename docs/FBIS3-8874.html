			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, March 16 (CTK) -- The  independent daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, citing "well informed  sources," reports today that the former government of Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar sold 9.52 percent of the shares of a  Kosice foundry shortly before it was dismissed last week.    The shares in the East Slovakia Foundries (VSZ), with a face  value of 1.5 billion Slovak korunas ($45 million), were sold for  300 million korunas ($9 million), of which 15 percent was in  hard currency.    "Everything testifies to the fact that Vladimir Meciar's  government continued right up to the end with its stunt-man  style of privatization, creating the right conditions for (his)  HZDS and for the return its people to the government, or rather  to power in Slovakia," the daily writes.    This privatization project was carried out "behind the veil"  of the new VSZ leadership and "its grey eminence," ex-Finance  Minister Julius Toth, who came to the ministry directly from  VSZ, where he was an independent specialist, the daily writes,  pointing to Meciar's statement on Monday that Toth was the only  HZDS founder who had been silenced. "Today we can only guess  how many millions for Vladimir Meciar's election campaign in  1992 came from the revenues of VSZ, when Julius Toth was  `finance minister'," the daily writes.    According to the daily SME, this is the reason for the  sudden  calling of a VSZ general meeting for Thursday, March 17, to  discuss the privatization project and the "establishment" of  Toth at the head of the foundries' supervisory council.    A written statement from the VSZ management said only that  the meeting was called at the request of the National Property  Fund, which, as holder of more than 10 percent of the company's  shares, has the right to call for a general meeting.    "The purpose of the shareholders' meeting will be to change  the status of the joint stock company and to change the  membership of its supervisory council," the statement says.</p>

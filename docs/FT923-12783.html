			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Performance pay's value is questioned THE value of performance-related pay to employers and employees has been called into question by a poll of 1,600 British Telecom managers. The poll, conducted by the Society of Telecom Executives, the union representing 25,000 managers and professionals in the industry, found that only 7 per cent of the sample thought PRP schemes improved their performance. Some 66 per cent of the sample thought that performance pay was applied unfairly, and more than 70 per cent thought that bonuses were arbitrary and that they undermined teamwork. The Society of Telecom Executives said the survey found that women fared less well under performance pay systems than men, even when they were meeting the same targets of performance standards. The survey also found that more than 70 per cent of BT's managers suffer from work-related stress, while some 57 per cent suffer from low morale.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Space war over eastern sky: Jenny Luesby on the threat from rival satellite launchers The emergence of Russia, China and Japan as rivals to Europe and the US threatens a glut of satellite launch facilities at a time of falling demand. With fewer than 20 commercial launch opportunities a year, Europe's Arianespace needs a substantial market share to make its launch facility and rocket development programme viable. But the going is getting tough for the Europeans and the US. Russia's first commercial launch contract from the west, to launch a satellite for Inmarsat, the international maritime co-operative, was priced at Dollars 36m, 30 to 50 per cent less than an equivalent Ariane launch. The competitive price reflects more than Russia's desire to earn foreign exchange. Its Proton satellite launcher is cheaper than those of its western rivals largely because it puts the satellite into final orbit, rather than requiring boosters on the satellite to fuel the last leg of the journey. Besides saving fuel, this almost doubles the life of the satellite, to 12 years. Since the Inmarsat deal, the US and Russia have agreed on a quota of eight Russian launches of US-made satellites by 2000, in return for the US granting, for the first time, export licences to American satellite manufacturers. Russia has also agreed to refer to the US for approval any Proton bid that undercuts the lowest western offer by more than 7.5 per cent. However, the agreement has done little to slow sales of Proton launches, which boast a record of reliability comparable to the market-leading Ariane. A recent joint venture between the US aerospace group Lockheed, Khrunichev, the maker of Proton, and the Russian research group, Energia, announced that since the Inmarsat deal, it has won orders for Proton worth Dollars 600m. The US telecoms group Motorola has booked Proton for the launch of 21 of its satellites for the Iridium communications network. Khrunichev says these orders do not exceed the quota agreed with the US; the Iridium launches will be to low-earth orbit, the quotas only cover launches into the higher geostationary orbit. But western competitors doubt whether Russia will adhere to the quotas, pointing to the failure of a similar deal between the US and China to prevent undercutting; China consistently offers deals at a discount of about 30 per cent to comparable European prices. But China's price competitiveness has been undermined by the dubious safety record of its Long March launchers. A planned launch for Australia was aborted in March 1992, while last month the destruction of China's first advanced weather satellite on its final pre-flight testing further undermined China's ambitions. The accident has set back China's planned launch of six satellites this year. But with the US deal on Chinese foreign launches due to expire in December and several foreign satellites already booked for Chinese launches over the next decade, China's space ambitions are far from dead. Meanwhile, Japan's space effort finally achieved the maiden flight of its H-II launcher in February, some two years behind schedule. The H-II's main engine, the LE7, is fuelled with liquid hydrogen. Although the LE7 has been beset with technical problems, it has greater potential for higher performance than the more traditional closed combustion engine. However, with launches restricted to just two a year, for environmental reasons, and no commercial customers yet signed up, Japan is unlikely to make an impact on the commercial satellite launching market for some time.</p>

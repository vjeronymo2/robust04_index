			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: Supertanker companies should assume burden of liability Sir, There is a grim truth that is not even denied by international shipping organisations: operating supertankers will always cause disastrous oil spills ('Shipping bodies say oil spills 'inevitable' ', January 7). Of course these risks can, and have to be, minimised by a more careful planning of tanker routes in order to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and better shipping standards. But the level, and type, of supertanker activity has to be questioned as well. Unfortunately, your editorial, 'Oil spill in the Shetlands' (January 7) completely misses the latter point. Common economic wisdom tells that economic efficiency can only be hoped for if all market participants are forced to take account of each and every cost arising from their activities. With supertanker operations this is not the case. Owing to limited liability, only a fraction of the damage to the environment has to be paid for by the operator. A compensation fund like the one set up by the International Maritime Organisation, even if liability were not limited, does not help either, as from the viewpoint of a single operator and/or oil importing country it requires only a lump-sum contribution irrespective of the kind and level of its activities. The question is not whether 'a pay-out is guaranteed in a reasonable period of time', but whether he who has caused the damage has to pay for it. In contrast to your dismissal, the 1990 US oil pollution act enacted in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster is the most sound answer to this problem yet. There is just one simple device missing. In addition to unlimited liability insurance should be mandatory in order to avoid the 'corporate veils' which you correctly identified as the main obstacle to the workability of the act. Then, in a competitive insurance market, premiums would roughly equal the expected damage and thus force the internationalisation of all external costs. Such a system would even provide incentives for better shipping standards, as any reduction of the risk of an accident would be neglected by lower premiums. If, with such a scheme, supertanker operations would cease to be commercially viable, the consequence is and should be obvious; society would have to dispense with them, and should have done so long ago. Limiting liability is but a subsidy and, as with all subsidies in the absence of public good effects, creates economic inefficiency. Supertanker operations can hardly be described as a public good.

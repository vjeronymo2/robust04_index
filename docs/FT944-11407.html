			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Bossi calls for change Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's federalist Northern League, yesterday warned that the party was prepared to use its power in the ruling coalition to press for political change, once the 1995 budget was approved. 'Without courage, the League risks being ground down,' he told a League congress. 'The moment has come for courageous decisions. Once a regime is installed, its difficult to obtain change.' In a crowd-pleasing speech, aimed as much at reasserting his power within the party as within the government, Mr Bossi sought a mandate from delegates to put the government's record on liberalism and federalism under scrutiny. He also called for the creation of a new liberal-democratic, federalist alliance, centred on the League and excluding the far-right National Alliance, currently part of the coalition, and the far left.</p>

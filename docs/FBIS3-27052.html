Meanwhile, the 10 enterprises raised about 1 billion yuan  last year for technical transformation and expansion of  production.    A Tianjin government official said that the city started  converting enterprises into joint stock companies in 1992.    Now the city has 58 standard joint stock companies and  hundreds of partnership companies.    They include state enterprises in the manufacturing,  commerce, communications and transportation, and real estate  sectors.    Three of the 58 companies have gone public and 32 are  liability limited companies.    Tianjin is one of the most important industrial bases in  north China. The introduction of the joint stock system will  help the enterprises to face the market, enhance their  decision-making power and increase funds directed toward  technological transformation and production.    This year, the city will select 30 others from its 100  large-  and medium-sized state enterprises to try the modern enterprise  system.</p>

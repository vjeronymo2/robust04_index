The accord allows each nation's airlines to operate flights  between the northern Japanese city of Aomori and the Russian Far  East city of Khabarovsk and between the central Japanese city of  Toyama and the Russian Far East city of Vladivostok, ministry  officials said.    Under the agreement, Russia's Aeroflot Airline plans to run  two weekly flights on both routes as soon as related customs,  immigration and quarantine facilities are set up at the Japanese  airports, they said.    The first flight between Aomori and Khabarovsk is expected  as  early as fiscal 1996 and that between Toyama and Vladivostok is  expected in fiscal 1994, they said.    No Japanese airlines reportedly plan to serve the two routes  at the moment.    The agreement also calls for raising the number of weekly  flights between Niigata and Vladivostok to three from the  current two starting in fiscal 1994, the officials said.    The two countries also agreed to hold a meeting in Tokyo of  Russian and Japanese aviation controllers to improve related  technical skills.    During the talks, Russian officials assured Japan that the  current restriction on trans-Siberian flights will be lifted as  early as March, the officials said.    Because of a lack of necessary aviation control equipment,  Russia has limited the number of trans-Siberian flights to six  per hour.</p>

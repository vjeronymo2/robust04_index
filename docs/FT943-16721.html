			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unwanted shares Having sold a holding of BP, I find myself the proud owner of six shares, being a stock dividend distributed after my sale. The last time something like this happened to me, it took a prolonged effort to throw the shares away. Is there any better way out? One solution you might like to consider is that many unit trusts offer free transfer of such amounts into their own funds so that at least you will be given credit for the shares' value, albeit small.

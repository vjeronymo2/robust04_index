			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National Newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister [Rafael Pardo] has joined  President Cesar Gaviria at the center of the scandal over the  presence of U.S. troops in Colombia because Pardo signed an  agreement without first advising the president. The minister is  currently in Juanchaco inspecting the controversial projects  with some congressmen.    [Begin recording] [Vergara] How do you feel about the  upcoming political trial against you and the president?    [Pardo] I have absolutely no doubts; no legal or political  doubts. There is nothing dishonorable about this, nothing I  would term as a mistake. Our actions have always been based on  a legal interpretation that we consider correct, and also on  factors of convenience that we consider important.    [Vergara] Did the president know about this agreement? It  has been said that he did not know about it; that his signature  appears on the document but that he knew nothing about it.    [Pardo] The president is aware of how these agreements are  established. He is aware of how military cooperation procedures  are handled. The president was not consulted about the content  of this memorandum of understanding because that would have been  a deviation from normal procedures. This is directly under the  jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. [end recording]    [Vergara] Minister Pardo and the congressional Foreign  Relations Committee are inspecting Juanchaco to determine what  projects are actually taking place in that region.</p>

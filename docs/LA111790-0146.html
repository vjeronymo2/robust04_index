			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME AT U.N. DRAFT NEW MEASURE ON PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> In a new U.N. Security Council resolution, a group of Arab and nonaligned  nations Friday called for a U.N. observer force to monitor the treatment of  Palestinians living in territories occupied by Israel and also for a conference  of all 164 nations that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention.  </P> <P> As the resolution stands now, a U.S. veto would be likely, officials indicated.  </P> <P> But efforts are under way behind the scenes to modify the resolution's wording  as council members awaited a decision by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de  Cuellar on whether to accept the invitation of Israel's government to send an  emissary to study the problems of Palestinians in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> A U.N. spokeswoman said Perez de Cuellar will make his views known when he  returns from Paris on Tuesday. The secretary general conferred Friday in Paris  with his special envoy, Jean-Claude Aime, on consultations that Aime held in  New York with Israeli diplomats about the potential trip.  </P> <P> Israel has rejected a Security Council resolution calling for an investigation  into violence Oct. 8 at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, during which 20  Palestinians were killed by police and security forces. But as a compromise,  Israel agreed to accept a mission by Aime to discuss the treatment of  Palestinians under Israeli occupation.  </P> <P> Israeli diplomats hope their offer will temper the resolution introduced Friday  in the Security Council by Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen. It calls for  deploying military observers stationed at the Jerusalem headquarters of the  U.N. Truce Supervision Organization into the occupied territories to monitor  the situation and to report back to the secretary general and the Security  Council.  </P> <P> The U.N. Truce Supervision Organization was established in 1948 to scrutinize a  series of cease-fire agreements and armistices between Israel and Arab states.  </P> <P> But Israel has served notice in advance that it vigorously opposes an observer  force, and U.S. diplomats said they could not vote for Friday's resolution in  its present form.  </P> <P> U.S. statements left the door open for negotiations over the weekend. There was  considerable sentiment among council members for a proposal by Perez de Cuellar  that the 164 nations that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention hold a new  conference, probably in Geneva, to discuss ways of protecting Palestinians in  Israeli-occupied territories.  </P> <P> The Fourth Geneva Convention, covering the protection of civilians in areas  occupied during a war, was signed Aug. 12, 1949.  </P> <P> The resolution submitted to the council demanded that Israel's government  accept the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention and scrupulously abide  by its provisions. It endorsed the idea of convening a meeting of the  document's signers to discuss possible new measures to strengthen the  convention.  </P> <P> Israel was among the original signers of the convention. However, it takes the  position that it has sole responsibility, including the duty to maintain law  and order, in territories it occupies.  </P> <P> Delegates from Malaysia, Libya, Syria and the Organization of the Islamic  Conference all spoke in favor of the resolution during council debate Friday.  </P> <P> Observer Nasser Kidwa of the Palestine Liberation Organization indicated that  some room exists for compromise on the new resolution, however.  </P> <P> He said agreement with the United States would be "difficult; nevertheless we  don't think it is impossible." He stressed, "We are ready to negotiate with  everybody."  </P> <P> But the PLO observer added that monitoring by U.N. forces is an "essential  factor" in the draft submitted to the council.  </P></p>

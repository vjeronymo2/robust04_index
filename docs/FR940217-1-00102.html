The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any emergency action that the initiating official has begun. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency action. The institution or servicer may make its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting with the show-cause official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or repetitious matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misuse described in the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, and the initiating official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting is requested, after the official receives all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material submitted by the institution in opposition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, the official also notifies each institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts with the servicer of that determination. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency action continues until a final decision is issued in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that proceeding, as provided in &sect;668.90 (c) or (f), as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is at the sole discretion of the initiating official, or, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show-cause official to demonstrate that because of facts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official or the show-cause meeting, continuation of the emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ended. The show-cause official considers any written material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revokes the emergency action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Nelson's task SMALL BRITISH businesses had a rough time during the recession. Many went under when banks called in their loans. And although the banks have come in for criticism for being too ready to pull the rug from under entrepreneurs' feet, the losses on their lending to small companies show they too have not fared well. With banks reluctant to extend more short-term finance to small businesses, there is a danger the economic recovery will be blighted. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was therefore right last week to initiate a review into the financing of industry. Small companies are excessively reliant on short-term overdrafts, which can be called in at the first hint of trouble. It would be better if they could raise longer term equity and debt finance. Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, who has been given the task of conducting the review, will find no shortage of ideas as he tours the country over the coming months. Business lobby groups have been quick to trot out ideas such as increasing capital allowances for small companies. Another idea came earlier this year from Mr Brian Pearse, Midland Bank's chief executive, who called on government to subsidise small business loans and give tax relief on investment by individuals in industry. Many of these suggestions smack of special pleading. Rather than devising yet more tax reliefs and subsidies. Mr Nelson will probably find it more fruitful to identify how current tax breaks distort investment flows. If small businesses are to make greater use of venture capital, their attitudes will have to change. At present, many entrepreneurs are not willing to dilute their control by selling equity stakes to outsiders. The way in which tax reliefs favour the institutionalisation of savings will also merit attention. Once the nation's savings are sucked into large institutions such as pension funds, they too seldom find their way to small companies in the form of equity finance. It is not worth the management effort of big institutions to invest in and monitor a large collection of tiny projects. Such investments, though, might be just the thing for wealthy individuals. Any attempts to de-institutionalise savings will be contentious. When the then Mr Nigel Lawson as chancellor tried to do so in the 1980s, the powerful pensions lobby scotched his plans. Since then, the government has trimmed pensions tax relief in a piecemeal fashion, an approach which has had no overall logic apart from raising cash for the exchequer. The arguments for reforming the taxation of savings are finely balanced. But there can be no radical change in the way companies are financed so long as the institutionalisation of savings persists. The question is whether the government has the stomach for a fundamental rethink.</p>

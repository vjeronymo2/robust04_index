			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Following Caldera's announcement of the suspension  of constitutional guarantees, Central Information Office  Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares explained the scope of the  suspension of constitutional guarantees.    [Begin Alvarez recording] The first paragraph of Article 60  states that no one shall be imprisoned or arrested unless he is  caught in the act or by virtue of a written warrant by the  official authorized to order arrests in the cases and  formalities specified by the law. Summary proceedings cannot be  extended beyond the maximum limit set by the law. The accused  shall be entitled to have bail set expeditiously and all the  defense means provided by the law as soon as the arrest warrant  is executed. If a punishable crime is perpetrated, police  authorities shall adopt the necessary or urgent provisional  measures that are indispensable to ensure the investigation of  the incident and the trial of the culprits. The law will  stipulate a brief and strict time limit in which such measures  must be take with the pertinent judicial authority. The law will  also set a deadline for the judicial authority to issue a  decision, with the understanding that these measures shall be  revoked and rendered ineffective if the judicial authority does  not confirm them by the set deadline. This first paragraph is  suspended.    Article 62 establishes that residences are inviolable, and  shall not be searched, except to prevent a crime or to comply,  in keeping with the law, with decisions issued by the courts.  Visits for health reasons [visitas sanitarias], conducted in  keeping with legal stipulations, shall be made only with prior  notice of the officials who are either ordering or conducting  such visits.    Article 64 says that everyone shall move freely throughout  the country, change abode or residence, leave the country or  return, bring or take out possessions from the country with no  additional restrictions than those established by the law.  Venezuelans shall enter the country without need of any  authorization. No government action shall impose the penalty of  expatriation against Venezuelans, except as a commutation of  sentence or at the request of the accused.    Article 96, which refers to economic rights, stipulates that  everyone shall be free to pursue the profitable activities of  his choice with no additional limitations other than those  provided in this Constitution or those indicated by the laws for  security, health, or social interest reasons. The law will  dictate norms to avert usury, profiteering, or any other abusive  practices aimed at hindering or limiting economic rights.    Article 99 guarantees the right to own property. By virtue  of  its social function, property ownership shall be subject to the  contributions, restrictions, and obligations established by the  law with regard to public use or social interest.    Article 101 indicates that assets of any sort shall only be  expropriated for public use or social interest purposes through  a final judgment and fair compensation payments. Payments can be  deferred for a specific time period or partially canceled  through the issue of bonds whose acceptance is obligatory in the  following cases: property expropriations to conduct agrarian  reform or the expansion and improvement of communities, or in  special cases of national interest specified by the law.    Provisions on these constitutional articles are henceforth  suspended. [end recording]    Minister Alvarez added that today the development and  finance  ministers will make announcements pertaining to their  organizations. The Council of Ministers is expected to take  further economic measures next Wednesday.</p>

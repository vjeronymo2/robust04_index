			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Clinton hails start of 'new era' - US reaction Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, yesterday greeted the IRA's ceasefire as a 'watershed announcement'. Mr Clinton said: 'While much work remains to be done, the IRA's decision to join the political process can mark the beginning of a new era that holds the promise of peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.' From the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, where he is on holiday, Mr Clinton said: 'I urge the IRA, and all who have supported it, to fulfil the promise of today's announcement to end the use and support of violence, just as we continue to call on all parties who have sought to achieve political goals through the use of violence to cease to do so. There must be a permanent end to violence.' Mr Clinton, who spoke by telephone yesterday morning with Mr John Major, the prime minister, and his Irish counterpart, Mr Albert Reynolds, said he was 'pleased that the US has been able to contribute to this process of reconciliation', and was ready to assist in advancing the process of peace. He gave no details of any possible increase in US financial aid to Northern Ireland. US officials are discussing a financial package, although figures have not yet been decided. White House officials said there were no plans yet for any joint meeting of Mr Clinton, Mr Reynolds and Mr Major, but they were 'aware of interest from the Irish government' in such a meeting. Privately, some White House officials see the ceasefire announcement as vindication of their decision - overriding objections from the Departments of State and Justice, and the British government - to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, to enter the US in February. The European Commission said it would step up its efforts to aid the province. Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, took the opportunity to stress the importance of the 'European dimension'. He said he would discuss 'additional financial and other measures' with the UK and Irish governments. Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's largest bloc, the 198-strong Socialist Group, urged 'all sections of the community in Northern Ireland to seize the historic opportunity for peace that is now before them'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 28 Feb (PANA) -- Somali faction leader,  General Mohamed Farah Aidid, Monday [28 February] in Addis  Ababa, held a 30-minute discussion with the OAU assistant  secretary general in charge of political affairs, Tobias  Muparanga, on the situation in war-torn Somalia. "He briefed me  on the efforts he has been making with other Somali factions  towards resolving the Somali crisis", Muparanga told PANA after  the meeting in an Addis Ababa hotel.    Aidid arrived in the Ethiopian capital on Sunday from  Eritrea  where he briefed the Eritrean leader, Isayas Afewerki on efforts  by his Somali National Alliance (SNA) to end the impasse in  Somalia, which has not had a central government since the fall  of President Mohamed Siad Barre in January, 1991. Since the  failed Somali informal political consultations in Addis Ababa in  December 1993, Aidid has been staying in Nairobi, Kenya, where  he has met several Somali factions and briefed Kenyan President  Daniel arap Moi on the outcome of the Addis Ababa consultations.  He also travelled to Uganda to brief President Yoweri Museveni.  According to the OAU official, Aidid will also visit Tanzania  in efforts to brief the leaders of the sub-region on the future  of Somalia when American troops withdraw and the destruction of  the country's infrastructure.    Muparanga led an OAU fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in  November 1993 where he met Somali faction leaders as well as  civic leaders and discussed with them efforts by the continental  body to end the Somali crisis.    Since the United Nations Security Council lifted the hunt  for  Aidid, for alleged killing of Pakistani peacekeepers serving  with the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in June, blamed on his  supporters, he has been on a diplomatic offensive to drum up  support from the leaders of the region for a future government  in Somalia in which he is to play a leading role.    Aidid's aide said he is expected to meet the Ethiopian  president, Meles Zenawi, Tuesday before returning to Nairobi to  continue with further consultations with the Somali factions.    President Meles was mandated by the 1993 June summit of the  OAU in Cairo to resolve the Somali crisis on behalf of the  African leaders. American troops and those from other Western  nations are due to withdraw from the war-torn east African  country by the end of March.</p>

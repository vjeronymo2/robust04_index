			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Freedom means curbs: Austria THE debate over immigration has become increasingly bitter, with the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) campaigning for legislation against foreigners, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The party, led by the populist Mr Jorg Haider, has proposed a halt to all immigration and a limit on the proportion of foreign children in schools. The party began campaigning this week to win signatures for a petition on its proposals. It says it expects at least 1m signatures, about a fifth of Austria's electorate. This would put enormous pressure on the government to submit to some of the FPO's demands. Austria has absorbed a huge number of refugees from eastern Europe since the demise of communism and so far without outbursts of violence of the kind seen in Germany. But the latest campaign has sparked both anti-foreign and anti-semitic outbursts. The FPO is the third largest party in parliament. It has increased its share of the popular vote from single figures in the mid-1980s to a peak of 23 per cent in the Vienna city elections a year ago.</p>

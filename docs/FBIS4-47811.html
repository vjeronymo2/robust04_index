			<p>BFN     [Text] Tension mounted again in Kinshasa when, in the  absence of Monsignor Monsengwo, president of the High Council of  the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) (who is attending  the Synod in Rome), an open conflict broke out between Second  Deputy President Anzuluni (presidential faction) and the  pro-Tshisekedi opposition.    Mr. Ndjoko, representing the Tshisekedi team in Brussels,  told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE that the seat of the assembly had been  invaded by 600 agents of the Special Presidential Division (DSP)  in civilian dress on Tuesday [3 May], while 1,200 of them in  uniform surrounded the building to prevent access and 300  others, in civilian dress, searched the deputies.  <H5>  New Duplication </H5>   According to Mr. Ndjoko, the USORAL [Sacred Union of the  Radical Opposition and Allies] refused to take part in the  plenary session on Tuesday in these conditions, while the  members of the assembly office belonging to the opposition  convened a plenary session on their side "to confirm" Mr.  Tshisekedi as prime minister, in other words "a new duplication  of the institutions."    Zairian Ambassador to Brussels Kimbulu told us that there  had  been no deployment of force at the HCR-PT on Tuesday "either  inside or outside," and that no plenary session was held on that  day. "Between 0800 and 1200 GMT, councillors were registered in  commissions. At 1400 GMT, the office met to count the  commissions and those registered. That is all." On Monday, AFP  press agency reports, the councillors had still not managed to  determine the conditions in which the future prime minister, the  object of the conflict, is to be appointed. This conflict took  a violent turn last Thursday. Mr. Anzuluni had called in the  forces of law and order, when the opposition was staging a  disturbance to prevent the session from being held; two  deputies, Mr. Mutshipaye Ilunga and Mr. Lumbu Lumbu, had ribs  broken; Dr. Ntambwe had his skull fractured by a blow with the  butt of a rifle and died from his injuries.  <H5>  Who for Prime Minister? </H5>   According to Mr. Ndjoko, the opposition met on 18 April in  the absence of the URD [Union for the Republic and Democracy] (a  sub- platform of the USORAL) and the UDI [Union of Independent  Democrats] (Kengo wa Dondo's party); 62 out of 80 were present  and 54 voted for Tshisekedi. On 28 April, the HCR office  eliminated the other candidates because they had been submitted  individually and not through the USORAL.    In presidential circles, it is being reaffirmed that the  prime minister must be presented by the opposition but "after  consultation with the political class," which, according to  these circles, amounts to demanding a consensus on this person.  And, according to Ambassador Kimbulu, the office has accepted  six candidates: Mr. Tshisekedi, Mr. Kengo, Mr. Beyeye, Mr.  Malumba Bangula, Mr. Lunda Bululu, and Mr. Mulumba Lukoji.</p>

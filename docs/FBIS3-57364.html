			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of Communist Party </F> of Russian Federation faction in State Duma, under  "Parliamentary Process -- View from Factions" rubric: "Start of  Duma"]    [Text] The first, organizational stage of the State Duma  sessions is over. The deputies have gone their separate ways  for a week to work in their electoral districts. The official  mass media have made the maximum effort to portray the Duma's  first days as an all-Russia slanging match and a struggle of  egoistic ambitions, to discredit it in the public consciousness,  and, to be frank, to prepare the ground for its speediest  dissolution.    The reason for such zeal is understandable. The regime,  which convened the Duma as a cover designed to legalize the  results of the coup d'etat, obtained as a result of the  elections something qualitatively different, which does not fit  in with its plans. It has no need of such a parliament, and the  first act in the struggle against the Duma was a psychological  war against it on the air and in the pages of the press.  Everything is being done to conceal from the electorate the  true meaning of the work that has been done. Therefore, it is  important to understand its actual meaning.    For 10 days a very hard struggle was being waged to ensure  the Duma's capacity for work -- to make it as difficult as  possible for particular groupings inside and outside the Duma to  block and thwart its activity by means of a boycott, procedural  ruses, the fueling of organizational muddle, etc. It was in  order to prevent such phenomena that a low quorum needed to open  the sessions was set; it was made difficult to delay matters by  arranging secret votes on any pretext; an obstacle was put in  the way of the fragmentation of the corps of deputies into a  mass of small and very small factions; and a small Duma Council  was formed, consisting of just 10 members and, consequently,  arriving more quickly at agreed decisions. All this has already  yielded the first fruits and made it possible quite promptly to  elect the chairman and his deputies and to form the Duma  committees. On the whole, it can be said that the Duma promises  to be an organ that is perfectly capable of working.    Thus, an important point, but still not the decisive one,  has  been passed in the Duma's development as an organ of real state  power. It is capable of adopting principled decisions, but will  the decisions of the Duma (and the Federal Assembly as a whole)  have a substantial impact on the state of affairs in the  country? According to the text of the Constitution, which the  Central Electoral Commission hastened to proclaim adopted, the  rights and powers of parliament have been curtailed to such an  extent that they are, in point of fact, not even legislative but  advisory. On behalf of the so-called "legislative proposals  commission under the president" the Duma was presented with a  107-point plan of legislative activity whose adoption would mean  parliament vegetating for many years in complete isolation from  reality and from the real needs and requirements of society and  the state. The fact that the Duma brushed that plan aside  attests to its state responsibility.    It is undoubtedly necessary to develop the legislative base.  But it is perfectly clear to any unbiased observer that the  country's present problems lie in a somewhat different plane.  We are suffering not from a deficit of laws but from a deficit  of legality, when none of the existing laws is seriously being  fulfilled and, most dangerously, an example is being set here by  the top executive structures headed by the president, which  descended to a coup d'etat and crude armed violence against  law-abiding citizens. The question now stands as follows:  Either legality will be restored or the country will sink  deeper and deeper into the quagmire of economic catastrophe and  smouldering civil war, which threatens at any moment to escalate  into a full-scale war.    It was in order to try to restore legality by peaceful,  nonviolent means that the opposition entered the Duma in full  awareness of the fact that the entire post-October political  structure was lacking a strong legal foundation. Consequently,  it is a question not of a submissive existence under conditions  imposed by force but of a need to radically change these  conditions. This objective need can be formulated as follows:  the restoration of effective parliamentary control over the  executive structures -- presidential, government, and any  others. At the same time it is necessary to sustain the  principle that the greater the powers of the executive, the more  rigid and scrupulous must be the legislature's control over  them. This not only does not contradict the principle of the  separation of powers but, on the contrary, stems directly from  it.    The legislative determination of the composition, structure,  and size of funding of executive organs, the approval of  candidacies for ministers and other top officials, the regular  hearing of reports on the activities of ministries and  departments, the holding, where necessary, of investigations --  all this is the inalienable prerogative of parliament and of its  committees and commissions with a normal democratic procedure of  state management and must become part of Russian political  practice. This virtually means an objective need to adopt a new  constitution.    Is the Duma (Federal Assembly) ready to take serious steps  in  the said direction? Taking into account the substantial  political heterogeneity of the corps of deputies, obviously a  return to legality will not be a one-off act but will require  persistent efforts to form a responsible state majority in the  Duma and for it to win public trust and support. In our view,  the platform for its consolidation must be an understanding of  the disastrous nature of the present socioeconomic policy,  protection for Russia's fundamental national-state interests,  and the desire to establish genuine people's power in the  country and the fatherland's spiritual revival.    For its part the deputies' faction of the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation will strive to ensure that the Duma  adopts decisions on a number of fundamental questions.    It is necessary to investigate and make a political  assessment of the events of 21 September through 4 October last  year and their consequences and to adopt legislative acts aimed  at preventing anything similar ever again. The circumstances  and consequences of the illegal Belovezhskaya Forest compact  must similarly be analyzed.    A very important task of parliament by way of restoring  legality is also to examine the question of the lawfulness of  the interpretation of the voting results of 12 December 1993 as  the electorate's adoption of the draft constitution proposed in  B. Yeltsin's name. It is our conviction that such an  interpretation is unlawful. So many very gross violations of  the Constitution and the Referendum Law were committed in the  course of preparing and "adopting" that draft that they  constitute perfectly adequate grounds for repealing the Central  Electoral Commission's decision and resuming the constitutional  process by means, for example, of scheduling a general election  to the Constitutional Assembly.    The period which the country is going through is a typical  example of what is called a suspension of law, when legitimacy  finds itself in question, i.e. the legal succession of all the  branches of power without exception, including, of course, the  Federal Assembly itself. In our view, the legality of  parliament can be interpreted only from the viewpoint of the  need for the country to return to the channel of rule-of-law  development and the maintenance of civilian peace. Those  actions -- and only those actions of it -- which are aimed at  achieving the said goal can be considered lawful. This goal  also determines the extent of the Duma's powers needed to  realize it. The source of these powers is the direct expression  of the electorate's will, certainly not Edict No. 1400, as  frequent attempts are made to portray the matter.    All these juridical niceties might at first sight seem to  have no direct bearing on the country's real needs in its  present catastrophic state. It must be understood, however,  that without an increase in the rights and powers of parliament  it will be unable to make a real contribution to the cause of  surmounting the crisis, and any initiatives by it will remain  just good intentions.    This does not mean, however, that urgent socioeconomic  problems have remained outside our attention. The Communists'  faction has its own plan of legislative initiatives on a wide  range of issues. These are, above all, draft laws aimed at  replacing the policy of reforms and protecting the Russian  economy: on labor collectives, taxation, price formation, the  destatization of ownership (as an alternative to privatization),  investment policy, and support for the agro-industrial complex.  State support for science, culture, education, and health care  and material and moral protection for the family, motherhood,  and childhood require special attention. Extraordinary measures  are needed to combat corruption and crime, particularly street  crime.    Any government which seriously intends to work in this area  will receive our vote of confidence. But first a government  program with a clear indication of the specific goals and the  approximate deadlines for realizing them and with calculations  of the funds necessary for this must be published, receive an  expert appraisal in parliamentary committees, be discussed in  detail, and, finally, be approved by the Duma. Only in this  case does parliament have the right to give its consent to the  appointment of the head of government and other officials, and  only on this condition can it bear responsibility for the  country's situation.    Maybe a different way of conducting state affairs, which was  practised hitherto, the method of backstage infighting and  intriguing, creates an illusion of autocratic power, but in  practice it has led and does lead to increased chaos and  arbitrariness, when crude violence remains the only argument in  a dispute, and this, as is known, is a highly unreliable and  short-lived instrument for resolving complex tasks.    This is not the first time Russia has experienced such a  situation. Every time the executive's stubborn reluctance to  cooperate with the representative power and to submit to  parliamentary control has led, in the final analysis, to very  grave social upheavals. The last time, this happened literally  before our eyes. The collapse of the great power, bloody  conflicts, economic disaster, the unprecedented degrading of  national and state dignity -- do these cruel realities really  not serve as an adequate argument in favor of choosing a  different path of cooperation among public forces and among the  branches of state power?    The first days of the Duma's work have created the  impression  that there are forces in it which are capable of responding to  reasonable arguments. Despite all their heterogeneity, they  will be able to cooperate if they regard the interests of the  whole state and the whole people as of paramount importance. It  would be better for those who are not capable of this to leave  the political stage voluntarily, without waiting for tough  circumstances and the people's indignation to force them to do  so.</p>

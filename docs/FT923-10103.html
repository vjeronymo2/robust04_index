			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK fears 'chaos' in Kenya soon THE British High Commission in Nairobi has warned the Foreign Office that Britain could lose millions and face an influx of up to 40,000 people with a right to settle in the UK if Kenya descends into chaos. A confidential memorandum, whose authenticity was confirmed yesterday by British officials, presents a rare glimpse of Whitehall's view of the unfolding transition to democracy in Kenya. It says: 'The real risk to our interest comes from the possibility (by no means unlikely) that rather than peaceful transition, Kenya will see chaos before the end of 1992.' In the memorandum, published this week in Kenya's Finance magazine, officials identify British interests as annual exports worth Pounds 250m, investment of Pounds 1bn, military training, regional stability, Kenyan support for Britain at the United Nations and 'avoidance of developments which would lead to an influx of perhaps 30,000-40,000 people into the UK fleeing disorder in Kenya and with some claim to settlement in Britain'. Although the memorandum was written earlier this year recent developments underline the High Commission's misgivings. A bitter power struggle has erupted in Kenya's main opposition party, raising the spectre of clashes on tribal or personality lines. On Thursday anti-riot police in Mombasa fired into the air to disperse clashing supporters of the two factions in the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford). Ethnic clashes, which have left at least 400 dead this year, continue to simmer. The leaked British memorandum gives an incisive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Kenya's political forces and says that while both Ford and President Daniel arap Moi share responsibility for tribal violence 'the government bears the heavier load.' British interests, it says, have been 'generally well served by Moi's regime though they have been put at risk by the increasing corruption, economic inefficiencies and degeneration of the political system.' Relations with Kenya cooled in November after Britain joined other donors in suspending aid to Kenya until democratic and economic reforms were implemented. Sir Roger Tomkys, British High Commissioner to Kenya, said yesterday he regretted the publication of the document which had resulted from a 'breach of trust'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 08, BNS -- The heads of Lithuanian and  Russian negotiation teams said they are satisfied with the  results reached at a round of talks in Vilnius June 7-8.    Viktor Isakov, head of the Russian delegation for talks with  Lithuania, said the progress made in Vilnius is "modest, but  nevertheless a contribution" to the development of bilateral  relations. The Russian negotiator said the deadlock over  Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the main  problem, which also concerns Lithuania's most favored nation  trade status.    The Russian diplomat said the connection between transit and  trade appeared last year when talks on Russian troop withdrawal  from Lithuania were coming to an end, and was confirmed at all  further meetings between negotiators, as well as by the  agreements signed.    Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian working group for  talks with the CIS, said the talks were "constructive" and added  that "more time and efforts are needed" to resolve the remaining  problems. Bulovas said both sides agreed that Belarussian  representatives should take part in talks on transit.    Isakov implied that the status of the Kaliningrad region in  Lithuanian-Russian talks does not differ from the status of any  other Russian region. The Russian diplomat said Kaliningrad can  be granted special status only if such a law is adopted in  Russia.    At a joint press conference Wednesday, both delegation  leaders confirmed that Russian military transit through  Lithuania was not discussed in Vilnius and that both sides only  exchanged views on the issue. The only document signed during  the Vilnius meeting was an agreement on the basic principles of  settlements between Lithuania and Russia. The accord was signed  by representatives of Lithuanian and Russian central banks.  Negotiators initialled an agreement on cooperation between  customs and virtually completed preparation of an agreement on  contract employees.    Isakov said the next round of talks is likely to be held  before September. The exact date will depend on the work of  experts, he said. Discussing issues that may be discussed at  the next round of talks, Bulovas mentioned mutual travel,  cultural values, nuclear energy, fishing and environment  protection.</p>

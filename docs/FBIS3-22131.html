			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent: "BNFL </F> 'Jumping Gun' on Thorp Reprocessing"]    [Text] British Nuclear Fuels is prepared to go ahead with  significant contamination of its Thorp nuclear reprocessing  plant at Sellafield before a crucial High Court judgment on its  operation.    A judicial review of the Government's permission for the  plant to open, granted in December after a year's delay, is  being carried out at the request of Greenpeace and Lancashire  County Council by Mr Justice Potts, who will not deliver his  judgment until March.    However, a spokesman for BNFL [British Nuclear Fuels  Limited]  said last night that it had told the court that it aimed to move  on to the next stage of Thorp's operations, the fragmentation,  or "shearing" of highly radioactive spent nuclear power station  fuel rods, on 7 March.    As soon as it does this, Thorp will have passed the point of  no return. From then on parts of the plant will be highly  radioactive and expensive to decommission. The cost could run  to hundreds of thousands of pounds.    According to BNFL, Mr Justice Potts "recognises the  importance of the date", and has said that he hoped to give his  judgment before 7 March.    Greenpeace, which is attempting a last-ditch legal battle to  halt operations at Thorp, said yesterday it was considering  whether to apply for a stay under which the court could stop  BNFL going ahead.    The fuel the company wants to shear comes from a British AGR  [Advanced Gas Reactor] nuclear power station at Heysham,  Lancashire. BNFL claims it is losing 2 million pounds for every  week that Thorp is delayed. If Mr Justice Potts found in  Greenpeace's favour, it would delay the start of full-scale  operations for months and raise the prospect of Thorp never  opening.    Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council claim that John  Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment, and Gillian  Shephard, Minister of Agriculture, were wrong to grant BNFL  authorisations for radioactive emissions from Thorp into the air  and the Irish Sea without first holding a public inquiry.    Greenpeace said yesterday that BNFL was jumping the gun.  "This shows utter contempt for the fears of 80,000 people who  have expressed real concern about radioactive discharges... and  who have stated a desire for a full and independent public  inquiry.''    "It is an act of desperation, a futile and forlorn gesture  because they will only have to pay to clean it up when we win  the case. This is also public money, so is a scandalous waste."    The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate said BNFL would need  further consents from the safety watchdog before it could go  ahead with the shearing, but it was possible it would gain these  before 7 March.    Immediately prior to the judicial review, on 12 January,  Greenpeace withdrew an application for a stay on BNFL moving  ahead with Thorp's operations. This followed evidence from the  company's lawyer that there would be no significant radioactive  contamination of the plant for at least 30 days. But the court  case has taken longer to complete than anticipated.</p>

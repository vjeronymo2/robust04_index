			<p>Language: <F P=105>Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by CHINA TAXATION NEWS Commentator: "Important </F> Measures in Tax Reform"]    [Text] The fourth session of the Eighth NPC Standing  Committee examined and adopted the "Decision of the NPC Standing  Committee on Revision of the `Individual Income Tax Law of the  People's Republic of China'" (hereafter referred to as the  "Decision") on 31 October 1993. President Jiang proclaimed this  "Decision" in Order of the President of the People's Republic of  China No. 12. The "Decision" will to into effect from 1 January  1994. This is a major revision of China's individual income tax  system. It shows that a major step has been made to make the  individual income tax system become more legalized, scientific,  standardized and rationalized. The proclamation and enforcement  of the revised individual income tax law is of great  significance in promoting the healthy development of China's  socialist market economy, opening the country even wider to the  outside world, ameliorating the uneven distribution of incomes  in society and protecting the nation's rights and interests in  taxation.    To reform China's individual income tax system is an  objective requirement in continuously developing the socialist  market economy, deepening the reform and opening to the outside  world. Prior to the reform, China's individual income tax  system was composed of three tax laws and regulations. The  enforcement of these laws and regulations has played a positive  role in promoting economic and technical cooperation and  exchanges with foreign countries, regulating the incomes of  individuals and increasing the revenues of the state. However,  with the development of the situation, some contradictions and  problems have gradually cropped up. They are often manifested as  follows:    1. The tax laws and regulations are not standardized in  taxing individuals with similar incomes and dividing the  categories of taxpayers.    2. Expense deductions seem to be low, while normal tax rates  too high.    3. The tax laws and regulations can no longer keep pace with  the many social and economic changes in terms of the scope of  taxation, taxable items and tax exemption policy. There is a  need to readjust and improve them.    In light of the aforementioned problems, the "Decision" made  the following important revisions of the 1980 Individual Income  Tax Law on the basis of the principle of "treating all taxpayers  on an equal basis, simplifying the tax system and making  reasonable adjustments" after summing up the past experience and  using the experience in foreign countries as a reference.    1. Efforts have been made to expand the sphere of the  Individual Income Tax Law to include Chinese citizens,  foreigners and self-employed industrial and commercial  establishments into a single uniform individual income tax law.    2. In accordance with international practice, the concept  of "resident" is introduced to differentiate the taxpayers'  limited liabilities from their unlimited ones in paying taxes.    3. Five more taxable items have been added according to the  actual situation in social and economic life. They are "incomes  of self-employed industrial and commercial establishments in  production and business," "income of institutions and  enterprises from their contracted and rental businesses",  "income from the transfer of properties," "income from authors'  remuneration" and "unexpected incomes."    4. Tax burdens have been properly adjusted. The tax rate  table for income tax from wages and salaries is divided into  nine steps instead of six steps. The "Decision" stipulates that  self-employed industrial and commercial establishments in  production and businesses must pay income tax at progressive  rates ranging 5 to 35 percent levied on their income in excess  of specific amounts. Those who are paid extremely high  remunerations for a certain type of work may be asked to pay  higher income tax on a percentage basis. In addition, people are  allowed to deduct from their income taxes the amount of their  donations to education or public welfare funds.    5. More items have been added for tax exemption in  accordance with the state of affairs in China.    It is important to enact a good tax law, but even more  important is that we must do a good job in enforcing such a law  and ensure that laws are observed, that their enforcement is  strict and that law breakers are dealt with. To levy the  individual income tax constitutes an important means of the  state in strengthening its macroeconomic control. We must  earnestly carry out this work in levying and collecting the  individual income tax. This law directly affects the  distribution of individual benefits. It is an important issue  of policy, and it involves many aspects of life. It is  difficult to levy and enforce this law. In enforcing this law,  the tax authorities must not only work hard, but also acquire  the full understanding and support of the large number of  taxpayers and people in all sectors of life in society. It is  for this reason that the local party and government leadership  must firmly strengthen their leadership in enforcing this law.  The various departments concerned must energetically coordinate  with one another in this regard. Directly shouldering the  responsibility in levying the lax, the tax authorities have an  arduous task to perform. On the one hand, they must adopt all  measures to give publicity to the significance and the spirit in  reforming the individual income tax law so that all taxpayers  will understand this law and consciously pay their income tax  according to the law; while on the other hand, they must  earnestly sum up their past experience in collecting income tax,  and firmly and in a down-to-earth manner achieve their goal of  acting according to law and levying the tax on the basis of the  prescribed tax rates.    Currently, there is less than two months left before the new  individual income tax law goes into effect. The tax authorities  at all levels must seize every opportunity to actively carry out  their preparations in propaganda and training work and in  studies in order to enforce the new tax law with a good  beginning.    It is our belief that with the vigorous support of the party  and government leadership at all levels, the close coordination  of the various tax authorities, the full understanding of the  large number of taxpayers and the joint efforts of all the  cadres in the taxation departments, China will definitely be  able to achieve new progress in levying and collecting  individual income tax and let this individual income tax play  its due active role.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- The reactions of most alliance  partners to the inclusion of five neofascists in Berlusconi's  government were characterized by embarrassed reserve.    In Bonn, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic  Party of Germany) hoped for the continuation of the "excellent  cooperation, above all in the European integration process,"  with his new counterpart, Antonio Martino. However, Heidemarie  Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party  of Germany, said that the appointment of five neofascist  ministers is "a shame for Italy and Europe." The Christian  Social Union is concerned that "Mussolini's grandsons" were able  "to gain part of the power." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Packaging side helps Molins up to Pounds 8.8m An improved performance by the packaging division and lower interest payments helped Molins, the machinery group, to report a 10 per cent increase for the first half, in spite of a fall in operating profit on the core tobacco machinery side. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8m to Pounds 8.8m for the six months to end June, on turnover ahead at Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 85.2m). Chinese demand for cigarette making equipment boosted the tobacco machinery division's turnover from Pounds 52.2m to Pounds 61m. 'The engine of growth has been the Chinese market,' said Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director, 'with continuing strong demand.' Operating profits from tobacco machinery fell from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 8.1m. This was partly because sales of spares declined as a result of the cigarette price war in the US. In addition the net pension credit, following a repayment to the group of Pounds 11.8m last year, fell from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 1.4m. The repayment helped the group to cut borrowings from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 3.3m. Net interest payable for the half was down from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 500,000. The US based packaging machinery division, which concentrates on corrugated board, lifted operating profits from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.2m. Turnover rose to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 32.6m). Mr Greenwood said the company was still not happy with margins, 'but at least we can point to progress, driven by improved conditions in North America.' The group is diversifying into food machinery, and first deliveries of a Pounds 6m contract with a multinational company for food machinery begin later this year. 'This is a first step into what we hope will be a new market for us,' said Mr Greenwood. 'We are building on our expertise in machinery that can handle delicate materials at high speed.' Earnings per share were 22.2p (20.1p), and the interim dividend is raised from 4.9p to 5.3p.</p>

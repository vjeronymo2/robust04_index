			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Racal shares fall after provisions lead to Pounds 0.4m loss Shares in Racal Electronics fell sharply yesterday after the data communications, radio and network services group reported a small interim pre-tax loss, mainly reflecting Pounds 20.2m in provisions for disposal and closure costs on the Racal-Redac computer aided engineering business. The shares closed 29p lower at 160p after the group announced a Pounds 388,000 pre-tax loss for the 28 weeks to October 8, compared with a Pounds 23.2m profit. The results were the first to be reported under the new FRS 3 accounting rules. Losses per share amounted to 0.07p compared with earnings of 3.95p. . The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 1.5p. Turnover from continuing operations slipped by 3.9 per cent to Pounds 428.7m (Pounds 446m) while discontinued operations added a further Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 2.77m). Operating profits from continuing operations declined by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 23.9m) after charging Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 7.7m) in redundancy, severance and reorganisation costs. Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said the operating results were adversely affected by lower turnover in the radio communications business resulting in a Pounds 4.5m reduction in profit. The decline in turnover reflected the continued worldwide recession, government defence spending cutbacks and increased competition. Operating profits from the data communications and marine and energy businesses also fell, but were higher in the defence radar and avionics and specialised businesses. Aside from the the Racal-Redac activities which were sold or closed in October, discontinued activities also included the HRM Marine activities in Spain which were discontinued in the summer of 1992. Operating losses for these businesses totalled Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 5.02m). This, together with the Racal-Redac disposal and closure costs of Pounds 6.3m and the acquisition goodwill of these businesses, written off in previous years, of Pounds 13.9m, produced a loss of Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 5.02m) on discontinued operations and resulted in a Pounds 1.88m trading loss compared with Pounds 18.9m profits. Interest income fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 4.29m). A cash-outflow of Pounds 23.6m, mainly reflecting a Pounds 34.7m increase in working capital, meant the group ended the period with net borrowings of Pounds 54.9m and gearing of 10.4 per cent. Sir Ernest said improved performances were expected in the second half from the data and radio communications businesses. However, he warned that given the need for increased expenditure on the British Army Bowman communications project and the National Lottery bid, operating profits from continuing operations for the full year would be similar to last year.

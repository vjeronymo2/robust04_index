			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHUTDOWN HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA IN FIRST DAY;  </P> <P> CLOSINGS: THE BUDGET DEADLOCK LEADS MOSTLY TO CONFUSION AND PETTY ANNOYANCES.  YOSEMITE RANGERS ARE SHUTTING CAMPSITES TODAY.  </P> <P> Thousands of campers in Yosemite National Park began getting the bad news  Saturday morning. Because of the federal budget stalemate, all campsites in the  park will be closed at 1 p.m. today,) although the Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite  Lodge and other facilities operated by the Curry Co. will remain open, as will  the visitor center with a reduced staff.  </P> <P> "We are technically closed right now but the gates are still open because it's  difficult to close Yosemite in a short period of time," said Park Ranger Bob  Clopine. "We're confused but we're making the best of a difficult situation."  </P> <P> For most Californians, there were few such problems Saturday because the vast  majority of federal agencies were closed.  </P> <P> Some part-time census workers even put in a day of overtime as they rushed to  complete the field work for the 1990 census.  </P> <P> Rick Winston, a Census Bureau district manager in Panorama City, said he and 11  others were told Friday to report to work Saturday regardless of what problems  Congress was having with the budget. "I don't know if we're going to get paid,  but we have to assume they know what they're doing."  </P> <P> The visitor center at Angeles National Forest remained open, thanks to a budget  surplus that will allow it and those at other national forests in California to  continue operations until Oct. 15. "After that, God only knows," said Ranger  Gerry Reponen from the Chilao Visitor Center.  </P> <P> And campgrounds in Cleveland National Forest remained open Saturday. "Nobody is  being sent away," said a worker at the El Cariso visitor information center,  just over the Orange County line in Riverside County. "We still have campers."  </P> <P> The Border Patrol -- which has more than 800 employees in the San Diego area,  the nation's largest such contingent -- was conducting normal operations.  </P> <P> The budget deadlock, however, touched Southern Californians in small ways.  Alfred Golden, first vice president of Seniors for Action, a senior citizens  political action group, said a toll-free number available to "tell Congress  exactly how we feel" was not in service.  </P> <P> The visitor center was closed at the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation  Area and scheduled nature hikes for weekend visitors were canceled, although  the area was open to those who want to hike on their own.  </P> <P> The Channel Islands National Park visitor center in Ventura was also closed.  Private boat operators are still providing tours of the islands, but rangers  will not guide them.  </P> <P> In San Diego, the seaside Cabrillo National Monument was closed. "What is  surprising is the number of visitors we turned away who had no idea this was  going on," Ranger Mark Anderson said.  </P> <P> The visitor center in Sequoia National Park was closed and all naturalists  talks and hikes canceled. The campgrounds remained open. Because of the  reduction in services, however, no entrance fees were being collected.  </P> <P> At Yosemite, visited by 3.4 million people last year, park entrances were open  and rangers continued to collect fees, although visitors were being warned that  services are limited.  </P> <P> Guided walks and ranger programs have been halted, Yosemite's Clopine said. And  if Congress fails to find a budget solution by this afternoon, the campgrounds  will be closed, he said.  </P> <P> "I think it's horrible," said Becky Vaccarezza of Stockton, who months ago had  made reservations for a weeklong vacation with five other adults and six  children.  </P> <P> "When you're at home you deal with the bills and everything. But when you come  up here, this is everybody's escape. This is how you're supposed to get away  from budgets. It's a major disappointment. We had so many plans for the kids."  </P> <P> The 550 park workers have been told to report Tuesday, after the Columbus Day  holiday, when they will find out whether they will continue working or be put  on furlough.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Nancy Wride, Mayrene Barker and Psyche Pascual contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

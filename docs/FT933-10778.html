			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Amber Day denies split over board appointment THE ENTIRE board of Amber Day, the UK discount retailer, supports the search for a chief executive from outside the company, Mr Stacey Ellis, chairman, said yesterday. The board has decided that Mr David Thompson, finance director and a board member himself, is not likely to be a suitable candidate for the post despite support for him within the company. Mr Ellis was denying weekend press reports that a split among the board members had emerged over Mr Ellis's support for one of the candidates currently under consideration. The company yesterday confirmed that Mr Paul Taylor, formerly a senior executive at House of Fraser and now at US-based clothing retailer, Leslie Fay, is one of the candidates, although reports that Mr Ellis favours him above any others are untrue. It added that Mr Taylor was only one of two or three external candidates and no decision had yet been made. The company said that Mr Ellis would not try to force a candidate on the board which other members were unhappy about. The board members are said to have been concerned that Mr Taylor's expertise is in the upper end of the clothing market and that he has insufficient experience in discounted merchandise.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Grumbling suburbs spurn Bush in presidential race PRESIDENT George Bush may be narrowing Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the national opinion polls, but still appears in trouble with suburban voters in the big US states which will determine the presidential election in November. The Washington Post/ABC poll, run on September 2-6 and published yesterday, has Mr Clinton ahead by 53:38 per cent among registered voters and by 53:41 per cent among those most likely to vote. This compares with 55:36 and 56:36 respectively in the previous survey, a week before. The national polls have been very volatile for two months. They now give Mr Clinton, the Democratic candidate, a lead of anything from five to 15 points and the acknowledged softness of Mr Clinton's support gives the Bush campaign hope, even though there is little evidence that the president is winning greater respect or confidence. However, at the local level in the nine biggest states, where 257 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory are at stake, the trends - as shown by polls, interviews with 'focus groups' and much media reporting - are still against Mr Bush. California and New York, the two biggest states, are now almost universally considered certainties for Mr Clinton. Texas, the next largest, is reckoned a toss-up in the latest Dallas Morning News poll. Most pundits still prefer Mr Bush in his adopted home state but Mr Ross Perot, the local billionaire, is on the ballot and may draw votes from the president. Mr Bush was also favoured in Florida, the fourth largest, but calculations there are difficult after Hurricane Andrew. The rust-belt swathe - Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and New Jersey  -is seen by both camps as critical. In their suburbs and working-class districts lives the bloc, known as Reagan Democrats, that has voted Republican in the last three elections. This week, both the Washington Post and Time magazine carried extensive reports from representative suburban counties in the critical states. Time, which also covered counties in the important swing states of Georgia and Missouri, revealed only one of five (Montgomery County in Ohio) where Mr Bush was level with Mr Clinton. The litany of complaints from the suburbs was about the local economies, the lack of opportunity for the rising generation, falling property values and sharp disagreement with the Republican party's definition of family values. The net result, according to the Post's conversations with about 2,800 registered voters, is that only about one Democrat in ten would vote for Mr Bush, while Mr Clinton could get the support of one Republican in six. Of the Democrats who voted for Mr Bush four years ago, 58 per cent now say they will support their party candidate, against 32 per cent for Mr Bush and 10 per cent undecided.</p>

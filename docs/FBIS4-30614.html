			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister [MITI] Eijiro Hata said Tuesday [28 June] he  has asked the monetary authorities to take action to stabilize  the currency market.    Steps should be taken so that a burgeoning pickup of the  Japanese economy will be sustained and shifted to a full  recovery, Hata told reporters.    Hata said he explained "the voice" of Japan's industrial  sectors struggling under the unmitigated strength of the yen  when he met with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii earlier in the  day.    Fujii replied Japan is prepared to take action in concert  with other Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries, Hata said.    He said he has heard that the currency issue will be taken  up  at the upcoming G-7 summit in Naples, Italy.    The dollar sank to a new global low of 99.50 yen in Monday's  Tokyo trading momentarily.</p>

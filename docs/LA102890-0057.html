			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS: WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PLUNGE IN THE POLLS, WASHINGTON INSIDERS CAN  SMELL BLOOD IN THE WATER. SOME PREDICT HE IS 'DEAD MEAT' IN 1992.  </P> <P> Even Washington -- where residents can smell blood in the water faster than a  hungry shark -- is struggling to assess the extraordinary decline in  credibility of the President of the United States. In the wicked but  descriptive words of Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), "George Bush is in deep  Sununu."  </P> <P> After eight weeks of glory, shaping what he called a "New World Order" around  the multinational force in Saudi Arabia, Bush came unglued this month. His  politics seemed to defend tax breaks for the rich before pursuing the larger  national interest of deficit reduction. Bush's approval ratings have dropped  from 75%-80% to 50%-55% in just a month -- the sharpest decline anyone can  remember without a scandal.  </P> <P> As GOP prospects plunge, top party strategists are openly predicting  disappointment in the Nov. 6 elections -- ending realignment hopes. Talk of  Bush being "Carterized" -- Washington's ultimate put-down -- is in the air, his  reelection is considered increasingly doubtful and top White House staffers  such as Chief of Staff John H. Sununu have become jokes on Capitol Hill. One  influential magazine has called on Secretary of State James A. Baker III to  resign for mishandling the events leading up to Iraq's August invasion of  Kuwait. There are even signs of unraveling public support for the U.S. military  presence in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> For the moment, however, the careful observer must draw back with the caveat  "Yes, but . . . . " -- in this case "Yes, but things could change."  </P> <P> They did for Jimmy Carter. In autumn, 1979, after Washington had snickered for  two years and Carter's approval had dropped below 30%, an overlapping pair of  foreign-policy crises -- Iran's seizure of the U.S. Embassy staff in Tehran as  hostages and the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan -- boosted the  embattled chief executive's rating back into the solid 60s. The fact that he  was fumbling and fading again by spring did not change the opportunities of  autumn.  </P> <P> Presidents, especially those like Bush, with foreign-policy skills, cannot be  prematurely counted out. Nonetheless, Bush -- like the "one-hoss shay" in  Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous poem -- is on the verge of falling apart in all  directions almost simultaneously.  </P> <P> The linchpin, of course, has been Bush's lack of leadership in the  deficit-reduction confrontation. His inept strategy and flip attitude -- that  famous "read my hips" crack while jogging -- let Democrats stay one step ahead,  relentlessly telling voters how Bush's demands and delays put helping the rich  ahead of dealing with the deficit. This was the devastating context in which  the President's ratings plummeted 20 points in as many days. The Persian Gulf  President let himself become the Palm Beach President, as Democrats looked on  in happy disbelief and Republicans in nervous horror.  </P> <P> The problem for Republicans is that this is not a one-shot failure. Bush's  dithering has confirmed the Democrats in a 1990-92 strategy of targeting the  GOP as defenders of the rich -- a proven Republican Achilles' heel dating back  to the days of populism and William Jennings Bryan a century ago. Indeed, the  possibility of a new economic populism has worried Bush strategists since 1988,  and now, even without a specific Democratic presidential candidate fitting the  bill, the 1990s are beginning to look like a decade with a populist leitmotif.  </P> <P> Class warfare is a misnomer. There is almost no serious precedent in U.S.  politics. But if class lines are too blurry a battleground, popular or populist  insurgencies against political and economic elites have a long history -- and  the Democrats now raising this issue are harnessing a powerful tradition that  could discomfort Bush for the rest of his White House tenure. The question is  how much. For populism and anger over economic fairness to move into high gear,  four provocations have been necessary:  </P> <P> First, there has to be a national economic downturn -- the worse it gets, the  greater the reaction against the policies and failures of the allied political  and economic elites in charge. This may be under way.  </P> <P> Second, the public has to see capitalism losing its creative, entrepreneurial  credentials and tilting more toward speculation, manipulation and greed. With  Michael Milken, Charles H. Keating Jr. and Neil Bush so much in the headlines,  this transition is already in process.  </P> <P> Third, voters have to have a sense that the rich have been getting a lot more  money a lot faster than everyone else -- and, in this respect, statistics for  the late 1980s are compelling.  </P> <P> Last, the public has to perceive that the ruling Washington elite has helped  the rich with unfair preferences. This is why Bush and the Republicans have so  hurt themselves by putting such emphasis on upper-bracket tax breaks. Voters'  worst suspicions are being confirmed, at the most inopportune time.  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, it's not surprising that Washington observers,  including many heartsick GOP strategists, see not just Bush's ratings but also  any larger Republican opportunity for realignment disintegrating before their  eyes. Liberal critics may talk about "Carterization" or, like the New Republic,  call for Baker's resignation. Republicans, however, feel a special pain.  </P> <P> Even during the September budget summit, congressional Republicans had begun  likening Sununu, Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady to "Larry, Moe and Curly" -- the Three Stooges. Ed Rollins,  co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, has been  telling the press that Sununu and Darman have been politically insensitive,  leaving Republicans in Congress to pay the price.  </P> <P> It could be a stiff price. The NRCC's own polls show Republican  self-identification among voters dropping 10-12 percentage points during  October -- a stunning decline. Unless the election produces a lot of pleasant  surprises, it's hard to imagine congressional Republicans ever fully trusting  or relying on the Bush White House again -- the same disastrous attitude that  Democrats developed toward Carter. Some congressional Republicans are already  describing Bush as "dead meat" in 1992.  </P> <P> Finally, there's growing reason to wonder whether Bush may not be losing his  leverage in the Persian Gulf, too. In the wake of a recent CBS news poll  showing domestic support for Bush's handling of the gulf crisis dropping to  just 57%, there have been parallel signs of dissension among the allies  confronting Saddam Hussein. Even Saudi Arabia appears more conciliatory,  hinting Hussein could receive territorial concessions in return for withdrawing  from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Any such settlement would cast real doubt on Bush's strategy in the Persian  Gulf, leaving him out on a limb in terms of U.S domestic politics. For now, the  President's reply is more hawkishness -- he's insisting no compromise is  possible and he's broadening his comparison between Hussein and Adolf Hitler by  likening Iraqi troops in Kuwait to the Nazi Death's Head regiment in Poland  during World War II.  </P> <P> Time magazine, for its part, has noted speculation that cracks in the anti-Iraq  coalition are pushing the United States to consider an attack, and a French  paper reported an attack could come before the election. In any case, the gulf  crisis could be on its way to becoming the international political equivalent  of the embarrassing budget summit.  </P> <P> Two-and-a-half years ago, some Republicans -- this writer included -- suggested  the best GOP strategy in the 1988 presidential election was to lose. Let the  Democrats get back into the White House just in time to hold the bag as the  bills for the dead-end speculation economics of the 1980s came due.  </P> <P> Over the last year or so -- especially after seeming triumphs, such as the  invasion of Panama and capture of Manuel A. Noreiga -- GOP politicians laughed  at these forebodings and revelled in possible benefits from the Bush  presidency. But now, as October takes on the color of a political Halloween,  Republicans find their "what might have been" reveries drifting back to the  once-in-a-generation GOP political opportunity that existed in 1988 -- the  election of Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> Just imagine. If Dukakis -- who has become a laughingstock even in his home  state -- were in the White House, odds are that the Democratic Party would be  facing a November blood bath. GOP senators and congressmen musing on these  fates believe that Republicans running against a Dukakis White House would be  about to regain control of the Senate, add 25-30 seats in the House and achieve  a major voice in 1991 redistricting. Instead, the despondent National  Republican Congressional Committee is putting out memos on how party candidates  can run away from Bush.  </P> <P> Remember, Bush has recovered from weakness before, and he has at least 12  months to do so again. But for now, Washington's vultures are beginning to  think about what could be another political death watch.  </P></p>

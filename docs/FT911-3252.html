			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Car export growth is expected to slow UK MOTOR industry leaders yesterday warned Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, that recent strong growth in car exports was expected to slow in the second half of the year. Car production has become increasingly dependent on exports in the face of the sharp downturn in domestic new car demand. Car makers are concerned, however, that sales in export markets are also likely to weaken later this year, when the present high level of demand in Germany begins to fall. The chief executives of Rover, Ford of Britain, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot met Mr Lamont and Mr Peter Lilley, secretary of state for trade and industry, yesterday to express the industry's concern at measures taken in last month's Budget. Car makers have become alarmed by what they perceive as an increasingly hostile attitude by the government towards the motor industry. Sir Hal Miller, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove and chairman of the all-party motor industry group of MPs, said Mr Lamont had assured the industry that it would not be used as 'a milch cow' for taxation. Sir Hal said the industry had not pressed in particular for the abolition of the 10 per cent special car tax - which has been a long-standing demand from the sector. New car sales fell by 12.7 per cent last year and fell by a further 21.6 per cent in the first quarter this year.</p>

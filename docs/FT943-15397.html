			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Break for the Border seeks cash after fall Break for the Border Group, the restaurant and nightclub operator which came to the market in May 1993, yesterday accompanied reduced annual profits with a cash raising exercise. Turnover from the two London cafes and the Borderline nightclub amounted to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 4.1m) during the 12 months to March 31 with improved margins behind a rise to Pounds 3.24m (Pounds 3.11m)in gross profits from food and drink sales. However, increased staffing and costs of seeking expansion opportunities, left profits before and after tax down from Pounds 477,000 to Pounds 402,000. A maiden dividend of 0.67p is payable from earnings of 4.3p (8.3p) per share. Mr Robert Gunlack, chairman, said that further growth would mainly come from acquisitions and the extension of its brand names away from London and the group yesterday confirmed the purchase, first announced in May, of the Dublin-based Marino Group. Marino comprises a 75 bedroom hotel and four theme bar/restaurants within a half mile radius in the Irish capital. Initial consideration amounts to IPounds 2m (Pounds 1.98m) cash on completion with further performance related payments to a maximum IPounds 5.08m. The deal will be funded by a placing and open offer of 7.88m new shares at 52p to raise a net Pounds 3.75m. The shares have been conditionally placed with institutions and other investors by Fiske, with existing shareholders entitled to participate on a 2-for-5 basis.</p>

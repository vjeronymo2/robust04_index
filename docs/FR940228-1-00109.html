			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The June 8, 1993, final regulations modified the definition of institutional refund to require an institution to exclude any unpaid charges owed to the institution by a student in determining the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges. These proposed regulations would retain this provision. However, because the HEA now specifies that an institution is permitted to subtract any unpaid charges owed by a student from the calculated refund to the student in calculating a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund, the requirements of the June 8, 1993, final regulations regarding the treatment of unpaid charges have been superseded and are inapplicable only in this case. That is, the institution is not required to exclude any unpaid balance owed to the institution by the student when the institution determines the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges when calculating a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund under section 484B of the HEA. The Secretary notes that the requirements of &sect;668.22 of the June 8, 1993, final regulations continue to be in effect for all other refunds calculated in accordance with section 484B of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that if the amount of a refund owed to a student is $25 or less, the institution would not be required to pay the refund. The Secretary believes that the administrative cost to institutions to make refunds of such a small amount may be greater than the refunds themselves. This consideration is of particular concern at institutions that have low tuition charges resulting in small refunds that are administratively burdensome and costly to the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Allocation of Refunds and Overpayments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 485 of the HEA specifies the order of return of refunds to the various sources of aid and to the student. A refund owed to a student who received funds under any Title IV, HEA program is to be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from which the student received aid in the following order until the amounts received by the student from those programs are eliminated. (1) The FFEL programs; (2) The FDSL Program; (3) The Federal Perkins Loan Program; (4) The Federal Pell Grant Program; (5) The FSEOG Program; (6) All other sources of aid; (7) The student. The Secretary proposes to make clear the longstanding policy that, after balances resulting from the FSEOG Program are eliminated, balances on aid received from all other Title IV, HEA programs must be eliminated before the State and private sources of aid are refunded. For consistency and to reduce administrative burden, the Secretary proposes to apply this order of return to repayment of overpayments also except that, in accordance with current regulations, no amount of a repayment may be allocated to the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, and Federal SLS programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also would make clear that refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances of Title IV, HEA program aid received for the period of enrollment for which the refunds are made. The Secretary does not believe that refunds should be used to eliminate, for example, outstanding balances on loans made for prior years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 485 of the HEA does not specify an order of return for refunds under the FFEL programs. The Secretary proposes a specified order of return for FFEL program funds. Refunds would be returned to eliminate outstanding balances on: (1) Federal SLS loans; (2) unsubsidized Federal Stafford loans; (3) subsidized Federal Stafford loans; and (4) Federal PLUS loans, in that order. The Secretary believes that this order is beneficial to the student and that by mandating the order of return of FFEL program funds, the interest of the student would be protected. The Secretary wishes to clarify that when returning any FFEL program funds, an institution may return the gross amount of a loan (including the guaranty and origination fee) if the institution so chooses, to serve as a deterrent to default on the small remaining amount. This ``extra'' amount would be used to reduce the next source of aid on the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary wishes to clarify that this order must be used if Title IV, HEA program funds are received, whether they are applied toward institutional charges or disbursed to the student for living expenses. Even if all Title IV, HEA program funds are disbursed to the student for living expenses, if a refund is owed when the student withdraws from the institution, the refund must first be returned to the Title IV, HEA programs from which the student received aid in the order specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Reiseburo Kuoni turns in 13.9% advance in sales REISEBURO Kuoni, the Swiss travel group, said it looked forward to a 'relatively satisfactory' result in 1993. The group, in which the German retailer Kaufhof purchased a 50.1 per cent capital stake last year, reported that 1992 group sales rose by 13.9 per cent to SFr2.46bn (Dollars 1.72bn) and net profits more than doubled to SFr49.9m from SFr21.3m. Mr Peter Oes, chief executive, said at the group's annual press conference that Kuoni was discussing co-operation with Kaufhof's ITS travel subsidiary. It has also been agreed that Kaufhof would select two of the group's seven board members. The Swiss Kuoni-Hugentobler Foundation, created by the group's founder, holds a 52.6 per cent voting majority. Swissair sold its 35.8 per cent stake in Kuoni last May.</p>

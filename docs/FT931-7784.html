			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / NHS chief in Scotland will head Oftel THE eight-month search for a new director-general for Oftel, the telecommunications industry watchdog, ended yesterday with the appointment of Mr Don Cruickshank, chief executive of the National Health Service in Scotland. The long-delayed appointment reflects the determination of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to find a candidate with broad business experience rather than a civil servant or academic. The post was originally advertised at a salary of about Pounds 90,000 a year. Confirming Mr Cruickshank's appointment from April 1, Mr Heseltine said yesterday that the telecoms industry had changed significantly since privatisation of British Telecommunications in 1984. The 1991 duopoly review had triggered further liberalisation, and an increasing number of operators had entered the market. He therefore wished to appoint someone 'who had direct experience of competition as a businessman'. Mr Cruickshank, a 50-year-old chartered accountant, became chief executive of the NHS in Scotland in 1989. Before that, he was managing director of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group for five years. His career also includes a period as commercial director of Times Newspapers, general manager of The Sunday Times and a director of the information and entertainment division of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. At the end of last year, there were suggestions that Mr Heseltine had rejected all the names drawn up on a shortlist put to him and had ordered a fresh search. Mr Cruickshank will take over from Mr Bill Wigglesworth, who was made acting director-general of Oftel following the departure last year of Sir Brian Carsberg to head the Office of Fair Trading. Mr Wigglesworth will resume his position as Oftel's deputy director-general. Mr Cruickshank will arrive at Oftel after a period in which some important decisions affecting the telecommunications industry have been taken, particularly the duopoly review and the BT pricing formula which is set until 1997. Oftel is, however, charged with regulating the licences granted to the new generation of competitors beginning to enter the telecommunications market. Earlier this month, Ionica, a privately owned company and the first direct competitor to BT and Mercury, was granted a licence which it hopes will give it 5 per cent of the household and small-business market within 10 years. Up to 30 more licence applications are being considered by the Department of Trade and Industry. Oftel is also awaiting a report on the future operation of the 999 emergency services and is discussing with BT proposals for changes to its internal accounting procedures.</p>

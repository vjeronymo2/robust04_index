			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold may sell Aztec stake to Pancontinental PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group and the winner on Tuesday of an ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m) bid battle for Aztec Mining, yesterday left open the possiblity that it could accept an offer from Pancontinental Mining for its newly-acquired Aztec holding. Pancontinental was the second bidder for Aztec, offering a mixture of ordinary shares and options, in contrast to PosGold's cash terms. When PosGold snapped up more than three-quarters of Aztec's shares through a stock-market raid, Pancontinental said it was withdrawing its rival bid. It is unclear, however, whether Australian takeover rules make this possible. Moreover, even if the Pancon offer carries a 90 per cent acceptance condition, PosGold could be in a position to satisfy this.</p>

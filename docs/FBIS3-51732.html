			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ilimar Franco] </F>   [Text] Brasilia--Jolted by the Budget CPI [Congressional  Investigating Committee], bereft of a candidate, and rudderless,  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is experiencing  its toughest political times ever. Brazil's largest party enters  the preliminary phase of another presidential election with no  prospects of victory. After being turned down by the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which does not want to be  part of a coalition, the PMDB is being courted by [Rio] Governor  Leonel Brizola, who is interested in using the party's structure  to support his own candidacy. Internally, the situation could  hardly be more complicated. None of the likely candidates for  the presidency--Antonio Britto, Orestes Quercia, Jose Sarney,  Pedro Simon, or Luiz Antonio Fleury--is uniting the party.    PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina),  believes the party's best hope is to elect a huge delegation to  the Chamber of Deputies and the state legislative assemblies. "I  have no doubt the PMDB will win a majority in the Congress,"  said Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais), its leader in the Chamber.  Despite being cut to the quick by the investigations of Deputies  Ibsen Pinheiro (Rio Grande do Sul) and Genebaldo Correia  (Bahia), the pmdebistas believe they can come out on  top. "Unlike some other parties, we are not putting obstacles in  the path of the investigation, nor are we protecting the  pmdebistas involved," charged the president of the  Sao Paulo PMDB, Deputy Roberto Rolemberg. "We installed a  traditional adversary from the Right as chairman of the CPI  (Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party,  Para]), and we ensured the presence of a traditional adversary  from the Left on the CPI (Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP)  [Workers Party, Sao Paulo])," Tarcisio added.  <H5>  Top Leaders Optimistic </H5>   "We would come out of this weaker had we tried to impede the  investigations," argues Luiz Henrique, convinced that the public  will understand that the responsibility rests with individuals,  not with the party. But although the top PMDB leadership is  optimistic about the outcome of the CPI and even though it is  the most affected party, the same cannot be said of the process  of selecting its candidate for president of Brazil. The  strongest man, Rio Grande do Sul Deputy Antonio Britto, former  minister of social security, has withdrawn his name from the  contest in principle, after receiving signals that the  quercistas would not support him. Former [Sao Paulo]  Governor Orestes Quercia, who had been torpedoed by a long list  of charges of illicit enrichment, has resurfaced and is  attempting to revive his candidacy for either Planalto Palace or  [Sao Paulo's] Bandeirantes Palace, but does not have his party's  support.    "We have candidates for every taste," said Rio Grande do Sul  Senator Pedro Simon, the administration's leader in the Senate  and another influential name vetoed by the  quercistas. Amapa Senator Jose Sarney dreams of being  a candidate, but in recent conversations with politicians has  acknowledged that this would be feasible only with Quercia's  seal of approval. Even so, it would be a candidacy weakened by  charges of corruption and a lack of support from the historical  leaders of the PMDB. [Sao Paulo] Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury  would not unite the party; proof of this was furnished when he  was left alone in his campaign to have the party abandon the  Itamar Franco administration, two months ago.    With so many problems, it will be hard for the party to  decide on a candidate within the first two months of 1994, as  its president and its leaders in the Chamber and Senate would  like it to do. "That would be the ideal, but I'm afraid it won't  happen," said Tarcisio Delgado. Simon concurred, saying: "There  is no natural candidate."    Governor Leonel Brizola has already taken note of the PMDB  dilemma and decided to rush in and see whether this situation  could benefit the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. Deputies Vivaldo  Barbosa and Neiva Moreira, both from Rio, have agreed with Luiz  Henrique and Tarcisio Delgado that the two will meet with  Brizola on Wednesday. The pedetistas think there is a  lot of affinity between the two parties.  <H5>  Infernal Luck From January to December </H5>   1993 was a year of chaos for the PMDB. Shaken by a  succession  of crises, the party is more divided than ever and the domestic  crisis which, paradoxically, has been nourishing it since the  military regime, has deepened. The PMDB began the year debating  whether or not to participate in the Itamar Franco government.  Party President Orestes Quercia was ultimately defeated, and the  position taken by government leader Rio Grande do Sul Senator  Pedro Simon in favor of the Itamar administration prevailed. But  this would not be the last defeat for Quercia, who, attacked by  former allies like Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo Correia, ended  up resigning the party presidency in May after becoming  increasingly isolated politically.    The debates on the wage policy approved by the Chamber's  Labor Committee, which raised wages by 100 percent, split the  PMDB once again. Senator Jose Sarney defended the proposal  against the Itamar Franco administration and its leader in the  Senate, Senator Pedro Simon. Sarney argued that his  administration had also been subjected to such a wage policy  against his will but, if it had not been for the chaos, that  same policy would be in effect under the present government.  Sarney was defeated within the PMDB when the Senate rejected the  proposal that had passed the Chamber.    The administration would split the PMDB again in August,  when  Itamar Franco decided to fire BNDES [National Bank for Economic  and Social Development] President Delben Leite. Sao Paulo  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury, who had never advocated that the  party participate in the government, took advantage of the  episode to suggest that the PMDB withdraw from the  administration. Fleury ended up being crushed by the actions of  party heavyweights like Sarney, Quercia and Simon.    The party began the year divided on questions of government  and ends 1993 with the same problem. But now the reason for the  discord is the appointment of the government's leader in the  Chamber. Deputy Luiz Henrique told President Itamar Franco last  Wednesday that the party does not want to nominate the  government's leader in the Chamber. Senator Pedro Simon thinks  otherwise. They all agreed to postpone the problem, so the  leader will probably not be chosen until 10 January.    The Budget CPI was like a massacre for the party. The  largest  number of people involved in the scandal, whose victims included  two important party leaders--Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo  Correia--are from the PMDB. Other respected names, such as  Senators Humberto Lucena (Paraiba) and Mauro Benevides (Ceara),  came out of it with tarnished images. The PMDB is the party with  the highest number of "dwarfs," the legislators [all short men]  who ran the Budget Committee and all the irregularities  committed on it.    As for the policy of forging alliances with an eye to the  presidential election, a lot could happen--at least in Sao  Paulo--most probably in the runoff. "In the first round, it is  possible there might be a `white' coalition," announced Sao  Paulo State Deputy Joao Leiva, a quercista and vice  president--now acting president--of the paulista  party board. A "white coalition" means respecting one's  opponent, avoiding making accusations or giving offense, in  order to facilitate an alliance for the runoff election. The  easiest, and most likely arrangement would be with the PSDB,  despite the hesitation of the tucanos Leiva reported  that there is also pressure for an alliance with Paulo Maluf's  PPR. If Maluf does not run for president, as it seems he will  not, the PPR backing could be of great help to the PMDB.  Definitely ruled out is an alliance with the PT.    Despite the current dissension--Quercia against Fleury in  Sao  Paulo, and Quercia against other potential candidates--the  quercistas anticipate that the PMDB will unite when  the convention rolls around.  <H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Maria Mayrink] </H5> <H5>  Sao Paulo: Fleury Leads, But Quercia Gives the Orders </H5>   Heir to a powerful and well-oiled administrative machine,  Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury is the PMDB's official leader in  Sao Paulo, but the one who still calls the shots in the party is  his predecessor, Orestes Quercia. Supposedly allies, the two are  drifting further and further apart in this preelection phase  when both are trying to open up a route to Planalto Palace while  insisting publicly that they are not candidates. They are not,  but they want to be.    Quercia does not conceal his interest in the presidency of  the Republic and if he is not ready to openly admit that he is a  candidate, it is because he wants to know first who his  opponents would be. He promises to return to the political scene  permanently in January after giving explanations to the PMDB  National Executive Committee regarding charges of corruption.  Quercismo controls more than 70 percent of the PMDB  directorships in the 625 Sao Paulo municipalities. Next year,  the State Executive Committee will conduct a census to find out  how many members the party actually has.    In his covert battle against the political godfather who  sent  him to Bandeirantes Palace, Fleury has been setting up his own  system for winning political prestige in the interior of the  state. That is why he replaced Claudio Alvarenga with Michel  Temer in the Secretariat of Government, with a promise to open  doors of his office to fellow sympathizers.    Fleury swears he is not a candidate for Planalto Palace, but  he has been putting together alliances that might ensure support  for his name at the party convention. Last Thursday, he had  dinner in Belo Horizonte with Minas Gerais Governor Helio  Garcia, whom he is trying to lure into the PMDB.  <H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Carlota Araujo] </H5> <H5>  Rio de Janeiro: Nelson and Moreira, the Spoils Divided </H5>   Fragmented, with three of its bosses swapping barbs, the  PMDB  in Rio is corroded by impasse on the eve of an extremely  important election year. Senator Nelson Carneiro's group says  that the PMDB, now controlled by former Governor Moreira Franco,  is bankrupt. Allies of the former government retort that the  senator is leaving the party for "electioneering" reasons. Both  factions accuse Rio Mayor Cesar Maia of being an opportunist.  Behind the division is the big question: with an eye to the 1994  elections, when posts at all levels will be at stake, they are  fighting to see who will negotiate in Rio in the name of the  party.    Nelson's group, which withdraws officially from the PMDB  tomorrow, said that the condominium fee on PMDB headquarters has  not been paid for two months. They also accuse the present  Executive Committee of racking up court suits for its  noncompliance with labor law. The senator insists he is leaving  because Moreira's group has monopolized the Executive Committee.    Supporters of the former governor refute the accusations.  The  party's current secretary general in Rio, Carlos Alberto Muniz,  said that the PMDB has no debts, that Moreira offered Nelson  every chance, but that he refused because he already had his  eyes on the PP [Progressive Party]. Moreira notes that any  agreement in connection with the governorship of Rio will be  subordinate to whatever alliances are formed for the  presidential elections. He insists he wants to run for a seat in  the Chamber, but Muniz does not rule out the possibility that  Moreira may become a candidate for governor of Rio. Meanwhile,  Moreira has been talking informally with the PSDB candidate,  Marcello Alencar. The former mayor has in his favor a large  portion of the 3.8 million votes in the city of Rio, but needs  help from the PMDB organization in the interior of the state.  <H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Roselena Nicolau] </H5> <H5>  Minas Gerais: Succession Will Be Clash of Opposing Forces </H5>   Even though it is the largest party in the state, the best  organized, and the one with the largest delegation in the state  legislature, the PMDB in Minas is a party without a face. This  is demonstrated by the internal disputes for the state  governorship. There are three candidates: federal Deputy  Tarcisio Delgado, party leader in the Chamber of Deputies;  former Governor Newton Cardoso; and the president of the Minas  Federation of Industries, Jose Alencar.    Tarcisio, who is from the "authentic" group, insists he will  win the convention, scheduled for May, and the elections as  well, despite the damage that the Budget CPI has done to the  PMDB. He said that, on the contrary, "it gave the grass roots an  incentive" to react after the CPI was installed.    Tarcisio says that the transformation in Minas Gerais goes  back to the beginning of 1993 when the top party leadership was  replaced and "members of the vanguard" took over. The deputy,  who is a member of the regional leadership body, urges an  approach to the PSDB and acknowledges that his running mate will  be former Belo Horizonte Mayor Eduardo Azeredo.    Another candidate with a long history in the PMDB, former  Governor Newton Cardoso, ranks second in the polls for the  governorship--the polls in which Tarcisio's name does not  appear. Cardoso's administration was plagued by charges of  corruption. Rejected in the state capital, he is strong in the  interior of the state.    As the "dark horse" of the PMDB, businessman Jose Alencar is  betting on "administrative competence and moral authority" to  help him win the battle at the convention. Alencar has never  been a politician and will exploit this fact to some extent in  his campaign. "I do not need politics," says he, who owns 10  companies.  <H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Mitchell] </H5> <H5>  Rio Grande do Sul: Federal Congressmen and Britto the Stars </H5>   Given the positive national image of almost all its federal  legislators, and boasting the best regional party structure, the  Rio Grande do Sul PMDB is not suffering much from the negative  repercussions of the Budget CPI. On the contrary, former  Minister and Federal Deputy Antonio Britto leads all the polls  for the gaucho governorship; some surveys show he has  twice or three times as many votes as the other candidates.    The Rio Grande do Sul congressional delegation, part of the  PMDB's so-called Ethical Movement, also distinguishes itself in  other areas: Deputy Nelson Jobim is the rapporteur for the  constitutional revision and Pedro Simon, the principal leader in  the state, is the government's leader in the Senate and the most  influential political advisor to President Itamar Franco.    The only exception concerns the heretofore highly respected  former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Ibsen Pinheiro. Oddly  enough, by opting at the time to be speaker of the Chamber  instead of running for mayor of Porto Alegre, Ibsen was one of  those responsible for the defeat of the party: after his refusal  and that of three other potential candidates, State Deputy Cesar  Schirmer lost the mayoral race to the PT candidate, Tarso Genro.    The gaucho PMDB is trying to recover from  successive electoral losses--for the governorship in 1990, and  the last two elections for mayor of Porto Alegre. The state  capital is the main problem for the gaucho PMDB,  since the PDT heads the city council, the legislative assembly,  and the state governorship, while the PT holds City Hall. In  compensation, the PMDB is well organized in the 427  municipalities and ranks first in the number of mayors (160),  vice mayors (145), and aldermen (1,286).</p>

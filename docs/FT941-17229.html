			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Dealers take post-Christmas profits European government bond markets fell broadly as traders cashed in profits following the Christmas season rally and braced themselves for possible adverse economic data later in the month. In the UK, an unexpectedly large jump in the narrow M0 money supply measure dampened expectations of further interest rate cuts and sent prices of gilts down sharply. Money supply expanded at an annualised rate of 5.8 per cent in December, well beyond the Treasury's 4 per cent target band, particularly depressing the longer end of the yield curve. The nearby March gilt futures contract fell to a low of 119.02 from the peak of 120.20 on December 29 before recovering at the close. In Germany, bund prices eased as dealers took post-Christmas profits, triggering some technical selling as prices fell through key support levels. There is also some nervousness ahead of German cost-of-living data, which may be released this week, and little expectation that recent economic data has shown sufficient weakness to prompt a cut in the German discount rate when the Bundesbank Council meets this Thursday. Italian government bond prices closed modestly higher, aided by optimistic assessments about Italian inflation for 1994. However, dealers remain concerned about a no-confidence debate in Parliament which could delay national elections tentatively slated for March. The combination of yen weakness against the US dollar, Monday's sell-off in the US treasury bond market and the prospect of new supply later this week all helped to push Japanese government bonds lower in yesterday's half-day trading session. The March futures contract opened at 117.33 and fell to a low of 117.08 before closing at 117.10. This compares with the close of 117.53 on December 30, the previous half-day session. The dollar strengthened yesterday against the yen, trading at Y113.45, compared with Y111.845 on December 30. Adding to the market's weakness is the expectation of an auction of about Y1,000bn of 10-year government bonds this week. Dealers said the coupon on the new bond issue is expected to be about 3.4 per cent. US Treasury bond prices rallied yesterday afternoon amid signs of a modest slowdown in the motor car and retailing sectors. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 ahead at 98 17/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.355 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 higher at 99 15/16 , to yield 4.266 per cent. After a week in which the yield on longer-dated securities climbed about 15 basis points, strong futures-led buying boosted prices across the maturity range. However, much of the activity came from traders adjusting their positions after the big sell-off. Demand evaporated and prices fell back to near opening levels. The market was lifted for a second time in mid-afternoon, when the final 10-day car sales figures of 1993 proved lacklustre. The Johnson Redbook report further eased concern over the pace of economic expansion. It showed December retail sales down 0.4 per cent from November, and up by a disappointing 8.5 per cent over the year-earlier period. The focus shifts now to the Labor Department's report on non-farm payrolls to be released on Friday. Forecasts range from an increase of 225,000 to 300,000. A figure at the high end could trigger a further bout of selling. The French economy ministry said the Treasury would issue around FFr275bn of OATs and FFr245bn of two and five-year notes (BTANs) in 1994, Reuter reports from Paris. It said net OAT and BTAN issues, after scheduled redemptions, would be about FFr300bn in 1994 against FFr332bn last year. The treasury issued FFr244bn of OATs and FFr231bn of BTANs in 1993, including Ecu4.2bn of bonds and notes denominated in the EU's basket currency. The Ecu amount, some FFr28bn worth, represented about 6 per cent of the total, compared with the treasury's original wish to issue some 15 per cent of new issues in Ecu. The Balladur bond, a special offering in July convertible into privatised shares, allowed a reduction of FFr72bn in outstanding Treasury bills.</p>

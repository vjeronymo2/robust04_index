"We will be increasing exports to Japan of our Accord and  Civic models from Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. Our  decision was backed by strong demand in Japan, as well as by the  appreciation of the yen against the dollar," the official said.    The decision was also made in line with the commencement of  sales in Japan on March 1 of Ohio-made Accord wagons and Accord  coupes, he said.    Honda of America's top export regions will be Japan,  followed  by Taiwan, Europe, Israel and Latin America. A few more  countries in Latin America could be added to the U.S. unit's  current list of 28 export countries, bringing the total as high  as 32, the official said.</p>

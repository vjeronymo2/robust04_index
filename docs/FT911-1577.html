			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Ulster talks on course UNIONIST and Nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland are expected to sit down together next week for the first time for more than 15 years to try to reach a historic agreement on new structures for governing the province, our Belfast Correspondent writes. The final agenda-setting meeting was held yesterday at Stormont Castle in Belfast, when Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, met Unionist representatives, led by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, and the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader. The meeting broke up after three hours with neither Mr Brooke nor the Unionist leaders commenting on their discussions. A Northern Ireland Office official said the inter-party talks process was still at the bilateral stage.</p>

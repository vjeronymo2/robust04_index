			<p>BFN     [Text] In Hanoi on the afternoon of 19 April, Dr. Ho Si  Thoang, general director of the Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation  [VOGC], signed a production-sharing contract with  representatives of the U.S. (NJP) Group and Japanese companies  for oil and gas exploration and exploitation in Lot 05-1B on the  Vietnamese continental shelf. Participating in the contract are  the VOGC's Oil and Gas Exploration and Exploitation Company and  an oil and gas company of the Russian Federation. This is 27th  production-sharing contract signed between the VOGC and foreign  companies since the introduction of the state Investment Law; it  is the first contract signed with a major U.S. oil company.    Lot 05-1B in the Thanh Long oil field is located on the  Vietnamese continental shelf. It lies about 400 km southeast of  the Vietnamese coast next to the Dai Hung oil field. It is  considered a promising spot for oil and gas. The U.S company  searched and explored here in early 1975 before withdrawing in  April 1975.    Present at the signing ceremony were Deputy Prime Minister  Tran Duc Luong, many high-ranking Vietnamese Government  officials, and diplomatic representatives of the concerned  countries.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Tashbulatova, GUDOK correspondent: "We </F> Learned How To Spend, We Will Learn How To Earn: Notes from the  Fifth Assembly of Railroad Chiefs"]    [Text] The results of 1993 and the results of the  first two months of this year upset all the calculations:  instead of the predicted drop in the transport volume, in the  range of 4 percent, by last December the reduction had reached  20 percent and more. This recession continued in March. Despite  the rigid stand of a number of railroads, they did not succeed  in achieving any sudden change in remuneration for transport. As  before, the mining, oil- and gas-extracting sectors, as well as  enterprises of the chemical and timber complex, were insolvent.  A number of major Russian enterprises periodically shut down and  stopped shipping goods.    The situation was similar on virtually every railroad.  The problems of advance financing were exacerbated, both with  respect to transfer of funds by the MPS [Ministry of Railways]  and settlement of accounts with other railroads and  enterprises.    That is why the sector's "brain center" assembled in  Yekaterinburg. The assembly constituted not only a unique  training aid and exchange of opinions of the road directors, but  also a means of working out future strategy and tactics. The  measures outlined were obviously inadequate. The joint efforts  of the roads to seek levers of influence on the deepest strata  of the railroad economy had to be coordinated. As O. Sharadze,  chief of the Gorkiy Railroad, said, because of the changed  conditions, structural changes were necessary as well. "Whereas  before, they pressed transportation on us and we had to decide  how we were to convey things, now, in my opinion, the structures  which are earning money have to be moved to the foreground. We  all learned how to spend, but few learned how to earn.  Therefore, I feel: we need to perform a structural  reorganization so that the economy is in the foreground. This is  the basis of all bases."    Three main blocks of questions were singled out at the  assembly. These were the economic interaction of the roads with  respect to carrying out the government decree "On the Position  of the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in  1994" and the statutes passed by the MPS Collegium on 11 March  1994; improving the transport process, or rather, reorganizing  it, in conformity with the new conditions, and carrying out  state programs for traffic safety.    I. Besedin, deputy minister, in speaking to the assembly  participants, devoted his main attention to following a flexible  tariff policy and granting broader rights in this respect to the  railroad chiefs. As we know, a one-ruble rise in the tariff for  transport will lead to a five-fold increase in prices on the  commodity market. Meanwhile, along with insolvency, the increase  in tariffs played a decisive role in the deterioration of the  sector's economic situation.    While in 1991, the increase in tariffs had virtually no  effect on transport volumes, and many things in the economy were  still moving due to inertia, the first abrupt crisis arrived in  May-June 1992, when tariffs all in all rose by a factor of 62  compared with the 1989 price list. The situation then stabilized  somewhat, but in November 1993, after the next rise in tariffs,  by a factor of 1.5, a second crisis occurred: freight turnover  dropped by practically 30 percent and more, and carriage charges  began to be greatly in excess of the value of the goods  transported.    Within the limits of a single mainline, following a flexible  tariff policy -- whom and how much does it benefit -- is within  the jurisdiction of the railroad chief. But what happens when  freight travels over two to three roads or more?    The participants in the assembly suggested several  perspectives on the solution to this problem. In the first  place, granting rebates and concluding the appropriate contracts  with the consignors of the dispatching road by telegraphed  agreement with the road of destination.    In the second place, it was proposed that for an operative  and qualified solution to the problems of regulating tariffs in  through service and for market research, with the development of  the appropriate recommendations on organizing transport and  tariff policy, a network marketing center, so to speak, a tariff  administration, be created at the MPS.    The next perspective had already been discussed at the MPS  Collegium. The overall level of tariffs today is such that  railroad workers have begun to lose out in the competition with  motor vehicle transport, where the growth rates of the tariffs  are lower -- not to mention small shipments and perishable  freight, as well as reinforced concrete items and building  materials, and moreover for long distances. The advantage in the  tariffs stems from the fact that the production cost of motor  vehicle transport does not include expenditures to maintain the  highways. Meanwhile, the railroad workers, through tax on the  railroad funds, by means of their own expenditures and  accordingly, tariffs, even finance the motorists.    On granting broader rights to the road chiefs.... This is a  two-edged weapon, a serious question. Why? The railroad workers  are regarded as monopolists, hence it is natural that the  anti-monopoly committee pays close attention to railroad  directors. Some railroads have already had to pay millions in  fines for this reason. Here we need the skilled work of  specialists, lawyers and economists, careful, impeccable work on  preparing contracts and fulfilling all the necessary  requirements. The MPS drew up methodological instructions, which  give recommendations, scientifically and with substantiation, on  organizing transport and the tariff policy.    The assembly also paid great attention to problems of  improving cost-accounting relations within the sector. The  method of formulating and the level of accounting prices for the  transport of freight and passengers in through service, along  with the volumes of transport, prove to have a considerable  effect on the financial results of the railroads. For most of  them, the relative proportion of transport in through service  and the revenues from it is overwhelming.    Many years of practical experience show that the existing  system of accounting prices does not meet the requirements of an  objective evaluation of the railroads' financial-economic  activity. The roads are not interested in seeking and realizing  reserves for the rise and fall of expenses.    For example, the Sverdlovsk Railroad had a 15-billion loss  from transport in January, while the Baykal-Amur had a  15-billion profit. If one considers that the transport volumes  on the Sverdlovsk are considerably higher, and the production  cost is much lower than on BAM, this polarity in financial  results can be explained only by the absence of objective  criteria for formulating accounting prices.    The identical level of profitability incorporated in  accounting prices gives the advantage to roads which have a high  production cost. For example, passenger transport is  unprofitable. The size of the losses are tremendous, but  meanwhile, given the existing formulation of accounting prices,  the roads performing the largest volume of passenger transport  are the most profitable. Is this not a paradox? The time is not  only ripe, but over-ripe for a return to the tariff principle of  distribution. Today even with unified tariffs the obvious  economic problems can be solved through the Russian government.    If BAM, for example, with the present tariffs, is  unprofitable, everyone should know about it. The size of its  losses should be known precisely. Today, however, reliable, and  moreover accessible information on the economic situation of the  railroads is practically non-existent. After all, every director  wants to see the situation of his own road against the  background of others, in order to evaluate the success of his  actions and to determine the problems that require joint efforts.    The Sverdlovsk Mainline proposed its own variant --  territorially differentiated tariffs. To accelerate their  introduction one must take a look at practical experience and  see what is happening as a result of this on individual  sections. Let us say, with the next indexing of freight tariffs,  by decision of the Russian Committee on Prices, a virtual  coefficient is established for the Tobolsk-Surgut section, and  so on, the road having been granted the right to exact and  direct toward its income the corresponding additional carriage  charge accompanying the dispatch and arrival of freight.    A proposal was also introduced on rescinding the material  responsibility of the roads for failure to adhere to the limit  for financing transit roads. The road collectives should not  bear the responsibility for the imperfection of the income  distribution system. Wages constitute a large part of the  operating expenses, and therefore, given the continuing  recession in transport, one must not avoid taking note of this  part of the expenses.    This problem will be solved, in the first place through  changing the work conditions for low-activity sections and  stations, leaving the reserves of refrigerator rolling stock and  the locomotive fleet alone, and taking organizational and  technological measures. Today, however, although this question  was also raised at the MPS Collegium, there is no proper basis  for norms determining the number of workers on the basis of the  drop in transport volumes and the accounting fund for labor  wages. Many of the existing normatives and norms for service  have grown obsolete and are unsuitable for the present-day  situation.    Meanwhile, dissonance is introduced by the main  administrations, which sometimes instruct the roads to increase  the number of individual categories of workers and demand that  certain technological and other structural subdivisions be newly  created. Every road acts on its own here. For example, the  Sverdlovsk has put the emphasis on improving labor organization,  and has used home duty, a fragmented work day, combining jobs  within an enterprise and a short work day. All this, of course,  was approved by the trade union. The assembly proposed that the  existing tariff rates and wages on the railroads be reduced to  unified rates and wages, established for the network according  to the vocational qualifications of groups of workers, based on  differences and difficulty, in accordance with the Tariff  Agreement.    Under the conditions of the sharp drop in the transport  volume, the problem of setting quotas for the railcar fleet is a  very urgent one. On the roads, the non-operating fleet -- MPS  reserves, technological reserves, railcars belonging on spur  tracks and those not in good working order -- sometimes exceed  the operating fleet. The quota as a norm determining the minimum  maintenance of the total railcar fleet for the volume of  operations has lost its regulatory function. The station tracks  are literally crammed with excess rolling stock. Under these  conditions, an above-quota payment is added to the roads'  additional expenditures to maintain an excess fleet, which  should be compensated in accordance with a centralized  procedure. It turns out that a road is penalized twice.    It was therefore proposed that the financial responsibility  of the railroads for adherence to the quota be eliminated, since  the roads are virtually devoid of any possibility of regulating  the fleets to adjust them to the established norm. The classic  indicators for the use of rolling stock -- such as "work car  turnover" -- are also obsolete.    On transferring part of the locomotive fleet to other roads.  How many documents have the main administrations passed, but  there have been no substantial changes. For example, V.  Predybaylov, chief of the Northern Railroad, complained that  there are not enough diesel locomotives on the mainline, while  there is an excess of electric locomotives. Another road uses  old ones, which long ago worked out their motor life, such as  VL22 electric locomotives. These problems, of course would be  more easily solved by the road directors than through the main  administrations, as is done today.    "This assembly is distinguished from others by the fact that  the Sverdlovsk has shown us the way a road interacts with the  VPK [military-industrial complex]," said I. Paristyy, chief of  the Moscow Railroad.    We have already told, on the pages of GUDOK, of the goods  produced by the Machine Building Plant imeni Kalinin. The visit  made to Uralvagonzavod left no lesser impression on the  participants in the assembly. The road chiefs were already  familiar with many of the items of the "railcar maker" --  gondolas, tank cars with up-to-date modifications, in no way  inferior to foreign analogs -- these are, so to speak, purely  railroad items. But the forklift trucks, excavators and  agricultural equipment for home vegetable gardens -- these were  really impressive. The meeting with V. Seryakov, director of the  Uralvagonzavod Production Association, was also interesting.    At Kamensk-Uralskiy, the assembly participants visited the  Oktyabr Production Association, and familiarized themselves with  the latest innovations in the aircraft industry and, of course,  with the production of an automatic locomotive braking control  system (SAUT-II), on the development of which scientists from  VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific Research  Institute] and Oktyabr specialists collaborated.    "We obtained a great deal of valuable information, related  not only to stabilizing the sector's economy, but also to  solving many practical problems on the Sverdlovsk Mainline,"  noted A. Ivanov, chief of the Far Eastern Railroad. "I, a  student of the Ural school, am proud that the Sverdlovsk  Railroad is giving an example of the way one must operate under  today's difficult conditions."</p>

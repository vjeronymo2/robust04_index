			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Chrysalis re-pupates Chris Wright, 48, the chairman and founder of Chrysalis Group, has turned to Steve Lewis to help rebuild the recording interests of his music publishing, communications and media company. Lewis, 39, who has one of the music industry's most successful track records after 20 years with Virgin, will be chief executive of a new music division which will encompass a new record company (as yet unnamed) and all the group's record publishing activities in the UK, Europe and the US. Chrysalis last year sold its remaining 50 per cent stake in the Chrysalis Records joint venture with Thorn EMI for Dollars 30m in cash and Wright is now freed from a non-competition agreement. He says: 'I have been waiting for the right opportunity to bring in an individual who shares my vision and philosophy. Steve Lewis is that person.' During his five years as deputy managing director of Virgin Records, Lewis was involved in launching artists such as Phil Collins and Simple Minds. From 1983, he was managing director of Virgin Music Publishers. In March, Virgin Music Group was sold to Thorn EMI for Pounds 510m. Lewis, who will have an equity stake in the new record company, will also retain his shareholding in the Tuchwood Label which he established with Rob Melbourne.</p>

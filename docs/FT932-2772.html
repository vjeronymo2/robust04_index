			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: Longer-term threat posed by trade imbalances Sir, While you understandably concentrate on the short-term issues addressed by Peter Sutherland, the newly appointed director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ('Failure on market access could 'sink' Gatt round', June 11), I found most interesting his awareness of a longer-term, but potentially much greater, threat. His call for '. . . legitimate interests, particularly those of the developing world, . . . to be taken into account by the developed world' could not be more relevant. Non-OECD countries (the 'poor') - which account for some 85 per cent of the world's population - are responsible for a mere 25 per cent of the world's international trade (calculated using imports; data from the World Development Report of the World Bank, 1992). I believe these numbers explain why the seemingly endless rows between the US, the EC and Japan focus so much of our attention. Nevertheless, developed countries should not underestimate the threat to themselves from ignoring trade demands from the poor majority. Where goods and services cannot move, people will. If income differentials are allowed to continue to widen - which they have a greater chance of doing without freer trade in agricultural and basic consumer goods - massive migration flows will be inevitable. Unless, that is, the current trend towards closing external borders in the EC and ports in the US develops fully into an international system of global apartheid. We should all wish Mr Sutherland well. His task in convincing OECD policymakers to take a long-term view is a hard but essential one.

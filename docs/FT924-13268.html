			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA rose sharply in early trade on news of an Ivorian decision to ban purchases of mid-crop and sub-grade cocoa for the 1992-93 season. There also appeared to be less prospect of the Ivory Coast selling cocoa around current levels after its decision to keep its producer price for good cocoa at 200 CFA francs a kg and a further fall in the value of sterling against the French franc. News of a 9.2 per cent rise in the third-quarter Dutch cocoa grind was seen as mildly supportive. GOLD was fixed little changed in the afternoon from its four-week low morning fix on the London bullion market. Trading was choppy after heavy Middle East selling. There seemed to be one major player governing business after selling heavily into the Australian market in early trade and then later into Europe, dealers said. There were some producer sales; producers were unhappy to be selling, but some needed to cover costs even though they were helping to drive the market lower. Compiled from Reuters</p>

This report is  completely untrue, the source said, and called on all mass media  not to publish such biased reports until they are verified by  the competent security agencies. He also cautioned the citizens  against believing such rumors, which seek to cast doubts on and  shake confidence in the march to security and stability, which  has gained strength over the past three years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Police are closely monitoring the entry of  foreigners into South Africa following a shooting incident near  Pretoria two weeks ago, in which a German right-winger was shot  dead.    This comes amid reports that neo-Nazi sympathisers from  Europe -- and possibly including battle-hardened Bosnian snipers  fresh from the Yugoslavian war -- are entering the country to  assist the local right-wing. Two weeks ago, German right-winger  Mr. Thomas Kunst, 32, was shot dead in a firefight with police  near Welbekend. Mr. Stephan Rays, 26, Mr. Horst Klenz, 57, and  German Mr. Alex Nedelnein were later arrested. The men were  apparently invited to South Africa by the right-wing.    In the March 14 edition of an international news magazine, a  Bosnian sniper is quoted as saying they feared revenge attacks  after the war. "They are hiring men like us in South Africa,"  said the man, identified only as Pipo. Other local reports,  quoting anonymous right-wing sources, claim that foreign  mercenaries are already in the country.</p>

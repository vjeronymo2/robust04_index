			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT SIMON SAYS ABOUT RAPE HITS TARGET  </P> <P> I commend you on Roger Simon's "Rape: Clothing Is Not the Criminal" (Feb. 18).  People repeatedly assume that women "ask for" the sexual abuse inflicted upon  them, and this is of course not so. Simon displayed, very clearly, that the  violent act comes from the attacker.  </P> <P> SONJA L. ALLER TALVI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Ukraine to keep grip on industry UKRAINE yesterday published a presidential decree continuing its state ordering system into 1994 and opening the door for a tightening of control over key industrial sectors. The decree, signed by President Leonid Kravchuk on October 28, requires agricultural, consumer goods and military enterprises to sell part of their production to the government at state-determined prices. It dashes hopes that Mr Kravchuk might try introducing market reforms before parliamentary and presidential elections next year. Of particular concern is the fact that the decree not only obliges state-owned enterprises - comprising most of Ukraine's industry - to satisfy state orders, but also applies to quasi-private companies that rent space and equipment from the government. Exclusively private companies are not required to comply with state orders. However, the fate of companies that could be privatised next year is unclear. Large-scale privatisation has yet to be initiated in Ukraine. The exact portion of production to be sold to the government at fixed prices is still to be determined. While President Kravchuk's decree is aimed at 'stabilising production' in Ukraine, where gross domestic product is falling at 20 per cent annually, the result is likely to be a further outflow of funds and the continued support of inefficient state enterprises.</p>

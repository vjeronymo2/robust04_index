			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali: "The Annual Report on Economic </F> Performance for 1993 Says: Important Indicators of Economic  Stability and Success of the Liberalization Policy, Including  Decrease in Inflation, Stabilization of Interest Rates on  Deposits, and Increase in Energy Production"]    [Text] The Center of Information and Decision-Making  Support in the Cabinet, under the supervision of Dr. Hisham  al-Sharif, has prepared a comprehensive report concerning  Egypt's economic performance in 1993. According to the report, a  number of economic indicators provide evidence of Egypt's  economic stability and the success of its economic  liberalization policy, the most important of these being the  decrease in the rate of inflation, stability of banking  transactions, and an increase in domestic production of all  types of energy.    By means of an examination of the most important information  that appeared in the annual report dealing with Egypt's economic  performance in 1993, we can monitor the important economic  indicators in this "economic thermometer."    First we note the most important indicator of the economic  stability, the success of the fiscal policy, and the monetary  transactions, and this is the clear decrease in rates of  inflation during the months of 1993, as opposed to the months of  1992. After inflation reached 22.1 percent in May of 1992, it  began to decrease slowly during the subsequent months until it  dropped to 13.6 percent by the end of the year.    In 1993, inflation continued to gradually go down until May,  when it was 10.6 percent, and then it once again went up  slightly until it reached 12.1 percent during the months of  November and December.    The indicator of foreign currency exchange rates during  1993,  until the end of the first week of February of the current year,  shows an increase in the exchange rates of the dollar and the  Japanese yen, whereas there was a decrease in the exchange rates  of the pound sterling, the German mark, the French franc, and  the unified European currency. Although the exchange rate of the  dollar rose only slightly all during 1992, the dollar underwent  lots of rate changes in during 1993. In January of 1992 its rate  was 332.47 piasters, and in January of 1993 its rate was 333.76  piasters, but by January of 1994 its rate had risen to 337.24  piasters and it went up several milliemes by the first week of  February of this year.  <H5>  Continuing Decrease </H5>   The interest rate on treasury bonds continued to go down  during the last two years. After having been 19.6 percent in  October of 1991, it went down to 16.6 percent by the end of 1992  and was 14.4 percent by the end of 1993. The average interest  rate by the first week of February of this year was 13.8 percent.    This decrease had an effect on the continuation of the  decrease of the average interest rate on deposits in Egyptian  pounds. After the rate had been 18 percent in January of 1992,  it went down to 15.2 percent by the end of the year. During the  first half of 1993 it continued to decrease, and it has hovered  around 12.5 percent since last July until the first week of  February of this year, and it is expected to decrease slightly  during the coming months.    These expectations are reinforced by the decrease in the  relative difference between the rate of inflation and the  interest rates on deposits. During the months of November and  December of last year, the rate of inflation reached 12.1  percent. Likewise, there was a continued decrease in the lending  and discount rate, which had fallen to 20.5 percent in January  of 1992, then 18.5 percent in January of 1993, and then 16.25  percent by January of 1994 and the first week of February of  this year. However, actual loans made by banks indicated a  transaction rate of 13 percent.    Private sector loans in local currency from banks decreased  during the second half of 1993, in spite of the liquidity that  accumulated in the banks. Therefore expectations are that there  probably will be a decrease in the loan interest rate, since  this is one of the means by which one can emerge from the  current situation of stagnation.    Interest rates on U.S. dollar desposits have nearly  stablilized. In January of 1993 they were around 3.25 percent,  then they went down to 3.04 percent by April of last year, and  have stayed at this point since then until the first week of  February of this year  <H5>  Steady Increase </H5>   All of the indicators dealing with the Suez Canal show an  increase in 1993 compared with the previous year. The number of  ships going through the canal increased by 798, or 4 percent,  making the total 17,329. The number of oil tankers going through  the canal increased by 51, or 1.6 percent, making the total  3,204. Consequently, tonnage carried by ships going through the  canal increased by about 27 million tons, or 7 percent, making  the total 397 million tons. This resulted in an increase in  revenues of about $85 million, or 4.5 percent, making the total  $l.96l billion.    In the sea and air transport sector, there was an increase  in  the volume of nonpetroleum goods transported by sea and by air.  The increase was 14 percent over last year, and totaled 25.987  million tons.    In the sector of land transport, the total number of  vehicles  by October of 1993 was 2.236 million, of which 935,000 were  private vehicles and 384,000 were trucks.  <H5>  Increase in Firms and Decrease in Bankruptcy </H5>   The number of stock corporations obtaining operating  licenses, increased by 29, or 10 percent, over last year, and  they totaled 847. The Corporations Administration gave its  approval to 594 of these companies, and the remaining 253 were  approved by the Investment Authority.    The capital of these corporations was 53 percent, or 2.803  billion pounds, less than the capital of companies which  obtained licenses in 1992, thus making the 1993 total 2.133  billion Egyptian pounds, as opposed to 4.754 billion Egyptian  pounds. [figures as published]    Business bankruptcies went down to 4,798 during the first  nine months of 1993, after they had totaled 5,918 during the  same period in the previous year. The number of bankruptcies was  lowest during March of 1993, whereas the highest rate was in May  of 1993.  <H5>  Tourism Down </H5>   Indicators showed a decrease in tourism in 1993, as compared  with the previous year, of 29 percent in terms of the number of  overnight stays in Egypt and 20 percent in terms of the number  of tourists coming to Egypt. The number of tourists who came  totaled 2.,503 million, representing a decrease of 643,000. The  total number of overnight stays was 15.890 million, representing  a decrease of 6.929 million. At the same time, there was only a  very slight decrease in the average length of stay of the  tourists, since this figure was 5.8 overnight stays as opposed  to about 6.7 overnight stays. These indicators were also  reflected in the total in income earned from tourism until  November of 1993, which was $1.294 billion, representing a  decrease of $953 million, or 42 percent, over the same time  period in the previous year.  <H5>  Progress in Energy </H5>   The forms of energy produced were as follows: The total  production of generated electricity in 1993 was 47.937 million  megawatt-hours. This represents an increase of 1509 million  megawatt-hours, or 3.2 percent, over production in 1992. In  spite of this increase, the total in electric services provided  was about 1.788 million megawatt-hours, or 4.6 percent, less in  1993 than it was in 1992.    Petroleum production for 1993 increased so that it totaled  46.364 trillion tons. This represents an increase of 1.109  million tons, or 2.4 percent, over the previous year. Petroleum  consumption in 1993 also increased, totaling 21.707 million  tons, representing an increase of 268,000 tons, or 1.2 percent,  over the previous year. The percentage of domestic consumption  of petroleum, as compared with the total production in 1993, was  46.8 percent, and this represents a 56-percent decrease over the  previous year.    Natural gas production in 1993 totaled 8.884 million tons,  representing an increase of 1.706 million tons, or 23.7 percent,  over the previous year. The same increase occurred in natural  gas services, the total being 8.229 million tons in 1993,  representing an increase of 1.102 million tons, or 15.4 percent,  over the previous year. This was reflected in the increase in  the percentage of total gas consumed as compared with total gas  produced, which was 99.2 percent in 1993, as opposed to 92.6  percent in the previous year.    Sales of cement in the construction and building materials  sector decreased by 946,000 tons, or 5.7 percent, over 1992. The  total for 1993 was 15.553 million tons. The months of January,  February, and March showed the lowest rates of sales, whereas  the months of July, August, and September showed the highest  rates.    Unlike sales of cement, sales of reinforcement iron in 1993  increased over the previous year. This increase was by about  82,000 tons, or 7.2 percent, and the total for the year was  1.210 million tons. The month of September showed the lowest  rate of sales, whereas the months of December and May showed the  highest.</p>

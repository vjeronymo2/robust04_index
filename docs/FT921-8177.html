			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The UN and Yugoslavia such as a breakdown of the ceasefire in Croatia - the United Nations is about to embark on its largest peace-keeping mission in 30 years, by deploying more than 14,000 troops in Yugoslavia. The risks are considerable. The UN is venturing into uncertain territory: its goals are seen differently by Croatia and Serbia, the two main protagonists, in a conflict that has already left at least 5,000 people dead, and more than half a million homeless. But its task is vital nonetheless: preserving the peace in order to give political negotiations on Yugoslavia's future a chance. Supported by the European Community, the UN was invited by Croatia, Serbia and the federal army to implement the latest ceasefire. It has already set out a detailed programme on where, how and for what duration its troops should be deployed throughout Croatia. It has also clearly spelt out its objectives: it will seek to persuade the army to withdraw from Croatia, and all sides to disarm. More importantly, as stressed in its mandate, the UN will 'not prejudge the outcome of political negotiations for a comprehensive settlement of the Yugoslav crisis'. Finding that remains the task of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia. The UN is treading a fine line between the hopes and fears of the two republics. Croatia has reservations about its plan. President Franjo Tudjman fears that the presence of the UN troops will cement the gains made by Serbia and the army which control nearly a third of Croatian territory. He wants the UN to facilitate the federal army's rapid withdrawal from the republic, help restore Croatian jurisdiction throughout its territory, and then go home within a year. Balkan conflagration Serbia, in contrast, believes that the longer the UN stays, the more likely it is that parts of Croatia will be eventually annexed by Serbia. The sceptics, for their part, argue that the UN is about to become embroiled in a Balkan conflagration from which no easy or honourable retreat will be possible. No one can doubt the difficulties facing the UN troops. In addition to trying to promote trust among Serbs and Croats, they will, in the process of disarming all sides, confront people with a long tradition of bearing arms and using them. Peace conference But if the UN is to inspire confidence, it is imperative that its peace-keeping role be coupled with the reconvening of the EC peace conference, which has been suspended pending clarification of the UN's role. Without parallel political negotiations led by the Community, the UN's mission could easily come unstuck. There are several things the Community should do to assist the peace process. It must insist on rigorous implementation of the arms embargo which was imposed last year but has not been strictly enough enforced. Since its recognition by the international community last month, Croatia is rearming so as to redress the military balance, and regain its territory. Serbia and the federal army are also obtaining weapons. Rearmament by both sides could strain the ceasefire and ultimately force the UN out. The EC also needs to address the future status of other republics which are still seeking recognition, principally Macedonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. The latter republic with an ethnic mix of Moslems, Serbs and Croats is now a virtual hostage of the Serb-dominated federal army. It is also in danger of becoming the next crucible of conflict, as Serbia and Croatia turn their attention to carving it up between them. Recognition of Bosnia's territorial integrity by the Community is thus critical. It would strengthen Bosnia's hand in arguing for the withdrawal of the army into Serbia, which is now its natural home. The impending UN peace-keeping effort is a step towards consolidating the stand-off between Serbia and Croatia. But it should not be seen as an end in itself: if it is not accompanied by a fresh Community effort to find a lasting political solution, its efforts will be in vain.</p>

The prime minister criticized work on the district reform,  stressing that the communes had not been consulted at all on  whether districts were to be established. He said his cabinet  was not aiming at the centralization of power and also stressed  that the point was not to "centrally" shift responsibility on  local governments.    Pawlak denied press statements according to which his  cabinet  sent an expert analysis of the concordat signed by the previous  government to the Secretariat of Poland's Episcopate. He  stressed the government was not conducting any work on the  document.    Asked about possible changes at the posts of deputy  ministers  in the so-called presidential ministries, namely, the Ministries  of Internal Affairs, National Defence and Foreign Affairs, the  prime minister said the issue aroused too strong emotions.    The prime minister also announced actions designed to limit  the so-called grey zone.</p>

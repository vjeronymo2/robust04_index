			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Status quo could undermine sterling - Currencies The murky events of last Friday in UK money markets have brought sterling to centre stage on the foreign exchanges as markets wait to see whether UK interest rates are raised. The pound rose sharply last Friday on expectations of a monetary tightening and is vulnerable to a setback, amid thin August trade, if the Bank of England leaves rates unchanged. The mood in the markets at the end of last week was that the Bank's management of monetary policy would come under strenuous criticism this week if policy was left on hold following confusing interest rate signals. When the credibility of the Bank's management of monetary policy was last an issue - after the much criticised cut in base rates last February - the pound was sold heavily as a result. Informing the discussion on UK interest rates will be the Bank of England's inflation report which is released tomorrow. Other UK figures coming out this week include M0 today and industrial production on Friday. Elsewhere, attention will focus on the dollar. The two events likely to determine the fortunes of the US currency are the aftermath of last night's deadline in the US - Japan trade procurement talks, and Friday's payroll data. Nothing changes immediately if, as expected, the trade talks fail to make the necessary progress. A 60-day period then commences during which time the US can decide whether or not to implement sanctions. With erstwhile dollar bears, such as Mr Fred Bergsten, the influential Washington economist, now beginning to change their tune, the impact is likely to be more subdued than when the Washington trade talks collapsed in February. Mr Bergsten has suggested that no sanctions will be applied against Japan until September and the yen will lose some of its strength. In terms of domestic monetary policy, three events this week will shed light on the state of the economy: the purchasing managers index, released today, the release on Wednesday of the Tan book for the August FOMC, and Friday's payroll release. In Europe the Bundesbank's summer recess will ensure that market focus remains on Italy. The currency recovered last week after slipping below L1,110 against the D-Mark. The key event will be the credibility of prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's appearance before the Lower House this week.</p>

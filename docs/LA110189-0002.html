			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST;  </P> <P> BOAT BLOWS UP NEAR ISRAELI WARSHIP  </P> <P> A Palestinian was blown up in his boat off Lebanon and three sailors aboard an  Israeli gunboat were slightly injured in what Jerusalem described as a suicide  attack. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Beirut claimed  responsibility for the attack. It said the boat was on its way to carry out "a  special mission" and claimed that the Israeli gunboat was sunk. Israeli  military sources, however, said the gunboat, patrolling off Lebanon, asked the  fishing boat to identify itself. Instead, the boat sailed toward the Israeli  warship, then blew up, the Israelis said.  </P></p>

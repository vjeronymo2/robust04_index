			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hjs" report: "Bonn Plans Help for `Eco-Jumbo'"] </F>   [Text] The government wants to assist the development of a  new generation of wide-body aircraft that could replace the  Airbus and Boeing 747 one day. The aircraft, which are meant to  emit exceptionally little exhaust fumes, consume less fuel, and  be very quiet in operation, are privately referred to as  "Eco-Jumbos."    This assistance is to form part of an aviation research and  technology program that is in the planning stage. However, the  financial aspects of this program are a subject of dispute. At  a meeting with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the Chancellery, the  chiefs of the state and senate chancelleries failed to reach  agreement with each other on this subject. The laender are  demanding at least 1 billion marks [DM] worth of support for the  suffering aviation industry for 1994-98. The Ministry of  Research supports this demand, but stipulates a new time period  for the program, 1995-99. The ministry wishes to administer the  program.    Reinhard Goehner, the government's air and space  coordinator,  told HANDELSBLATT that the size of financial assistance would be  decided later, during financial consultations. But among  government circles there is talk of a maximum of DM750 million,  or DM150 per year. In addition, strong participation by the  laender is called for.</p>

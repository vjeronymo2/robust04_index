			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WELLS FARGO WILL BUY 130 NEW BRANCHES;  </P> <P> FINANCE: GREAT AMERICAN, WHICH LOST $263.4 MILLION IN 1989, AGREES TO SELL ITS  CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS FOR $492 MILLION.  </P> <P> Struggling Great American Bank announced today that it has agreed to sell its  California branch network to Wells Fargo &amp; Co. for $492 million, pending  approval by shareholders and federal regulators.  </P> <P> The proposed transaction includes Great American's 130 California branches with  assets of $5.9 billion, Great American said in a statement.  </P> <P> The San Diego-based thrift, the country's eighth-largest savings and loan, has  been struggling against a rising tide of losses since the fourth quarter of  1988, largely because of a widening loan problem acquired with an Arizona  thrift that Great American bought in 1986.  </P> <P> Losses during 1989 hit a staggering $263.4 million and left Great American  unable to meet minimum federal capital standards. The thrift must raise $350  million by the end of the year to avoid a government takeover.  </P> <P> The deal with Wells Fargo would pare down Great American's $15.4 billion in  assets to between $8 billion and $9 billion. Great American would retain 81  branch offices in Washington, Arizona and Colorado.  </P> <P> The sale of the branches would be completed in two stages. The 92 offices in  San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties would be sold by late this year, and  the rest of the California branches would be sold in 1992.  </P> <P> It was unclear this morning how many of Great American's estimated 1,800  employees in California would be retained by Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> With the sale, Wells Fargo is expected to solidify its market position in San  Diego County, where it has been battling with Security Pacific Bank, the  state's second-largest bank.  </P> <P> Before the Great American deal, Wells Fargo had 486 branch offices in  California and ranked as the third-largest bank in the state with $50.2 billion  in assets.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo currently has 24 branches in San Diego County and would have 88  after the deal is completed. Security Pacific has about 65 branches in the  county.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo and Security Pacific have been buying up smaller California  institutions in the last several years.  </P> <P> Security Pacific, with assets of $94.5 billion, remains as the state's  second-largest bank behind Bank of America. Security Pacific is expected to  become the largest bank in San Diego County, with 65 branches, once it gets  final approval from regulators for its $112-million purchase of La Jolla  Bancorp.  </P></p>

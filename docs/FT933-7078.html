			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: WPP The banks which agreed to last year's debt-for-equity swap at WPP may be pleasantly surprised by the recent run of the shares. Yesterday's closing price represents a handsome premium over the level at which their preference shares can be converted next week. Little wonder that most fully intend to exercise that option and take profits, rather than hang on in the hope of more. The conversion will act as a drag on the shares, since buyers will have to be found for around 11 per cent of WPP's share capital. The situation is likely to recur next year when the banks are free to convert their remaining prefs. Longer term prospects turn, though, on WPP's ability to generate more revenue while keeping a lid on costs. Revenue growth of 5 per cent in the first half - once exchange rate movements are stripped out - and a slight improvement in margins is thus encouraging. But with recession taking hold in Europe and only a sluggish recovery in the US, that rate of progress can not be taken for granted. Discounting in markets from cigarettes to detergent also poses a threat to the branded goods companies on which WPP depends. One response by its clients would be to defend market share and the remaining price differential of branded goods over generic products by increasing marketing spend. The worrying alternative would be to defend margins by taking an axe to advertising.</p>

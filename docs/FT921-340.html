			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: Moonstruck It has been obvious for some time that the Earth Summit in Rio this June risked sliding into chaos. That risk has now increased with the belated discovery - over two years after preparations began - that the proposed dates coincide with an important Islamic lunar festival. As a result, 20 Islamic countries have asked the UN organisers to postpone the event by four days so their government leaders can carry out their ritual observance of the new moon. This is no mean request since more than 160 heads of state or government have been invited, all of whom will have to rejig their diaries if the UN agrees to shift the date. As a compromise, the UN is willing to consider a delay of two days. But the EC countries - which have made no secret of their annoyance at this oversight - are balking. The one person who is unaffected is President George Bush who has yet to say whether he will be coming to Rio at all.</p>

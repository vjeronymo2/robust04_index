			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tough new players in video games  -Michiyo Nakamoto watches Matsushita and Sony enter the field THE Christmas season has traditionally been a time of plenty for Japan's video games makers. But this year, the run up to the holiday is likely to bring the industry less cheer than usual. When Nintendo, the most successful video games maker, announced its business results for the first half of the fiscal year yesterday, the figures showed the first signs of slowdown from a company which has seen sales rise almost continuously over 10 years. They confirmed a growing suspicion that Japan's video games makers face a turning point in their fortunes that is being brought about by a major change the industry faces. While the squeeze on profits the industry is beginning to experience stems directly from the economic downturn and the Japanese currency's strong appreciation this year, it is also a sign of the tougher times Nintendo and its chief competitor, Sega, are likely to encounter ahead. In October, Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, made its debut in the video games market amid much fanfare with the launch of a multimedia video games machine developed by 3DO, the US start-up company in which Matsushita has invested. A few weeks later, Sony too announced that it would be launching a home use video game system next year that would offer ultra high speed, three-dimensional graphics. For Nintendo and Sega, the intrusion of the two large consumer electronics companies into the games market spells the end of a lucrative world where demand seemed to rise endlessly and which had been virtually closed to outside competition. In the US, Dollars 6.4bn worth of games software was sold in 1992, or more than the year's entire film box office revenues in the US, according to a report by Barings Securities. Japanese trade ministry statistics show that the video games market last year grew 13 per cent in Japan to Y411bn (USDollars 3.8bn), while the audio-visual market shrank 12 per cent to Y371bn. With almost 90 per cent of the market, Nintendo has enjoyed monopoly profits, with operating margins ranging between 25 to 30 per cent, compared with average operating margins of 5 to 6 per cent in the consumer electronics industry, says Mr Barry Dargan at SG Warburg Securities. Given the spectacular growth and profits available in the video games market, it was likely to be a matter of time before the consumer electronics giants made a serious bid to divert some of those gains their way. It is still too early to tell how successful Matsushita and Sony might be in doing so. However, the two electronics companies have a number of factors in their favour which could make them formidable competitors. The shift to next-generation games systems that is being brought about by technology advancements means that the timing is right for newcomers to try to stake a position in the market. With their strong brand names, Sony and Matsushita can be expected to find easy acceptance among consumers. The advances in technology are also moving games programmes closer to Hollywood type entertainment, using full motion video footage and high quality sound and to the world of interactive multimedia. This is where Matsushita and Sony, with a wealth of entertainment material in their film and record libraries, have an advantage over existing video games makers. Matsushita's hugely successful film Jurassic Park is being made into an interactive game while Sony will launch such a game based on its movie Last Action Hero. The consensus is that the biggest loser from the entry of Matsushita and Sony into the video games market will be Nintendo. Against the moves of the consumer electronics giants, Sega has formed a number of alliances to ensure that it is well prepared for the changes that the video games industry faces. It has joined hands with TCI, the cable operator and Time Warner, the entertainment group, to provide video games on cable TV and with AT&amp;T to provide video games down the telephone line. Nintendo, however, being the most dominant player, not only has the most to lose, the company has appeared surprisingly unmoved by the impending threat to its dominance. 'We will go our own way,' says a Nintendo official who defends the decision to stand behind its current generation machine for the time being by pointing out that 'providing greater computing power does not necessarily lead to more entertaining games'. Nintendo is betting on a tie-up with Silicon Graphics, a leading US maker of visual computing systems, to develop a more advanced machine than either Sony's or Matsushita's for launch in 1995. It also hopes its proven expertise in bringing hit programmes to the market will help it stave off the competition. However, it is precisely in the area of software that Nintendo faces the strongest competition from Matsushita and Sony, both of which own Hollywood film and music studios. As software moves relentlessly in the direction of full motion video using footage from entertainment films, 'Nintendo may find itself left out in the cold,' Mr Dargan says. It will either have to pay huge royalty fees for entertainment software based on films or be relegated to the lower end of the market, he believes. Whatever the eventual outcome, as a host of makers line the shop shelves with competing systems, the video games market next Christmas season will be ringing to a more discordant tune.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NINTENDO Interim results 1993-94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Ybn       Change %      1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales                          260.18           -6.2       277.41 Operating profit                64.14          -11.0        72.05 Pre-tax profit                  61.07          -24.0        80.25 Full-year forecasts: Sales     500.00          -11.0       562.70 Pre-tax profit                 121.00          -26.0       163.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company report  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

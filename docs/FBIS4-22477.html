			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Anatoliy Lisitsyn </F> by KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Dmitriy Sevryukov; place  and date not given: "The Province Is Moving... Where?"]    [Text] Residents of Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, or Uglich say with  a certain pride that they no longer live in an oblast but in a  province, although official confirmation of the title of the  region is being delayed, as usual. This upsets Yaroslavl  residents because the seemingly innocent word "oblast" reminds  them of the oblast party committee and its permanent First  [secretary], nicknamed by the populace "tsar Fedor." The current  Yaroslavl leader, however--Governor Lisitsyn--is respectfully  called Anatoliy Ivanovich even in the most remote kolkhoz.  During the December elections to the Federation Council, voters  in the province not only cast the absolute majority of votes for  the governor but also, unlike other Russian regions, did not  fall for the temptation to play into the hands of Zhirinovskiy's  party.    [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, are you not afraid that  authoritative figures on a local level, given the weakening of  the center, will wittingly or unwittingly contribute to Russia's  repeating the fate of the Union: disintegration into individual  principalities, rural districts, provinces...    [Lisitsyn] I am against the "parade of sovereignties"  started  by my colleagues from Sverdlovsk Oblast. And when he proposed  himself for the post of speaker of the Federation Council, I  spoke sharply against it. In the current explosive political  situation it is enough to set a precedent, and a chain reaction  will start... To allow fragmentation of the Russian state--in no  matter what form--means to nullify history.    [Sevryukov] The economic crisis in each region has its own  local flavor. Everybody in Yaroslavl remembers the February  rebellion of "red directors," who were threatening an  interregional strike...    [Lisitsyn] It did not reach this point. And the "rebellion"  had been provoked to a large extent not by industrialists but  trade unions, who constantly destabilize the situation. We were  able to reach an agreement, though, and identified the  principles and positions on which we must immediately support  enterprises: reduce road tax and property tax.    We also defined a long-term economic development policy. On  this we worked together with Ye. Gaydar's institute. We prepared  37 promising programs, some of which may qualify both for  federal investment and investment on the part of international  mortgage banks. We plan to present this unique Yaroslavl-Gaydar  program to a broad circle of businessmen and economists in  Moscow from 24 to 28 May, during the Yaroslavl Oblast week in  the capital.    I recently visited Nemtsov in Nizhniy Novgorod. We compared  our provinces' indicators of agricultural production and  discovered that Yaroslavl Oblast has experienced a smaller  decline in the livestock herd and has a higher milk yield and  higher average wages. As to agriculture specifically, the entire  secret is that since 1992 we have been directing half of our  budget money into that sphere.    [Sevryukov] Anatoliy Ivanovich, in a recent interview to  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Sergey Shakhray remarked that what is  happening in society today is a battle between three elites:  Moscow, regional, and sectoral. Do you agree with such a formula?    [Lisitsyn] This fight is not only perceptible--it is coming  to the forefront of domestic political life. If you take federal  organs of administration and local organs, the problem is that  the experience accumulated in the regions is being ignored by  our government. The government is attempting to implement on his  own a mechanism of economic reform without analyzing regional  experience. All attempts from the grass roots level to have our  experience finally put to use have been fruitless. I am  particularly bitter about this, since I am a member of the board  of the Governors Union, whose task is to propagate the regions'  experience.    [Sevryukov] Yaroslavl Oblast was among the first to hold  elections to the oblast duma and local organs of representative  power. There have been accusations, however, that the elections  were undemocratic, since heads of administrations participated  in them, which violates the principle of separation of power...    [Lisitsyn] First, I have to tell you that these elections  were held in an extremely difficult political situation.  Strictly speaking, there were attempts to derail them. And the  key opposition figure, sad to say, was the president's  representative in Yaroslavl Oblast. When the election campaign  was already in full swing, and after we had already spent about  2 billion rubles on it, he suddenly proposed to move the  elections to the fall. And later urged the population not to  turn out for elections altogether, not to vote.    Nevertheless, the oblast duma has been elected and is now  functioning. It is a group of competent people, professionals.  And the fact that almost half the duma deputies are members of  the executive branch does not indicate in any way that the  elections were undemocratic.    [Sevryukov] You have been governor for two and a half years  now. Has the pilgrimage to power given you the sense of  satisfaction over what has been accomplished?    [Lisitsyn] Complete satisfaction--no. Especially now with  the  departure--again--of Gaydar, whose economic concept was the  foundation of our region's development.    A point of legitimate pride for the governor's team is  probably the stability of the socioeconomic situation and secure  civil peace. I think that to a large extent credit for this goes  to the Civic Consensus Union, created under the governor two  years ago; it includes representatives of all--without  exception--parties and movements. Each month they all gather  together--essentially, political opponents: Russia's Choice, the  communists, the national-patriots... With all our disagreements,  we have learned to come to agreement, because it is in the  interests of the people.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Growth forecast for north Scotland The north of Scotland is poised to pull out strongly from a belated recession, with economic growth expected to average 2.6 per cent a year over the next five years, a survey published yesterday says. The Fraser of Allander Institute, in a quarterly business survey for Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development agency, says the growth should produce thousands of new jobs when a recent rise in business confidence is matched by private-sector investment in company start-ups and expansions. Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE Network, which groups the area's 10 local enterprise companies, said the network had triggered a number of projects. More than 1,000 business projects had been assisted and more than 2,900 jobs created or retained.</p>

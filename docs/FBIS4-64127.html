			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The State Duma (lower house of  the Russian parliament) mounted the first attack on the six  recent economic decrees by President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday.    Calling them "unconstitutional", Deputy Valentin Martemyanov  (Russian Communist Party) proposed that the president's  documents should be debated at the chamber's plenary meeting.    However, his proposal failed, collecting only 167 votes in  support.    Therefore, the item worded by the legislator as  "unconstitutional decrees by the president and measures to stop  them" was not put on the agenda of the meeting. However,  analysts believe that the attack on Yeltsin's economic decrees  is not the last one.</p>

On this date last  year, our people established in this land the government of the  people and by the people, to which they have ardently been  aspiring.    As president, I eradicated irregularities and corruption  that  had been prevailing in this land.    I worked with all my heart for the recovery of the economy,  which had fallen into a swamp of stagnation. I made every  effort to establish the national discipline so that no one who  used unjust means could have both power and honor. As  president, I dedicated all my spirit and strength to push ahead  with change and reform in this country.    Today our society is changing. The people's awareness of  wealth and honor is also changing. Their awareness of a  worthwhile human existence is expanding, and they are freeing  themselves from the way of life of pursuing only material  abundance.    The Chongwadae presidential offices have become closer to  the  people. The economy is recovering. The nation's position is  being enhanced.    Clean and healthy energy is springing from the lowest  stratum of society. We now have hope and confidence for the  future. However, our reality is still far from the goal we have  to achieve. You all know that the deep-rooted evils accumulated  for over 30 years cannot be cleaned up in one day. Corruption  accumulated for over 30 years is being exposed in various  incidents and accidents.    We have a long way to go and many things to change. The past  constitution and practice are holding us up. However, I will  continue with change and reform bearing the historic burden  entrusted to me. National competitiveness, which we set as the  goal of this year's national administration, can only be  achieved externally through opening and competition and  internally through change and reform.    Dear fellow countrymen, I have already talked about the new  year national administration policy in the New Year's news  conference and I will only talk about a few points today.    First, it is deplorable that national understanding and  consensus of internationalization is still not sufficiently  achieved. A hundred years ago, we could not become  internationalized by self-determination but were forced to open  the country by external control. Therefore, we fell behind and  were turned into a colony. In order for us not to repeat the  mistake we made a hundred years ago in the first opening  process, we have to spontaneously carry out the second opening  through internationalization.    We have to learn from history. We should not deplore the  door opening but should open the door ourselves and advance to  the wide-open world. We have no reason to feel defeatism or  persecution about the outside. I sincerely felt it last year  through the Asia Pacific Economic Council summit meeting and my  visit to the United States.    We have the vitality of a cultural nation that has lived on  for 5,000 years. We have the potential to create miracles on  the ruins of colonization and war. We are becoming more  dominant in the world through the establishment of a civilian  government and reform. Let us all be confident. There is  nothing for us to envy. No one can block our nation's advance.    Second, we have to renew the officialdom. Some of our public  officials who should lead the change and reform of our community  are refraining from actions being preoccupied by an easy-going  attitude and opportunism.    Change and reform of officialdom society has become a task  that cannot be delayed any more. Overweight organizations and  functions should be boldly reduced. Useless administrative  regulations should be resolutely abolished.    We should turn administration from reigning over the people  into providing service.    The administration field should also introduce the  management  concept of business, namely management with high efficiency at  the least expense.    Third, the government will more powerfully push ahead to  strengthen international competitiveness through economic  revitalization. This does not mean ignorance of economic  justice or balanced development. Prompted by the settlement of  the Uruguay Round negotiations, the government has directed  profound attention and energy to farmers and fishermen.    We will provide intense financial and systematic support in  order to build rich farms and fishing villages. A new, creative  farming movement to cope with the challenge of opening up  started in the rural communities across the country. I consider  this a very encouraging phenomenon.    I would like to make another appeal for management-labor  harmony in order to realize an economic upsurge. Management  should make all sincere efforts to make labor--a field of  technological development and quality promotion--a working site  full of vigor and excitement. Enterprises that cannot satisfy  their employees, can neither produce goods that satisfy its  customers, nor be successful. Workers should set the target of  their labor movement on upgrading productivity and the standard  of technology. The issue of wage increases cannot be the only  goal of the labor movement. The labor movement should be  consistent with national competitiveness.    The government will exert utmost efforts to stabilize price,  to improve income distribution, and to expand social security.  Only when the workers, the management and the government form a  sound trinity, can our international competitiveness be upgraded  drastically.    Fourth, today's civilian government is not yesterday's  authoritarian government. It is a government with morality and  legitimacy. The channels and methods for the people to present  their political opinion have been sufficiently guaranteed. The  time when illegal struggle was regarded as just has passed. I  want to make clear that under a civilian government chosen by  the people, lawlessness and violence will not be accepted under  any pretext. It is the essential responsibility of the  government to protect the people from violence and lawlessness.    Fifth, I will humbly accept constructive criticism and  advice  pertaining to the president and the government. Our government  and I hope that the opposition party becomes a genuine partner  in reform, by getting rid of the ruling-opposition party  relations of discord and confrontation as seen in the past. We  are looking forward to creative relations between the ruling and  opposition parties which sincerely strive for and discuss the  interests, justice, and the future of all of our communities.  Those who cry for justice should be considered just persons by  others. When talking about reforms, the person who has set  examples in reform is persuasive.    What we want is the true reform partner and advice on  reform from the true heart. What we urgently need is reform in  the field of politics. As long as politics remain in the marsh  of underdevelopment and nonefficiency, thereby hindering the  development of other fields, we cannot maximize the strength of  the country. We cannot advance forward. We cannot win the  fierce international competition. I hope that clean and  productive politics in its true sense will be restored in this  land as soon as possible. I hope, with the people, that  systematic reform for it will be made as soon as possible.    My dear fellow countrymen: Assuming office as president, I  promised the people that I would devote all my powers to  national reconciliation and reunification, fulfilling the  mission entrusted to me by history and the nation. I have never  for a moment forgotten this promise. In particular, I have been  doing my best with patience for the peaceful resolution of the  North Korean nuclear issue. In this connection, I think it a  very fortunate development that North Korea agreed to permit  nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.    The North Korean nuclear issue is not only a problem  connected with the survival of the 70-million-strong nation but  a stumbling block that could stand in the way of reunification  for good. Therefore, the government has undergone again and  again the conflicting anguish that we should maintain a resolute  attitude but should avoid a situation of extremity [kukhan  sanghwang].    I clearly declare here that if North Korea renounces nuclear  development and selects the road of genuine dialogue between the  North and the South I am ready to accelerate North-South joint  economic development for North-South coexistence and  coprosperity in the manufacturing, agricultural, construction,  and energy fields.    My dear fellow countrymen: I thank you the people for your  support and encouragement so that I may carry out my duty as  president with flawlessly clean morality in view of history, the  people, and my own conscience. In the future as well, I will  devote myself to the country and the nation without selfishness,  devoting all my wisdom and passion for it.    What has sustained me over my 30 years of struggle for  democratization has been my trust in you, our great people. The  people, together with me, were able to establish a government of  civilian democracy in this land, so I, with the people, will  solidify the foundation of a new Korea. This is my hope and my  dream. A new Korea is my dream and a dream for all of us. The  dream of the 70 million people will certainly be realized by the  strength of the 70 million people.    A great history can only be made by the sweat, tears, and  passion of the great people. I will work with perspiration to  pioneer the glorious future of the fatherland, sharing joy and  sorrow with the people, toward the new Korea and toward the  world.    The energy of spring is rising up from deep in the earth in  this land. On this day last year, we started anew with new  resolutions. Today, we must open a new spring of pioneering  national destiny. Spring is for the person who sets off in  search of it. Let us all pioneer a new spring of national  history.    Thank you.</p>

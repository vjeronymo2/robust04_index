			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 29 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has rejected a proposal to keep nuclear  material from a reactor in North Korea "in a safe place, under  seal" an IAEA source confirmed Sunday [29 May].    Dimitri Perricos, head of the IAEA's team of experts in  North  Korea, who left Pyongyang Saturday, said in Beijing, "the North  Koreans proposed a procedure which was not workable on a  technical front."    IAEA experts here said storing the nuclear rods would not  have allowed the agency to verify whether any had been diverted  for the possible manufacture nuclear weapons.    "The only effective method of control is to immediately stop  the downloading of the reactor and take samples from the nuclear  rods," one expert said.    "The North Koreans have said it would cost too much to stop  the downloading of the reactor."    Two IAEA inspectors at Yongbyon continue to observe the  operations at the reactor.    The United States and IAEA officials have said repeatedly  that they do not think North Korea has been using the  downloading of the reactor to divert nuclear material to a  possible weapons programme.    But they think the previous occasions, dating back to 1989,  have been used to build up a stockpile of weapons-grade material.    "The only means of verifying that is to take samples which  can tell us with certainty the progress of the nuclear material  since the reactor was brought into service in 1986," an IAEA  expert said.</p>

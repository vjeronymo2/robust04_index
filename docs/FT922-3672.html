			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM dons a different suit of clothes - Attempts to break into the low end of the market INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) is donning unfamiliar clothes as it moves to attack markets that have hitherto been beneath its lofty gaze. Last week, the world's largest computer manufacturer unveiled a new, wholly-owned subsidiary to battle head-to-head in Europe with low-cost 'clone' personal computer-makers. But camouflage dress seemed to be the order of the day for the new company. Mr Bill McCracken, general manager of IBM Europe's Personal Systems Business Unit, stood in regulation navy blue suit beside Mr Alan Willsher, the head of the new European subsidiary, Individual Computer Products International (ICPI). 'Notice the difference between IBM and ICPI,' he said, drawing attention to Mr Willsher's plaid jacket, blue shirt and yellow tie. He was underlining the independence of IBM's new venture from its big and bureaucratic US parent. ICPI was launched in the UK recently with the aim of taking IBM firmly into the low end of the PC marketplace. It is an area where the industry's largest manufacturer is both weak and under sharp attack from 'clone' makers which assemble PCs from standard components that are functionally similar to IBM's machines but significantly cheaper. These manufacturers benefit from lower overheads and less need to carry out expensive research and development. Over 3,000 clone manufacturers operate in Taiwan alone. There are, however, questions over the quality of these products compared with established industry brands such as IBM, Compaq and Olivetti. The establishment of ICPI is belated recognition by IBM that brand awareness is rapidly giving way to price as a differentiator at the lower end of the PC business and that it has to change radically to protect its markets. 'It is time for the computer industry to recognise that computer buyers, like other human beings, do not make buying decisions for purely rational reasons. How can they when all low-cost PCs are virtually the same?' says Mr Willsher. IBM's share of the overall PC market has plunged from about 40 per cent a decade ago to about 12 per cent; in the UK alone, its share has fallen from 26 per cent in 1989 to 15 per cent today But growth is fastest at the low end, where machines are priced in the UK at less than Pounds 1,000 (Dollars 1,830), and expanding at a rate of 45 per cent a year in Europe, against 21 per cent for the whole PC market, according to Mr Willsher. There has also been a marked change in the way PCs are distributed. A growing proportion of PCs are sold through direct distribution, that is, telesales and mail order, rather than through dealers. IBM has been slow to exploit these unfamiliar product channels. IBM's new venture is small, with just 45 employees initially. The aim is to be flexible and responsive to the marketplace. It will source its products on the open market, selling through a combination of dealer and retailer and direct distribution. The new venture has been established in the UK, but it is seen as the beginning of a world-wide development. A similar venture has been launched in Canada, and a French operation opens next week. IBM is not alone among quality manufacturers in trying to break into the low end of the market. Compaq, a leader in high-performance systems, will launch its own low-priced range on June 15, backed by a Dollars 10m advertising campaign. It will sell these systems under its own name, however, while IBM's decision to set up a subsidiary with no overt connection with the parent is explained by the dilemma it faces in this area of the market. It has to compete on price, but if it sells 'clones' which prove less reliable than its traditional product range under its own name, its credibility across its entire range will be compromised. Without the IBM connection, however, it is difficult to see what the new range, called Ambra, has to differentiate it from any other range of clones. Furthermore, it already has a low-priced machine, the PS/1, intended for home use, with which the Ambra range could be in competition. IBM is putting its faith in advertising to create brand awareness for Ambra. The group has started a multi-million pound advertising campaign with the help of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, creators of the Levi jeans commercials, which will promote the products as 'a desirable brand that appeals to the individual.' The campaign involves television commercials and full-page advertisements in national newspapers, and its theme concerns athletes striving, a far cry from the Charlie Chaplin commercials which launched IBM's first PC. Competitors are delighted with the campaign, which they believe will help create awareness for the whole market segment. But they see little threat in the new range. Amstrad points out that one of the UK leading high street retailers - Dixons - has decided not to stock Ambra, apparently because of a possible conflict with IBM's existing range. Elonex, another leading UK PC maker, points out that Ambra products are not aggressively priced. An Elonex machine of similar configuration to an Ambra computer could work out Pounds 75, or almost 10 per cent, cheaper. The services and support ICPI is promoting as a sign of its reliability are already being offered by companies such as Dell. So the key must be IBM's marketing muscle. But is Bartle Bogle Hegarty's appeal to aesthetic and lifestyle preferences the answer: 'they're only PCs, for heaven's sake,' said one commentator scornfully.</p>

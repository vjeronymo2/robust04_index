			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price up on Iraq/UN deadlock NORTH SEA oil prices rose 30 cents after news of deadlock in the United Nations/Iraq oil talks in New York over the weekend saw some traders taking positions in the market early yesterday. But as the talks resumed in the afternoon uncertainty over the outcome reasserted itself and trading dried up. North Sea Brent crude for August delivery rose to Dollars 16.90 a barrel - still close to an 18-month low, but with traders more optimistic about the price outlook. Although the UN's difficulties with Iraq over weapons inspections are separate from the oil talks, the conflict over the weekend led many traders to increase the odds against Iraqi exports. Baghdad must agree to allow UN officials to monitor the distribution of food and medical aid purchased with the proceeds of the Dollars 1.6bn oil sales under discussion. The details of the monitoring procedure have not been discussed and the talks are believed to have made little progress. The oil market will still be subject to increased volatility while the talks are under way. But analysts are increasingly seeing the market's reaction to the talks as exaggerated. 'If the talks finish in complete failure, I would expect to see Dollars 1 a barrel - if not more - added to the oil price pretty rapidly,' said Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS.</p>

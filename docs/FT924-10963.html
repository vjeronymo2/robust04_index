			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Breeden opposes Iosco capital standard: SEC chairman condemns proposal as 'imprudent' - Chance of agreement recedes THE likelihood of agreement being reached on an international standard for the capital to be held by securities firms and banks receded sharply yesterday, when Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said he was implacably opposed to the current proposal. Mr Breeden said the proposal - which is supported by the Securities and Investments Board of the UK - was 'imprudent in the extreme' and it would be better if agreement was 'never reached' than to accept the proposals. Mr Breeden is chairman of the technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), whose annual meeting is taking place in London. There is an emergency meeting of the technical committee this morning. Mr Breeden said the SEC had tested the proposals to see what would have happened if they had been in force during Black Monday in October 1987, when share prices fell more than 22 per cent. 'Several big securities firms would have collapsed,' he warned. The Iosco proposals have already been enshrined in a European Community capital adequacy directive (or CAD), to be followed by all EC-based securities firms. 'The levels of capital under the CAD are highly unsafe,' he said. 'I am not sure the public understands that.' The dispute between the SIB and the SEC hinges on the extent to which a securities firm should be able to reduce the capital it carries, to cover the risk of losses on a portfolio of equities, by hedging that portfolio. Mr Breeden also pointed to a second reason why an international standard was unlikely to be agreed. Any standard would be applied by Iosco members and the bank regulators grouped in the Basle Committee on Bank Supervision. Mr Breeden said Iosco members were united in opposition to the Basle committee's position on the capital to be applied to holdings of bonds and debt securities, as opposed to equities. Under the Basle proposals, banks' holdings of bonds for investment purposes  -as opposed to their trading books - would be excluded from any capital requirement, but Iosco opposes this distinction and says that capital should be required for all bond holdings.

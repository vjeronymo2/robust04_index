			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Japan plays catch-up with US - At first sight advanced information networks might seem like another instance of Japan stealing a march on its competitors in a key new technology. The truth is rather different The dull, grey halls of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications seem an unlikely cradle for inspired visions of the country's high-tech future. But for several months these shadowy corridors have been abuzz with activity, as bureaucrats have raced against time to come up with a credible blueprint for Japan's information superhighway. The speed and enthusiasm with which the MPT has moved has been startling. Last month, in a report by the Telecommunications Council, it made public its vision of Japan's advanced information network. The report will form the basis for the ministry's policy-making. It said Japan should be well on the way to an advanced information society by the turn of the century, with 20 per cent of the population connected by fibre-optic cable that will allow speedy, two-way transmission of vast amounts of information. By 2010, such cables should criss-cross the nation in a network that would provide the entire population with access to the information superhighway. At first sight it might seem like another instance of Japan stealing a march on its competitors with an ambitious long-term plan to give it a lead in a key new technology. The truth is rather different. Japan is behind the US in plans for an information superhighway and there is little detail on how the ministry's report might become reality. By the MPT's own estimate, the programme would cost between Y33tn and Y55tn, with an additional Y42tn needed if the cable is to be installed underground. As yet there is no indication where funds on that scale would come from. Yet the bureaucrats are in a hurry for a number of reasons. They are under pressure to catch up with the US which, when it comes to multimedia, is several years ahead of Japan. The MPT estimates that by the year 2010, the information and communication industries could be generating between 5 and 6 per cent of gross domestic product, or Y123tn. The number of new jobs created could come to 2.4m, or more than the number employed in the Japanese automobile industry today. Japan is searching for a new engine for economic growth. The post-war growth of the Japanese economy was fuelled first by heavy industry and then in turn by automobiles and consumer electronics. With international competition in both industries mounting, and after a long and bruising recession, economic strategists are searching for competitive advantage in higher value added fields. Multimedia is an obvious candidate. The telecommunications ministry is not alone in mapping out a multimedia future for Japan. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry last month published its own report on an advanced information programme. As the past architect of Japan's industrial future, Miti is increasingly convinced that added value in economic activity will come not from manufacturing but from intellectual activity, such as software. A sophisticated information infrastructure is crucial in fostering such intellectual activity. According to the MPT's vision, Japan's advanced information infrastructure should be rolled out in three stages over a period of 17 years. The first stage would be to connect the largest cities, prefectural government offices and public facilities, such as hospitals, libraries and schools, with fibre-optic cable. This would link 20 per cent of the population. The target for the second stage, would be to link cities with a population of over 100,000 and give coverage to 60 per cent of the population. The final stage would aim for nationwide linkage by 2010. Plans for financing all this, however, are vague. The job of building the superhighway should be left to the private sector, the government argues, and the MPT believes government's role should be to provide interest-free or low-interest loans and tax incentives. There could also be spending to promote the use of information superhighway services, especially among public institutions. This could start as early as next spring. The authorities' approach to regulation could be equally important. Tight regulations and lack of competition have kept the prices of many services very high in Japan. Without greater competition in providing multimedia services, prices could be so high as to discourage many consumers. There are some signs that Japanese ministries recognise that the multimedia market will only take off with a plurality of service providers offering a wide range of services. The only private company capable of building a fibre-optic cable network of any scale is NTT, the telecommunications group. It has drawn up plans for laying fibre-optic cable throughout the country by 2015. Yet by relaxing many of the rules that separate the broadcasting and telecommunications industries - which have hindered the growth of cable TV operators - the MPT is attempting to foster competition against NTT. Rules on foreign ownership of broadcasting companies have been relaxed and the ministry is considering a plan to enable the country's small, independent cable TV operators to link up using the infrastructure of the relatively new telecommunications companies known as new common carriers. While the authorities labour over the regulatory issues, a swarm of private projects are under way to test the practicalities of advanced two-way communications and the services they might offer. The National Children's Hospital and Tokyo Teishin Hospital are carrying out an experiment linking some of their patients to the hospital through digital networks. A colour videophone is place in the patient's house to enable doctors to conduct simple examinations of their patients. Data on blood pressure, urine samples and from cardiograms can also be sent through the digital phone lines. Secom, a security systems company, and a hospital in Tokyo have started a service to provide support in analysing computed tomography and MRI images. Hospitals and clinics which sign up for the service send in CT and MRI images through integrated services digital networks for analysis by specialist doctors. The analysis is then sent back by fax. But in future Secom aims to conduct the services on interactive networks. Sega, the video games maker, has started providing cable TV subscribers with games-on-demand. And trading houses, such as Sumitomo and C Itoh, have tied up with US companies to develop home shopping. Okazaki, a city in central Japan, has been designated by the MPT as a model city for multimedia networks. Students will be able to access educational information collected by the city using existing cable TV networks, and teleconferencing will be used for major school events, such as student board meetings. As projects multiply, the practical benefits of advanced communications networks will become clearer to a still mystified public. The first in this series appeared on June 30 and looked at Italy</p>

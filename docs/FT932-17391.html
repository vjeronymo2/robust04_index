			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Broad reform of property lease law announced THE government yesterday announced a far-reaching reform of the law on commercial property leases. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, announced measures affecting future leases which would limit the liability of a tenant which passes its lease onto another tenant. Separately, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said a consultation paper would be issued shortly to examine three aspects of commercial leases which have caused concern: upward-only rent reviews, confidentiality clauses and the procedures for resolving disputes. He stressed that no legislation would affect existing contracts. While landlords were relieved that the proposals would make little impact on existing leases, some were concerned about the impact on property values in the future. 'This is a tenant-biased proposal,' said Mr John Parry, president of the British Property Federation. 'It will make property less attractive for investors.' Under Lord Mackay's proposals, a tenant that moved out of a property might be required to guarantee the rent payments of the next tenant but would not be held responsible if the lease was subsequently passed on. This would be a considerable help to tenants, which can currently be held responsible for rent arrears for the lifetime of a lease - generally 25 years. Lord Mackay said the government would restrict the implementation of most of the 1988 Law Commission's recommendations on this matter to existing leases. The legislation will be introduced when parliamentary time permits. Where existing leases are concerned, he said that landlords wanting to sue a former tenant for the rent arrears built up by a subsequent tenant would have to claim within nine months of the money becoming due. The proposals were welcomed by tenant representatives, despite concerns that they will do little to help businesses that are currently faced with bills for rent arrears run up subsequent tenants. 'This is a great day for hundreds of thousands of small businesses,' said the Property Market Reform Group, a tenant's lobbying group, while the CBI welcomed the proposals as a tremendous breakthrough'.</p>

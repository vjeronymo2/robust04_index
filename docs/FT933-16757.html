			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / 'Active' UN role for Japan, Germany THE elevation of Germany and Japan to permanent membership in the UN security council would require their 'active role in global peace and security activities,' the US said yesterday. In supporting their entry in an official response to a UN resolution on council reform, the US also emphasised that the status of the existing five permanent members should remain unaltered. Thus, there would be no direct threat to Britain and France whose diminished status has been cited by third world members as a reason for change. But many members may not welcome the implication that Germany and Japan, the enemy states whose defeat in second world war led to the creation of the UN, should have a stronger military role half a century afterwards. Britain, France, Russia and China, which with the US form the present permanent membership, did not immediately release their responses to the resolution. These were supposed to have been delivered by the end of June. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general, will compile all the comments in a comprehensive report to the general assembly, which will review the question later this year. He favours reform of UN bodies in 1995, when the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Charter will be celebrated. Japan, currently an elected member of the council, hopes to make a smooth transition to a permanent seat by then. Nigeria, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Egypt and even a multi-racial South Africa have all been mentioned as contenders for permanent membership. The US evidently did not want to take sides in any such contest but declared its willingness to consider 'a modest number of additional seats'. Nor did the statement address the question whether new permanent members should have the power of veto. However, it stressed that the current five had 'global political and economic influence and a capacity as well as a will to contribute to global peace and security through peacekeeping and other activities.' All of them happen also to be nuclear powers.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row looms on public-sector pay limits THE TREASURY is set to fight calls from Whitehall spending ministers for the planned extension into next year of a tough squeeze on public-sector pay to be imposed again through a formal and published pay ceiling. Whitehall officials and senior ministers indicated yesterday that the Treasury's spending plans for 1994-95 and 1995-96 would allow for an increase in the public-sector wage bill of at most 2 per cent next year. Some ministers believe that figure might come down towards zero in the next few months as departments take on new spending commitments. The spending ministers are arguing privately that the pay squeeze will be impossible to enforce without a formal limit applying to all public-sector workers. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, plans to resist calls from colleagues in the main spending departments for the present published 1.5 per cent pay ceiling to be rolled over into 1994-95. Mr Lamont will argue during this summer's public spending negotiations that an unpublished Treasury ceiling for the overall wage bill should be met through informal limits for each of the main departments. That would put the onus on each department to strike a balance between wage re-straint, cuts in capital programmes and job losses in areas such as the National Health Service, schools, the police and the fire service. The chancellor's stance appears to have set the stage for a political row with some of his colleagues. Last year spending ministers on the powerful EDX public expenditure cabinet committee, charged with thrashing out the allocation of available funds, pushed for the 1.5 per cent ceiling to be imposed for two years. Mr Lamont succeeded then in restricting it to one year, but some of his colleagues are arguing that the pressures on pay have intensified since that deal was struck . This week's Budget showed that Whitehall budgets in 1994-95 will be 0.25 per cent lower in real terms than in the financial year which starts next month. Unions representing public-sector workers reacted angrily to suggestions that the government might set a pay ceiling for a second year. Nalgo, the local government union, said: 'The government is storing up enormous industrial problems for itself. 'Attempts to make public-sector workers pay for the government's incompetent economic performance this year, next year or any other year will not be tolerated.' The Royal College of Nursing said the prime minister had made a clear commitment to its pay review body to recommend pay levels in 1993-94. 'We shall be holding him to that,' it said.</p>

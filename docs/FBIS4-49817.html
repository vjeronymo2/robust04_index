			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Some 40 percent of the  provincial and prefectural officials are from ethnic minorities  in Yunnan, a southwestern province with a large number of  ethnic-minority inhabitants.    A provincial official said that of the total number of the  province's ethnic officials 68.5 have education up to college or  special secondary school level. More than half of them hold the  titles as professors or technicians.    Yunnan is home to 25 ethnic minorities, which make up 34  percent of its population. Most of them used to live primitive  lives before the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.  To improve life and education for these ethnic people, the  province has earmarked over one million yuan (about 110,000 U.S.  dollars) every year to help start special training classes for  ethnic officials.    Now the number of technical personnel among the ethnic  population has hit a record high of 127,000. Many of them are  very active in various walks of life such as agriculture,  engineering, education, science and technology. Some have  become acclaimed professors and research scientists.    At present, ethnic-minority people hold such prominent  positions in the Communist Party, government and legislature as  deputy party head, provincial governor and deputy governor, head  of the provincial people's congress and chairman or  vice-chairman of provincial committees of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference.</p>

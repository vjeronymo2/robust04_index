			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Society axes endowments CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society surprised analysts and the financial services industry by announcing this week that it is to stop selling not only endowment mortgages but also all other insurance-related products. Banks and building societies have been moving inexorably towards a supermarket approach to selling a wide range of financial products, such as pensions and life insurance. The idea, known as 'bancassurance,' has become common currency in the industry. Banks and societies foresee a boost to their income from commission on such sales. Some societies - such as Britannia, National &amp; Provincial and Woolwich - have made an expensive investment by setting up their own life companies which should, in the long run, prove more profitable than 'tying' (ie, having an exclusive distribution) with a single life office. What is wrong with trying to increase income by providing a wide range of products (with the added virtue of convenience, since they are available on the high street)? Nothing, in principle. But the problem is that by tying to a single life office, customers must buy the products of that provider regardless of how they have performed or whether they meet the client's needs. Moreover, consumer bodies (such as the Consumers' Association) have concluded that some products, particularly endowment mortgages, are oversold because of the commission they generate. Anthony Nelson, economics secretary to the Treasury, has become alarmed by the high lapse rates in the life industry. Last month, he ordered the regulators to draft rules obliging both tied agents and independent financial advisers to disclose how much commission they get when they recommend a product. This is expected to make endowment mortgages - where an equity-linked, long-term savings plan is taken out to pay off the mortgage - even less attractive than before. 'Societies are realising that bancassurance is not a guaranteed route to riches,' says the CA's Jean Eaglesham. 'It is another nail in the coffin of endowment mortgages.' C &amp; G says that once its five-year tied agreement with Legal &amp; General ends in November, it will not seek a tie with any other life office or set up its own. Customers who want insurance-related products will be referred to local IFAs, who are responsible for referring roughly 60 per cent of C &amp; G's existing mortgage clients. The society showed its disenchantment with endowments three years ago when it announced it would concentrate on interest-only and repayment mortgages. With the former, the choice of how to pay off the capital is left to the borrower. Andrew Longhurst, C &amp; G's chief executive, says: 'Endowment mortgages are not automatically in the customer's best interests.' Endowments now account for only 8.3 per cent of C &amp; G's new mortgage sales, compared with an industry average of 69 per cent. This has meant lower commission income compared with the other top 10 building societies, much of which is eaten up by the costs of selling the products. C &amp; G says this is expected to increase with the introduction of more rigorous training standards for insurance salesmen. The society's low cost-to-income ratio means it relies less on bancassurance for its income than comparable rivals - and, thus, can do without it more easily. C &amp; G also has been helped by its low overheads: it has the lowest number of branches of any top 10 society except Bristol &amp; West. Instead, it has built up a postal banking service and much of its deposit-taking is in the form of postal accounts. It has courted the wealthier older investor, both as saver and borrower. Others, tied into the bancassurance strategy, will find it difficult to change tack and are unlikely to follow. But as Patrick Frazer, of consultant DIBC (and author of Morgan Grenfell's annual report on building societies), says: 'C &amp; G looks as if it will be on the side of the angels while the other building societies find themselves in the position of having to defend what is increasingly seen as a rip-off product.'</p>

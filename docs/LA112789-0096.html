			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLAYTON STARTLES THE FIELD AT BARRIOS 10K RACE  </P> <P> Matt Clayton doesn't have any national championships notched on his running  shoes. There are no Olympic medals gathering dust on his shelf.  </P> <P> But Sunday at the $20,000 Reebok Arturo Barrios Invitational, Clayton, a  24-year-old San Diego State student, raced against those who have such things  -- and won nonetheless.  </P> <P> Clayton, of Imperial Beach, waited until the final 200 yards of the  10-kilometer race to pull away from a talented field to win in 28 minutes 30  seconds, an impressive 39-second improvement over his previous 10K best of  29:09, run only two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Among those Clayton beat were Suleiman Nyambui, who won 15 National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. championships in cross-country, indoor and outdoor track  competing for UTEP in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Nyambui, 37, was second in 28:39, followed by Mexican standouts Salvador Garcia  (28:44), Abundio Mondragon (28:52) and Jorge Marquez (29:12).  </P> <P> "Oh, this is a big-time thrill for me," said Clayton, a cross-country coach at  Bonita Vista High School. "My main goal was to run under 29 minutes and break  into the top five. I didn't think I'd win the thing. It's exciting. Like (being  on) cloud 99, I guess."  </P> <P> In the women's division, Rosa Mota, the 1988 Olympic marathon champion from  Portugal, had little trouble outrunning a field that included four-time U.S.  Olympian Francie Larrieu-Smith, 1987 NCAA 10,000-meter champ Sylvia Mosqueda,  and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, the women's world-record holder at several  distances, including 10K.  </P> <P> Mota, who waved to the largely Latino crowds as they shouted "Vaya Rosa!" and  "Vaya Rosita!," spent the first two miles in a shoulder-to-shoulder duel with  Mosqueda before picking up the pace. Mosqueda, whose reputation as a runner who  goes out hard and finishes weak proved true again, faded to third in 33:20 and  was passed by Larrieu-Smith (second at 33:05) with two miles remaining.  </P> <P> Mota, who is just 4-feet-9, 90 pounds and wears a men's size 3 1/2 shoe, said:  "I don't like to wait for the finish (to make a move) because I am too slow. I  try to go faster and faster each mile instead."  </P> <P> Kristiansen, still recovering from her victory in the New York City Marathon  three weeks ago, participated in the event's 5K walk with her 6-year-old son,  Gaute, before running in the elite 10K. Kristiansen had planned on running in  the open 10K, but changed her mind Saturday.  </P> <P> "I planned to run the fun run, but I am a competitor; I wanted to run," she  said. "I didn't try to win at all; I just love to race. I haven't trained since  New York, so I'm not in shape."  </P> <P> Kristiansen, whose 10K world record on the track is 30:13, ran 34:24, good  enough for sixth and $400.  </P> <P> Clayton and Mota each earned $4,000 for their victories.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Although he is hardly close to his form that brought him several world records  some 10 years ago, 37-year-old Henry Rono, now on the comeback trail in Eugene,  Ore., ran a respectable 32:34 for 19th. . . . Twelve men broke 30 minutes in  the race, and seven women ran sub-35s. . . . Orange County's top finisher was  former Orange Coast College standout Alfredo Vigueras, now living and training  in Alamosa, Colo. . . . Proceeds from the race will benefit a "Stay in School"  program for Orange County students. The race's namesake, Arturo Barrios, said  $15,000 was raised for the program Sunday. Next year the goal is $20,000. "This  sport has given me a lot of things," said Barrios, the world-record holder at  10,000 meters. "This is one way of giving something back, to help people." . .  . Despite the early-morning drizzle, about 2,000 runners turned out for the  races, and an estimated 1,000 came just to watch.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (1): The future of computing starts here - Comment / Philip Manchester charts the trend towards a stable infrastructure for information technology and the exciting new business applications which this will allow EVEN casual observers of the computer and communications industries cannot have failed to have noticed that things are changing. The inexorable rise of the MS/DOS personal computer, the growth of networked systems and the continued advances in both computer and communications technologies has wrought change on a grand scale in the last couple of years. These changes promise to create a stable continuum for future information technology (IT) systems - but they mean a radical shift in the underlying infrastructure of information processing which is both technological and cultural. On the technology side, new approaches to building and designing systems using low-cost, high-performance hardware and standard 'open' software have turned conventional wisdom on its head. Bigger is no longer necessarily better and traditional IT is no longer competitive. On the cultural side, the struggle to keep the IT industry the fast-moving, high-growth industry it has been for the last 30 years, has led to unprecedented alliances between erstwhile market rivals. More important, the demands of computer users for genuine cost-effective IT systems has forced suppliers to adopt a different approach to the design of systems. It has also forced them to co-operate like never before. The bottom line is that the new technology infrastructure of computers and communications opens the door to exciting new applications. But it also means that the world becomes more complex. In place of the relatively simple computers of yesterday, modern users are confronted with an array of technology to help them do their job. This year's A to Z of Computing looks at the technological innovation which has made this possible. Advanced digital telecommunications creates greater bandwidth to carry more, richer information - opening the door to multimedia applications. The wide acceptance of the client/server architectural approach to networked systems design, coupled with software standards such as SQL for databases and X/Windows for workstation computing, makes it possible to build systems from multi-sourced components. NEW approaches to the application of IT - such as groupware, just-in-time manufacturing, computer-aided systems engineering and voice technology - provide opportunities for companies to gain competitive edge from their IT investment. At the same time, the growth of complex networks of computers raises questions such as security, fault tolerance and software piracy. While advances in IT do much to create new opportunities, traditional approaches still have a role to play - although they will, of course, have to change to survive. The mainframe computer still has much to offer - as indeed does a traditional software discipline like as transaction management. Future IT systems will be required to 'interoperate' with each other at all levels to satisfy the growing need for a stable continuum of technology from a handheld computer through to a powerful mainframe. This future is being written now and the FT's A to Z of Computing places the implication in context for the general reader as well as the technologist.</p>

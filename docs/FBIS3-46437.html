Zaveryukha told a news conference Russia's agriculture is  facing difficulties as many farms do not have enough money to  buy machinery, fertilizer and fuels.    The minister listened to a criticism by former Finance  Minister Boris Fedorov, who said that Zaveryukha's demand for  more money for the complexes he is in charge of is "excessive."  such criticism was "absurd," Zaveryukha said.    However, Zaveryukha stressed that the situation may even  worsen if the country's agriculture industry isn't funded  properly.    Referring to the 1993 harvest, when Russia realized a total  of 100 million tons of grain, Zaveryukha said that the crop did  not reach the expected output due to climatic and financial  problems.    Zaveryukha said that the government will continue to carry  out the reforms and impose its tough financial policies,  pointing out that the new cabinet is conforming to the needs of  the times.</p>

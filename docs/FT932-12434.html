			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: US recovery puts Mobil in profit MOBIL, the big US energy group, yesterday reported a first-quarter 1993 net profit of Dollars 490m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, against a loss of Dollars 319m last time, following accounting charges. With last year's accounting charges stripped out, the year-on-year comparison shows first-quarter earnings more than doubled this year, from Dollars 277m a year ago. Revenues were Dollars 15bn, a decrease of 1 per cent year-on-year. Mr Allen Murray, chairman, said while there was sluggish economic growth in Europe, the US economy had picked up and US gas prices recovered to more traditional winter levels. He said Mobil continued to focus on restructuring efforts and reported that operating expenses were down year-on-year in the US. Exploration and production earnings were Dollars 433m, up from Dollars 175m a year ago. US operating earnings for exploration and production were Dollars 117m while non-US earnings were Dollars 316m. Marketing and refining earnings were Dollars 134m, an increase of Dollars 82m year-on-year. Chemical division earnings were Dollars 21m, against Dollars 10m a year ago. Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures for the first quarter of 1993 were Dollars 815m, or 10 per cent lower than last year. Chevron, the fourth-biggest US energy group, also reported buoyant first-quarter results. Net income was Dollars 501m, or Dollars 1.54 per share, up 47 per cent on the previous year's quarterly income before special accounting charges. Total revenues were Dollars 9.8bn, compared with Dollars 9.7bn a year ago. Capital and exploration spending was Dollars 778m in the quarter, down from Dollars 1.08bn a year ago.</p>

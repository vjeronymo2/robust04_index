			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Muslim Brotherhood "on recent events in </F> the country"; place and date not given]    [Text] Egypt and the Arab and Islamic nations are going  through a crucial stage in their current history. Attempts to  incite trouble and discord between the people and their  governments are no secret to anyone, nor are the obvious  conspiracies to break up a united people and fragment and  partition their united homeland.    As a result of this deteriorating situation, many people  have  been killed, stability has been lost, and peace and security  vanished.    The Muslim Brotherhood announces that its program for  teaching the ways of God the Almighty and religion is a peaceful  program based on awakening Islamic feeling, reviving belief in  people's hearts, educating the nation in knowledge, work, and  morals, and spreading a spirit of sacrifice, jihad, and  dedication among the Islamic people to ascend from the abyss of  backwardness and work on building the unity of the nation. To  achieve this, the Muslim Brotherhood gets its inspiration from  the words of justice, blessed may they be: Invite all to the  way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue  with them in ways that are best and most gracious [Koranic  verse], as well as in the Almighty's words: Let there arise from  you a band of people inviting all that is good, enjoying what is  right and forbidding what is wrong [Koranic verse]. At the same  time, the Brotherhood shows respect for constitutions and laws  and works through them to achieve the interests of the country  and the people such as public freedoms, respect for human  rights, and justice among people.    This has been manifested by the fact that the Brotherhood  has  taken part in all aspects of life within the framework of the  constitution and laws in force. Brotherhood members have  participated in local and parliamentary councils, professional  associations, and other such institutions along with other  political parties and forces. Thus, they were hoping to reform  the situation through the words of justice, open dialogue,  constructive opinion, impartial criticism, and honorable  opposition.    There have been bitter acts of violence for many reasons  ever  since the Muslim Brotherhood emerged from the prisons nearly a  quarter of a century ago. Not a single member of the Muslim  Brotherhood took part in these events. On the contrary, the  Brotherhood condemns these incidents because it considers such  events a departure from the right course in preaching the ways  of God, the Almighty, and a distancing from the path it follows.  The president of the republic said this in statements to the  French newspaper LE MONDE on 1 November last year. The  president then said about the Muslim Brotherhood: It is an  Islamic movement that has opted for political struggle rather  than violence. Former Egyptian interior ministers at various  stages have also stated these facts. The latest of these was a  statement by Interior Minister Hasan al- Alfi in his news  conference published in AL-AHRAM and AL-JUMHURIYAH on 14 April  1994. This is evidence of the innocence of the Muslim  Brotherhood of such accusations which are made indiscriminately  without any backing or proof.    Thousands of defendants have been tried in numerous cases  and  thousands of others were arrested. The Brotherhood's clear and  explicit stance on these issues is evidence of its commitment to  its wise plan in preaching the ways of God through conviction  and confirmation.    The Muslim Brotherhood is not, and will not be a group  advocating sedition and trouble, and will not be the cause of  revolution or clashes. However, the absence of a response to  the demands of the people, the delay in reforms, coupled with  the big deterioration in services and disregard for man's basic  rights, in addition to failure to provide the necessary  guarantees for freedom of elections, some of these points, in  fact all of them, are what is causing concern and fear regarding  the deterioration of the situation to a unacceptable state.    May God protect Egypt from the evil of schemers and keep all  harmful things at bay.</p>

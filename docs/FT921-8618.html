			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: Leo in Love - Nuffield Theatre, Southampton If Leo in Love serves one useful purpose, it is as a reminder that boulevard comedy is not simply the preserve of the commercial theatres of London and New York. The French, who after all invented the term, are responsible for this fatuous excursion into the emotional byways for middle age. Jean Sarment's play, adapted and translated, is the archetypal star vehicle  -a little creaky in the joints and warped in the wheels, but offers a more or less roadworthy ride to an actor of a certain age. Produced originally as Leopold Le Bien-aime in Paris in 1927, it was taken up the the French actor Georges Wilson, for whom it has become something of a speciality, and arrives in Southampton under the wing of Martin Jarvis. The plotline is contrived to within an inch of its life. The eponymous Leo, woman hating bachelor, has a chance meeting on a riverbank with the 'dead letter supervisor' for the Paris post office - a civil servant responsible for disposing of undelivered mail, who tells him of two misrouted letters from women which he opened years earlier. One told her suitor to get lost, while the other - to a man called Leopold  - specified the time and venue for a romantic tryst, which, helas, must never have been kept. Realising the letter to have been addressed to him, Leo is immediately transformed from curmudgeonly fisherman to ardent roue, who fixes all the village romances while inviting his one-time sweetheart and authoress of the letter to stay, in the hope of rekindling their amour. Marie-Therese - rather amusingly played by Sarah Badel - is now a hefty widow with no inkling of Leo's blighted love nor any recollection of the aborted assignation. In the interests of those who plan to see the show during its forthcoming tour of the southern counties, I will give no more away except to say that director Patrick Sandford has driven a Rolls-Royce of a cast down a pretty paltry avenue. The capering joviality of Jarvis is nicely offset by a handful of cameos including a stringy spinster from Angela Pleasence and a sniffy priest from Christopher Godwin. The set, by Robin Don, is a delight.</p>

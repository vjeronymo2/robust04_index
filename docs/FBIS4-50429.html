			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yuan Pu (5913 2528) and reporter Li Anding </F> (2621 1344 1353)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- During a recent  interview, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State  Economic and Trade Commission, said that replacing state  enterprises' operating mechanisms and turning them into modern  businesses is an assignment which the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee specifically put forth. He said:  Enterprises' immediate project of deepening reform will  underscore the "replacement of mechanisms." His commission and  other relevant departments have already drawn up a plan for this  purpose. To deepen the reform, efforts will be made to  "expedite reform in its entirety, achieve breakthroughs at key  points, and carry out supporting projects comprehensively" to  make sure that enterprise reforms will deepen.    Wang Zhongyu said: While implementing this plan, we must  proceed from a new angle and establish new concepts so that  enterprise reform can reach a higher level. Under this plan,  the rights and benefits that the state enjoys as an investor and  the limited liabilities it undertakes must be commensurate with  its investments. This plan also specifically provides that state  enterprises must have a stronger influence and play a dominant  role through controlling and purchasing stocks and by using  limited state capital to dominate more capital. The plan also  specifically states that perennially unprofitable enterprises  and insolvent enterprises must be allowed to go bankrupt  according to the law, and that assets should flow rationally so  that they can have the maximum effect and help attain the  anticipated goals for reform.    Wang Zhongyu said: "Expediting reform in its entirety" means  that the two regulations -- the "Regulations Governing the  Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing the Supervision and  Control of State-Owned Property" -- must be implemented along  with the establishment of a modern enterprise system. In other  words, enterprises must enjoy all the privileges and fulfill all  their obligations prescribed in the regulations, and state-owned  property must be controlled more effectively so that a modern  enterprise system can be reliably established on the basis of  reforming the labor, personnel, and wage systems and  implementing the "Accountancy Norm" and "General Principles for  Financial Affairs" as well as the two sets of aforementioned  regulations.    "Achieving breakthroughs at key points" means that efforts  must be made to expedite the development of major enterprises  and regions. Over a two-year period, 10,000 large and medium  state- owned enterprises will be designated to implement the  "Enterprise Law," the regulations on changing operating  mechanisms, the accountancy norm, and the guiding principles for  financial affairs; to finish reappraising their stocks and  assets; and to basically complete changing their operating  mechanisms. While implementing the regulations for supervising  state-owned property, the state will, by groups and by stages,  set up supervisory boards at 1,000 mainstay enterprises to  exercise supervision over the state-owned property of these  enterprises whose operations are closely associated with the  national economy and people's livelihood. Meanwhile, under the  State Council's consolidated leadership and planning, 100 large  and medium businesses will be selected to experiment with modern  operations in order to explore ways to operate these businesses  like corporations. At the same time, a dozen or so cities will  be designated to carry out supporting reforms with the objective  of optimizing capital structures and increasing the strength of  enterprises. The economic and trade commission and eight other  departments have already drawn up plans for carrying out pilot  projects in about 10 cities concerning replenishing enterprises,  separating their responsibilities, and lightening their burdens  as well as letting insolvent enterprises go bankrupt.    As for "carrying out supporting projects comprehensively,"  cities will be asked to take advantage of their abilities to  launch comprehensive reforms and deal with key problems that  have been plaguing large and medium enterprises for a long time.  Meanwhile, mechanisms for strengthening coordination between  general and specialized departments will be established so that  problems can be dealt with comprehensively.    Wang Zhongyu said: Our plan has gone into effect with a  positive response and support from local governments and  enterprises. Owing to problems confronting enterprises, the  measures prescribed in the plans are quite strong. For example,  to carry out the "Bankruptcy Law" and to speed up enterprises'  organizational restructuring, it has been prescribed that  markets' trading property rights will be established in cities  so that property use can be optimized. With respect to  separating enterprises' social functions, cities that have been  designated to carry out the pilot project will establish some  labor service markets so that they can gradually undertake  various social functions, such as placing surplus workers  through various channels. Different methods will also be  adopted to help enterprises reduce their unwarranted debts  according to different circumstances.    Wang Zhongyu indicated that he expected that the plan will  encounter many problems but that his commission is determined to  follow through with the plan, seize the opportunity to expedite  enterprise reform, act in a practical manner in dealing with the  problems that the old system has caused enterprises, and create  the conditions that can enable large and medium state-owned  enterprises to move into the market without burdens.</p>

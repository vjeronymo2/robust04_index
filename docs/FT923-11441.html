			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / London Electricity tops service poll ELECTRICITY consumers in London get better service than those in the north of Scotland, the industry watchdog Offer reported yesterday. It also proposed important measures to improve customer service in the electricity industry. These include offering customers timed appointments and paying more compensation for bad service. The report ranked the 12 regional electricity companies and the two Scottish electricity companies according to how well they had performed against 10 'guaranteed' service standards Offer set in July last year. If they fall below these standards, the companies have to pay customers compensation. London Electricity came out top, with a failure rate of only one incident per 10,000 customers since July last year. The Scottish company Hydro-Electric was the worst, with 47 failures per 10,000. The company admitted it had some way to go to achieve its objectives. East Midlands came bottom of the 12 regional electricity companies, with 26 failures per 10,000. But East Midlands said it had set itself more stringent standards than most companies. For example, it already offers customers timed appointments, and replies to them more quickly than Offer requires. The other companies performed from best to worst as follows: Southern (5 failures), Yorkshire (7), Northern (10), Norweb (10), Eastern (11), Seeboard (12), Midlands (13), Scottish Power (14), South Wales (18), South Western (21), Manweb (25) and East Midlands (26). But some companies also failed Offer's 'overall standards'. These do not carry financial penalties, but Offer said it would write to the companies and ask them how they planned to improve their service. While East Midlands performed better on these standards, ScottishPower, Midlands Electricity and Southern Electric each failed standards - and Hydro-Electric failed two. Offer also proposed changes to customer service standards which it expects to introduce in January after a consultation period. These involve: Doubling the penalty payments customers can claim from electricity companies. Under the new standard customers could claim Pounds 20 for a missed appointment, and non-domestic customers could claim Pounds 100 for failure to supply electricity. Compelling electricity companies to specify within 2 hours when they will arrive for appointments with customers. Ensuring customers are sent accurate rather than estimated bills.</p>

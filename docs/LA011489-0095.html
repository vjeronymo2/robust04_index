			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STUDENTS STAGE SIT-IN AT S. AFRICA CONSULATE  </P> <P> About 30 students staged a sit-in Friday outside the South African Consulate in  Beverly Hills, vowing to stay there until Martin Luther King Day on Monday --  barring their arrest.  </P> <P> The students, carrying sleeping bags, pillows and a change of clothes, camped  on the third floor of the consulate office at 50 N. La Cienega Blvd. and sang,  "We shall overcome."  </P> <P> A consulate employee, peering through a window in one of the office doors,  refused to respond to the students' demands that he explain his country's  apartheid policy.  </P> <P> "He stood behind the window, then shut the blinds to us and refused to speak,"  said Sonjia Stutsky, 16, a Beverly Hills High School junior.  </P> <P> She said the group planned to camp in the hall until Monday morning when a  demonstration march is scheduled at 11 a.m. from the old consulate office on  Wilshire Boulevard to the new La Cienega facility.  </P> <P> Police stationed outside the building said the students could stay as long as  the building manager agreed.  </P></p>

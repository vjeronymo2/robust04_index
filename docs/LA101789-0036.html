			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 100,000 SURGE THROUGH LEIPZIG TO URGE REFORM  </P> <P> The biggest demonstration in East Germany in decades took place Monday night in  the southern city of Leipzig as at least 100,000 opposition activists surged  through the streets after peace services in five Protestant churches.  </P> <P> They crowded into Karl Marx Square in the center of East Germany's  second-largest city as part of a mass effort to urge the hard-line Communist  regime to introduce political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> "We are the people" and "Give young people power," they chanted. Some carried  banners calling for free elections, unrestricted travel and a free media.  Breaking with tradition, the official East German news agency ADN, a radio  station and the main television evening news program all carried accounts of  the demonstration.  </P> <P> Police did not interfere with the marchers, staying on the sidelines as they  did last week during a similar gathering, when the turnout was estimated at  50,000. The estimated number of people in the street Monday night made it the  biggest protest since worker riots in 1953, which were suppressed by Soviet  tanks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Warsaw, the East German Embassy reversed its policy and began  giving East Germans travel documents enabling them to emigrate to West Germany.  At least 1,300 East Germans are in the Polish capital waiting for  transportation that would allow them to join an exodus of refugees to the West.  </P> <P> The East Berlin regime had insisted that these citizens be sent back through  East Germany so they could be officially "expelled" as undesirable. The tactic  backfired, however, when hundreds of other East Germans tried to jump on board  the westbound trains.  </P> <P> On Monday, officials at the East German Embassy began handing out emigration  papers to their countrymen. Ambassador Juergen van Zwoll personally met the  first two busloads of East Germans when they arrived.  </P> <P> "The East German government found a solution for those East German citizens who  are in Poland by issuing them a certificate of renunciation of citizenship and  providing them with an identification paper," Van Zwoll said.  </P> <P> He said that "these people can go to whatever country they wish -- their  further destination does not interest us."  </P> <P> Several East Germans confirmed that they were required to sign a certificate  renouncing their citizenship and that they were then given new identification  papers.  </P> <P> "We are stateless people," one said as he left the embassy.  </P> <P> Not for long, however. The first group of East Germans to call at their embassy  moved quickly on to the West German Embassy, where they were given travel  documents and then prepared to depart for West Germany. West Germany recognizes  only a single German citizenship.  </P> <P> An official with the Polish airline LOT said the airline had received inquiries  from the West German Embassy about chartering flights to West Germany, and a  spokesman for the West German airline Lufthansa said his company is ready to  fly the refugees out if called on to do so.  </P> <P> In another development, Austrian police said Monday that about 1,800 East  Germans crossed the border from Hungary en route to West Germany in the  previous 24 hours. About 36,000 East Germans have crossed into Austria from  Hungary since Sept. 11, when Hungary opened its border to the refugees.  </P> <P> In East Germany, members of the reform-minded group Democratic Awakening  demanded in an open letter to East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack that the state  undertake an inquiry into police beatings of demonstrators during celebrations  10 days ago marking the 40th anniversary of the East German state.  </P> <P> The letter said hundreds of citizens have complained that they were humiliated  and mistreated for more than 24 hours, adding: "Violence and intimidation are  not suitable conditions for the democratic dialogue all sides are seeking."  </P></p>

"We are very satisfied. We didn't  expect it to be that warm so quickly," she says, just two years  after diplomatic relations were established.    With the first flush of high-level contacts now over, the  excitement and romance of the Sino-Israel honeymoon has begun to  wear off. Diplomacy is now aimed at the practical co-operation  essential to the success of the marriage. When Israeli  Economics and Planning Minister, Shim'on Shetrit, arrives in  Beijing today for an eight day visit, he will not be discussing  glamorous international affairs, but comparing notes on the  development of free-trade zones, privatisation of state  enterprises, inflation control, and regional development. "We  will be bringing a message of mutual co-operation and respect,  not telling them we know best," he told the South China Morning  Post.    The visit, at the invitation of Zou Jiahua, vice premier and  head of the State Planning Commission, is an indication that  ties are normal and continuing to grow steadily.    Officials and academic observers seem surprised by reports  from Hong Kong of a three-month cooling of relations after a  helicopter crash in Israel last November killed the visiting  Mayor of Shenyang. The crash, said Ms Ben Abba, also killed  three Israelis and nobody suspected foul play. A report on the  incident is expected to blame the incident on an engine fault.  "The Chinese understand accidents like this happen," she said.    On another level, however, it is evident there has been some  disappointment on both sides with the concrete results of two  years of Commentary on-operation. "It's because expectations  were too high in the first place," said Yitzhaq Shichor,  associate professor at the Department of East Asian Studies of  the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Israel is disappointed at  China's continued sales of arms and weapons technology to Iran  and the Arab countries, although Foreign Ministry officials  believe China has kept its pledge not to supply missiles to Iran.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> More than 61,000 "boat people" fled Vietnam in the first eight months of this  year, a figure higher than in any full year since 1981, and Hong Kong is  bearing the brunt of the influx, a U.N. group said. The Office of the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees registered 61,345 arrivals in countries of first  asylum in Southeast Asia and Japan from January through August, just before  seasonal conditions traditionally slow down the exodus. The outflow compared to  45,500 for last year and 74,000 in 1981. Hong Kong reported 32,000 arrivals  during the first eight months.  </P></p>

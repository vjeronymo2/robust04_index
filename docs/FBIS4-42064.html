			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "European Unemployment Sounds an </F> Alarm Signal"]    [Text] Bonn, 26 May -- Speaking to journalists in Bonn,  Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt emphasized the efforts being  made by the Federal Government to achieve deregulation within  the European Union [EU]. That should help to overcome the  bureaucratic obstacles within the Union. Rexrodt wants to use a  team of independent experts, composed of scientists,  businessmen, and lawyers, to examine these issues. They should  check EU provisions to establish whether companies and consumers  are being burdened with unnecessary costs. The minister did,  however, say that the subject was "dynamite in Europe" and would  be rejected by Jacques Delors, the EU president.    Rexrodt talked about the main tasks that he envisaged when  Germany takes over the EU presidency on 1 July. Those tasks  included overcoming unemployment and strengthening competition.  An unemployment figure of over 17 million in Europe sounds an  alarm bell in Europe, said Rexrodt in Bonn. Fortunately,  economic recovery had started in many EU member states. This  positive development has to be secured and developed. The  European Council action program for growth, competitiveness, and  employment can provide a basis for this. It seemed to be  particularly important to Rexrodt to oversee the implementation  of this plan. It would be sensible for the European states to  report to the Council of Minister on successes and failures.    In individual laender -- while considering the specific  situation in each of them -- the issue is one of consolidating  public budgets, developing labor market policy instruments, and  reducing bureaucracy. Next year, the European Commission is to  expand the number of its members from the current 17 to 21.    Rexrodt also said it is important to liberalize the European  electricity and gas markets: When that happens, competitive  distortions between member states will have to be eliminated.  In the case of energy production, companies should experience a  healthy degree of competition. In this respect, an EU guideline  is necessary, one that would increase the possibilities for  transferring gas and electricity through foreign networks and  would result in the disappearance of the current demarcation  agreements. There are substantial differences on this issue  within Germany. Thus, municipal authorities want to retain their  rights to issue exclusive permits for the supply of energy. The  Environment Ministry feels that it has been disregarded by the  Economics Ministry, because Rexrodt's ministry has not accorded  sufficient attention to environmental considerations and because  coordination between the ministries does not function.    Further, Rexrodt thinks it is necessary to create clear-cut  prospects for Central and East European states. In this  respect, Germany has a particular duty. Thus, the negotiations  on the free trade agreements with the Baltic states should be  concluded during the German presidency. The Commission could  then shortly present the draft of a mandate for the conclusion  of an agreement with those states. As far as the applications  for membership submitted by Poland and Hungary are concerned,  membership negotiations are conceivable only when the situation  in those countries would permit that. In the meantime, the  European Union will have to develop its policy of opening up  markets by dismantling tariffs and other restrictions. Rexrodt  does not consider the ideas that he has outlined to be "a list  of wishes," but sees there being good prospects of real progress  in the areas in question.</p>

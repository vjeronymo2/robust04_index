			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Easy to shift, harder to make a bomb with: The nuts and bolts of a do-it-yourself nuclear bomb In a suburban garage somewhere in western Europe, terrorists might today be assembling a nuclear weapon as destructive as the bombs that killed 100,000 people at Hiroshima and Nagasaki while middle-men may be trading plutonium to countries desperate to become nuclear weapons states. These are the fears raised by the increasing incidence of plutonium smuggling. But how realistic are they? Unfortunately, the answer is that smuggling plutonium is pretty straightforward and making bombs from it not that much harder. For all the doomsday demonology which surrounds it, plutonium is reasonably easily handled, and therefore, smuggled. The most common form of storage is as 1kg bars or small pellets, much like lead shot. Plutonium is a very toxic metal and causes cancer, yet most of the radioactivity which it gives off does not penetrate very far. That means that provided it is packaged in a properly sealed plastic container, it can be handled without protective clothing or large amounts of lead shielding. Smugglers, prepared to take the chance that the seals may break, can carry plutonium in a case or even in their clothing. Their main challenge is to avoid the airport metal detectors and x-ray scanners which would pick up the presence of such heavy metal objects. The amount of plutonium required to make a bomb depends on the sophistication of the design. US or Russian scientists could now make a workable design with as little as 2.5kg of plutonium. A beginner with a work bench and some sticky-back plastic would probably work with between 6kg and 10kg to make sure of an atomic explosion. When that amount of plutonium is coverted into a sphere it is little larger than a tennis ball. One snag is that remote control facilities are needed to melt down and shape the plutonium, since direct contact must be avoided. This plutonium fabrication is one of the more difficult parts of the process which would be hard to conduct in a suburban garage, but reasonably easy in any modestly equipped nuclear laboratory. The other requirement is that the plutonium is of high quality. Plutonium produced from uranium in the early months of use in a nuclear reactor is the bomb-grade plutonium-239, which readily explodes in a massive chain reaction. The less explosive plutonium-240 is produced after nuclear fuel has been in a reactor longer, and inhibits an effective nuclear explosion. Bomb-makers are looking for material which is more than 90 per cent plutonium-239, the kind of stuff which has been smuggled into Germany. Once the plutonium core is in place, the next job is to make a sphere of about 400kg of conventional explosive, typically the high explosive HMX, to go around it. This needs to be shaped so that the explosive shock wave it produces is focused in on the plutonium core, crushing it into a ball half its normal size. The implosion dramatically increases the number of plutonium atoms which are split apart, releasing enormous energies and generating a rapidly escalating chain reaction. It is that chain reaction which forms the nuclear explosion. For this to work properly it is important to get an even detonation. All of the high-explosive must go off at once, producing a symmetrical spherical shock wave to crush the plutonium. It requires some sophisticated electronics and large detonating capacitors which can be made to operate simultaneously to make this happen. Anyone determined to could acquire such equipment commercially, and the detonators are similar to some used in hi-tech flash photography. Producing an even explosion would also be difficult for terrorists, but most countries have conventional weapons designers who could produce such a detonation. They could also test how effective their design was by conducting trial explosions around a lead or uranium core, and observing the shock wave using X-ray cameras. Since they would only be conducting modest conventional explosions, a test programme would probably go undetected. Some refinements are normally added to the basic pattern to make sure the bomb is effective. The plutonium core is usually covered in a metallic 'neutron shield'. This reflects the neutrons which split the plutonium atoms back into the core, making sure that the maximum number are detonated during the explosion. To increase the number of reactions, a 'neutron gun' is also fired a fraction of a second after the conventional implosion starts, flooding the core with neutrons and kick-starting the nuclear chain reaction. This neutron gun uses electronics which could be assembled commercially and heavy water which can be obtained from civil nuclear sources. Last, just outside the neutron shield is a layer of uranium which is crushed by the high explosive and helps to ram the plutonium core into the smallest possible space. Such a nuclear weapon would weigh under 500kg, would be somewhat larger than a basketball and could be fitted into the warhead of a Scud missile. Its exact explosive power would depend on the quality of its construction, but a conservative designer might estimate that it would have the force of 20,000 tonnes of TNT - similar to that of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is, perhaps, a little beyond the ken of terrorists groups. It is by no means beyond most states if they were able to get their hands on enough of the weapons-grade plutonium currently being smuggled through Germany.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney wins banks' support for shake-up Euro Disney, the troubled French amusement park company, said yesterday that 92 per cent of its creditor banks, holding 90 per cent of its debt, had signed the memorandum of understanding that sets out the restructuring scheme designed to bring the company back to health, agencies report. Euro Disney, whose parent is the US entertainment group Walt Disney, said 'a sufficient number of banks have agreed to underwrite more than FFr3bn (Dollars 508m) of a proposed FFr6bn rights offering'. The creditor banks will underwrite 51 per cent of the offering and the remainder will be guaranteed by Disney, in line with its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney. The rights issue, scheduled for early summer, will be formally proposed at an extraordinary meeting to be called shortly, Euro Disney said. All the proceeds of the offering will be used to repay the lenders, bringing total bank debt to about FFr10bn. Euro Disney has a total debt of FFr21bn. The restructuring will involve a halving of the nominal value of Euro Disney shares to FFr5 from FFr10. Euro Disney said the broad lines of the agreement had been presented at the shareholders' meeting on March 14, but the company had since agreed 'a significant addition' to grant all shareholders - including Walt Disney - warrants valid for 10 years that allow them to buy Euro Disney shares at FFr40. The group said revenues for the six months to March 31 had declined to FFr1.572bn, compared with FFr1.794bn in the same period of fiscal 1993. In spite of this, the first-half operating loss narrowed to FFr1.048bn from FFr1.18bn, due largely to a 25 per cent reduction in general and administrative expenses and a reduction of lease payments resulting from lower interest rates. Net losses were reduced to FFr1.055bn in the first half of fiscal 1994 from FFr4.338bn, due largely to a change in accounting methods.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] U.S. Ambassador to Port-au-Prince William Lacy  Swing said he is sensitive to the concerns of President Aristide  who has rejected the plan proposed by Haitian parliamentarians  as a resolution to the crisis. Swing said that he is optimistic  about the chances of finding a solution to the crisis. He  mentioned four reasons that should favor a quick outcome to the  crisis: the context of change of political systems in the  hemisphere, the consensus of the four countries called Friends  of Haiti, the availability of massive economic aid, and the  Governors Island agreement.

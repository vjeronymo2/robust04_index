			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 retreats but bounces off 3,350 level - Market report A low-key trading session in London saw share prices come under further moderate bouts of selling pressure. They were weakened mostly by worries about international bond and equity markets but also by a large mixed programme trade carried out by one of the London market's biggest marketmaking firms. Dealers said the market was unsettled by worries about the failure of joint trade talks between Japan and the US, which had aimed at increasing US penetration of Japanese markets. Also, the FT-SE 100 future traded at a discount to the cash market for much of the day. Activity in London was also restricted by serious disruption to transport services in and out of the City, caused by bad weather, plus a general reluctance by fund managers to trade in size ahead of a deluge of economic data from the UK and abroad this week. At the close of a rather disappointing opening day to a new two-week trading account, the FT-SE 100 index settled 15.4 lower at 3,363.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem with its senior index, closing 19.4 off at 4010.6. Turnover levels were badly curtailed by the weather problems in Europe and North America. Only 626.5m shares changed hands yesterday, halting a sustained run of near 1bn share turnovers in UK equities. The day's business was said to have been among the lowest in the market so far this year. The value of customer business in the equity market last Friday reached Pounds 2.26bn, the highest in a two-week trading account which saw some of the heaviest customer business on record. There was no real downside pressure in London at the outset with dealers already primed to cope with the overnight weakness of the influential far eastern markets, where Tokyo dropped 2.7 per cent and the Hong Kong market 4.5 per cent. International bond markets opened on a steady note but began to lose ground as the day wore on, undermining sentiment throughout equity markets. The FT-SE 100 opened only marginally easier and briefly moved into positive territory, following good economic data on producer prices, before embarking on a decline which gathered pace throughout the early afternoon. What surprised the market was the weakness in the FT-SE 100 index in the face of a strong showing by Wall Street. The US market, which was a constant threat to European market stability last week, followed last Friday's good late rally with a strong opening performance which took the Dow Jones Average up almost 30 points during London trading hours. Dealers attributed London's weakness to a sizeable programme trade, thought to have been operated by Smith New Court, and said to have been weighted to the sell side. However, after testing the crucial 3,350 level, the FT-SE 100 stabilised and edged higher, helped by Wall Street, eventually halving its earlier fall. Strategists saw no real lead in the day's events, however. 'The simple message is that there are no real inflationary threats to the economy at the present moment, or for the next eighteen months,' said Mr Richard Jeffrey of stockbroker Charterhouse Tilney. Among a welter of economic details due this week, this morning brings industrial production numbers for December, while tomorrow sees January inflation, unemployment and average earnings figures.</p>

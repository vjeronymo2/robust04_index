			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- Slovakia would like to  hold an ongoing matter-of-fact dialogue with Hungary in peaceful  and level-headed atmosphere, new Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard  Kukan said on Slovak Television last night.    In response to recent statements by Hungarian Premier Peter  Boross that he considered himself the spiritual premier of even  those Hungarians living outside the state's borders, Kukan  pointed out that elections are looming in Hungary and all means  are being employed to win votes.    "I understand that to mean that he has in mind some kind of  spiritual leadership. As far as I know, in the same speech he  also said that Hungary respected its current borders. And from  our point of view, that is decisive," Kukan said.    The recently deposed government of Vladimir Meciar reacted  to  similar statements by Boross' deceased predecessor, Jozsef  Antall, with an anxiety that led it to challenge the loyalty of  the approximately 600,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia,  and to charge Hungarian leaders with irredentism, which  contributed to a worsening of relations between Budapest and  Bratislava.    "For the normal development of good neighborly relations  with  Hungary, inviolability of the border is the basic question from  which stems everything else," Kukan said, adding that this  question can be answered once and for all if Budapest displays  in its "willingness to discuss and to leave doors open" the same  accommodating spirit as Bratislava.    "If we can solve the question of the inviolability of the  border in a way that satisfies Slovak interests, our relations  with our Hungarian neighbors can develop normally," Kukan said.</p>

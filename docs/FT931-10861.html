			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Surprise move brings modest relief THE Bundesbank action was greeted with cautious relief in political and business circles in Germany yesterday. The move caught most observers by surprise, because the central bank was expected to wait for solid results from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's attempts to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' with trade unions, employers, the opposition Social Democrats and the 16 federal states, to settle future financing for east Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, who has made little secret of his desire to see an early interest rate cut to revive the ailing German economy, said the move would provide 'a positive impulse'. There was relief in the Chancellor's office, where pressure from France had been acutely felt. Mr Kohl's advisers had stressed the need to pay attention to the international as well as domestic consequences of high interest rates. However, Mr Wolfgang Roth, of the opposition SPD, said the action was just 'a faltering step in the right direction'. And the German federation of industry said lasting economic stimulus could hardly be expected from such a modest step, but a bigger interest rate reduction would not have been a responsible action.</p>

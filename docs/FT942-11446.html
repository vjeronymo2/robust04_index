			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop setbacks put cotton market in a spin - Prices have risen by more than 50 per cent to 3-year highs US cotton exporters and south-east Asian yarn-spinners are benefiting from sharp falls in production in China, Pakistan and India that have pushed up world prices for raw cotton by more than 50 per cent in the last five months. The Cotlook 'A' index, published by Cotton Outlook, the authoritative Liverpool-based trade publication, has risen by about 30 cents to 86 cents a pound since December, its highest level for nearly three years. At the same time the prompt position at New York's cotton futures market has risen from 62 cents to over 86 cents a pound. All three Asian producers, along with Turkey, have slapped export restrictions on cotton to protect their important domestic textile industries. The International Cotton Advisory Committee, a Washington-based association of exporting and importing nations, estimates the production decline will mean about 480,000 tonnes less cotton reaching the world market from those countries than expected. World trade in cotton is about 6m tonnes a year. Dr Terry Townsend, statistician to the ICAC secretariat, suggests that the US, notably Texas and Oklahoma, which grow coarse cotton like that produced in India and Pakistan, would enjoy a rise in exports of up to 150,000 tonnes, or 10 per cent. 'The US is the biggest exporting beneficiary, although Uzbekistan and other central Asian countries will benefit,' he says. The drop in Turkish exports will mean an extra 50,000 tonnes of the longer-fibre type produced in Turkey is likely to be exported by the US states of California and Arizona, along with Australia and countries in west Africa. Consumers will not feel the price rise because raw cotton accounts for a negligible part of the price of finished clothes, he says. But they may notice fewer items from China, India and Pakistan. 'The real beneficiaries are countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, whose yarn-spinning industries face less competition from yarn made in the main cotton-producing countries,' says Dr Townsend. The main Asian cotton producers are suffering meanwhile. The ICAC has predicted that the Pakistani cotton shortfall and its impact on the textile industry will reduce GDP by 2 per cent. The 1993-94 crop in Pakistan is nearly 40 per cent below expectations following a severe attack of leaf curl virus, which the ICAC fears could spread to northern India and central Asia in the next few years. Pakistan, hit by a second successive bad year, stopped all exports, including shipments of cotton for which contracts had been signed, in January. China and India, the world's largest and third largest producers respectively, have suffered attacks from the bollworm pest. Output in three key cotton provinces in north east China has dropped to about 1m tonnes from 3m tonnes two years ago. The shortages have brought many textile plants in China to a standstill. Avoiding an outright export ban, the government stopped issuing export licences in mid-January, and since then it has only allowed the shipment of some 4,000 tonnes of cotton for which contracts had been signed and letters of credit opened. However, Mr Mike Edwards of Cotton Outlook says the market's main preoccupation is with China's purchases abroad, which are just beginning. 'Depending on how large they are, that could send the market a little bit higher,' he predicts. The ICAC price model calculates that every 53,000 tonnes of additional cotton imported by China translates into a rise of 1 cent in the Cotlook index. In India, where output is down nearly 400,000 tonnes to 2m tonnes, sales and shipments were banned in January and February. But shipments registered for export by February 9 have since resumed. Turkey, whose crop was hit by poor weather, stopped all exports in January with a 40 per cent tax, although in March it relented by allowing cotton registered for sale to be shipped without the tax. Cotton accounts for 48 per cent of world fibre use, but the drop in production will push that share down slightly, to the advantage of wool and artificial fibres, says Dr Townsend. He adds, however, that at current prices, cotton production is likely to increase in the US, central and south America, Africa and Australia to make up the decline.</p>

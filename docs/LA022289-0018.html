			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX'S SLUMP COSTS PENGUINS  </P> <P> As Mario Lemieux's chances of breaking Wayne Gretzky's scoring records become  more remote, the struggles of the Pittsburgh Penguins increase.  </P> <P> Lemieux had only an assist Tuesday night at Pittsburgh and the Minnesota North  Stars ended a four-game losing streak, 2-1.  </P> <P> A victory would have put the Penguins back in first place in the Patrick  Division, which is having a sensational race. Instead, Wally Schreiber's goal  halfway through the last period, handed them their third consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> Lemieux's only point was a fluke. Early in the second period, from behind the  net, Lemieux's pass went in front to Jock Callander. Callander's shot caromed  off Minnesota defenseman Curt Giles into the net.  </P> <P> The fluke score gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead. The good luck of the Penguins  turned sour halfway through the period. Ville Siren of the Stars took a shot  from the point, it hit a Pittsburgh stick, bounced off the stick of Minnesota's  Dino Ciccarelli and went into the net for Ciccarelli's 31st goal and a 1-1 tie.  </P> <P> Schreiber's goal was no fluke. He directed, with his stick, a shot from the  point into the net past goalie Tom Barrasso. It was only his second in 18  games.  </P> <P> With 20 games left, Lemieux needs 30 goals and 59 points to tie Gretzky's  records. Three weeks ago, Lemieux was on a pace that would have wiped both  records out.  </P> <P> Lemieux usually gets a number of goals and assists on power plays. He is the  main reason the Penguins have more goals with a player advantage than anyone  else. Against goalie Kari Takko, the Penguins had five power-play opportunities  and didn't convert one. Takko had 37 saves, at least seven when his team was  short-handed.  </P> <P> Vancouver 2, St. Louis 0 -- The impressive goaltending of Kirk McLean continued  at Vancouver and the Canucks set a club record with their sixth victory in a  row.  </P> <P> McLean, in winning his fifth consecutive game, recorded his second shutout and  improved his record to 15-11-4.  </P> <P> Defensemen Larry Melnyk and Doug Lidster scored first-period goals and the rest  of the night the defense prevented the Blues from getting good shots on goal.  </P> <P> The winning streak has put the Canucks nine points ahead of Winnipeg in the  battle for the last playoff spot in the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> Detroit 6, New York Islanders 5 -- If the Red Wings do hang on and win the  Norris Division, it will be largely because Steve Yzerman is having a banner  season.  </P> <P> Yzerman scored two goals and assisted on another at Uniondale, N.Y., to lead  the Wings to a hard-earned victory that extended their lead to 11 points.  </P> <P> The goals gave Yzerman 55. He is tied with John Ogrodnick for the club record  in a season. He has 123 points, breaking Marcel Dionne's record of 121 set in  the 1974-75 season. With 28 games left, Yzerman is certain to extend the  records considerably.  </P> <P> Quebec 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Michel Goulet and Marc Fortier scored goals six minutes  apart in the second period at Quebec to bring the Nordiques from behind.  </P> <P> The Jets had won two in a row by coming from behind in the last period, but  this time, they couldn't get the puck past goalie Ron Tugnutt in the final 33  minutes.  </P> <P> Edmonton 7, Hartford 4 -- Mark Messier scored four goals at Edmonton as the  Oilers ended a three-game losing streak. The victory enabled the Oilers to pull  within three points of the Kings in the battle for second in the Smythe  Division. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

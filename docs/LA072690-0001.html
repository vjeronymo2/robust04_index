			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> BUSH EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS ON LATINO ISSUES  </P> <P> In wide-ranging comments to Latino reporters, President Bush voiced support for  Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, chided Fidel Castro as being "out of step"  and called on Congress to decide whether the employer sanction provision of the  1986 immigration law is causing widespread discrimination against Latinos.  </P> <P> Sixteen journalists were invited by the White House for the question-and-answer  session, one of a series of briefings with various groups of reporters.  Although Bush did not set forth substantially new policy positions, the session  provided a forum for the President to express his views on a variety of Latino  issues.  </P> <P> In an opening statement, Bush called education the foremost issue of "concern  to the Hispanic community" and referred to Cavazos' work in directing a  "massive study" on Latino educational issues.  </P> <P> Cavazos angered many Latinos earlier this year by putting the blame on parents  for many of the achievement problems of Latino students, including a  high-school dropout rate nearing 40%. In Los Angeles last month, where Cavazos  held the last in a series of hearings on Latino education, he was assailed by a  number of parents and educators.  </P> <P> Coming to Cavazos' defense, Bush said, "I've got great confidence in him. It  burns me up when I see shots fired at him." The President said the Cavazos  study will result in "key suggestions . . . that I'm sure will be turned around  into action."  </P> <P> Regarding Castro, Bush said the Cuban leader "should be celebrating, along with  other countries, the demise of the Berlin Wall." Instead, the President  continued: "Castro is criticizing Gorbachev for being not true to a Communist  revolution. He's out of step. He's swimming against the tide. He is a symbol,  the lone holdout of a Marxist totalitarianism that has failed all around the  world. And he ought to be better to his people than that."  </P> <P> Bush said that, if "Castro wants to say something constructive -- more  democracy, more freedom, more openness, more free press, more acceptance of a  change that is worldwide, fine, I'm listening. . . . But to say that, as some  have suggested, you ought to go down -- sit down and talk to Castro right now  and that will solve any problems, I don't see that at all."  </P> <P> Bush asserted that as long as the Soviet Union continues to provide a subsidy  to Cuba, "it will be very, very difficult for the United States to help the  Soviet Union with their enormous financial problems."  </P> <P> On immigration, Bush said he could not condone discriminatory employment  practices, but he declined to acknowledge that the employer sanctions in the  1986 immigration law are causing job problems for Latinos who are legally  entitled to work in the United States. And, he said, "I don't know about  repealing it."  </P> <P> Instead, he urged Congress to investigate and determine whether discrimination  practices are occurring. When a reporter pointed out that the General  Accounting Office, the investigatory arm of Congress, already had issued a  report citing prejudice against Latinos in employment, Bush said: "I haven't  read the GAO report and so I don't comment on things I haven't read."  </P> <P> Latino national organizations have lobbied strongly for repeal of employer  sanctions since the GAO issued its report last March 29. The GAO study found  that "widespread discrimination is practiced by an estimated 19% of employers  nationally and 29% of employers in the Los Angeles area."  </P> <P> The Latino groups argue that employers, rather than risk violating the law's  sanctions, sometimes avoid hiring anyone who looks or sounds foreign.  </P> <P> There has been little support, however, for repeal of the sanctions by  Congress.  </P> <P> During the 45-minute session, held in the Roosevelt Room, the President also  touched on other subjects. Here are excerpts of Bush's comments:  </P> <P> On the proposed referendum in Puerto Rico on the island's future status:  </P> <P> "I strongly support such a referendum. . . . I'm for statehood and I've said  so. I want to see a fair referendum to give the people their say. So I use this  statement right now as a strong assertion that I support Congressman (Robert  J.) Lagomarsino (R-Ojai) and others who are pushing for the kind of referendum  that you asked me about."  </P> <P> On a pending civil rights bill:  </P> <P> "I hope we're going to get a civil rights bill I can sign. I've tried to be out  front with some of the groups that have been lobbying, making clear to them  that I'm not going to sign a quota bill. Everyone says there's no quotas in  this bill, and then I say, well fine, let's state it; let's find ways to make  it clear. Quotas work, in my view, against all groups . . .  </P> <P> "As you know, I've made a commitment to use the bully pulpit, which is the  White House and the President's office, to speak out against racism and bigotry  and hate. . . . Of course, we've passed this Hate Crimes Bill that I hope is  going to be helpful."  </P> <P> On a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico:  </P> <P> "We support the FTA with Mexico. There are some problems out there. . . . I  think they can be overcome, and I think . . . a deal can be worked out that is  in the benefit of both our countries. Let me say that I'm impressed with  President (Carlos Salinas de Gortari's) approach to these problems."  </P> <P> On whether immigration would be affected by a free-trade agreement:  </P> <P> "Could be. Could be. But I don't know yet how that will link in. Labor is the  big question, you know . . . our labor unions have some strong concerns. But  the process is pretty arduous and we'll give every group a chance to be heard.  But we've got to look at the broad canvas . . . ameliorating the economy of  Mexico and not diminishing our economic interests."  </P> <P> On allegations that economic aid to help Andean countries fight drugs is being  tied to military action:  </P> <P> "We certainly have been trying to be helpful on the economic side, and I think  they've welcomed the economic support, and we've tried to be helpful on the  interdiction side. But nobody is trying to dictate to any sovereign country  what must be done in a military sense."  </P> <P> On making adjustments to the U.S. Census to make up for an expected undercount  of minorities:  </P> <P> "I don't know enough about that to have an opinion. I do know that every time  there's a census, some people allege that it's an unfair count. . . . I can't  say that the census is unfair because I don't think that -- I think the jury is  still out."  </P> <P> On the feeling by some Latinos in the Southwest that they are being neglected:  </P> <P> "Well, there are people that live in Washington, D.C., that think they're being  neglected, and (on) the West Coast that think they are. So what we've got to do  is have sensitive programs that benefit people and keep the unemployment  statistics going down so people have jobs. But I think you're absolutely right.  . . . But I don't know how you make it totally inclusive. We have 254 million  people here. I try my best. . . ."  </P></p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / GM loses fight over production General Motors, the US carmaker, must continue making cars in Finland until the end of 1996 at the plant of its former partner Valmet, the majority Finnish state-owned engineering group. The two companies have been locked in legal conflict since 1992 following GM Europe's decision to transfer production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt from December 1992. GM moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland. Valmet responded with a series of legal actions, which ended yesterday when GM was forced to accept a settlement, after it became clear that it was about to lose its case before an international tribunal in Paris. GM said that under the terms of the settlement all other outstanding legal disputes between the two groups had been dropped. The US carmaker has been forced to place 45 per cent of its planned production of the Calibra at the Finnish plant starting in the second quarter of this year and running to the end of 1996, when its original agreement with Valmet was due to expire. It must also pay compensation to Valmet for the 15 months from the end of 1992, during which output in Finland has been curtailed with the loss to Valmet of around 10,000 cars. The size of the damages was not disclosed. GM was forced by a German court order last year to resume small volume production in the second half of 1993 pending the outcome of the arbitration. The US carmaker said that it expected total Calibra output to reach about 27,000 this year, of which about 1,000 a month would be produced in Finland. Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM needed extra capacity in west Europe with record demand for new cars. Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said that the company would incur a cost penalty of DM4,000 - DM5,000 per car for the Calibras produced in Finland.</p>

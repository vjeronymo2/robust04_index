			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Philips sells defence arm stake PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has sold its remaining 20 per cent stake in Hollandse Signaalapparaten (HSA), the Dutch defence electronics manufacturer, to Thomson-CSF of France, which bought an 80 per cent stake in the company two years ago. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The price of the remaining 20 per cent stake was fixed by both companies when the original deal was struck in 1990. Philips said the transaction would not produce an extraordinary gain for its 1992 accounts because it had already booked the full value of HSA in the first quarter of 1990 on the assumption that it would later divest the rest of the subsidiary. In that quarter, the Dutch electronics group recorded total extraordinary gains of Fl 330m, including not only HSA but also the proceeds from divestments of the company's Belgian, French and German defence interests. HSA, based in the Dutch town of Hengelo, is a leading maker of military telecommunications equipment and claims to be the European market leader in naval command and control systems. It currently has an annual turnover of Fl 800m (Dollars 445m) and a workforce of 4,000. Two years ago, it generated sales of Fl 900m with a staff of 5,300. The sale of HSA completes Philips' full withdrawal from the European defence electronics sector. Its only remaining defence electronics subsidiary is Magiec of the US, which has an annual turnover equivalent to more than Fl 1bn. Despite several years of active searching, Philips has failed to find a buyer for Magiec.</p>

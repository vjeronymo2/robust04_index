			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Harald Watermann report: "Hintze, the Media, and the </F> Principles of the CDU"]    [Text] Hamburg -- Peter Hintze, general secretary of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], must have been deeply hurt:  Immediately after the assertion that only the Christian  Democrats can lead Germany into a safe future, he struck back at  the media at the CDU congress in Hamburg. Offended by numerous  press reports about his person and his ability as secretary  general, he sharply attacked the media -- "certain magazines  that invent primitive slogans, which spy on party friends and  colleagues, which write impertinent serialized stories and  provide corresponding slogans to the opposition." He told the  900 journalists who attended the party congress: "I hope you  contribute to making it possible for the political dispute and  the formation of public opinion to take place in a matter of  fact and unpolemical way."    Then he turned to the political opponent, the Social  Democratic Party [SPD]: He accused the party of avoiding the  discussion of topical issues with the CDU. The only thing the  SPD has offered in the past few months was obstructionism at all  levels.    The following sentences were balm for the 1,000 CDU  delegates: "We are winning support. Approval for our policy is  increasing. Numerous people, including those in the new laender,  are acknowledging what we have achieved." Then the CDU  secretary general presented the new basic program of the  CDU:     -  Society: "We want to continue to strengthen the  family. Those who educate children should pay fewer  taxes."    -  Unemployment: "Our reply to 4 million unemployed is:  Only a strong economy ensures jobs. We will expand the social  market economy and create new future-oriented jobs in this  way."    -  Social benefits: "We will restructure the welfare state.  We need new structures to ensure social justice and social  balance tomorrow."    -  Internal security: "We advocate the right of  the citizens to security. Concerning `electronic evidence,' we  would like to tell the Free Democratic Party of Germany: Nobody  in Germany supports a liberalism that facilitates the work of  dangerous criminals."    -  Europe: "We will make Europe strong.  Europe must never again be powerless in view of murder, rape,  and immense suffering."    -  Environment: "We will develop a global  environmental strategy that will offer the poor an opportunity  for development through their own strength. It remains our task  to preserve what God has created."    The deputy chairman of the CDU Bundestag group, Heiner  Geissler, noted a crisis of confidence in the CDU. In a speech,  which was received with prolonged applause, he stressed that  confidence and competence cannot be restored through "pride in  oneself" but only through arguments.</p>

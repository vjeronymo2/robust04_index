			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Observer: Absent friends Numerous notables joined 3m Turks in Ankara yesterday for the state funeral of President Turgut Ozal. The public figures included Shevardnadze of Georgia and Ter-Petrosian of Armenia - hardly Turkey's most popular neighbour at the moment. Also there were Greece's Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis and President Richard von Weizsacker of Germany. But the notables present were less noteworthy than the absence of certain western leaders. It was they who so much valued Ozal's support during the Gulf war, when he cut off Iraq's pipeline and made Turkish airfields available for US bombers, in defiance of most Turkish public opinion and indeed of his own military top brass. Where, oh where, were John Major, Francois Mitterrand and George Bush? Britain was represented by Baroness Chalker, and France by its new telecommunications minister, Gerard Longuet. Former US secretary of state Jim Baker did turn up, but the Clinton administration made do with Warren Christopher's deputy, Cliff Wharton. As for Bush, gee, he'd have just loved to be there, if he hadn't been too busy with his presidential library.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Business history for managers Sir, Arnold Kransdorff ('Teaching the history of business', May 1) suggested that putting business history on the school curriculum would encourage a 'cultural revolution' which would transform British business prospects. He did not explain how this would be achieved. The neglect of business history in Britain's management schools is far more important. Internationally comparative business history demonstrates there is no magic formula to ensure competitive advantage. Instead, it shows the need for flexibility in business and the importance of tailoring strategy and structure to accommodate the ever-changing characteristics of particular societies and markets. By allowing a dynamic analysis of strategy, the study of business history can provide a valuable extra dimension to management training. The teaching of business history in British management schools would generate a real gain for management education rather than the decidedly dubious benefit of a so-called 'business culture' in schools.

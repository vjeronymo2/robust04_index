			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Concerned by banking practice Sir, It is normal practice for a clearing bank to obtain a report from accountants before granting, or continuing, financing facilities for working capital to a company that is in, or emerging from, a period of financial difficulty. The accountants are instructed by the bank in terms agreed with the company, which undertakes to the bank to pay the accountants' fees for doing the work. This is unobjectionable. However, in such circumstances, certain clearing banks may also indicate to the accountants that, in the event of a situation developing in which the power to appoint a receiver is exercised by the bank (possibly following a decision not to grant or renew facilities in the light of the accountants' report) that firm of accountants will be appointed receivers. I think this practice is objectionable. My concern is heightened if the bank invites the accountants to discuss how they would proceed with a receivership while, to the knowledge of the bank, the directors are negotiating a transaction which might create a need for a further report by the accountants. My concern is heightened further if, when the directors are successful in their negotiations, the bank calls for a further report and the accountants, to the knowledge of the bank, refuse to put in writing an acknowledgment that they, in making their report to the bank, owe a duty of care to the company. Perhaps it would benefit the business community if this area was considered by the Bank of England and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.

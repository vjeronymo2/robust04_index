			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Dolores Oliveira in Buenos Aires] </F>   [Text] Argentine President Carlos Menem yesterday ordered a  "state of alert" among Argentine intelligence services in light  of the possibility of a subversive resurgence -- like the  uprising in Chiapas, Mexico -- in Southern Cone countries. The  president caught his main security assistants by surprise. They  attributed the initiative to Menem's "intuition." There were  rumors that everything began after closed door conversations  with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Paraguayan  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last  week. According to reports published in Buenos Aires by the  morning economic newspaper EL CRONISTA, Argentine officials who  accompanied Menem in Punta del Este detected a fear --  particularly among members of Wasmosy's entourage -- of  "hit-and-run forays" across Paraguayan and Bolivian borders by  -- as Paraguayan politicians put it -- "narcoterrorists at the  service of the Sao Paulo forum."  <H5>  The Sao Paulo Forum </H5>   The so-called Sao Paulo Forum was born in 1990 in the wake  of  a well-intentioned initiative by labor leader Luiz Inacio "Lula"  da Silva to unify the Latin American leftist sectors and to lead  them along the path of democracy, consensus, and government  experience.    The Forum has already held four subsequent meetings, in Sao  Paulo, Mexico, Managua, and Havana. Two irreconcilable  positions emerged from within the Forum at the latest meeting in  Havana. On the one hand, those who insisted on the political  course. Among them were the Uruguayan Broad Front; the  Brazilian labor movement; and Mexico's opposition PRD [Party of  the Democratic Revolution], led by political scientist Jorge  Castaneda -- the philosophical inspirer of this Latin American  leftist group. On the other hand, the hardliners refuse to give  up the armed struggle and who decided "to prepare for a  rebellion by the victims of the economic adjustment." This  happened just two months ago, in November 1993.    An intelligence report read a few hours ago by President  Menem suggests some irregularities that might include a  connection among the various attempts to begin subversive  activities in Argentine territory.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: First Pacific in talks on bank divestment First Pacific, the diversified Hong Kong group, is negotiating the divestment of at least 80 per cent of its wholly-owned Californian retail bank, United Savings Bank, to the Salim family, large shareholders in the company, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. 'The planned divestment of a majority interest in United Savings Bank will allow us to continue to re-allocate significant resources to Asia, and in particular to the group's telecommunications activities where investment requirements are substantial,' managing director Mr Manuel Pangilinan said.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICE IN MAINE  </P> <P> What a pleasure to read Elliott Almond and Valerie Ice's article on "Maine"  (March 12), in which Acadia National Park was discussed. Having lived on Mount  Desert Island for 10 years and authored two books on the park, it is fun to be  reminded of all the good times in one of my most favorite national parks.  </P> <P> However, there were a number of mistakes. Father Pierre Biard (not "Baird")  settled at Fernald Point in 1613. The landscape architect was Frederick Law  Olmsted (not "Fredrick Law Almstead"). There is no "Beaver Mountain"; perhaps  the authors meant Brewer Mountain, which is near Eagle Lake. The park is  southeast, rather than "east" of Bangor, and Ellsworth is northwest of Bar  Harbor, rather than "west." The town is Southwest Harbor, not "Southeast  Harbor." And the ZIP code for Bar Harbor, Me., is 04609, not 04347.  </P> <P> RUSSELL D. BUTCHER  </P> <P> National Parks  </P> <P> and Conservation Assn.  </P> <P> Cottonwood, Ariz.  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Brussels to probe service monopolies at airports THE European Commission is investigating complaints from Europe's leading airlines against monopolies providing ground-handling services at airports in Milan, Frankfurt and across Spain. The complaints, filed by Air France, Alitalia, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, SAS and Sabena, could induce Brussels to bring forward deregulation proposals for such services as airport baggage handling and refuelling, analogous to the legislation liberalising air transport introduced in the past six years. The airlines complain that at a time of unprecedented losses and growing competition as a result of the EC's 'open skies' policies, they are subject to high handling costs on the ground, at airports which operate monopolies. 'Liberalisation in the air should be followed by liberalisation on the ground,' a statement from KLM said yesterday. The European Commission would only confirm yesterday that it was investigating three complaints it had received in the last month. Industry sources said there had been more than a dozen complaints. KLM said that the Italian, German and Spanish airports cited in the EC action had attracted the most complaints from European airlines. But there were also other airports in Europe where competition in ground-handling was non-existent or extremely limited, a KLM spokesman said. He declined to name other airports but said he that if all European airports charged the same rates as Schiphol in Amsterdam, then KLM would save roughly Fl 25m (Pounds 8.7m) a year in ground-handling charges. These charges at airports where a monopoly is in force can be 50 per cent higher than at airports which allow a choice of services, the Dutch carrier said. In the cases of Frankfurt, Milan and the Spanish airports, KLM is allowed to have KLM personnel behind the check-in counters, but it is restricted in how it deploys its own staff. Ground-handling includes not only passenger check-in but also cargo handling and aircraft refuelling. A spokesman for the European Commission said Brussels expected a response to the complaints from the handling companies in the next three to four weeks. Officials refused to comment on the likelihood of any action to dilute the monopolies. But EC diplomats remarked that at a time when Brussels was enforcing competition on hard-pressed airlines, and cracking down on state aid to flag carriers, it would be hard for the Commission to resist their demands for more competition in ground services.</p>

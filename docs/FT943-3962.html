			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / France and China sign FFr16bn deals France and China have signed a series of commercial contracts worth FFr15.9bn (Pounds 1.94bn) during an official visit to Paris by Mr Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president. Mr Zemin's visit, which involved meetings with both Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist French president, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister, marked the culmination of a year of intense diplomatic effort by the French to bring about a rapprochement with China after Beijing protested at the French decision to sell jet fighters to Taiwan. The thaw between the two countries has heralded a wave of commercial initiatives between French companies and the Chinese authorities. Two of the largest contracts involve Elf Aquitaine, the recently privatised French oil group, which is the main investor in a FFr11bn refinery construction project in Shanghai and has concluded a crude oil trading agreement with Sinochem, the Chinese concern responsible for importing and exporting chemicals. Mr Zemin was met by Chinese dissidents and Tibetan protesters at both ends of a train journey from Paris to Bordeaux to visit a nuclear power station, AP reports. Police detained four protesters at the Montparnasse station in Paris, part of a group of two dozen, as they tried to unfurl a protest banner.</p>

Each practice shall have an established lifespan or minimum period of time that it is expected to function as a conservation practice with proper maintenance. If ASCS determines that a practice has not been properly maintained for the established lifespan, the participant receiving the cost-share assistance shall refund all or any part of such cost-share assistance as determined appropriate by the ASC COC. Further, any agreement providing for cost-share assistance will be terminated, with respect to the land on which the practice is located, if there is voluntary loss of control of the land by the participant receiving the cost-share assistance and the person acquiring control of such land elects not to become a successor in interest to the agreement. If the agreement providing for cost-share assistance is terminated as a result of the voluntary loss of control of the land, each participant receiving cost-share assistance under that agreement shall be liable for refunding to ASCS any cost-share assistance which has been received with respect to the practice. In addition, such person shall forfeit any right to receive any further cost-share assistance with respect to the land on which the practice is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.23  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Actions defeating purpose of program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the STC or COC determines that a participant has taken any action which tends to defeat the purposes of these programs, the participant may be required to refund all or part of any of these program payments otherwise due or paid that participant during the program year. These actions include, but are not limited to, failure to properly maintain or deliberately destroying a practice carried out under a prior program year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Depriving others of cost-share assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the STC or COC determines that any participant has employed any scheme or device to deprive any other person of cost-share assistance, the participant may be required to refund all or part of any of these program payments otherwise due or paid that person during the program year.

False information or a false claim includes, but is not limited to, a request for payment for a practice not carried out or for practices which do not meet the required specifications. Any amounts paid under these circumstances shall be refunded and any amounts otherwise due the participant shall be withheld. The withholding or refunding of cost shares will be in addition to any other penalty or liability otherwise imposed by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;701.26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Cost-share assistance not subject to claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any cost-share assistance or portion thereof due any participant shall be allowed without regard to questions of title under State law, and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government.

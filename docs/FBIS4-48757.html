			<p>BFN     [Text] Ventersdorp May 25 SAPA -- Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] leader  Eugene Terreblanche on Wednesday said his organisation would not  even consider meeting President Nelson Mandela until he gave  amnesty to all rightwingers in jail or awaiting trial. In a  statement, Mr Terreblanche reacted to Mr Mandela's remarks on a  joint Agenda/Newsline TV programme on Tuesday night that he  would meet Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg.  The talks would be a follow-up to last Friday's meeting with  the CP leader and one with Freedom Front leader Gen Constand  Viljoen. Mr Mandela said he wanted to meet rightwing leaders in  a bid to address fears of rightwingers, who have strongly  advocated setting up an independent Afrikaner homeland.    It has been confirmed Mr Mandela will meet Dr Hartzenberg at  his official residence Westbrooke about midday on Wednesday and  Gen Viljoen later in the day.    Mr Terreblanche's statement said the AWB wished to place on  record that it had not had any discussions whatsoever with the  African National Congress. "Further we have not given any  person, persons or body outside the AWB authority or mandate to  have discussions with any other person, party or body for and on  behalf of our organisation."    Mr Terreblanche said the AWB was not prepared to even  consider holding talks with the ruling African National Congress  unless "at the very least" the pre-condition of amnesty to all  rightwing political prisoners was met. This was the only  condition under which we would consider having talks, Mr  Terreblanche said.    Mr Mandela had said he wanted to start afresh, the AWB  leader  said, adding that therefore the slate had to be wiped completely  before any other options could be explored. "We wish to point  out that no government can oppress or banish the ideal of  freedom which burns in the hearts of our people. Unless the  above questions are addressed, our people will continue with  their struggle until they are free."</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira under heavy pressure RUMOURS swept through the markets yesterday, forcing at least two European central banks to intervene to support their currencies. With the New York markets closed and next week's summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations imminent, the day was ripe for speculation, and the lira bore the brunt. The trouble began in the morning. Rumours, ranging from a D-Mark revaluation this weekend - which would put pressure on the weaker European currencies - to Italian banks being ordered to stop trading lire, combined to put the Italian currency under heavy pressure. The Bank of Italy firmly denied that it had ordered Italian banks to stop quoting lira prices but as the currency dropped to 760.25 per D-Mark, two lira down on its mid-day fixing, it was forced to intervene twice during the afternoon. The plunge took the currency to within five lire of its floor against the D-Mark in the European Monetary System grid. The lira has been under pressure since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty at the start of June. Investors are afraid that Italy will not get its public accounts into order without the discipline of European economic convergence rules. But yesterday's run on the currency, coming only a day after Italy's new treasury minister said a stable lira was the centre of the government's economic policy, reflected just how nervous investors have become. The lira recovered some ground to trade at 759.20 to the D-Mark by mid-afternoon. It closed at 757.5 per D-Mark. The lira speculation added to nervousness about the peseta and the Bank of Spain announced that it too was intervening to support the currency. Worries about public spending being out of control have undermined Spanish markets in recent weeks. The pound did not escape the traumas. It moved in line with the weaker currencies, dragged down by the D-Mark's gain. The French franc held its own against the D-Mark. One other rumour doing the rounds was that sterling would join the narrow bands of the ERM this weekend accompanied by a cut in base rates. The UK currency fell quite heavily during the afternoon but bounced back to close at DM2.8950 against a previous close of DM2.9025. 'If there was any central bank support it was done very secretly,' said one dealer. There was one beneficiary of the turmoil - the dollar. 'The dollar simply drifted while attention focused on the weaker ERM currencies,' said Mr Michael Feeny, market analyst at Sumitomo Bank. The US currency edged a little higher in late trade, closing in London at DM1.5165 against a previous close of DM1.5135.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 2 SAPA -- The South African National  Defence Force [SANDF] is planning a service brigade to assist  the government's Reconstruction and Development programme,  newly-appointed SANDF chief Gen Georg Meiring said on Thursday  [2 June]. He was addressing a press conference at Defence Force  headquarters in Pretoria.    Outlining his vision of a Defence Force "out of the people  and for the people" Gen Meiring said recruits who did not make  the grade for admission into the Defence Force proper could  become members of the service brigade. They would acquire  skills in areas such as building houses and digging trenches as  part of the Defence Force's contribution to the Reconstruction  and Development Programme.    Gen Meiring said that in the past the Defence Force had  helped with drought relief and civil construction projects in  townships. He foresaw a similar role for the service brigade.    Replying to questions, Gen Meiring said the process of  integrating statutory and non-statutory armed forces into a  single Defence Force would take about three years.    He outlined a "colour blind" Defence Force in which the best  person for the job would get the job, regardless of his or her  colour. He said positions from the rank of lieutenant-general  upwards were filled by decision of the cabinet and he hoped  political pressure would not be brought to bear on these  appointments.    Over the next three years there would be bridging courses  for  soldiers with a background in non-statutory forces such as the  African National Congress' armed wing Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear  of the Nation], but these would not qualify them to hold high  rank in the SANDF. He said the SANDF would grow by about 30,000  members as personnel from other forces were taken in. Over a  three-year period, however, it would be trimmed back to the size  it is now.    About 10,000 volunteers would be drafted in 1995.    He said the defence budget had been scaled back by 47 per  cent since 1989 and had reached a point when it was not feasible  to cut it further. In fact, the defence budget would increase.    He did not see the SANDF playing a major role in African  peace- keeping efforts at this stage. Its first priority was  towards South Africa and its next priority was to work in  conjunction with the states of southern Africa.    On the integration of members of the Azanian Peoples  Liberation Army [APLA], Gen Meiring said no APLA members' names  appeared on the list agreed to in the constitution for inclusion  in the SANDF. However, APLA members could be accepted in their  individual capacities. They were not automatically members of  the SANDF.    He said the SANDF would continue with internal policing in  support of the South African Police Service. But this was not a  role it chose for itself and he hoped the political situation  had changed in such a way that the SANDF's presence on the East  Rand would not be necessary for much longer.    He said Defence Minister Joe Modise had a working team  studying the implications of a civilian ministry of defence.</p>

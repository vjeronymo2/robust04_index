			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's first ever visit to  Laos has laid the impetus for the development of two-way trade  and investment. The move will help Laos to integrate with the  world economy. To this end, a bilateral payments agreement has  been signed. The pact will facilitate increased two-way  economic and investment linkages. At the same time the  agreement reinforces the investment guarantee agreement signed  in 1992.    The visit is also significant for it demonstrates Malaysia's  commitment to the economic development of Laos in the context of  South-South cooperation. With this, more Malaysian investors  will be encouraged to invest in Laos.    Malaysia is not contented with enhancing only bilateral  links  with the Indochinese nation. It wants Laos to be an important  part of Southeast Asia, thereby positioning itself to contribute  significantly to ASEAN. To this end, Malaysia will do its  utmost best to facilitate its entry into the six-member  grouping. By being a member, it will be able to participate in  regional development projects. For example, the Growth Triangle  concept could be extended to this part of Southeast Asia. In  addition, ASEAN could emerge as a stronger grouping. This is  why Laos, along with other Indochinese countries, must strive  for economic development. Even more vital is that these  countries must resolve whatever problems they have in a peaceful  manner. They only know too well the destruction and untold  misery of war. It is a new era for ASEAN and Laos must be part  of this economic prosperity and the great need to preserve  understanding, the sentiment of goodwill and nurture cooperation  in view of the global changes and development.    Therefore, ASEAN has the ability to go forth in development  -- to be more effective with the full membership of ten  countries including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar  [Burma]. With this, Dr. Mahathir's visit to Laos is all the  more significant. Although Malaysians have gone into logging,  road construction, and hotel renovation, there is much potential  for expansion. Malaysia has lots to offer in terms of expertise  in areas such as mining, timber extraction, plantation  management, and downstream processing of agriculture and mineral  resources. Other areas include finance, engineering  consultancy, infrastructure, and tourism. Since Laos has given  priority to developing its energy needs, Malaysian companies  should look to exploiting this potential. It is important that  businessmen of both countries have greater contacts. For Laos,  it will help in transforming its national economy to one based  on market forces. Malaysians can gain in terms of new markets  as well as through reversed investments by taking advantage of  cheaper costs in Laos. The shortcomings and bottlenecks faced  in Laos indeed provide opportunities which can be exploited by  Malaysians.    Currently, Malaysia's investments in Laos is not  substantial.  But this could be a thing of the past if Laos' economic  potential is truly exploited for mutual benefit. In this way,  Malaysia would have done its part in assisting a fellow  Southeast Asian country in taking its rightful place as an  important part of the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam met at noon  today with the heads and members of the Arab press agencies'  delegations participating in the 21st conference of the General  Assembly of Arab News Agencies Union. [passage omitted]    Khaddam addressed the heads and members of the Arab News  Agencies delegations participating in this conference. He said:  It gives me pleasure to meet with some of the elite who work in  the Arab information field. I wish you an enjoyable stay in  Syria and I wish your conference success in attaining the  objectives for which it is meeting. [passage omitted]    Khaddam said: You know that the Arab nation faces serious  challenges against its present and past, not to mention its  future. These challenges revolve around the control of the land  and the will. The foremost of these challenges is the Zionist  challenge and the foreign designs against our countries. We  face these challenges under complicated international  circumstances as the world now lacks balance, objectivity, and  law, not to mention the state of division and fragmentation the  Arabs are suffering, and the stagnant Arab unity movement and  the activities it should have inspired that would have been  employed in tackling these challenges. If the Zionist challenge  now is the same as it was years ago, it remains the most serious  challenge in the future because the Zionist movement has an  ideology and a strategy based on the establishment of a major  power in this region. The political borders of this state, as  we know, will not be within the boundaries of its present  aggression. Its economic borders will target Arab resources  while its strategic borders will extend to Iran, Pakistan, and  others.    The domestic challenge, as I have mentioned, is the Arab  state of affairs in itself. All joint pan-Arab values have  vanished, replaced by concepts that have nothing to do with  pan-Arab interests. Arab relations became unbalanced and the  use of force or the threat of using it within the framework of  these relations has become a manifestation that has contributed  to the uncomfortable state of affairs we are now experiencing.    Some of those who have been overpowered by their countries'  interests believe that the conflicts they wage serve their  people. They do not realize that these conflicts have taken  place at the expense of their people and not in their interest,  and that these conflicts have taken place in the service of  foreign powers and not in their service. Thus, we found  pan-Arab unity threatened and we experienced a harsh campaign  waged from outside and assisted from within the Arab homeland  threatening the national unity of several Arab countries.  [passage omitted]    The vice president said: If we review the current  circumstances, we realize the role the foreign media has played  in the service of Israel. Before the conclusion of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, there was no one in the West, or among  those on its bandwagon, ready to offer any assistance or to  seriously work to stop the Israeli pressure against the  Palestinian intifadah. Suddenly, after its conclusion, we all  saw the media theatrics with which some of the Palestinian  leaders have been welcomed in some countries that used to ban  their entrance. The media portrayed the incident as if was a  historical transformation, and encouraged some to have  illusions. This, undoubtedly, has greatly served Israel.  [passage omitted]    The vice president said: We always talk about the Arab  situation, which pains and embitters every Arab citizen. There  is no doubt that unless matters are restored to their natural  situation and unless everybody understands that his fate is  linked with that of the nation, the Arab situation will remain  complicated and painful for every one. Due to our status as a  confrontation state and to our historical circumstances, we in  Syria fully understand that the restoration of the Arab spirit  to Arab relations has become necessary and fateful.    There is no doubt that searching for solutions and creating  suitable joint Arab action to serve the nation's interests and  its progress should be the responsibility of every one at this  current stage.    When waging the battle of peace, which is like a battle in a  real war, the fighter will be in a stronger position if his  nation is unified and enjoys solidarity. Similarly, the worker  in a time of peace will enjoy a stronger position in defending  the nation's rights if that nation is unified and enjoys  solidarity.    We have been calling for a just and comprehensive peace  since  the beginning of the seventies, and that the issue of peace has  been a principal part of our strategy. We mean by peace a peace  that will enable us to regain all our territories and the  Palestinian Arab people's national rights.    Then came the U.S. initiative, which we accepted after  lengthy discussions that led to basic amendments to that  initiative, foremost of which are the need for a comprehensive  solution on all fronts and insistence on implementing UN  resolutions. We went to Madrid, eager to see coordinated Arab  action among the Arab parties involved in the process and also  to see other parties that are not directly involved in constant  touch because the conflict has a pan-Arab, rather than, regional  nature.    All the Arab summits' resolutions have asserted that all  solutions should be Arab ones. In light of this concept, we  worked and went to the Washington talks, and many attempts were  made to reach a solution with Syria on the occupied Syrian  territories. We rejected these because we believed in the  pan-Arabism of the conflict, and consequently, in the need for a  comprehensive solution, because unilateral solutions cannot  produce peace and stability in the region. [passage omitted]    Then contacts were held, and it was agreed to hold a meeting  between President al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Geneva this month. The vice president added: Our position will  remain clear. Peace should lead to the implementation of the  Security Council's resolutions and to a total withdrawal from  the occupied territories. We hope that the meeting will produce  positive results. He said: We tried to maintain a unified Arab  effort during the peace process, but regrettably, multilateral  meetings were held. We believe that such meetings should not  discuss issues pertaining to peace before discussing the issue  of peace and withdrawal.    He said: You notice brothers that after the signing of the  agreement between the PLO and the Israelis, the Israelis tried  to make it look as if peace had been realized in the region.  They started to demand the lifting of the Arab boycott, and the  establishment of relations between Israel and the Arab states.  Regrettably, some Western circles adopted this position without  taking into consideration that the reason for the Arab boycott  was Israel's aggression against the Arabs, its occupation of  their lands, and the displacement of millions of Palestinians.  The reasons for the boycott still stand. Undoubtedly, the  position on this issue has been good, and all attempts to draw  the Arab countries into canceling the boycott failed. [passage  omitted]    Khaddam addressed the conference and said: I sincerely say  to you that had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone to  the peace negotiations. It is true that there is a vast  military imbalance, but there is also a great imbalance in other  issues that are in the Arab favor and are no less important than  military power. Had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone  to Madrid or Washington because negotiations with the weak or  the one who is viewed as weak are sure to be at his expense and  at the expense of his land.    He said: We feel that our capabilities and those of the  Arabs are not small. These capabilities enable us to feel  strong. He pointed out that the time when the Israelis used to  carry out operations that made the people feel defeat is no  longer. [passage omitted]    He emphasized: There will never be a peace that is not  honorable and that does not guarantee our full rights. The  peace we want is the one with which we and our future  generations will be proud, no matter how bad or complicated the  circumstances become. For us, an inch of land represents the  dignity, honor, and future of the country. Nevertheless, had  the Arab situation been normal, our capabilities to realize  gains would have been much better, and this would have been in  the interest of all parties.    Khaddam then answered questions of the conference members.</p>

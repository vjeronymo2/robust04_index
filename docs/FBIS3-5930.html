			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shozo Azuma, parliamentary vice minister of </F> foreign affairs, by unidentified GAIKO FORUM editorial staff  member on 1 February; place not given: "How Were Russia's  Parliamentary Elections Conducted?"]    [Text]International Election Monitoring Was  Effective    [GAIKO FORUM] To begin with, please give me the background  of  why the monitoring teams were sent to observe the elections and  how Japan dealt with this?    [Azuma] The recent parliamentary elections were the first of  their kind carried out in a democratic fashion for a newborn  Russia, and I understand that this was an important milestone  for Russia to become a true democracy. With this realization,  and to support Russia's democratization, Japan decided to send  monitoring teams there. To put it concretely, President Boris  Yeltsin, when he visited Japan last October, personally  requested that a monitoring team be dispatched, and Prime  Minister Hosokawa expressed a willingness to actively cooperate  on the matter.    Thus, it was decided that Japan would send a government  monitoring team, and I was appointed an ambassador extraordinary  to head the team. Members of the team included the Home Affairs  Ministry, local public and private organizations, as well as the  central government and an advisory team of Diet members. My  team monitored Moscow, and another detachment was sent to  Khabarovsk. In addition to sending monitoring teams, Japan  provided supplementary assistance by making grants of  communications equipment and the like.    [GAIKO FORUM] I consider the Russians to be a proud people,  but despite this they asked for monitoring teams to be sent.  How do you interpret this request? Did they intend to improve  Russia's image, or did this reflect an apprehension about the  election behavior of the Russian people?    [Azuma] They might have considered that order would be  maintained by having international election monitoring teams.  The important things, however, were to let the world as well as  their own people know that the recent elections were conducted  in a free and fair atmosphere and that the international  election monitoring teams served their purpose in very effective  way.  <H5>  Elections in a Peaceful, Harmonious Atmosphere </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] Compared to Japan's elections, what impression  did you get of Russia's election campaigns and the response of  its voters?    [Azuma] Because it was Russia's first democratic election  and  because the campaigning period was short, they were entirely  different from Japan's. Unlike in Japan, there were no campaign  loudspeaker vehicles on the streets. Door-to-door campaigns  were permitted, but little such campaigning was done because the  campaigning period was so short. Few wayside speeches were  noticed. We saw only Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal  Democratic Party doing this. In the election campaigns,  television played an especially vital role, in my opinion. In  Japanese polling stations, we find a solemn atmosphere, in the  sense that secret balloting has to be guaranteed, but it was  peaceful and harmonious in Russia. Husbands and wives were seen  entering the same voting booth together, or voters were seen  filling out ballots while talking with other voters without  bothering to enter the booths. If you witnessed only such  scenes, you would conclude that secret voting was not attained,  but they insisted that they were discussing only how to fill out  the ballots. Certainly, it did not come to our attention,  within the scope of our monitoring, that somebody induced others  to vote for specific candidates or parties. To strictly  safeguard secret balloting, however, it might be necessary to  increase the number of voting booths so that filling out ballots  in booths can be thoroughly enforced.    Although it was not actually observed to have happened,  there  were problems of preventing one voter from voting many times.  According to the system, anybody who was not in their voting  district on election day because they were on official trips  could cast their ballots where they presented themselves by only  showing their passports or identification cards. So, logically,  it was possible for a voter to vote multiple times by going to  other voting districts and showing their identification cards.  To eliminate such a danger of multiple voting, I think that the  current absentee ballot system must be amended. Somewhere in  Africa, they put a mark which is indelible for a certain length  of time on the voter's hand, to make the absentee voting system  foolproof. That sort of method might become necessary. Also,  there was room for improvement in the system of placing  inspectors.  <H5>  Whether People Can Follow Reforms or Not </H5>   [GAIKO FORUM] The outcome of the elections shocked the world  with the emergence of such an extreme nationalist as Mr.  Zhirinovskiy. What is your thought on this?    [Azuma] Although the elections were conducted smoothly, they  did not turn out as the reformist camp anticipated.    [GAIKO FORUM] Was it that the people were perplexed by the  abrupt reforms?    [Azuma] As for the trend in the direction of democratization  and a market economy, the multitude of the Russian people are  presumed to understand this. A lady who came to vote said, "I  cannot see what they are actually going to offer to better our  lives, although they keep bragging about reforms." This kind of  discontent drifted toward the ultrarightists, I suppose. I  heard many people say that they did not bother to vote because  the reformers were absolutely destined for victory.    [GAIKO FORUM] China is, in a manner different from that of  Russia, proceeding with an open economic system while  maintaining its dictatorial system. On the contrary, Russia  gave priority to political reform before economic reform.  However, the market economy is not functioning well, and crime  seems to be on the increase. What do you think about these  things?    [Azuma] If measures had been taken to permit the people to  understand the contents of the reforms while carrying out  radical changes, confusion and discontent could have been  mitigated.    It could well be an issue of the end of the 20th century  that  rationality and human pride are lost because greed overcomes  them, while human nature is neglected by pursuing rationality.  Now the wisdom is needed to harmonize them. In the case of  China, it is proceeding with gradualism, and it is thought that  if the test cases along the coastal areas prove to be  successful, they may be applied to the nation as a whole. In  Russia, there are, in a sense, many people with a West European  way of thinking. So, it can be rationally proposed that there  is a concept first and that it is followed by methods to achieve  the objectives based on that concept. But the question is  whether the people can follow it, whether to proceed after the  people are fully informed about it, and whether to proceed with  their full consent or rather with the full authority entrusted  to the elites. I believe that social confusion was brought  about by the people who want to take part in a good idea without  their having come to grips with that idea.  <H3>  Future Japanese-Russian Relations in a Turbulent World  Community </H3>   [GAIKO FORUM] What should the future assistance to Russia  from Japan and the West be like?    [Azuma] Russia is going ahead with democratization and  economic reforms, and it wants assistance from the international  community because it cannot help itself. A new parliament came  into being as a result of the recent elections. Within it are  unexpected political parties embracing factors of instability  concerning the course of reforms, in a sense. But, as a general  direction of the course being followed, President Yeltsin and  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are steadfastly continuing in  the direction of reforms. At this stage, it should not be  considered that the basis for assistance has ended. If Russia  is thrown into confusion as the result of a lack of assistance,  it will pose an unstable factor for the whole world, as well as  the Russian region. A Russia which evolves into a democracy and  which follows the way to economic reforms is directly connected  with the stability and prosperity of the world. And that is the  precondition for assistance.    [GAIKO FORUM] A sense of menace from Russia/the Soviet Union  remains in the heart of Japanese. Now that the Soviet Union is  gone, what do you see as the future of Japanese-Russian  relations?    [Azuma] Military power was an important nucleus of the  post-World War II Cold War structure. But, after that structure  has collapsed, it should not be attempted to maintain that order  by possessing military power. The key to becoming a great power  rests on economic power, and I think that understanding between  the leaders who guide the economy and the people is what is  being sought after the collapse of the Cold War structure. It  may take a considerable amount of time before that becomes  tangible. An extremely important factor in pursuing the  post-Cold War new international order is to deepen  Japanese-Russian relations in a broad sense rather than the  up-to-the-present Japanese-Russian relations in a narrow sense.    In the case of Japan, the collapse of the 1955 order was a  domestic affair, without the international trend having been  part of the recipe. Meantime, what is happening in the world is  the decisionmaking of a nation which directly feels the  turbulence of the international community and which is compelled  to respond to the changes in the world. If not viewed from such  a perspective, the movement of Russia will become  incomprehensible. I do not deny the importance of Japan's  dealing with what it should do concerning Japanese-Russian  relations, but I think we have come to the point where  Japanese-Russian relations must be considered once again in the  post-Cold War framework in which these relations are managed  with the turbulence of the international community being kept in  mind. However, nobody seems to have the answer yet, I think.    [GAIKO FORUM] Quite a bit of assistance is being provided to  Siberia by nongovernmental organizations, and in that sense the  recent sending of election-monitoring teams can be categorized  as one such step for Russia.    [Azuma] That is right.    [GAIKO FORUM] After your return, what is your main point in  discussing your experiences there?    [Azuma] Russia's election system is a single-member  constituency within the proportional-representation system. Two  hundred and twenty-five members each are elected by both systems  to fill the 450-seat parliament. If the reformist camps do not  cooperate between themselves and wage independent election  campaigns, they will suffer defeats in unexpected areas. I said  this to the prime minister, and he said that it is quite  enlightening. (laughter)    [GAIKO FORUM] Japan is not only teaching but also has  something to learn.    [Azuma] I have not quite comprehended why Russia chose such  a  system. However, Japan is going to adopt the same type because  of the recent passage of the political reform bills. It gives  quite a hint.    [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.</p>

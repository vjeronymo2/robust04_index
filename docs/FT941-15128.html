			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The poor performance of gilts so far this year might have convinced the Bank of England not to hold a gilts auction in January. That it has chosen to do so after all comes as something of a relief. It means the authorities have enough confidence in the market to get a sale away. The 15-year maturity range is also one which should meet reasonable demand from domestic investors anxious to buy longer-dated paper which has been in short supply. With sterling already strong and international markets wobbly, this is probably not a time to rely too heavily on foreign money. These arguments, though, would have pointed to an even longer-dated issue of 25 or 30 years. That the Bank chose to stick to a 15-year maturity underlines a different dilemma. Rightly or wrongly, the market perceives it has chosen not to borrow over 25 years at rates around 6.6 per cent because that would undermine the credibility of its anti-inflation policy. Were it to do so, the market would assume it had decided long yields had reached their trough. That in turn could spark a nasty sell-off. Somehow the Bank needs to find a way of getting itself off this hook. Funding pressures are lower than they were a year ago, but they are still considerable. It does not help if the Bank limits its scope to borrow across the entire yield curve. Nor is it good for the market to be deprived of liquidity at the long end. Perhaps the Bank should start by issuing an ultra-long tap after the auction to get investors used to the idea again. If it insists on waiting, it is bound to miss the boat.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Scottish banking group rescued AN emergency rescue of a small Scottish private banking group, Adam &amp; Company, has been organised over the past three weeks after it lost Pounds 21m on foreign currency futures. The losses were made by the three employees of Adam's London treasury dealing department, which trades in foreign currency and short-term securities. All three have been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation by a firm of accountants, Price Waterhouse. Mr James Laurenson, Adam's managing director, said the dealings had been 'unauthorised'. He said the treasury team began to make the loss-making deals in April, but that senior management only became aware of them three weeks ago. He said the deals came to light because losses on them had become so big that 'they could not be hidden'. All the dealing positions have now been closed. However, the bank's capital - which was Pounds 7.1m at the end of June - was wiped out by the losses. But the bank has been able to keep trading because it has persuaded one of its shareholders to inject Pounds 21m of new capital into it. The shareholder, which is buying Pounds 21m of new preference shares in Adam's banking subsidiary, has asked for its identity to remain secret. The preference shares pay no coupon for 10 years. Mr Laurenson said the bank was 'incredibly' fortunate to have such a supportive shareholder. He believes the bank has emerged stronger than before, because of the terms of the injection and because of support by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has provided committed credit lines to the bank. Adam's biggest shareholders include the wealthy Schlumberger family and also Standard Life, the Scottish insurance company. It is understood neither made the capital injection. Adam disclosed yesterday it had incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5m in the year to June 30, compared with a profit in the previous year of Pounds 869,000. The results included Pounds 6.58m of the Pounds 21m foreign currency loss. Adam believes only Pounds 6.58m had in fact been incurred by June 30. Mr Laurenson said that without the foreign currency loss 'profits would have almost doubled'.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / UN mission in Guatemala A United Nations mission to monitor respect for human rights in Guatemala will begin operating today amid a climate of social instability and soaring levels of abuses. The mission of some 300 observers is fruit of an agreement signed in March between the government and left-wing guerrillas, which both sides have since frequently violated. Its mandate is to support the authorities in investigating human rights abuses and to make recommendations on how existing institutions can be improved. But it faces a judicial system where judges are frequently bribed or threatened and a police force which is poorly paid, badly trained, routinely corrupt and with little investigative capacity. The mission will also need the co-operation of the powerful army, which has jealously guarded its independence and virtual de facto immunity from prosecution.</p>

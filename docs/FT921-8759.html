			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Sisters who aim to collar a mail market in shirts - Two women who work successfully from home SO YOU want to work from home? Perhaps you have young children to watch over? You do not want to slave away over a 50-hour week, but you do want a business that makes money. Back in 1986, Lexi Douglas and Henrietta Nettlefold embarked on a route that an increasing number of budding entrepreneurs are now taking in the hope of having their cake and eating it. The mail order business in women's shirts run by the two sisters now has a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000 and is making a healthy return on turnover of just over 19 per cent. Last year, the pair also bought the small, family-owned garment-maker in Folkestone, Kent, which supplies all the shirts for their company, Sparklers, as well as a range of other clothing on contract. It cost them between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000 but has yearly sales of Pounds 120,000 on which it makes a return of more than 10 per cent. 'We love the business, even if it can be nerve-wracking at times,' says Douglas. 'It's nice when we have a new brochure out, the telephone is ringing, the mail is coming in and people are buying shirts in the fabrics we chose. Of course, when you have between you six children, two ponies, chickens and dogs, who needs a factory? But we are absolutely glad that we bought it.' Both women recognise that the injection of household income from spouses removes much of the pressure when new businesses are started. Douglas is married to opera singer Nigel Douglas, and Nettlefold to an investment banker. Starting with capital of just Pounds 3,000, the sisters looked first for fabric suppliers. They used information supplied by the Cotton Institute and attended suppliers' fairs, including Fabrex at London's Olympia. For the first two years they bought just British fabrics, but now more than half comes from abroad, mainly Austria, France and Germany. 'Small British mills tend to be very traditional with their patterns,' says Nettlefold. 'There is not enough variation in fabrics from them and some are prone to delays with deliveries.' In its first year, Sparklers, using the Folkestone garment-maker to supply shirts in designs provided mainly by the two women, managed a turnover of Pounds 48,500 on which it made a pre-tax return of Pounds 12,000. Its sales last year were Pounds 320,000, although with a fall in return. The mailing list has grown to 30,000 through word of mouth, advertising in the national press and Good Housekeeping magazine (every month), charity sales and stands at sporting events. Sparklers' sales pitch is that it sells shirts designed for women but in best-quality men's shirting material rather than the usual non-breathing, synthetic fabric offered by most women's blouse-makers. The company uses two-fold cotton at Pounds 4 a metre rather than Pounds 1.50 for cheaper material, and mixes of cotton and wool. Most of the shirts, in five basic patterns with nine fabrics, retail at between Pounds 31 and Pounds 36. The business is run from the Douglas's seven-bedroom, 18th-century home near Dover and from Nettlefold's house in London. Other than the tiny garment 'factory' - which is a separate company - they have no business premises. The only staff member is a woman who works in the Douglas house despatching order forms and shirts. 'I would say we work on average about three and a half days a week,' says Douglas. Selling about 10,000 shirts a year, Sparklers produces a new brochure, with fabric swatches, twice a year for winter and summer and changes most of the fabrics every 12 months. Each brochure costs about 45p to produce and 18,000 or so are mailed every six months. The biggest headache has been financing fabric purchases and manufacturing costs. This can involve a layout twice a year of about Pounds 30,000 for the fabrics alone, although suppliers give 60 days credit. It takes just over eight weeks from fabric delivery to producing enough shirts for mail orders to be taken. One shirt usually requires about two metres of material. 'It is worrying when you've got Pounds 50,000 worth of shirts on your hands and you are wondering if anyone is going to buy them,' Douglas says. 'We make about 2,500 shirts prior to mailing - and that is before we have a clear impression of which colours and styles are really going to sell.' This pressure is compounded by Sparklers' policy of despatching shirts to customers the day it receives an order. Most of the company's profits have been ploughed back, says Douglas, so its healthy bank balance now covers the cost of laying-in fabric. It has also coped with the odd howler. 'I have to say that we have had some amazingly unsuccessful shirts, some real lulus,' she admits. Telephone sales account for a fifth of turnover, as do sales at charity functions - Sparklers pays a table fee and 10 to 15 per cent of its takings during the day to that charity. From her home, Douglas despatches up to 100 shirts a day, taken in bundles to the local village post office. Costs are covered by a Pounds 1 post and packaging fee. Each of the women takes out between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 in salaries. But the recession has reduced growth to a standstill and lowered the 'conversion rate' of sales from mail shots from an exceptionally bounteous 21 per cent to 13 per cent - although that still is good. The 2,500 sq ft factory the sisters bought last year had been teetering on the edge of closure. The previous owner is now its manager, overseeing six machinists earning between Pounds 3 and Pounds 4 an hour and 10 out-workers. The sisters seem determined to expand their mail-order business and are considering, for the first time, buying some mailing lists. The thought of selling Sparklers when it has been built-up a little further has also crossed their minds. Douglas knows that mail order is growing and that up-market products increasingly are filling the pages of catalogues and brochures. She also knows she might face more competitors but says she is not worried. 'I think the growth of mail order is a good thing because it is changing buying habits,' Douglas adds. 'I think a lot of people are getting fed up with shopping.' Sparklers Shirts, Eythorne House, Eythorne, near Dover, Kent CT15 4BE. Tel. 0304-830-424.</p>

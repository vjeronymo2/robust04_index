			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Weapon imports 'source of instability' TURKEY and Greece have become two of the largest importers of big weapons systems in the last two years, providing another potential source of instability in the Balkan region, a study claims today. The research, by the British American Security Information Council, an independent think tank, says Greece received more weapons systems in 1992 than almost any other country in the world, spending some Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.23bn) on arms, while Turkey spent Dollars 1.5bn on similar purchases. Turkish and Greek officials yesterday denied the figures. However, western military officials confirmed that both countries had been involved in a large build-up in recent years, fuelled by donations of second-hand weapons from other Nato countries. One Nato official said: 'The figures seem surprising, but there is no doubt that the transfer of equipment has been the largest in the region.' In spite of fears that a conflict in the former Yugoslav regions of Macedonia or Kosova could embroil Greece and Turkey, diplomats cite tensions between Greece and Turkey are the main reason for the build-up.</p>

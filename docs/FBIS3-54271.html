What issues have you discussed  with officials in London, and what are the aims of your visit to  the United States, which begins tomorrow?    [Al Khalifah] Actually my current visit to London is a  regular working visit organized between us and the British  Defense Ministry. The meetings held yesterday, Monday, with  Jonathan Aitken, minister of state for defense procurements, and  then Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind are regular meetings  which occur once a year in Bahrain or in London.    And as I said, these are regular visits and meetings which  do  not lead to "military deals," as you journalists like to portray  them. Even if they do lead to deals and agreements, we military  officials are known for saying little.    ['Alam-al-Din] So what can be said about the results of the  meetings held yesterday?    [Al Khalifah] A memorandum of understanding was signed  yesterday between us and them to organize joint exercises and  cooperation in the exchange of military personnel between the  two states.    ['Alam-al-Din] Does your visit to the United States tomorrow  (today) fall within the same framework as your visit to Britain?    [Al Khalifah] The visit to the United States is similar to  the visit to Britain. It is aimed at organizing joint  cooperation between the United States and Bahrain.    ['Alam-al-Din] Can Bahrain's cooperation with the United  States and Britain be put in a single framework?    [Al Khalifah] Our cooperation with Britain is older.  However, our dealings with the two states are conducted on the  same level. They are two major states and each has its  influential role in the security of the region, the Gulf region.    ['Alam-al-Din] How would you assess the results of the Gulf  Cooperation Council [GCC] summit held in Riyadh last month with  regard to Gulf security?    [Al Khalifah] The summit and its results were a success at  the military level, as the leaders endorsed all the defense  ministers' recommendations without any omissions, amendments, or  reservations--proof of complete success.    ['Alam-al-Din] What stage has been reached in the plan to  build and develop the "Peninsula Shield Force"?    [Al Khalifah] There is a reorganization process under way to  reinforce the Peninsula Shield Force on the basis of the  recommendations I mentioned.    ['Alam-al-Din] Some people are calling for a limit to the  Gulf states' spending on armament, saying that the weapons they  are buying exceed their capability. What is your opinion?    [Al Khalifah] I can talk about the State of Bahrain in  detail and about my brothers in the GCC states generally and say  that we are newly independent states, and it is obviously a  national duty to build up our armed forces. Every citizen  should participate in performing this duty in order to defend  the homeland. And any efforts made in that direction -- in an  organized manner -- are bound to to lead to the desired results.    I do not believe that the Gulf states are arming themselves  beyond their security needs. On the contrary, they need every  item of armament purchased in order to confront the dangers  surrounding them, which far exceed their armament programs.    ['Alam-al-Din] How do you view the situation of the  Bahrain Armed Forces? And are you satisfied with their position?    [Al Khalifah] Defense in Bahrain -- under the supervision of  their highnesses the head of state, the heir apparent, and the  prime minister -- has the lion's share in the modest general  budget.    And praise be to God, we have -- with our own capabilities  and the help of our brothers in the GCC states -- achieved the  basic structure with regard to the establishment of Bahrain's  defense force in terms of the three corps: ground forces, air  force, and navy. That is, in a manner sufficient to defend  Bahrain against any threat.    There is a need for further capabilities whose achievement I  am discussing with the British and U.S. Governments.    ['Alam-al-Din] When will the Gulf possess a joint military  force capable of repulsing any foreign aggression against any  GCC state, even at the initial stage of this aggression?    [Al Khalifah] Some people always say that the work of the  GCC defense ministers is characterized by slowness. To this we  can respond that, if we study NATO's history, we will find that  it took its defense ministers decades to assemble and unite its  forces after World War II. And there are European states which  still have not joined NATO. And there are states which have  joined it in a semiofficial way, like France, which is not a  proper member, even though it has to fulfill certain NATO  commitments for geopolitical reasons.    Thus I believe that the steps we have taken with regard to  building systems, laws, and military arrangements in the Gulf  are effective and fundamental. So it can be said that all this  will lead to the uniting of the military forces. And the  Peninsula Shield Force is the basic nucleus for joint and  unified military cooperation.    ['Alam-al-Din] Some people in the West expect World War III  to break out in the Gulf region within the next five years. Do  you believe this expectation to be correct, and, if so, how can  it be tackled?    [Al Khalifah] That saying proves that preparedness for war  is the best means to prevent the breakout of war. This is  because any enemy who sees that the person he is planning to  attack is preparing to defend himself is bound to reexamine his  calculations, and vice versa.    We hope that the page of wars will be turned, that peace  will  prevail, and that the peoples will enjoy stability. What we  have suffered from the two recent wars is enough.    ['Alam-al-Din] Why has talk about the establishment of an  Arab military industry stopped?    [Al Khalifah] Maybe money and material capabilities are the  first reason for the faltering of military industrialization in  some Arab states, such as Egypt.    As for the GCC states, there is still interest in military  industrialization, and the issue is on the negotiating table.  There is a nucleus for military industrialization in the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia. It will develop with the passage of time.    ['Alam-al-Din] How is peace expected to affect regional  security in the Middle East?    [Al Khalifah] As is known, Israel is a state which is not  comfortable under peace, by virtue of its political structure  and as a group of individuals gathered in our region from  various parts of the world. This is why they want to continue  the occupation atmosphere in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and  Jordan and at the same time to seize the economic initiative  from us and to invade our countries economically just as they  have invaded them militarily and in human terms.    We hope that Israel has now decided to be serious in the  framework of the peace process. We also hope that they have  discovered that they have no life except within the framework of  a comprehensive and just peace. We in the Gulf states leave the  Palestinians to make their own decisions, and we support  everything they have decided for themselves. We also support  the peace process and believe as military officials that there  can be no peace as long as the enemy continues to occupy our  Arab territories.    ['Alam-al-Din] What about other threats?    [Al Khalifah] As long as the Gulf region contains 65 percent  of world oil reserves, the threats to it will continue to exist.  What sort of peace or security can be established when Israel  has more than 200 nuclear bombs in its military arsenal.    When you ponder this reality your confidence in peace is  bound to waver. However, we hope that the endeavors being made  will secure just solutions, strip Israel of its nuclear weapons,  and eliminate this type of vile and destructive weapon from our  region as a whole.</p>

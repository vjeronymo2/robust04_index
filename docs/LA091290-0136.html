			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE PREP PATH;  </P> <P> IF SPARKS GETS OK TO PLAY AT MATER DEI, HIS PRESENCE WILL BE FELT  </P> <P> Derek Sparks came to the door, and the floor rumbled beneath him.  </P> <P> If Sparks' strides can make the ground shake, what kind of tremors are we in  for if Sparks is declared eligible to play football for Mater Dei this season?  </P> <P> Get the Richter scale ready.  </P> <P> Sparks, a 6-foot, 212-pound all-Southern Section running back last year at Van  Nuys Montclair Prep, enrolled at Mater Dei this week. If Sparks is ruled  eligible to play for the Monarchs -- the Southern Section executive committee  will meet at 11 a.m. today to discuss the situation -- Mater Dei will have a  few additions to its football program:  </P> <P>  -- A remedy for its mediocre offense.  </P> <P>  -- Another year of rumor and innuendo.  </P> <P> Regarding the latter, Mater Dei has been in this position before.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the school was placed on probation without sanctions when the  Southern Section ruled that Mater Dei had violated a rule regarding illegal  inducements in the transfer of Corona del Mar quarterback Dan O'Neil.  </P> <P> While it might be determined that Mater Dei -- and Sparks -- has acted properly  in this case, bitter words, or at least whispers, from rival camps surely will  hit the rumor mill.  </P> <P>  "Did you hear? They promised Sparks cash! A car! An appearance on 'The  Simpsons!' ... "  </P> <P>  Mater Dei has heard it before. And so has Sparks.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old from Wharton, Tex., already has attended three high schools in  three years.  </P> <P> As a freshman, he went to his hometown school, Wharton High. The next year he  moved to Southern California, attending Wilmington Banning where, after gaining  1,394 yards, he was named the state's sophomore of the year by Cal-Hi Sports.  </P> <P> He transferred to Montclair Prep for his junior year, gaining 1,944 yards and  scoring 35 touchdowns last season. Two weeks ago, he played in Montclair Prep's  season opener in Hawaii, gaining 63 yards in a 28-7 loss to Honolulu  Farrington. He left the game in the third quarter after spraining his right  ankle.  </P> <P> Now, Sparks says, he is transferring to Mater Dei because his mother, June  Sparks, was still living in Texas but wanted to be with Derek for his senior  year.  </P> <P> "She had friends in this (Santa Ana) area," Sparks said. "Plus she didn't want  to live in the Valley."  </P> <P> Why Mater Dei?  </P> <P> "I liked Mater Dei because they stress academics so much," Derek Sparks said.  "Once you go to a private school, you get used to everything being first-rate.  I didn't want to sell myself short."  </P> <P> Sparks did not attend classes Tuesday. He said he was waiting for his schedule  to be finalized. Monday was the first day of classes.  </P> <P> Asked if thought Mater Dei wouldn't be taking a little heat from rival programs  if he becomes eligible, Sparks shook his head and smiled.  </P> <P> "Oh, yeah," he said with a grin.  </P> <P> "When I transferred to Montclair, there were lots of newspaper articles (with)  quotes from the other teams," Sparks said.  </P> <P> "They said stuff like, 'Yeah, he's getting paid to play,' and all that garbage.  . . .  </P> <P> "But no rules were ever broken. . . . One reason I didn't play last week is  they (Mater Dei administrators) were making sure everything was OK and  official."  </P> <P> But is everything OK with Sparks? Moving three times in three years has to wear  on you, right?  </P> <P> Montclair Prep assistant football coach John Hazelton said Sparks sounded as if  he was nearly in tears when he left a message on his answering machine about  leaving Montclair.  </P> <P> "When I think about it I go, 'Dang,' " Sparks said. "If I could do it all over  again, I would've just picked one school so things could just be the same. But  things don't always work out that way. Sometimes you just do with what comes  your way.  </P> <P> "It's hard, though. You have got to drop your friends and the guys on the  football team. . . . But my mom wanted to be with me and I wanted to be with  her. She wanted to live here, so I moved to be together."  </P> <P> The gray shorts Sparks was wearing had a Mater Dei football logo stamped on  them. His gray T-shirt had Montclair Football across the front.  </P> <P> To which school does he feel more affinity?  </P> <P> Only time -- and yards gained -- will tell.  </P> <P> Add Sparks: Sparks, who was listed as a preseason prep All-American by  SuperPrep magazine this year, says his goal is to break the Southern Section  career-rushing record of 5,998 yards set in 1986-88 by Russell White of Encino  Crespi.  </P> <P> Including the 63 yards he gained in the Hawaii game two weeks ago, Sparks has a  career total of 3,401 yards.  </P> <P> He'll need a 2,598-yard season to break White's mark.  </P> <P> "I know it's going to be tough," Sparks said. "I've already missed one game,  and I didn't get to play a full game in Hawaii . . . Also, it looks like it'll  be more difficult because I'm moving up divisions (Mater Dei is Division I,  Montclair Prep is Division IX).  </P> <P> "It's a challenge, but I like challenges. Whatever comes, comes, though. The  main thing is to fit in with the program."  </P> <P> Or get in.  </P></p>

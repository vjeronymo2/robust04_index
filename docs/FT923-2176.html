			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Margins come under pressure at Campari Strong pressure on margins led Campari International, the sporting leisurewear group, to report a one third fall in profits in its seasonally unfavourable first half. Turnover for the six months to June 30 dipped to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 19.5m) reflecting the dull men's wear market in the UK. Interest received fell from Pounds 338,000 to Pounds 263,000, leaving profits before tax at Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 1.53m). However, Mr Christopher Cheng, chairman, said the group's autumn ranges had been 'well-received'. Sales so far in the second half and forward orders were 'comfortably ahead' of last year. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.25p (3p), payable from earnings of 7.27p (11.15p) per share.</p>

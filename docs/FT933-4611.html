			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings After running around like a headless chicken buying businesses in the 1980s, Hillsdown is now restoring some sanity to its sprawling empire. Its management is proving brutally effective in knocking the business into shape. Although trading profits remained static in the first half at Pounds 81m, Hillsdown squeezed Pounds 50m more cash from its operations. Over the past year, it has chopped Pounds 400m of low-margin commodity sales. Much remains to be done while complaints about Hillsdown's exposure to cyclical businesses remain as valid as ever. With refreshing candour, Hillsdown admits it does not have much choice about its current strategy of simply improving what it has got. Gearing of 42 per cent precludes any big moves into higher value-added areas. It would be hard to get a rights issue away, while the poor performance of Premier Brands hardly inspires confidence that Hillsdown is the best of brand managers anyway. For the moment, investors will have to content themselves with the secure dividend: Hillsdown remains the fifth highest yielding stock in the FT-SE 350 despite its shares rising from 74p to 172p since last September. At some point, attention must switch to earnings prospects. A multiple currently matching that of Unilever either suggests the market is being wildly optimistic about Hillsdown's recovery or - more probably - that it is unduly glum about the Anglo-Dutch giant.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: Software houses bear high costs of SE's Taurus Sir, Richard Waters's article, 'Taurus the octopus' (January 22), mentioned the increasing costs of Taurus to London's already pressed securities industry. However, one major group of participants in Taurus was not even mentioned: the software houses. My company, along with several others, took the initiative to start building systems for Taurus back in 1990, before we had obtained any firm client commitments. We made this decision because of the complexity of the project and the tight time-scales put out by the London Stock Exchange. To date, it is largely the software houses that have taken the brunt of the continuing delays and changes to Taurus. We have made a substantial investment both in terms of direct and opportunity costs and we are a long way from retrieving an acceptable return on this investment. As well as having been overlooked in your article, this has not generally been recognised by the potential Taurus participants either. The larger software houses, such as my own, are in a position to withstand this, but there must be some serious concern about our smaller brethren. Finally I am astonished that the exchange had to be persuaded to introduce the extra phase of 'many-to-many-testing'. This seems fundamental to such a complex system and gives insight into the overoptimistic approach taken by the exchange to Taurus.

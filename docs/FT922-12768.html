			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 11m turnround puts Beckenham in red AN OPERATING deficit, substantial write-offs, and greatly increased interest charges put Beckenham Group into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.45m in the year to October 31. That marked an Pounds 11m downswing on the Pounds 5.6m profit achieved in the previous year. Losses per share were 11p (earnings 7.9p). The final dividend is omitted, leaving the total at 0.5p (3p). The dividend on the 9 per cent redeemable cumulative preference shares will not be paid. Mr Christopher Egleton, chairman of this group of contractors and distributors, said the greatest difficulties were at Duffy Femwork, where the group acquired an outstanding two thirds interest from the joint venture partners. It made ductwork for Canary Wharf. Recession had a deeper effect than anticipated at the halfway mark, with contract starting dates delayed and pressure om margins increased. The result was a 13 per cent decrease in turnover for continuing operations and an operating loss of Pounds 2.45m. A large scale reorganisation was put in hand. Resulting costs were heavy, amounting to some Pounds 2.7m in redundancies and other closure costs and write-downs, in addition to those for Docklands, and there were write-offs for subsidiaries sold in previous years. The provisions have been taken as Pounds 1.92m exceptional and Pounds 3.58m extraordinary.</p>

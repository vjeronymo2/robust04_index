			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate articles to the 33rd anniversary of the independence of  Sierra Leone.    A by-lined article of MINJU CHOSON says that the Sierra  Leonean people have worked to build a new independent and  prospering society after independence.    It notes:    Sierra Leone is developing relations with many countries,  pursuing a non-aligned policy externally.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea established  diplomatic ties with Sierra Leone in October 1971. Since then  travels and contacts have been frequent and friendly relations  further developed between the two peoples.    Believing that the friendly and cooperative relations  between  the two countries will grow stronger and develop in accordance  with the idea of independence, peace and friendship, the Korean  people wish the Sierra Leonean people new achievements in the  efforts for the independent development of the country, the  article says. NODONG SINMUN carries an article introducing the  change of Sierra Leone.</p>

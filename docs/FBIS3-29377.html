Wichit said the Cabinet had given approval to the Defence  Ministry to buy six transport planes, worth Bt3.42 billion, from  Italy, but it must cooperate with the Finance and the Commerce  ministries to persuade Rome to buy Thai agricultural produce in  return. Wichit said it would be difficult fol Thailand to ask  Rome to accept the barter-trade deal since the purchase was not  at government-to-government level. He also said if the Air  Force had to coordinate with the other two ministries it might  delay the plan and "the price will go up."    The Cabinet decided last November that the armed forces must  inform the Commerce Ministy about future arms purchase so that  it could help to negotiate possible barter deals. The Cabinet's  move was lauded as a way to end decades of obscure weapons  purchases which sometimes were plagued with charges about  irregularities.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai later played down the issue by  saying that the decision was not mandatory. The Commerce  Ministry however has set up a committee, chaired by Director  General of the International Trade Department Oranut Osathanon,  to study and coordinate potential arms barter-trade deals with  foreign countries.</p>

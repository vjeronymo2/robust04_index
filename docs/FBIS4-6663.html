			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Japanese Government special envoy Nobuo Matsunaga  disclosed in a speech on the afternoon of 20 April that U.S.  Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor said that "Japanese  macroeconomic measures are most important" in dealing with the  stalled Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. Matsunaga  reported that Kantor again sought the continuation of income tax  cuts and the implementation of other measures.    With regard to the priority sectors in the framework talks  such as automobiles and auto parts, he said that "both Japan and  the United States should make arduous efforts" to formulate  objective criteria which do not entail numerical targets, and he  stressed the importance of compromise by both sides.    Matsunaga visited Washington in early April to hold talks  with U.S. Government officials. He touched on these talks in  the speech. In reporting the U.S. position on this issue, he  disclosed that Kantor had stated: "While specific issues with  Japan surely need to be resolved, macroeconomic policies are  most important. If the Japanese economy is not transformed into  a domestic demand-oriented one through macropolicies, there can  be no progress in Japanese-U.S. relations." In connection with  this, Matsunaga said during the speech, "It is a fact that there  are doubts overseas about the effectiveness of tax cuts and how  much actual public investment is involved." "There is little  time left before June. If we do not work hard on this, we will  not make it in time."    Matsunaga also revealed that he had told U.S. officials that  "from Japan's point of view, the U.S. battlefront is divided"  and that he had expressed the view that differences of views  inside the U.S. Government contributed to difficulties in  bilateral negotiations. He reported that in response, U.S.  officials had explained: "There is indeed room for some  soul-searching. We are now building a consensus around USTR  Kantor, who is responsible for government procurement,  insurance, and other specific sectors of the framework talks."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the crime perpetrated by Zionist settlers  in Hebron yesterday, an official spokesman for the Palestine  National Liberation Movement, Fatah, [dissident] has stated that  what happened in Hebron yesterday was definite proof exposing  the falsehoods that have been going on for some time, concerning  the agreements that Yasir 'Arafat concluded with the Zionist  enemy.    The spokesman added that what happened in Hebron yesterday  also confirmed the extent of both 'Arafat's involvement and his  standing in the Zionist enemy's trench. He asserted that our  militant people will continue their intifadah and daily struggle  and will not pay attention to the falsehoods and deception  pursued by the 'Arafatist group regarding its agreements with  the enemy. The Zionist attacks and massacres will not go  unpunished, he said.</p>

In addition to basic business assistance services, the center will provide specialized assistance in the areas of Construction Assistance and Bonding, Capital Development, Franchise Development, International Trade and Tourism Development. Each one of these specialized business areas are considered functional components, and serve as integral parts of the center. The MEGA Center is, therefore, equipped to meet the more complex business needs of the minority business community. This, in turn, is expected to create growing and more profitable ventures resulting in increased job opportunities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The closing date for applications is September 6, 1994.

Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions, or combinations thereof. The Chicago MEGA Center will provide service in the Chicago Metropolitan Area with selected services throughout the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The award number of this MEGA Center will be 05&hyph;10&hyph;95002&hyph;01.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: Applicant capability in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MEGA Center shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To assist in this effort, the MEGA Center may choose to charge client fees for business services rendered. Fees for assistance rendered under the Basic Service Component of the MEGA Center range from $10.00 to $60.00 per hour based on the size of the client's business. Fees for assistance under the Market-Specialized Service Components of the MEGA Center may be based on a portion of the current market rate for such services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an application is selected for funding, MBDA has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of MBDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' is not applicable to this program.

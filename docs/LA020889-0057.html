			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTEL LOSES NEC TRIAL BUT CLAIMS ANTI-PIRACY VICTORY  </P> <P> Striking a blow to the fortunes of high-technology pirates and copycats, a  federal judge in San Jose ruled Tuesday in a case pitting Intel Corp. against  its Japanese rival NEC that a key element in computer chips is subject to  federal copyright laws.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William Gray handed a partial victory to NEC, ruling that  the scrappy Japanese firm did not infringe on an Intel copyright for the  microchips that act as the brains in first-generation IBM personal computers.  </P> <P> But Intel claimed a broader victory in Gray's ruling that microchip codes are  subject to copyright law -- a decision the American firm said would protect the  investments that it and other innovative chip manufacturers have made in  developing new technology.  </P> <P> Experts in intellectual property law agreed, saying the decision would  discourage the kind of imitation that has resulted in cutting-edge U.S. firms  losing the profits on their inventions to lower-priced foreign copycats.  </P> <P> "It draws a line against . . . lower-cost producers simply waiting for Intel to  produce a top-of-the-line microprocessor which they then take to Hong Kong or  Taiwan and duplicate at cheap labor and put in the market to compete with  Intel," said Vincent Cox, a Century City attorney who specializes in  intellectual property law.  </P> <P> "It gives Intel a substantial incentive to go out there and invest heavily in  obtaining a leadership role in the microprocessor field and then to reap the  rewards," Cox added.  </P> <P> In the San Jose case, Intel had complained 4 1/2 years ago that NEC, once its  partner in a broad cross-licensing agreement, had violated its copyright on the  microcode of its 8086/88 computer chip. Microcodes are the tiny instructions  that are embedded in and help run a microprocessor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Microcode Called Software  </P> <P> On the narrow issue, Gray said Intel had failed to protect its copyright.  Although Intel had properly marked its devices with copyright notices, Gray  said many of the devices, made by some Intel licensees, were distributed  without the notices. As a result, Intel forfeited its copyright, the judge  ruled.  </P> <P> But more importantly, say analysts, Gray sided with Intel and ruled that a  microcode qualifies as a computer program and can be protected under copyright  laws.  </P> <P> NEC had contended that the Intel microcode did not meet the definition of a  computer program. The microcode, NEC said, is virtually part of the computer,  and thus not subject to copyright protection.  </P> <P> Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said Intel's  immediate loss of copyright protection on its 8086/88 chip was a minor blow,  because the company no longer sells many of those chips.  </P> <P> "It's a clear loss, but it does not hurt much," said Murphy.  </P> <P> But he agreed that the long-term implications of Gray's ruling favored Intel  and its innovative peers. "Intel has won a big victory in the long term," he  said. "It certainly does make it difficult to copy a chip because it's very  difficult for one chip to work like another if you don't copy the microcode."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jesus Sanchez contributed to this story.  </P></p>

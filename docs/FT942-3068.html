			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Glaxo faces new era as Girolami goes: Knight who reshaped the drugs industry steps down after 25 years Sir Paul Girolami, who brought US-style revenues - and salaries - to the UK pharmaceuticals industry, is stepping down as chairman of Glaxo. His gives up executive powers at the end of this month - Glaxo's financial year-end - after a quarter of a century on the board, the last nine years as chairman. He will leave the board, and his Pounds 1.4m annual pay package, at the annual meeting on November 18 by which time a replacement non-executive chairman should have been chosen. His departure marks a change in the company's direction. The past 13 years growth have moved Glaxo from a diversified also-ran to a tightly focused prescription drugs group at the top of the industry. The next few years are likely to be shaped by government healthcare reforms that are depressing profit margins across the industry. Sir Paul leaves a business accustomed to sustained profits growth. He became chief executive in 1980, a year before the launch of ulcer treatment Zantac, now the world's biggest selling drug. Glaxo emerged from a period of declining fortunes in the late 1970s so rapidly that, by 1983, annual profits growth of more than 50 per cent was greeted with disappointment. He brought an unprecedented emphasis on marketing to the scientific world of drug prescribing. Zantac sales rapidly overtook SmithKline's ulcer treatment Tagamet, even though the medical difference between the two products was small. He became chairman in 1985 and committed the company to a culture of self-sufficiency and organic growth. Prepared to be autocratic in style, he clashed with, and removed, two chief executives between 1989 and 1993. Today, Zantac sales are more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year and still rising. The company has at least two new drugs whose annual sales are forecast by analysts to surpass Dollars 1bn each within five years. Yet Glaxo's prospects are less certain than at any time since the 1970s. Changes in healthcare management, designed to control public spending, have prompted other giants of the industry to reorientate themselves. Glaxo knows that the days of self-sufficiency and organic growth are over. 'No one should be in any doubt that the future will be very different,' said Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, yesterday. 'We face enormous change in the way our industry operates.' The change in direction has already started. Glaxo has signed a deal with US company Warner-Lambert to sell its drugs in the non-prescription over-the-counter market. In March this year, Sir Richard said that further deals would be signed in the US. Another part of the company's response was revealed yesterday. Sir Paul's one-man rule is apparently giving way to a triumvirate of Sir Richard, the yet-to-be-named non-executive chairman, and Dr Franz Humer, 47, who was appointed chief operating director last year. Glaxo is likely to find it tough to recruit a non-executive chairman weighty enough to balance Sir Richard's mastery of both the science and craft of running a drugs company. Earlier this year, Wellcome gave up the hunt for a chairman to succeed Sir Alastair Frame and allowed Mr John Robb to annoy some institutional investors by becoming both chairman and chief executive. Sir Paul's job was, in retrospect, mainly to manage growth. Whoever takes over will face the more complex task of changing the course of a healthcare supertanker steaming towards an uncertain future.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- SIR PAUL GIROLAMI  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1926: Born 1966: Joined Glaxo after qualifying as a chartered accountant and       working for Cooper Brothers 1968: Appointed financial director 1972: Planned defence against Beecham bid 1980: Appointed chief executive 1985: Appointed chairman 1988: Knighted  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Lex, Page 22 Observer, Page 21</p>

Branding this as an outburst of the "civilian"-veiled  fascist  revealing his sinister intention to tighten the repressive rule,  a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says:    Dictatorship is incompatible with democracy. It is shameful  of the puppets to talk about "civilian government" and  "democracy" while wielding the sword of dictatorship.    The ever more outrageous and vicious suppression by the  puppets is hysterics of those who are floundering in the crisis  of a fish out of water, rejected and denounced by the people.    Sword-brandishing, however, can never be a means of  prolonging life. The struggle of the South Korean people for  independence, democracy, reunification and the vital rights is  justifiable. It cannot be criminalized under any circumstances.    To suppress this struggle by branding it as "illegal" is a  lawless violence and an unpardonable fascist outrage. The  harsher the fascist suppression by the puppets, the stronger the  resistance of the people.    The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique had better act with  discretion.</p>

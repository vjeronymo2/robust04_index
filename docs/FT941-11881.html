			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Drug 'breakthrough' gives hope to arthritis sufferers The most promising clinical results so far in the search for an effective arthritis treatment were announced in London yesterday. Scientistsat the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology spoke of a 'breakthrough' as they published the results of a trial of an experimental drug on 20 patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis - the most common cause of severe inflammation ofthe joints. All 20, who had failed to respond to existing drugs, showed a marked and long-standing improvement after treatment at Charing Cross Hospital, London, with the new product, CenTNF. Manufactured by Centocor, a US biotechnology company, the antibody blocks the action of tumour necrosis factor, a natural molecule involved in the inflammatory process. Repeated injections of CenTNF every 10 to 12 weeks appeared to control arthritis symptoms without side effects, said Prof Marc Feldmann of the Kennedy Institute. Centocor, based in Philadelphia, and the Kennedy Institute are now organising larger-scale clinical trials in Europe. Celltech, a UK biotechnology company based in Slough, isstarting clinical trials of an alternative TNF antibody on arthritis patients at two other London hospitals. 'The consensus in the rheumatology community is that a TNF antibody is the most exciting lead to a treatment for arthritis,' said Prof Feldmann. 'So far it is the only new lead in which all the patients have responded.' If larger scale clinical trials confirm the safety and efficacy of the anti-TNF drugs, they could be licensed for commercial use within three years. However, an antibody drug is likely to cost several thousand pounds a year - which would make it prohibitively expensive as a general treatment for the UK's estimated 1m rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. 'We will expect some quite dramatic benefits from the drug to justify its cost,' said Dr Mark Bodmer, a senior Celltech researcher.</p>

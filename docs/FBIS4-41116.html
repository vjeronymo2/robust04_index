			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Larisa Lazar for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 21 Jun -- Either we choose the road of normal  economic reforms, or we will remain a third-rate country,  Stanislav Shushkevich, one of the candidates for the presidency  of the Republic of Belarus and former head of parliament, said  at a meeting with war and labor veterans.    The candidate expounded on his economic program, which  envisages bringing the rate of inflation down to 6-10 percent by  the end of the year (whereas now it stands at over 50 percent).    Those attending the meeting were also interested in problems  connected with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Many people,  particularly the older generation, are criticizing the former  speaker, claiming that the USSR was destroyed at Belovezhskaya  Pushcha.    Answering his critics, Stanislav Stanislavavich noted that  the Soviet Union had in effect broken up before the meeting of  the leaders of the Slav states at Viskuli. He reminded them  that seven republics -- Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia,  Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova -- had not taken any part in  the referendum on the future of the USSR, thereby expressing  their negative attitude to the empire. Kazakhstan conducted its  referendum with a different wording. Over 90 percent of  residents in Ukraine voted for sovereignty.    In the opinion of Shushkevich, it was for this very reason  that an attempt was made at Viskuli to preserve economic ties  between the Republics and to give them a new impetus through the  creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The  presidential candidate believes that this averted a "Yugoslav  scenario," which could well have taken much more dangerous forms.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: HK gives the world its phone number - Foreign interest in a planned expansion of its mobile market The Hong Kong government has incensed the telecommunications industry with proposals to expand the mobile telephone market - a move widely tipped to have the effect of attracting competition from across the globe and expected to give the existing cellular operators a run for their money. The government announced last month that it would award up to 10 new mobile licences as early as next April. The invitation to bid is bound to attract a wide number of bidders, including from Europe and the US. Hong Kong has no bars on foreign ownership or participation in its economy and licences are awarded on the basis of merit rather than being auctioned off to the highest bidder. The new licences are being awarded on the basis of a projected total demand of 1.1m mobile phone users, or 18 per cent of the total Hong Kong population, by the end of 1998, which assumes current growth rates are maintained. In a consultative paper issued in February, the government said it intended to award up to six Personal Communication Services (PCS) (also known as Personal Com - munication Network (PCN)) licences - mobile services intended for the mass market with coverage comparable to existing cellular services and accessible through inexpensive and lightweight handsets. Even this suggestion met with outrage - Pacific Link Communications, one of the existing cellular operators, advocated a ban on new licences for the time being; conversely two non-cellular operators urged discrimination against (if not a total veto on) those operators already providing cellular services. But the submissions in response to the consultative paper that caused the greatest impact were those that called on the Office of the Telecommunications Authority (Ofta) to consider the advanced Japanese technology known as Personal Handy Phone System (PHS). Hong Kong last week asked Japan's telecommunications ministry for co-operation in its plan to introduce the system. The suggestion came in a proposal - outlined in the authority's report on the Future Regulation of Mobile Telecommunications Services in Hong Kong that followed the consultation process - to issue four new licences on PHS. Mr Alex Arena, director-general of telecommunications for Ofta, says about half the 47 submissions made after the consultative paper mentioned PHS. 'So I took the view, if the industry wants to use PHS and I have spectrum (frequencies) available, and if it meets the usual tests for developing a standard, I would be prepared to accept it for Hong Kong.' He disputes the notion of a 'magic number', or ceiling, and points to the fast-growing pager market which, unhampered by regulatory barriers, has swollen to accommodate 34 licencees. 'Competition has driven that market and grown that market and therefore many more licences can exist that would not have had the government decided four or five was the right number. We have been trying to get the message across that government's role is to create opportunities in the market. If they cannot make a business of it then the normal marketplace dynamics will take effect,' he says. But it is the nature of that competition which is disturbing the industry. Mr Douglas Li, chief executive of SmarTone, Hong Kong's newest cellular operator, says: 'The government takes the view competition is good. But that's a narrow view. It seems logical and simple and appeals to the populous, but I think it's too simplistic in the sense that overall if you look at Hong Kong as a whole all these networks are way too many. 'Economically it is not that efficient. Especially with PCN, the nature of which means you have to have substantial investment up front. By issuing licences all at the same time means some time in 1996/97 we will have this sudden emergence of a massive amount of capacity. People put hard dollars in to create those, and the only way is to make them pay is to grab customers. The most likely way to do that is by dropping the hell out of prices, but that means the financial case deteriorates, maybe beyond the pale.' Hongkong Telecom's deputy chief executive Peter Howell-Davies says: 'Six PCN licences and four PHS licences is bold. Whether it's the best solution for Hong Kong I think needs - and am sure will receive - further consideration. . . . We have counselled some caution on whether that's the best solution for Hong Kong, knowing the industry is changing fairly rapidly.' Mr Andrew Harrington, senior analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong doubts there will be enough demand to absorb more than two new licencees - one PCN and one PHS. Already three out of 10 people in Hong Kong have some form of mobile telephony, or around one per household, giving Hong Kong one of the highest penetrations in the world and putting it on a par with fixed wire telephone penetration in Taiwan and South Korea. 'It takes a leap of faith there's significant long-term growth left in the market. How high can it go?' says Mr Harrington. Mr Li of SmarTone is adamant the move will do little to enhance services to customers: 'I don't think it is necessarily better for consumers. I can see the logic behind what they are saying, but I do feel by splitting the spectrum in so many parts it is not aiding efficiency on the part of the operators. It requires us to invest more and ultimately that (cost) has to be passed on to customers. 'It will lead to a massive amount of capacity and definitely bring down prices. Initially that's a great deal for the consumer, but I believe there will be casualties financially among the operators. If that kind of cost-cutting competition comes in then you will find possible deterioration in services offered.'</p>

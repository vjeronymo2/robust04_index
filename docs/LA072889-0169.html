			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FDA ASKED TO ACT ON FOOD LABELING  </P> <P> Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said today he has asked  the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food  labeling standards.  </P> <P> The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food  labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing  ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods.  </P> <P> Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement  for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to  improve food labeling.  </P> <P> "Interest in food labeling has never been higher," Sullivan said in a  statement. "Food labeling bills have been introduced in Congress. Consumers are  watching what they eat more closely."  </P></p>

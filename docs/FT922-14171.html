			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Tesco hits Pounds 546m but slows in second half HIGHER productivity, new store openings and the benefit of the Pounds 572m rights issue a year ago helped Tesco, the food retailer, to increase pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 545.5m in the 53 weeks to to February 29. Excluding property disposals, profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 545m (Pounds 417.1m). Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said the recession had started to hit the company in the second half of last year but sales were now showing marginal volume growth on a comparable basis. With further productivity gains as well, he expected 'yet another year of profit growth'. Tesco's shares rose 4 1/2 p to 255 1/2 p. Sales for the year grew by 12.9 per cent to Pounds 7.6bn including VAT, with about 2 percentage points of the gain coming from the 53rd week of the financial year. The first half saw sales up 12.5 per cent to Pounds 3.3bn. The second half sales increase was 13.1 per cent to Pounds 4.3bn, but of that 3.6 percentage points was due to the extra week's trading. However, the sales rise in comparable stores was 6.5 per cent in the first half and 2.5 per cent in the second. Operating profits were 19.8 per cent ahead at Pounds 503.3m, giving a margin on sales excluding VAT of 7.1 per cent (6.6 per cent). First half operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 200.2m while the second half advance was 17 per cent to Pounds 303.1m. The second half saw the start of Sunday opening in England and Wales in the run up to Christmas. Sir Ian said this had been 'an unqualified success' with 500,000 people shopping at Tesco on Sunday. In Scotland, where Tesco had been open on Sunday for eight years, Sunday sales accounted for over 10 per cent of the week's business - in England and Wales it currently represented about 5 per cent. After capitalising interest of Pounds 88m (Pounds 63m) interest receivable was Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 19.1m). The interest benefit from the rights money was about Pounds 69m although it caused a 3 per cent dilution at the earnings per share level. Mr David Reid, finance director, said capitalised interest would fall in 1992-93 to about Pounds 78m. The group's capital spending programme is beginning to slow. In 1990-91 the group spent Pounds 950m, this fell to Pounds 850m last year and will drop to Pounds 800m in the current year. Sir Ian said that land prices and building costs were falling. Last year 24 stores were opened and two extended adding 977,000 sq ft of sales space, while 12 totalling 175,000 sq ft were closed taking the total to 396 stores with net selling area of 10.5m sq ft. The current year would see a 1.1m sq ft increase with 28 stores opening, and 20-25 stores are planned for 1993-94 adding 900,000 to 1m sq ft. At the year end net gearing was 14.4 per cent. Mr Reid said there was still a cash outflow from the business, which would be about Pounds 200m in the current year, taking year end debt to about Pounds 550m. However, the outflows would reduce and the group would be cash neutral by 1994-95 with gearing staying well under 30 per cent. During the year Tesco raised Pounds 320m through long-term debt instruments and Pounds 50m from the sale and leaseback of six stores. Improved working capital control contributed Pounds 59m to group funding, with the stock turn at the year end down to 2.5 weeks (2.8 weeks), the lowest in the industry, Tesco claimed. A fall to 2 weeks is expected in the next few years as benefits from automatic reordering come through. High wage increases last year meant the ratio of wages to sales worsened by 0.3 percentage points but Mr David Malpas, managing director, said this would improve by 0.2 percentage points in the current year. After a 27.5 (30.6) per cent tax rate fully diluted earnings per share rose 20.2 per cent to 19.95p, excluding the profits on property sales. A final dividend of 4.3p (3.6p) is proposed giving a total of 6.3p (5.25p) a rise of 20 per cent. See Lex</p>

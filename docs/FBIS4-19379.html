			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent </F> representative to the United Nations, by Zafer Kiraz in New  York, date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Kiraz] Turkey has been taking steps since the  beginning of the war against the cruelty, and suffering in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What has Turkey done after the latest  Gorazde incident? What is the latest situation at the United  Nations?    [Batu] The Serbs have been attacking Gorazde for the past 17  days. We believe that these attacks can be stopped only by  resorting to force. We have been explaining our position to our  friends insistently. We have activated the Islamic Conference  Organization [ICO] contact group. We took several steps. I  believe that the two air raids were finally carried out thanks  to the ICO representations led by Turkey. These were  insufficient, however. In fact, they were so insufficient and  weak that the aggressor became even more daring. We are  concerned, very concerned. We are sad because the UN Security  Council which merely watched the developments reach the present  situation continued to be disorganized and helpless today as  well. I have been calling the term president of the Security  Council since this morning. So has the Bosnia-Herzegovina  representative. The term president does not even answer the  calls. There is no action on the part of the five big powers.  I repeat: Gorazde is a so-called secure region. Who is  supposed to make it secure? The United Nations. What kind of  security is this?    [Kiraz] Thank you, sir.    [Batu] I thank you.</p>

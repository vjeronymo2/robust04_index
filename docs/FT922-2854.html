			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Banks shore up shaky property foundations / Explaining the fashion for behind-the-scenes rescues THE prospects for the UK commercial property industry, locked into its third year of decline, are as diverse and uncertain as ever. For every investor who asserts that the slump is over - as Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, did last Thursday - there is a developer who claims that the bottom is not even in sight. Thus, Regalian's accounts were qualified last week on the grounds that its development sites and empty property defied precise valuation. But the biggest sources of uncertainty are the banks. Tremors from last month's spectacular corporate failures are rippling through the UK property market, prompting speculation about the next large property company to collapse. Although Mountleigh's failure was long-expected, the collapse of Canary Wharf has disconcerted an industry that thought it was hardened to bad news. More than a third of investment and development companies recently interviewed by Gallup expected the clearing banks to clamp down on their credit lines as a result of the Canary Wharf collapse. The prospect of more corporate failures is perceived to be not a question of if, but when. But fears of a sudden melt-down are probably misplaced. The character of this property slump is very different from that of 1974, when defaults by property companies threatened to trigger the failure of the secondary banks. This time round, most of the lending is syndicated amongst large banks which are better able to absorb the losses. As a result, one of the most striking features of this property slump is the support shown by the banks for companies which appear to be prime candidates for receivership. A cursory glance at the share prices listed at the back of this newspaper shows that a large number of quoted trading and development companies are nearly worthless. The difficulty of letting and selling buildings has forced scores of companies to breach banking covenants and left them without sufficient income to service bank debt. But for the most part, banks are responding to companies' pleas to defer their interest payments or reconstruct their debts. For every high-profile failure, there are many more successful rescues behind the scenes. The banks' patience can be ascribed to a combination of common sense, desperation and wishful thinking. The most convincing reason for the banks' forbearance is that they would gain nothing from putting a company into receivership. They would prefer to leave the company in the hands of the management than pay handsomely for receivers who have limited property expertise. 'Banks would far rather work with, not against, the incumbent management who know the assets best,' said Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank, the biggest UK lender to the property industry. Exceptions occur where the banks have lost faith in the company's management. The failure of Mountleigh, for instance, was partly due to the City's exasperation with its frequent changes of management and strategy. It was also due to the presence of bondholders demanding payment, another common cause of receiverships. Banks are often reluctant to allow bondholders, who have a lesser claim to the company's assets, to take money out of the business. Another crucial incentive for the banks to avoid receiverships is the impact it has on asset values. A survey published by English &amp; Overseas Properties last week found that four out of five of the UK's top 30 receivers believed that banks were reluctant to put assets under receivership for fear of realising massive losses in asset values. The problem is partly that potential buyers force down prices when companies are in receivership. Although the receivers invariably stress that they 'are not looking for distress sales', a company in receivership undoubtedly has less bargaining power. 'Receivership has an unfortunate taint' said one of Canary Wharf's bankers, explaining its choice of administration rather than receivership. A related problem is that assets deteriorate under receivership. Creditors often believe it is throwing good money after bad to fund property maintenance. The budget set aside by the banks is exclusively for marketing purposes, rather than for enhancing or improving the building to retain its value. But in some instances, the most important motivation for keeping a company going is that the banks want to minimise their provisions. Selling property crystallises a loss and in the current state of the market, the resultant damage to a bank's balance sheet would tend to be greater than if it estimated the fall in value. Banks would rather take provisions over a two- or three-year period. They will want to avoid provisions and write-offs that shrink their capital at a time when the Bank for International Settlements' new capital adequacy regime is being introduced. Critics argue that banks' willingness to keep property companies in business largely stems from a desire to take the simplest approach rather than add to the daunting problems already on their plate. A perception exists that the banks are floundering where their property loans are concerned. A head of a large surveying firm, recently drafted in by one of the clearing banks to help with the property casualties, discovered huge numbers of doubtful property loans stuffed into files in alphabetical order. 'They just don't know what they've got,' he says. Banks are also criticised in some quarters for believing that holding back on receiverships will help foster a recovery, which will ultimately allow them to get more back from delinquent loans. As matters stand, the market is deadlocked. At the top end of the market, representing 15 per cent of the total, there is unsatisfied demand, which could be slaked by property coming on the market. 'More receiverships will bring liquidity to the market. It will bring investors in at more realistic levels which will enhance the market,' says Mr Mike Riley of Chesterton, chartered surveyors. For the remainder of the market, the problem is an absence of finance, as banks are not prepared to extend new loans on property that is in any way flawed. 'Unless the banking sector starts lending and takes more risk, it will be very difficult to finance a recovery,' says Mr Riley. This poses a large question over the banks' ability to extricate themselves from their problem property loans. Memories of the last property crash when the banks were able, with time, to work through their problems are misleading. Inflation reduced the scale of those debts; yet now indebted companies are suffering from one of the highest level of interest rates, adjusted for inflation, since the 1930s. Problems created by the banks' headlong rush into property lending at the end of the 1980s are likely to be around for some years yet.</p>

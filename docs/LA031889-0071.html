			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> IN MILLER'S FINAL GAME, OREGON ST. LOSES IN OVERTIME  </P> <P> Evansville guard Reed Crafton ended Ralph Miller's long coaching career with a  long shot Friday.  </P> <P> Crafton made a three-pointer with 10 seconds left in overtime as Evansville  beat Miller's Oregon State team, 94-90, in the first round of the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. West Regional.  </P> <P> Miller, who is retiring at age 70, ended his 38-year college coaching career  with 674 victories and 370 losses.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry it's over," he said. "I'm pleased with the results of our team this  year and I hoped we could win one more. But so be it."  </P> <P> Sunday, Evansville (25-5) will play Seton Hall, a 60-51 winner over Southwest  Missouri State.  </P> <P> Gary Payton put Oregon State ahead, 90-89, on a short jumper with 49 seconds  left and was fouled on the play, but he missed the free throw.  </P> <P> After Evansville retook the lead on Crafton's second three-pointer of the  overtime, Oregon State called a timeout. Payton missed a three-pointer with  four seconds left and fouled out two seconds later.  </P> <P> Evansville made half of its 24 three-point attempts, including all four in  overtime.  </P> <P> "We like to shoot the three-point shot, and if we don't hit it, we lose,"  Evansville Coach Jim Crews said.  </P> <P> Payton, who finished with 31 points, had tied the game, 78-78, with 11 seconds  left in regulation on two free throws, after the Beavers outscored Evansville,  15-4, in the last 4 1/2 minutes.  </P> <P> Scott Haffner, who led Evansville with 26 points, missed a three-pointer with  two seconds to go, forcing the overtime.  </P> <P> Teo Alibegovic scored eight points in the extra session for Oregon State, which  finished the season 22-8.  </P> <P> "We had two problems," said Miller, who took the Beavers to the NCAA tournament  eight times. "We missed too many easy shots, and we made too many fouls."  </P> <P> Evansville, which won the regular-season title in the Midwestern Collegiate  Conference, had lost its only previous NCAA tournament game in 1982 to  Marquette.  </P> <P> Evansville led, 73-64, with 4:51 remaining after Crafton, who scored 13 points,  sank a jumper to cap an 11-point run.  </P> <P> The Aces trailed, 39-37, at halftime, but Haffner hit a layup and a  three-pointer and the lead then changed four times before Oregon State tied it,  at 47-47, on a jumper by Payton.  </P> <P> Evansville took the lead again, however, and held it until Eric Knox's  three-pointer gave Oregon State a 64-62 lead with 8:58 left.  </P></p>

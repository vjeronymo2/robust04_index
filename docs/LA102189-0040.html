			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S FOOTBALL GAMES;  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE VS. RANCHO SANTIAGO: BATTLE OF UNBEATENS  </P> <P> A couple of impressive rankings and undefeated records are on the line tonight  when Rancho Santiago College travels to Riverside for a Mission Conference  Central Division game at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago (5-0 overall and 4-0 in conference play) is ranked second in  Southland Poll and fifth in the J.C. Grid-Wire national poll.  </P> <P> Riverside (5-0, 4-0) is third in the Southland Poll and eighth in the J.C.  Grid-Wire national poll.  </P> <P> Both teams come in with powerful offenses, but slightly different methods.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago is the state's best offensive team, averaging 459 yards and  39.8 points a game. But the Dons have the sort of balance coaches always want  but seldom get.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago is averaging 221.2 yards rushing, and 237.8 yards passing.  </P> <P> Riverside is averaging 401.6 yards and 28.4 points a game, but there is little  question the Tigers prefer the run.  </P> <P> Riverside averages 244.4 yards rushing and only 157.2 yards passing.  </P> <P> In tonight's other Mission Conference Central Division games:  </P> <P> Golden West (3-2, 3-1) at Fullerton (3-2, 2-2), 7 p.m. -- Fullerton has a 13-3  record against Golden West and hasn't lost to the Rustlers since the 1977  Avocado Bowl.  </P> <P> Golden West has been improving its rushing game each week thanks to better  blocking and the work of sophomore running back Sean Cheatham. Cheatham has 470  yards, and has rushed for more than 100 yards three times this season.  </P> <P> Of course, running against Fullerton will be a challenge. Fullerton has the  top-ranked rushing defense in the 16-team conference. Fullerton is allowing  61.8 yards a game. Fullerton is second in the conference in total defense,  allowing 245 yards a game.  </P> <P> Orange Coast (4-1, 3-1) at Saddleback (1-4, 1-3), 7 p.m. -- Orange Coast has  been getting better each week thanks in part to the improvement of freshman  quarterback Greg Angelovic. He doubled his touchdown total for the season with  three last week in a 34-7 victory over San Diego Mesa. Angelovic has only one  interception this season.  </P> <P> Saddleback has been searching for a consistent quarterback, with John Barnes  and Jeff Bailey alternating. But Bailey was impressive in relief of Barnes  against Pasadena last week and will get the start tonight.  </P></p>

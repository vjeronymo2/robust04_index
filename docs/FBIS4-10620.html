			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the Nation by President Guillermo Endara from </F> the Palace of the Herons in Panama City on 14 April -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow countrymen: One of the most important duties  I have as president of a transition government moving the nation  toward democracy is to ensure clean and free elections. I have  committed myself to this because the country needs it. I have  put forth my best efforts to ensure that the traumas we have  traditionally experienced during similar situations not be  repeated, especially the shameful experience of the May 1989  elections.    However, it is one thing to guarantee free elections, and it  is another thing to remain silent while, amid the heated  electoral campaign, my government is being subjected to unfair  criticism that neglects the very special circumstances under  which we have had to work.    Within this context, I have decided to make public some  material of genuinely historical value. I learned of the  specific contents of this material only a few days ago. Since  then, I have conscientiously weighed this in my mind. I  deliberated greatly on whether or not I should disclose its  contents. In the end, what weighed most in terms of my decision  was the knowledge that my teacher, Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid,  would have disclosed this material if he were in my position,  because, if the voice of the people is indeed the voice of God,  then the people are sovereign and have a right to know. The  truth must not be hidden from the people, especially truth that  is relevant when important decisions must be made. My  conscience would bother me if, knowing that this material is in  my hands, I did not inform the Panamanian people of its contents.    The film clips you will now see are only a sample of  hundreds  of films personally recorded by public officials of that time --  tapes that were filmed and recorded by the officials of those  days. They were the only ones who filmed this material. You  will see their faces and hear their voices in all their crudity.  They are official Presidency documents that I am making public.  As a Panamanian these truths embarrass me and fill me with great  shame. However, this happened in our country.    As president, I would not like to see this happen again in  Panama. However, this does not depend on me. It will depend  solely on the Panamanian people's choice on 8 May. I will hand  over power to the person elected by the people.    Thank you very much.</p>

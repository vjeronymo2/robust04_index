Vasile Chirculescu,  deputy director-general of the Targu-Jiu Autonomous Public  corporation told a ROMPRES coresspondent that in each of the  three days of strike 100,000 tonnes of lignite and brown coal  were extracted in each of the three coal field whose miners are  on strike. The quantities sent to power stations during the  strike stood at more than 90 percent of those supplied before  the strike started. "The strike is not legal," said Chirculescu,  "that's why we filed a lawsuit against the strikers' leaders and  asked that the case be considered an emergency. The public  corporation does not have enough money to solve the strikers'  claims."    Coal power stations had around 2.4 million tonnes of coal in  store Wednesday, February 16. The situation was critical at the  stations Oradea 1 and 2, Suceava, Iasi and Arad, to which  additional amounts of coal were sent.</p>

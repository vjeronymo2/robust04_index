			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar earnings jump but share price weakens Caterpillar, the Illinois-based manufacturer of engines and heavy equipment, reported record sales and earnings in the first quarter, and said demand for its products in Europe had begun to improve. However, the results fell short of Wall Street expectations, and Caterpillar's stock dropped by Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 103 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earnings jumped to Dollars 192m, or Dollars 1.89 a share, from Dollars 34m, or 34 cents a share, in the 1993 first quarter. Sales rose to Dollars 3.28bn, from Dollars 2.69bn a year earlier. Sales within the US were up 21 per cent at Dollars 1.65bn, while sales outside the US advanced by 23 per cent, to Dollars 1.52bn. 'Return on sales in the first quarter was almost 6 per cent, about double the rate for all of last year,' said Mr Donald Fites, chairman. 'That's a significant improvement and we anticipate further improvements as European economies, which have been depressed, pick up momentum.' Analysts noted that much of the improvement in Caterpillar's sales outside the US was the result of dealers building inventories during the quarter, and positioning for anticipated demand. In last year's first quarter, dealers were trimming inventories in response to weak demand. Caterpillar said that at the end of the quarter its worldwide workforce totalled 51,671, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Two years after the United Auto Workers union ended an acrimonious strike at Caterpillar's factories, the union and the company still do not have a contract. 'Product and shipment volumes from UAW-represented facilities, however, continue to meet or exceed plans. Quality levels continue to exceed pre-strike levels,' the company said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing,  vice-premier of the State Council, said here that the current  situation of Chinese foreign trade is good, but the cost  per-unit for earning foreign exchange is increasing too fast.    He stressed that it is necessary to strictly ban driving up  prices to collect commodities for export and ban underselling of  goods.    He noted that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation has invited bidding for trading a dozen commodities  for export. This practice has produced good results and proved  to be useful in bringing forced price rises of commodities  collected for export and underselling under control. It is  imperative to sum up these experiences and to popularize the  practice as soon as possible, the vice-premier said.    He also stressed that effective measures should be taken to  prevent the property of state-owned foreign trade enterprises  from being drained off.    Vice-Premier Li made these remarks during his April 29-May 3  survey tour of south China's Guangdong Province.    During his stay in Guangdong, the vice-premier visited the  75th China Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, Huangpu Customs, a  free-trade zone, the new Zhuhai Airport and some state-owned  enterprises. He made an all-round investigation into the  implementation of some reform measures.    He said that in order to build the basic framework of a  socialist market economic system, the Chinese Central Government  has taken a series of reform measures in the systems of finance  and taxation, banking, modern enterprises, investment, foreign  trade and foreign exchange. Judging by the situation in the  first four months of this year, all the measures have fared  well. He urged leaders at all levels to pay close attention to  the issue of revitalizing large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises. He also discussed ideas on revitalizing  state-owned foreign trade enterprises with local officials and  entrepreneurs.    On the development of special economic zones in the future,  the vice-premier said that they should follow international  conventions to further improve their environment for investment  and lay the emphasis on attracting investment from large  multinationals.    He stressed the necessity of constantly fighting against  smuggling and the importance of running the free-trade zones  well.    He also brought special attention to education, saying that  universities should try to find an effective method for arousing  the enthusiasm of all circles and strengthening domestic and  international cooperation to raise educational levels and train  personnel suited to the development of a socialist market  economy.</p>

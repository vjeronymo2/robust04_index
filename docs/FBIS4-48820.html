			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- While there would  be no Nuremburg trial, revenge or witch-hunt of those who  committed human rights violations in the past, he wished to give  the assurance that there would be no cover-up or sweeping under  the carpet, the minister of justice, Mr Dullah Omar, said on  Friday. Speaking during debate on the president's state of the  nation address, he said: "There will be no amnesty without  disclosure." (applause) It had to be made possible for all  South Africans to come to terms with the past with dignity.    The Constitution laid down certain conditions for amnesty  for  the period from October 1990 to October 6, 1993, and the last  official cut-off date mentioned had been December 5, 1993. The  post-December 6 period was not covered by draft legislation now  being prepared, Mr Omar said.    A proposed commission of truth and reconciliation should  avoid any connotation which suggested revenge or a witch-hunt.  Amnesty should be accompanied by acknowledgement and  disclosure. Ordinary crimes will not be covered, and victims  should receive reparation and compensation.    Mr Omar said the views of all parties represented in the  government of national unity would be taken into account in the  process, as well as those of parties not represented.    The ANC's opposition on the death penalty remained and  legislation would be presented in due course. In the meantime,  the moratorium on the death sentence would remain. Mr Omar said  he spent sleepless nights thinking about the 400 people sitting  on death row in South Africa (including the former  self-governing territories), and this matter would have to be  dealt with "expeditiously".    Just so would the question of children in prison. This  problem was compounded by many children not having homes or  parents to go to, and by the fact that many juveniles had been  convicted of extremely serious crimes of violence. "I cannot  see them being released to places where similar crimes could be  committed," Mr Omar said. Violence against women also had to be  addressed. He concluded: "Much work needs to be done to ensure  that justice becomes truly accessible to all our people."    At the start of his speech, Mr Omar said he shared the joy  of  others at the "scourge of apartheid" having been removed from  South Africa's society. But, he warned, "we should not be  carried away by the euphoria of the moment." His one great  apprehension was that in five years' time someone might write  about the country: "not yet uhuru [Swahili for freedom]." For  this reason, the reconstruction and development programme had to  succeed.</p>

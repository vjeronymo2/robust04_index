			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. ASSEMBLY ASSAILS ISRAELI POLICIES IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES  </P> <P> The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday condemned Israel's policies and practices  in the occupied territories and asked the Security Council to consider measures  to protect Palestinian civilians there.  </P> <P> The resolution was approved 129 to 2 with one abstention. The United States  joined Israel in voting against the measure.  </P> <P> The Assembly stressed the "urgent need" to expedite the convening of an  international peace conference on the Middle East and asked Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar to submit periodic reports on developments in the  occupied territories.  </P> <P> Israel has opposed such an international conference.  </P> <P> The Assembly acted after a two-day debate on the subject initiated by Arab  states amid a 17-month uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Before casting his first vote in the Assembly since he became the Bush  Administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Ambassador Thomas R.  Pickering criticized the language of the resolution.  </P> <P> "It is counterproductive and only succeeds in driving the parties further apart  at a time when efforts should be focused on bringing them together," he said.  </P> <P> In debate on the measure, Japan criticized Israeli policy in the occupied  territories, saying it is time its "futility" is recognized in face of the  Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> Ambassador Makoto Taniguchi said Tokyo is seriously concerned "over the massive  use of force by Israeli authorities against Palestinian civilians."  </P> <P> "The repressive measures which the Israeli government continues to take against  the Palestinian people run counter to the peace momentum that is being  developed in the Middle East, " Taniguchi declared.  </P> <P> "It is time that Israel recognized the gravity of the situation and the  futility of its policies."  </P> <P> The Japanese delegate said the Palestine Liberation Organization represents the  Palestinians and that it is essential that Israel and the PLO recognize each  other's position and that the PLO participate in a regional peace process.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, PLO leader Yasser Arafat held a 90-minute meeting in Geneva with  Perez de Cuellar and said the PLO planned to apply for full membership in all  specialized U.N. agencies, a move the United States and Israel oppose.  </P> <P> Arafat told reporters that the PLO, which now has observer status in the world  body, will begin its campaign for full membership with a bid to join the World  Health Organization.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is </F> in Brussels, by Jean-Marie Cavada from the France-2 studio in  Paris--live]    [Excerpts] [Cavada] I would like to look at the results of  the first part of the summit in Brussels. [passage omitted]  Today was the first part of the Brussels NATO summit, which  will continue tomorrow.    Mr. Juppe, at France's request the Bosnian issue has at last  been discussed. Do the Americans and the French agree on air  strikes? Which ones? Against whom and by whom, Mr. Juppe?    [Juppe] Mr. Cavada, like everyone else, I am deeply  distressed by what I know and what I see. [passage omitted] It  is necessary to put pressure on all parties today in order to  convince them that there is no military solution and that the  only solution is a political settlement.    What have we tried to do at this alliance summit? First, we  spoke about Yugoslavia. It had been decided that 16 heads of  state and government would gather to discuss security and  stability in Europe, while setting Yugoslavia aside. But,  because France said last week that this was inconceivable, we  talked about Yugoslavia today.    We obtained three things, which will be included in  tomorrow's final declaration. They may seem insignificant to  those who are listening to us, but they are important for the  future.    First, we managed to have the 16 countries of the Atlantic  alliance approve the peace plan of the European Union. We are  often told that there is no political aim. I am sorry, but  there is a political aim. The aim is peace, as fair a peace as  possible. We Europeans have committed ourselves to this. We  said: This is the plan we suggest. I discussed this plan  myself with Mr. Izetbegovic. I remember very well the moment  when, in Geneva, on 29 November 1993 I asked him: What do you  want? He wrote on a piece of paper before my eyes: 33.3 percent  of Bosnian territory. This is what he said.    So this is what we suggested: 17.5 percent for the Croats,  33.3 percent for the Muslims, and the rest for the Serbs. There  are many other aspects to this plan: access to the sea, the  international status of Sarajevo, the European status of Mostar,  access to the Sava River and the Danube in the north. Anyway,  the plan is on the table, and we are now in a position to say:  The 16 countries of the Atlantic alliance are telling all the  parties that this is the plan which must now be approved and  accepted. There will be no other.    The second thing we obtained, and this is very important, is  the commitment of the 16 to contribute to the enforcement on the  ground in Bosnia, by sending troops to implement this plan if it  is approved. I say to those who are listening to us in  Sarajevo: President Clinton himself, and the other heads of  state and government, said today: If peace is signed, we will  go to Bosnia with NATO soldiers to guarantee the enforcement [of  the plan]. It is a solemn commitment.    Finally, the third thing we obtained is that the Atlantic  alliance says it is ready to support the UN in enforcing  Security Council resolutions. This means two things in concrete  terms.    First, as Francois Leotard and General Briquemont have said,  it is necessary to reinforce UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  troops. For months on end we were told that an extra 7,000 men  would be dispatched. France did its duty and sent 1,000. Where  are the others? As early as tomorrow, we will meet UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali in Paris, and we shall say to him: Where  are the others? They must come.    The second aspect of this commitment on NATO's part is to  say: If UNPROFOR is attacked, if it cannot carry out the mission  it was given by the Security Council, then we are available for  air strikes. At the initiative of France once again, with our  partners who have troops on the ground, we have tried to define  more precisely the operations we could undertake in order to  restore UNPROFOR's credibility.    As Francois Leotard explained earlier--and I will be  brief--the first intervention is to force open the road to  Srebrenica to relieve Canadian troops, and the second is to open  Tuzla airport so that humanitarian aid can land there. We warn  those who might want to oppose these two operations that if they  do so, air strikes will be used. As I am talking to you, while  heads of state and governments are still discussing this, this  is the outcome of today's talks in Brussels.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Cuts proposed to axe deficit PRESIDENT Bill Clinton may have thought his budget battles were over, at least for this year, but two former senators came back to Washington yesterday to sound a trumpet call for more radical measures to eliminate the federal budget deficit entirely by 2000. Mr Paul Tsongas and Mr Warren Rudman laid out a programme that scrapes virtually every political nerve in the US, proposing means-testing for most social security benefits, severe cuts in the Medicare health plan for the elderly, and a steep increase in petrol taxes. Mr Tsongas and Mr Rudman come from different political parties, but they share a sense of urgency about the need to bring under control the federal budget deficit, now rising at a rate of Dollars 12,000 (Pounds 7,800) a second. 'That is Dollars 12,000 a second of debt that we leave to our children. Those numbers are generationally immoral,' Mr Tsongas said yesterday at a small rally on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, midway between the White House and Capitol Hill. The US deficit is projected to reach Dollars 251bn in 2000. The central proposal of the programme outlined by Mr Tsongas and Mr Rudman is a sliding scale means test, which would progressively reduce benefit payments to all those whose income exceeds Dollars 40,000 a year. They calculate that this would save Dollars 67.6bn in 2000. 'We must change the conception in America about how this deficit is being caused: not, as many Americans think, by waste and fraud, by too much foreign aid or by too many congressional perks, but by entitlements,' Mr Rudman said. The programme also proposes raising Dollars 44.8bn in 2000 through adding 50 cents a gallon to the petrol tax, Dollars 18.7bn from alcohol and tobacco taxes, and Dollars 19bn from domestic spending cuts - in areas such as the space station, or community development block grants paid to cities and states.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / E Europe on the road to easier travel Slowly and without fanfare, a 20,000km motorway system linking the Baltic Sea with the Aegean and the Black Sea with the Adriatic is taking shape in eastern Europe. If the planners' dreams come true, some day not too far distant cars and trucks will be able to speed along a virtually seamless highway from Gdansk to Gurbulak on Turkey's border with Iran and from Genoa to Constanta, Romania's Black Sea port. The network is already a quarter complete; a quarter is under construction. Nearly 200km will be opened this year and a further 200km in 1995. The Trans-European Motorway (TEM) is matched by a similar network of designated international rail routes, the Trans-European Railway (TER), aimed at developing a coherent and efficient rail and combined transport system for eastern Europe. Co-ordinating these grandiose schemes, conceived well before the collapse of communism in 1989, is a reticent United Nations organisation, the Economic Commission for Europe. The Geneva-based ECE, whose 54 members span western and eastern Europe and North America, is responsible for 50-odd pan-European transport conventions, perhaps the best known being the TIR international lorry system. Tackling the dreadful state of their transport infrastructure, and the serious bottlenecks at western borders, has become an important priority for the governments of central and eastern Europe. Success in moving towards a market economy now depends on boosting exports, primarily to the west, while the tearing down of the Iron Curtain has vastly increased the numbers of people on the move. Yet the region (excluding Russia) boasts just 5,000km of motorways, compared with more than 40,000km in western Europe, and most of the remaining road network is crumbling. Only a tiny fraction of rail lines meets standards commonplace in the west. Many are in disrepair, and countries have different technical and operating standards which make it difficult quickly to move goods across frontiers. The severe recession in most of central and eastern Europe that followed the upheavals of 1989 led to big falls in traffic. But now that economic activity is picking up, for instance in Poland and the Czech Republic, the deficiencies of the creaking road and rail systems are becoming all too apparent. At the same time, says Mr Jose Capel Ferrer, head of the ECE's transport division, the financial constraints on these countries are even tighter than before. Though some help has been promised by the west, notably through the European Union's Phare assistance programme, governments will have to find the bulk of the resources to improve transport infrastructures themselves. Partly in the hope of maximising western aid, and partly because of the need to get priorities right, eastern European governments have assigned a critical role to the TEM and TER projects. Both projects identify a 'core' network of strategic modern transport links built and operated to common standards, as well as a staged plan of action to put them in place. The TEM, covering eight eastern European nations, was originally launched in 1977 as a north-south motorway axis. The plan was rapidly recast after 1989 to include an extra 7,000km of east-west connections to carry the big increases expected in traffic volumes once economic recovery takes hold. The short-term emphasis is now also less on building to full motorway standard (costing Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m a kilometre), especially where traffic levels do not yet justify it, and more on upgrading existing roads or building one motorway carriageway (to take two-way traffic), leaving the second for more prosperous times. Financial constraints have propelled some countries to explore build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes in which private companies finance construction and recompense themselves with tolls for a fixed period. With the bulk of the motorway network in western Europe complete, French, Italian and German companies are trawling hopefully for business in eastern Europe. However, BOT plans have been bedevilled by arguments over terms, and contractors themselves have sometimes been discouraged by current low volumes of traffic. Upgrading existing rail infrastructure and developing combined transport installations, envisaged by the 1985 TER plan, is proving even more difficult to fund than road-building. The 10 participant countries are now concentrating on tackling the most urgent problems, for instance, by relieving obvious bottlenecks. The ECE is also laying stress not only on physical improvements to the rail network but on the need to change management attitudes. In the days of communism, long distance freight traffic was directed to the railways which carried, on average, two-thirds of all tonne-kilometres (against less than a fifth for western European countries). Now, transport operators are free to use the roads which, even in their degraded state, offer quicker door-to-door deliveries. The result has been a dramatic decline in rail use. To cope with the new situation, railway managers need to become more market oriented, exploit combined transport possibilities (road, rail and water) and simplify border procedures, the ECE says.</p>

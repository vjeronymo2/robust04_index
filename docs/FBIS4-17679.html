			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of four of the nine Russian Duma  factions are ready to sign the Civic Accord. They are Yegor  Gaydar (Russia's Choice), Sergey Shakhray (Unity and Concord  Party), Nikolay Travkin (Democratic Party), and Ekaterina  Lakhova (Russia's Women).    The document will be signed in the St. George's Hall in the  Kremlin on April 28.    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (Yavlinskiy's faction) and Gennadiy  Zyuganov (Communist Party) said they did not intend to sign the  accord.    Yavlinskiy told journalists that he has no need to sign an  agreement with Gaydar, but he does not want to sign such an  accord with Zhirinovskiy.    The Communist Party at an all-Russian conference over the  week- end declared that the signing of the document was not  meaningful since "sources of confrontation" remain.    The Agrarian Party, led by Mikhail Lapshin, links its  signing  of the accord with the conclusion of an agreement between the  cabinet and farmers on the guaranteed state purchase of crops.    The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], led by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, is to adopt a decision on Tuesday. Although  Zhirinovskiy sets a number of terms (including the resignation  of six cabinet ministers), he considers signing the accord  possible "as a compromise, enabling further progress."    The New Regional Policy faction, led by Vladimir Medvedev,  has so far been undecided since some members have been for and  others have been against signing.</p>

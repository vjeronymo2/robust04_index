			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Bankers' Meeting"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Vladimir Masar, governor of the Slovak  National Bank [NBS], yesterday informed the highest  representatives of all commercial banks about topical issues of  monetary development and the NBS's monetary policy. The meeting  was attended by other members of the NBS Banking Council. The  discussion concerned, above all, the temporary suspension by the  NBS of refinancing credits for commercial banks. This measure  is a consequence of the growth of liquidity at the beginning of  this year, caused by the increase of the state budget deficit  toward the end of 1993. The representatives of commercial banks  noted that, even though they were not responsible for the growth  of liquidity, this NBS measure has an unfavorable impact on  their credit policy toward clients.</p>

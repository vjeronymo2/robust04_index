			<p>BFN     [Text] Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] advisers in  Nampula Province have welcomed President Joaquim Chissano's  guidelines on the speedy appointment of administrators and other  officials to areas controlled by Afonso Dhlakama's organization.  Interviewed by the MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY, the Renamo  advisers said the head of state's guidelines once again show  that he loves peace. Adviser Luis Trinta said the main problem  faced with the reintegration of Renamo's areas into central  administration is lack of transportation, not for personal use  but for official duties.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Observer: Hole in one Should any readers happen to insure their boats with Eagle Star, don't be too shame-faced about any little bumps and claims this season. Earlier this week a crew from the giant insurer was competing in the T &amp; N Industry Sailing challenge. Eagle Star is hot stuff on the water, and until early Tuesday looked likely to win again. However, with just 10 miles to go, it bumped into a crew from Mars (confectioners not planet), and emerged with a sizeable hole in the yacht's port quarter. It's not clear how it will affect Eagle Star's No Claims Bonus.</p>

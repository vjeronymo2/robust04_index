			<p>BFN     [Text] On board Turkish frigate Fatih, June 16 (A.A.) --  President Suleyman Demirel said that the Turkish Armed Forces  was ready to fulfill any duty assigned to itself.    On board the frigate Fatih during the Sea Wolf-94 exercise,  Demirel said that a forcible solution on Cyprus would lead to  turbulences on the island and would also reopen deep wounds  between Turkey and Greece.    After the conclusion of the exercise, Demirel told a press  conference that the Turkish nation felt great security because  of its strong army.    `Our Armed Forces will fulfill any duty given to it by the  people and the state,' Demirel said. `Both exercises were  carried out excellently. Everyone can easily notice the great  discipline and high-level of training the Army members have.'    Answering a question about Cyprus, Demirel said that peace  was established on the island ever since the 1974 Peace  Operation in Turkey.    `However,' he added, `a solution has been sought since then.  A conclusion was not reached yet on a bi-zonal, bi-communal  federated state based on political equality.'    `In fact,' he added, `the actual situation on the island is  a  solution. It has ended the bloodshed and the fighting between  the two communities.'    He also stressed that the Greek Cypriot Administration in  the  south was recognized by the world as the Republic of Cyprus  while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] was  recognized only by Turkey.    `The 150,000 Turks in Cyprus are being treated by the world  as if they were in a hostage camp in the eastern part of the  Mediterranean,' he said.    Demirel went on to say that the world was still hostile  against the Turkish presence in northern Cyprus.    `The per capita income in south Cyprus is 10,000 U.S.  dollars  while this figure is 3,000 dollars in the TRNC,' he said.    `It is necessary to seek a viable solution in Cyprus, rather  than trying to impose a non-operative one,' he said.</p>

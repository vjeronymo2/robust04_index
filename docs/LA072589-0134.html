			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOSHIBA GROWTH IN IRVINE PROCEEDING;  </P> <P> TELEPHONE OPERATION TO MOVE FROM JAPAN LATER IN YEAR  </P> <P> As part of a three-year expansion that will double the size of its Orange  County operations, Toshiba will transfer production of some business telephone  products from Japan to Irvine later this year.  </P> <P> The move will create just 40 local jobs in October, but Toshiba's plans call  for boosting its local employment by 850 positions by the end of 1991, said  Robert A. Wittenberg, a spokesman for Toshiba America Information Systems Inc.,  an Irvine-based unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp.  </P> <P> In an interview last March, Information Systems President Kiichi Hataya  disclosed a broad plan to expand the company's local operations by moving more  manufacturing from overseas to Irvine and other Toshiba facilities in the  United States. On Monday, Toshiba formally announced the latest phase of that  expansion. The company declined to disclose the size of its investment in the  expansion.  </P> <P> Beginning Oct. 1, the Information Systems unit will move manufacturing of  private-branch exchange, or PBX, systems and business telephones from Japan to  Irvine, Hataya said.  </P> <P> The first phase of the expansion took place in January when Toshiba boosted  local production of laptop computers and began making cellular mobile  telephones in Irvine. And in April, it began local production of office  copiers.  </P> <P> The Information Systems division employs 850 people in Irvine and 1,200  nationwide.  </P> <P> Hataya said the move is part of a Toshiba program to manufacture more products  closer to their markets.  </P> <P> "By producing systems in the United States," Hataya said, "we will be far  better able to maintain inventory control, respond more efficiently to customer  needs and react with more immediacy to fluctuations in marketplace demand."  </P> <P> Hataya said the expansion is also part of an effort by Toshiba "to demonstrate  its commitment to the U.S. marketplace" by purchasing more parts and supplies  for its U.S.-made products from local suppliers.  </P></p>

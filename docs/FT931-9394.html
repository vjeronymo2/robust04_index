			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Dublin's 'Juno' in Belfast - Malcolm Rutherford discusses the pertinence of O'Casey's play today THE Gate Theatre Dublin has been appearing this week at the Grand Opera House in Belfast with a wonderful production of Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock. The production by Joe Dowling is not new; it was first performed in Dublin a good five years ago and has since been acclaimed around the world. But as Michael Barnes, the artistic director at the Opera House, explains, this is the first time that it has been possible to get it to Belfast. So what do the people of the north make of a piece which has plenty of relevance to present troubles? They have flocked to it in droves. The Opera House, a fine theatre which seats about 1,000, has been booked out all week. And, of course, they recognise it as the masterpiece it is. Juno is not a nationalist work. If anything, its attitude to politics is a plague on all the factions. When O'Casey was making his mark in Dublin in the early 1920s, the internal troubles were intense. Political infighting and fanaticism are strewn throughout the play, yet the underlying theme of Juno is poverty and the attempt to live above the breadline: sectarianism simply makes life even more difficult. There is also something about the play which goes deeper. Why is it that people are poor? Certainly the Boyle family would be better off if the Captain consumed less drink and spent less time with his friend Joxer Daly? Why are the women on the whole so much more responsible than the men? Why do they set double standards when the women occasionally fall from grace? See the way the best as well as the worst of them turn on the young Mary when she becomes pregnant. Why are the Irish so curiously fey, for ever lilting into song and fantasy however deep their troubles? Is it escapism or is it a way of life? Then there is the very sharp attack the futility of religion, as in the famous lines: 'Mother o'God, Mother o'God have pity on us all] Blessed Virgin, where were you when me darlin' son was riddled with bullets,' the last words being repeated like a prayer. Why does the religion like the political fanaticism remain so strong? And why are there some Irish, like the IRA, who appear to have no sense of humour? The gunmen in Juno behave like stage dummies. Again it is striking that even when Captain Boyle is out of work the Boyle family is not absolutely poor. It survives, has aspirations, tries to dress well. Mary has been through school and is reading Ibsen. The women take the Captain's behaviour more or less for granted. In short, this is a very complex society. Every character is different, and the women are as different from each other as they are from the men. Few of the questions raised have changed much since the play was written. They seem as relevant in the north as in the Republic, and watching the play in Belfast the audience had no sense of estrangement. In fact, they seemed thoroughly at home. Two footnotes. Joxer, the layabout sponger, is usually played with a degree of sympathy. Here, Mark Lambert plays him as an out-and-out waster. The mood of the piece is realistic, not sentimental. I also think Juno would be an even better play if the final drunken exchanges between the Captain and Joxer were dropped, stopping with Anita Reeve's magnificent Juno crying for an end to 'this murdherin' hate'. The production moves to Cork, then from March 15 tours to Chichester, Bath, Cardiff, Reading, Blackpool, Norwich, Birmingham, Richmond and Newcastle.</p>

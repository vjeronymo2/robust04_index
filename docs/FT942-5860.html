			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Towles rejects Australians Towles, the lossmaking clothing manufacturer which last week was the subject of a Pounds 4.22m cash bid from London City Equities, yesterday dismissed the offer, saying it 'undervalued the company'. London City, an Australian investment group which has 51 per cent of the equity but only 14 per cent of the votes, said it made the offer because it was 'outraged' at Towles' continuing losses. The offer, announced last Friday, comprises 265p for each ordinary share, 115p for each A ordinary share, 52p for each A preference share, and 78p for each B preference share. Towles reported losses of Pounds 236,000 from turnover of Pounds 15.7m for the year to end-February. London City said it planned to introduce new management if it was successful. The Towles board yesterday said it would provide detailed advice in due course. Meanwhile, shareholders were advised to take no action.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Coloroll chief denies blame for Survival fall MR JOHN Ashcroft, former chairman of Coloroll Group, claimed yesterday that he was not to blame for the downfall of Survival Group, outdoor clothing and equipment company, placed in administration on Wednesday with total estimated liabilities of Pounds 1.7m. Mr Ashcroft, Survival's chairman, and managing director until December 1992, blamed the company's problems on the recession, which hit sales, and a delay in a refinancing needed to keep the business afloat. He declined to say who was responsible for the hitch over the refinancing which he said he recommended in November. He added he personally would have taken a three to five year view of the company, in which he and two partners bought a 72 per cent stake in 1990. He said he holds a minority interest but is the largest creditor. Cumbria-based Survival Aids, renamed Survival Group a year ago, was Mr Ashcroft's first acquisition following Coloroll's collapse with debts of about Pounds 350m. Mr Ron Robinson of Buchler, Phillips &amp; Traynor, the joint administrators, said yesterday he had already received a couple of approaches and was hopeful of selling the business and its name. Mr Ashcroft followed a policy of swift expansion for Survival, increasing its retail outlets from three to 13, two of which closed in December. The other 11 shops, shut yesterday for stocktaking, reopen today, pending a decision by the administrators. A decision on the future of the company's 70 staff is expected today. Unsecured creditors, mostly trade suppliers, are owed more than Pounds 1.5m of the estimated Pounds 1.7m liabilities. One supplier owed a substantial sum said: 'They were trying to open too many shops and reduce their stock accordingly to finance it. It's very sad." In the year to September 30 1991, Survival made an operating profit of Pounds 64,000, and after tax profit of Pounds 11,000, on turnover of Pounds 4.6m.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Labour seeks assurances on RAF operations in Iraq THE LABOUR party yesterday called on the government to clarify the terms under which British warplanes will operate in southern Iraq. It warned that it would not support attacks on ground positions without further United Nations authorisation. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, wrote to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, seeking clarification and confirming broad support for the operation by the US, Britain and France to protect the Shia communities from Iraqi bombing. Mr Cunningham said, however, that Labour was disturbed by conflicting reports from London and Washington on how the air exclusion zone would be enforced. He asked for assurances from Mr Hurd that the UN had been kept fully informed of the plan and added that attacks on Iraqi ground forces within the zone should not be permitted unless and until they were first considered by the UN Security Council. His letter coincided with a series of attacks on Labour's approach to foreign policy by a number of MPs on the left of the party. Ms Clare Short, newly restored to a position on the Labour front bench, attacked the leadership's refusal to demand the recall of parliament to discuss the crises in Bosnia and Iraq. Her comments came as an editorial in Tribune newspaper, which represents opinion on the left, launched a bitter attack on Mr Cunningham's inexperience in foreign affairs. The Royal Air Force will not make use of RAF Bent-waters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk when the US Air Force leaves the two bases next year. The Ministry of Defence had been considering moving Harrier aircraft from RAF Wittering, in Cambridgeshire, and Jaguar aircraft from RAF Coltishall, in Norfolk, to the two bases when it resumes full control of the sites next September. But the MoD said yesterday that an investment appraisal had shown it would not be cost effect-ive. The ministry believes it unlikely that a long-term defence requirement will be found for the two Suffolk airfields.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Radical reform of Irish tax system called for AN ADVISORY body to the Irish Department of Industry has recommended an urgent overhaul of the country's tax system, just three weeks before the government is due to present its 1992 budget. The Industrial Policy Review Group (IPRG), made up of leaders of Irish industry, financial institutions and trade unions, in a report published last week, noted: 'It is time for the government. . . to take the hard political decisions and decisive action needed for a thoroughgoing reform of our taxation system.' The report criticises the pervasiveness of ad-hoc tax breaks and incentives in the economy 'which have no coherent pattern or logic'. It recommends their phased reduction or elimination, in order to bring down personal taxation rates, which are among the highest in the EC. 'Single persons on very little more than the average industrial wage pay a marginal tax rate of almost 60 per cent,' the report says. Such a reform, the report argues, would drastically reduce the need for special reliefs and allowances which are now used 'to promote activities perceived as necessary for economic development'. The IPRG also recommends that the special 10 per cent corporate tax rate applying to manufacturing industry should not be extended to new sectors, or beyond the year 2010. 'The 10 per cent rate has been far more valuable to foreign-based than to Irish-owned industry,' the IPRG says, although it recognises that it has been 'the single most effective tool in inducing inward foreign investment'. Standard-rate corporation tax is 40 per cent.</p>

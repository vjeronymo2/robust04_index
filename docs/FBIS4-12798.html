			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan Jad-al-Haqq, Egyptian ambassador </F> to Sudan, by unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] After the meeting between  the Egyptian and Sudanese foreign ministers, do you believe that  the atmosphere is now favorable for resuming the Hala'ib  committee's work? And will you work to hold this meeting in  Khartoum?    [Jad-al-Haqq] An invitation has been sent to the Egyptian  foreign minister from Dr. Abu-Salih to visit Khartoum. The  visit will take place at the right time. Without doubt contacts  are being made so that the visit can be made and the committee's  work resumed. That was among the aims of my meeting with  Minister 'Amr Musa.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Some people say that Musa is refusing to  visit Khartoum while the present government is in power. What  is your opinion?    [Jad-al-Haqq] That is not true at all. I stress that the  foreign minister has accepted the invitation to visit Sudan, and  he will make the visit at the right time, in view of his  engagements and preoccupation in Cairo with following up the  peace process and other issues.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Did you sense real seriousness from the  two sides in tackling the problems and transcending the current  phase of disputes which has occurred in relations in the recent  period?    [Jad-al-Haqq] I am always optimistic about surmounting any  differences or sudden problems between the two countries. These  problems are not difficult to solve. No problem is difficult to  solve as long as there are sincere intentions and as long as the  efforts are intensified. [passage omitted]    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe it is possible for the  two sides to backtrack on the measures taken before the tension  arose in relations -- both the measures taken by Sudan against  the Egyptian education mission or the consulates, and those  taken by Cairo against Hala'ib?    [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that it is not in anyone's  interests to harm relations between two fraternal peoples. Not  only that: I also believe in our relationship with Sudan. It is  a relationship of kinship. The people of Sudan are our kinfolk  and relatives, and no one can sever the bond of kinship. We the  present generation must safeguard this relationship. This  generation in both Egypt and Sudan must safeguard what our  ancestors achieved and cherished for us.    I can say that the unity of the Nile Valley and its people  is  the basis and foundation for the establishment, success, or  continuation of any Arab unity or solidarity. Without doubt  that is in the interests of the two fraternal peoples in Egypt  and Sudan in view of the ties by which this region is  characterized compared with other regions.    [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How would you assess conditions in  southern Sudan, especially in the light of what has been said  about foreign endeavors and plans to separate it from the rest  of the country and to establish a self-rule authority there?    [Jad-al-Haqq] I can confirm that there is no doubt about  Egypt's foreign policy, as it is committed to safeguarding  Sudan's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of its  people.    This is not limited to southern Sudan alone. It applies to  all the Sudanese territory. It is a fixed and known position  which stems from historic constants, namely commitment to  safeguarding the territory and people of fraternal Sudan.    Not only does Egypt support Sudan, but also defends it  against any attempts seeking to separate any part of Sudan's  territory and fraternal people. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>   [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, 20 Feb (NOTIMEX) --  The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] delegates arrived  in this capital today to participate on Monday in negotiations  aimed at ending the armed conflict, which began in southeastern  Mexico on 1 January. [passage omitted]    Four "neutral" security circles were established in the  cathedral where the talks will be held with representatives of  the military police, nongovernmental organizations, the Mexican  Red Cross, and the International Red Cross. [passage omitted]    During the day the members of the EZLN will work on their  agenda and work plans, Major "Moises" said shortly before  entering the cathedral. "We are going to seek peace (...) we  want better answers from the federal government," Lieutenant  "Camilo" said in Ocosingo Municipality shortly before leaving  for San Cristobal.    In three communiques published by the media on Sunday, the  armed group said it would not come to this city to ask for  forgiveness but to demand justice.    Shortly before departing to pick up the first group of  rebels, Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation, stated in a communique that the effectiveness of  the political solution "lies in a real commitment for change  that will not endanger the essential principles of the nation  and the state. We should emerge with new solutions for just  causes here, but we should also strengthen the state of law.  Only then will we have solutions and achieve lasting and  democratic progress." We must respond to the demands of the  armed group, but we must also respond to the demands of the  communities in Chiapas who do not belong to that organization,  to social groups who do not support them, and to an entire  society which is hopeful but also troubled. [passage omitted]  There are no deadlines to end the dialogue because "its  objective is truly building peace, and therefore we are not  going to make the main aspect -- the political part -- fail due  to formalisms," Camacho Solis said.    The agenda for the talks, agreed upon through indirect  negotiations, includes economic, social, and political demands,  in addition to definitively ending the hostilities. The economic  demands refer to the situation of the Indians in Chiapas, while  the social demands refer to racism, neglect, and respect for the  culture and traditions of the Indian people in Chiapas. The  political demands refer to opportunities for real participation  by the Indians.    Camacho Solis said on 20 February that the agenda includes  economic, political, and social problems in Chiapas and no  national topics. He added that national topics will be  discussed, but no resolution will be issued on them. Camacho  Solis had said he would allow the participation of EZLN  representatives carrying weapons or wearing the ski masks that  the rebel leaders usually wear. "If I must be in front of  someone carrying a submachine gun or someone who prefers to wear  a ski mask, I will respect his decision. If he decides to take  it off, I will also respect his decision," Camacho Solis said.    He explained that representatives from the registered  political parties will attend the meeting and that there will be  permanent communication with the so-called Plural Group of the  National Congress for Chiapas in case there is need for another  government representative at the talks.    "If there is a joint conference or a joint communique at the  end of the first round of talks, it would be an excellent signal  that we are on the right track," Camacho Solis stressed.    Bishop Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, and  Camacho Solis issued a call to the people of San Cristobal to  contribute to guaranteeing security during the meeting. After  announcing the site of the talks at the cathedral, Ruiz asked  the people to prevent any type of provocations, disturbances,  partisan demonstrations, or irresponsible actions. In his  homily, Ruiz said that in view of the importance of the meeting,  San Cristobal and its main church will be called from now on  "the city and the cathedral of peace" and urged the people to  mark their homes with the sign of peace.</p>

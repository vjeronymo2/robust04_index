			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Philippe Chambon: ``Trees That Breathe </F> Tomorrow's Air'']    [Text] In 50 years' time, the atmosphere will contain twice  as much carbon dioxide as it does today. How will the oak, the  beech, and the spruce deal with it? A French team has attempted  a simulation.    In the heart of the Auvergne hills at  Saint-Maurice-es-Allier, 10 or so trees are already living in  the air of the year 2050, closely monitored by the INRA's  [National Agronomic Research Institute] forestry research center  from Nancy. Jean-Pierre Garrec's team has started a rather  unusual experiment here: growing trees in a CO2- rich  atmosphere.    The young trees -- oak, beech, and spruce -- have been  placed  in a chamber with an open top into which scientists inject a gas  mixture containing 700 ppm (parts per million) of CO2, twice as  much as in the air we breathe today. That is the proportion of  carbon dioxide predicted for the middle of the next century.  The calculation is simple since the graph plotting the increase  of CO2 in the atmosphere is widely known and easy to  extrapolate. As for the open-topped chamber technique, this has  hardly any effect on the natural environment, which is why it  was preferred to simple greenhouses.    Saint-Maurice-es-Allier has the advantage of being a former  thermal spa, supplied by the Sainte-Marguerite spring.  Researchers therefore have a free and inexhaustible source of  carbon dioxide. The excess gas extracted from the mineral water  is all the more interesting because it does not have the same  isotopic composition as the CO2 in the atmosphere, allowing  scientists to examine how it is metabolized by the plants that  absorb it.    This experimental station was opened two years ago. It plays  host to researchers from several European laboratories and parts  of the IGBP (International Geosphere Biosphere Program). It  receives subsidies from the EC and the French ministries  concerned (environment, research, and agriculture).    Jean-Pierre Darec explains: ``Until now, the impact of  atmospheric changes on trees was only studied over short  periods. Now we can hope to carry out this work over six years  or more.'' That is a short time compared with the life of a  tree, but the researchers, who have already obtained some  interesting results, hope to be able to draw some exclusive  conclusions.    The Nancy team specializes in analyzing the parts of the  plant that come into contact with the atmosphere, i.e. the bark,  the skin of the leaves, and the protective wax that covers them.  Samples taken at Saint-Maurice are analyzed at Nancy where  Didier Le Thiec and Martin Dixon try to assess the changes to  the outer tissue of the trees. The first thing they noticed is  that there were a lot fewer stomata -- a type of leaf pore  involved in regulating gas absorption -- on the trees living in  the atmosphere of 2050. It appears that the plant reacts to the  excess CO2 by reducing its number of stomata, while absorbing  more carbon dioxide than in today's atmosphere. In fact, this  phenomenon is already documented. In certain regions of Italy,  natural emissions of CO2 through the soil produce a similar  effect on wild plants. However, the air in these regions  changes constantly, affected by the wind, for example. In  Saint-Maurice, on the other hand, the parameters are kept  constant and allow much more reliable measurements to be taken.    Other teams have been examining the herbaria of our  forefathers. The leaves conserved in herbaria dating from the  end of the 18th century contain many more stomata than leaves of  today. Analysis of the air bubbles trapped in the polar ice  caps tells us that at that time, the CO2 content was just 280  ppm. How far can this phenomenon go without disrupting plant  metabolism? Is it reversible? These are questions for which  the Nancy team hopes to find the answers.    The experiment is also aimed at determining whether the  changes to the atmosphere can influence the penetration of  phytosanitary products and the sensitivity of plants to insect  or fungal attack.    While, for the time being, the tests are limited to CO2, a  similar line of research is underway to measure the effects on  trees of increases in the tropospheric ozone levels (the ozone  at an altitude of between 0 and 15 km). ``When we have the  initial results, we will inject the Saint-Maurice chambers with  the amount of ozone predicted for 2050,'' announced Jean-Pierre  Garrec. ``We are not afraid of discovering catastrophic effects  with the CO2, but with the combination of gases it is quite  another thing.'' Preliminary results are already raising serious  questions.    The researchers were naturally expecting the plants to grow  better in a CO2-rich atmosphere, since this gas is essential to  the production of biomass through photosynthesis. This is  effectively what is occurring in the INRA's experimental  chambers, except that the growth rate differs surprisingly from  one species to the next. Oak, in particular, grows much faster  than spruce. ``This difference led us to question forestry  balances,'' said Jean-Pierre Garrec. It is possible that the  increase in CO2 could favor certain species to the detriment of  others and so upset the diversity of species in our forests.  However, this is a hypothesis that remains to be verified. The  data supplied by the INRA station is still very fragmented and  too new to enable us to draw any long-term conclusions.    In the meantime, the Nancy experiments have also attracted  the interest of nurserymen, and in particular those that supply  towns, since municipalities often ask for fully-grown trees,  notably to avoid vandalism. Studies into the growth of trees in  a CO2-rich atmosphere could offer them an attractive  alternative: moving from the sapling to the young tree in a  record time.</p>

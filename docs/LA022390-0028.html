			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ANGEL TOWN' MISSES THE MARK  </P> <P> The awkward, tediously violent "Angel Town" (citywide) introduces former world  kick-boxing champion Olivier Gruner as a new French graduate student at a  fictional local university -- read USC -- whose martial arts skills come in  handy when he takes on a Chicano gang terrorizing his landlady (Theresa  Saldana), who lives in a large, run-down, turn-of-the-century house.  </P> <P> It seems that some five years earlier Saldana's husband took a stand against  gang violence in the neighborhood and paid for it with his life.  </P> <P> Now the gang maintains a near nonstop harassment of Saldana's teen-age son  (Frank Aragon) to try to force him to accept membership in the very outfit that  murdered his father. It would seem that Gruner has arrived in the nick of time,  yet before he's able to do his stuff effectively the gang manages to terrorize  Saldana's mother-in-law into a fatal heart attack and rape Saldana besides.  </P> <P> Writer S. Warren and director Eric Karson make no attempt to explore the gang  phenomenon or psychology; the gang members are simply hateful figures of evil,  the stereotypical ethnic bad guys whom the hero predictably defeats in the  final reel. The wiry Gruner has presence, and when it comes to kick-boxers, is  a better actor than the more monumental-looking Dolph Lundgren.  </P> <P> The acting honors, however, go to Saldana, who suggests the cruel irony of the  Chicano family who has worked hard to own its own home only to find the  neighborhood disintegrating around it. "Angel Town" (rated R for violence)  works up some exploitation-picture energy at the beginning, but it dissipates  into protracted mayhem.  </P></p>

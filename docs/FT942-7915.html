			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Workers reject compromise on Suzuki job cuts Workers at the Suzuki car factory in southern Spain dug themselves in for a prolonged conflict yesterday, rejecting a compromise job-cutting plan agreed between the Japanese company and Andalucia's Socialist regional government. The plan was designed as a holding exercise during the search for a new owner to replace Suzuki, which controls more than 80 per cent of the loss-making Santana Motor. The Socialist government in Madrid and the regional authorities are anxious to defuse tension during the campaign for regional elections in three weeks. Production of four-wheel-drive vehicles at the Santana factory in Linares has been blocked by the conflict, which began three months ago when the company applied for protection from creditors and announced plans to dismiss more than 60 per cent of the 2,400-strong workforce. The plans have provoked a fierce local reaction and a series of demonstrations and protest marches. Last Thursday the Santana management reluctantly agreed to a regional government proposal to reduce the workforce at Linares and nearby La Carolina by 900, instead of the 1,500 proposed. The company said it was willing to support the plan 'to contribute to the normalisation of the situation and the search for definitive solutions'. The Andalucian government linked the plan to a proposed Pta13.6bn (Dollars 99m) loan which would be either repaid after five years or converted into shares. However, the regional authorities said they had no vocation as car-makers, indicating they still hoped for a new partner to take over Santana.</p>

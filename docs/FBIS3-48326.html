Touching on the question of whether  Prime Minister Hosokawa will take the responsibility if the  package of political reform bills are killed in the Diet during  its current session, Chairman Murayama said:    [Begin Murayama recording] It is not desirable to leave  Japan  with a political vacuum at a time when Japan is mired in a  severe recession. The prime minister should first work to  compile a budget for fiscal 1994. He should make a decision on  the responsibility after the enactment of the budget. I believe  the Hosokawa cabinet should fulfill its responsibility to the  people. [end recording]    In this way, Chairman Murayama said Prime Minister Hosokawa  should not dissolve the House of Representatives and announce  the resignation of his cabinet en masse, and the prime minister  should make a decision on his responsibility after the budget is  enacted in the Diet. [passage omitted on the SDPJ's discussing  ways to handle its members who voted against the bills in the  lower house].</p>

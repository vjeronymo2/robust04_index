			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the completion and the opening of digital  telecommunications throughout the whole province in March this  year, Shandong's department of Posts and Telecommunications has  decided recently to go a step further to build up and complete  six large networks and to quicken construction of an information  highway throughout the province.    The six large networks are as follows: 1) The province's  Digital division exchange network to cities and prefectures will  be expanded from province to the county level. 2) Medium and  high speed digital data telecommunications network, known as DDN  will be connected and open in cities at and above the city and  prefectural level. It will also be connected with a national  DDN backbone network, and then expanded to the county and city  level. 3) Mobile telecommunications network covering the whole  province. 4) Complete and open a wireless paging network which  can scan the whole province automatically. 5) Build 168  information stations in the province. 6) Complete and open the  visual telephone conference network that connects the cities at  and above the city and prefectural level in the province. In  the meantime, Shandong's department of posts and  telecommunications determined to develop various urgently needed  telecommunications services in a timely manner to meet the  demand of large numbers of consumers.    It was reported that 17 May is the 26th world  telecommunications day. The topic is "telecommunication and  culture." The commemorative symposium convened for this will be  held by the provincial posts and telecommunications  administration in Jinan on the afternoon of 16 May.</p>

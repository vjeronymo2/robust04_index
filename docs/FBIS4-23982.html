			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia], President Charles Gankay Taylor, has been giving  details on results of the talks held in Gbarnga with the State  Council and Assembly delegations in Monrovia. On the issue of  two separate currencies in the same Liberia, Mr. Taylor said if  the State Council cannot resolve the issue now, he will make a  decision after he is elected president of Liberia on 7  September. He argued the question of the formation of a  national army is a constitutional issue, on which Liberians will  have no choice but to accept:    [Begin Taylor recording] We made it very clear that the  issue of the national army was not an issue that any individual  or body in this country could object to, because it was a matter  of the Constitution. No one can violate the constitution. The  Constitution calls for the Presidency of this country to raise  an Army. We have no alternative. They don't have a choice.    On the currency issue, they explained that in the interest  of  peace, they accepted the issue of the dual currency, in order  that no matter where you are in this country, it will be  accepted. Well, I view that as having to pass the buck, but if  they do not solve this issue, after I am elected president of  this country I will solve it. I can see that we are ready for  leadership in this country. Others may not be, and we are not  going to let these issues [word indistinct] them. After I  become president, I will make the decisions as president of this  nation on what will happen. [end recording]    President Taylor also expresed regret over pronouncements of  the Tanzanian and Ghanaian Governments to withdraw their troops  from the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States  Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] force in Liberia. He said he would  personally interact with the United Nations and the two  governments to ensure their continued participation in the  Liberian peace process. President Taylor, however, said the  Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG must be withdrawn from Liberia in  order to move the peace process forward, but stressed that we  need the Tanzanians and the Ghanaians here to assist us:    [Begin Taylor recording] We regret the statement on the part  of the Tanzanian defense minister. Also, we regret the  statement on the part of the Ghanaian foreign minister, Dr.  Asamoah, on the possibilities of [words indistinct]. The  Tanzanians are a very fine military group. They are here, we  meet them. If there is anything that we've said, we've said  that the Nigerian contingent must go. They have to go. We  will not work with them. They will go. But for those units  like Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, we will urge the international  community to assist those troops, because they are here for  peace. It is unfortunate. I will question them and will, as a  leader of a major unit in this country, write both the Ghanaian  and the Tanzanian presidents, and also a letter to the secretary  general of the United Nations, urging them to do everything  possible to keep those units here. But let the Nigerians go.  [end recording]    President Taylor outlined details of the visit of the State  Council and TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly] delegations  to Gbarnga. The NPFL leader said the State Council must seek to  have an effective chairman, saying we only seem to be making  progress in the absence of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor.  Chairman Kpomakpor has been attending the OAU meeting in  Tunisia, while other members of the council took advantage of  his absence to visit Gbarnga to move the peace process forward.  Chairman Kpomakpor, while earlier attending the inauguration  ceremony of South African President Nelson Mandela, other  council members also sought the opportunity to formally induct  Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper as foreign minister, only to come back  home later to accept the decision. [sentence as heard] Chairman  Kpomakpor is said to be ineffective when it comes to making  decisions of grave national concern, and there are calls for his  replacement if he cannot (?do) the job.</p>

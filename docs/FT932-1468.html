			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US bank hits Glaxo Goldman Sachs, the leading US investment bank, was the driving force behind the underperformance of Glaxo, after the broking firm's pharmaceuticals team reduced its current-year profits estimate for the drugs group. The broker said the downgrade was partly because of the recent decline in the performance of the dollar, but declined to give any further details. Goldman's team also lowered its forecast for following years, resulting in a cut in its five-year average earnings per share growth rate forecast from 13 per cent to 11 per cent. For the current year to June, Goldman pared its profits forecast from Pounds 1.705bn to Pounds 1.65bn, giving earnings per share of 39.1p against a previous prediction of 40.4p. Goldman expects the dividend to be increased by 15 per cent to 19.5p. Goldman said it maintained its stance on Glaxo, expecting market performance during the next six months but underperformance over the longer term. Glaxo closed 10 1/2 lower at 587 1/2 p following good turnover of 2.7m shares.</p>

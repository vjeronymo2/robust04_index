			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canadian court may hold key to outcome of McCain brothers' feud THE McCAIN frozen foods empire urgently needs a new chief executive if it is not to lose the confidence of customers, suppliers and employees, says one of the two feuding brothers who head the family-owned Canadian company. In an affidavit filed in a New Brunswick court, Mr Harrison McCain outlines an increasingly hostile relationship with his brother and co-chief executive Wallace, which has reached the point where the two are unable to agree on important business decisions. The court is due to hear an application by Wallace next week seeking to overturn a decision by other family members to oust him as joint chief executive by September 30. The 33 McCain family shareholders have resorted to litigation after failing to resolve differences over top-management succession, and over various offers and counter-offers for each other's shares in the CDollars 3bn-a-year business. Wallace's branch of the family owns about one-third of the shares of McCain Foods. The remainder is split between Harrison's family and the children of two dead brothers. Harrison alleges in his affidavit that bad blood between himself and Wallace dates back to Wallace's unilateral decision three years ago to appoint his son Michael as head of McCain Foods' US subsidiary. Wallace, aged 63, alleged in an earlier affidavit that Harrison, who is two years older, has sought to speed up the search for a new chief executive since suffering a heart attack early last year. Wallace favours maintaining the present arrangement of joint chief executives until a group of outside directors can identify a suitable successor. Harrison responds that 'it seems absolutely incredible to me that Wallace thinks that he and I could function at all as co-CEOs while we are fighting each other in the courtroom'. Harrison also dismisses a proposal by Wallace to split McCain Foods into two roughly equal parts, with one covering the Americas and the Pacific Rim, the other the UK and European businesses. 'To divide the operating company in any way would put both parts at risk in every market,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOORING MASTER TELLS REGRET, DENIES BLAME  </P> <P> John Keon, the mooring master who supervised the ill-fated berthing of the  American Trader off Huntington Beach, said Friday night that he feels badly  about the oil spill but that he is not to blame.  </P> <P> "Our lives are tied to the sea," said Keon, 41, in his first interview since  the accident. "We care just as much about the birds and the fish and everything  else, the pollution, as anybody. I see those people on the beach and I hope  they know that.  </P> <P> "I don't have any accident or incident on my record, and after this  investigation is done that will be the same," Keon said.  </P> <P> "Obviously something happened out there. There's a ship with at least one hole  in it and a pollution incident. Beyond that I can't say any more."  </P> <P> Keon spoke at his home after returning for the first time since the Wednesday  afternoon oil spill. He said he had been awake, talking to Coast Guard  officials since the accident.  </P> <P> He said crew members at first were baffled by the oil leak. "They knew on the  ship that there was oil on the water. They saw it and smelled it. But nobody  knew what caused it for a few hours until the divers went down and discovered a  hole."  </P> <P> The tanker's 12-ton anchor had gashed a hole in the hull during a routine  mooring maneuver. Keon said he has guided between 75 and 100 moorings at the  Huntington Beach terminal, and there was nothing different about the situation  this time.  </P> <P> "There was no low tide," Keon said, disputing official reports. "The tide was  normal. There was nothing unusual about the conditions at all. All the moorings  on the West Coast are virtually the same. There is nothing particularly  difficult about this one."  </P> <P> But Keon, speaking with his wife Karen and daughter Heather nearby, said he was  under orders not to offer any more details.  </P> <P> He said the environmental damage was upsetting to everyone aboard the ship.  </P> <P> Keon, a burly man with sandy hair and full beard, looks the part of a seaman.  He has worked on ships for 24 years since starting as an ordinary seaman. He  has been a self-employed mooring master at Huntington Beach for five years.  </P> <P> The American Trader's captain, A. R. (Robert) La Ware, was also on board at the  time of the accident. But it is typical for an experienced local pilot to guide  the berthing with help from a mooring launch on the water.  </P> <P> Both Keon and La Ware were tested for drugs and alcohol after the accident. The  alcohol results were negative and the drug tests are pending. A friend said  Keon is a teetotaler.  </P> <P> About 300,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil poured from the tanker's hull and  some of the crude has washed onto a 12-mile stretch of Orange County beaches.  </P> <P> The tanker berthing process is laborious, often taking two to three hours. The  large ship must be turned and nudged into position between a cluster of buoys  that hold it in position. The ship is then connected to a pipeline that carries  the crude oil to refineries onshore.  </P> <P> Keon and his family have lived in the San Jacinto area for eight years. They  own a tan, stucco house with a red-tile roof on Inglenook Avenue, a quiet  cul-de-sac in an upscale subdivision. He and his wife grew up in the Garden  Grove-Westminster area of Orange County.  </P> <P> The mooring master praised the tanker crew's efforts to quickly contain the  damage. "The vessel captain notified the Coast Guard and all the pertinent  authorities right away," Keon said. "They were on the scene quickly. The  response was excellent."  </P> <P> Warren reported from San Jacinto and Roderick from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

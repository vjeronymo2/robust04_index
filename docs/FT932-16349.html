			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon shows advance to Pounds 125.7m - Market awaiting decision on how Pounds 428m cash pile will be spent FALLING UK profits at MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing company, led to its first write off of advance corporation tax at a cost of Pounds 3.4m. Mr Anthony Hichens, chairman, said ACT this year would have been an even greater problem without last week's sale of the stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company. The problem should disappear as the UK economy recovers, especially if Caradon uses its Pounds 428m cash pile to buy a UK company, he said. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 125.7m in 1992 while turnover fell 2 per cent to Pounds 664.4m. UK profits were hit by continuing recession and one-off costs. At Everest, the replacement window and double glazing company, about Pounds 2m was lost after the company mistimed recovery. A further Pounds 3m of disruption costs were incurred in commissioning new radiator plants in the UK. In total, and including US restructuring, the company spent Pounds 11.7m on reorganisation during the year. Year end net borrowings increased by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 44.9m, giving gearing of 9 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 525.1m. On a fully diluted basis, earnings increased to 15.8p (15p) per share. The final dividend of 5.9p makes a total of 8.65p (8.43p). The shares fell 2p to 318p. COMMENT Hardly surprisingly, the market was far more interested in Caradon's takeover plans than yesterday's results - almost every name in the building materials sector has now been mooted as a target. Caradon insists it will not be hurried into making its move; equally, it will not wish to be seen to dither, especially with UK interest rates this low. The company appears to be preparing itself and its followers for a significant bid, preferably on a friendly rather than hostile basis, and it is likely to start looking in the UK or, possibly, Germany. Meantime, forecasting profits for this year will be difficult because of the exceptional and currency gains. But underlying earnings are likely to be little changed, reflecting recovery in the UK and US against a slowdown in Europe and the replacement of CMB profits by interest earnings. On that basis, the shares are trading on 20 times and look fully valued, even if investors decide Caradon now deserves to be rated as a building materials company rather than a conglomerate.</p>

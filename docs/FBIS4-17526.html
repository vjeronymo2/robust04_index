			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] The idea of civic accord has become nearly an  obsession in our society but so far none of the politicians and  leaders of different factions have shown particular enthusiasm  about the forthcoming signing of that document, which is to take  place on 28 April in the St. George Hall in the Kremlin.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent T. Aldoshina] Representatives of political  parties and public movements will be given air time and, with  it, an opportunity to make their opinion known to the people -  especially on the eve of the signing of the civic accord  agreement. Their right to do this is guaranteed by a  presidential decree. Its existence became known at today's  meeting of Boris Yeltsin with representatives of the factions of  the State Duma. This concession to the parties' demands was  made by the president in order to confirm that there are  alternatives to extremism and confrontation in Russia. The  obligations proclaimed by those who are going to sign the  agreement contain a hope for successful implementation of the  idea of civic peace.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] We are talking not about an  ordinary compromise. It is capable of saving Russia at the  present stage. At the same time, the participants in the  agreement are by no means renouncing their convictions,  programs, and platforms - there is no need for that. On the  contrary, one of the aims of the agreement is to offer to all  political forces peaceful, non-violent ways of achieving their  goals. [end recording]    [Aldoshina] Yeltsin aide Georgiy Satarov has described the  attitudes of the faction leaders to the idea of an all-saving  compromise, namely civic accord. In his opinion, virtually all  of those present at today's meeting with the president spoke in  favor of signing the agreement. The ubiquitous Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy was the first to support the president. The  Agrarians and Communists are also for it on the whole but they  have certain conditions, so it is not yet clear if they will  join the agreement together with the main group of signatories.  The Yabloko bloc was the only one to speak categorically  against signing it, in the sense that Yabloko is ready to do all  it can for the idea of civic peace and accord but does not  intend to sign any declarations.</p>

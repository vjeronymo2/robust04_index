			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDUCTOR BERNSTEIN  </P> <P> Myrna Oliver's obituary on Leonard Bernstein (Oct. 15) contained a phrasing  that perpetuates a negative stereotype of gay men and lesbians.  </P> <P> In explaining the 1987 published biography of Bernstein which documents his  relationships with men, she writes "Although . . . Bernstein had many  homosexual affairs . . . there was no question that he adored his family." The  implication is that homosexuals cannot adore their families or even have  families. Many gay men and lesbians do indeed have families and many are  adored.  </P> <P> PETER M. NARDI, Co-President  </P> <P> Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against  </P> <P> Defamation, Los Angeles  </P></p>

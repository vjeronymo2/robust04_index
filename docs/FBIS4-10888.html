			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by German </F> Sopena in Buenos Aires; date not given]    [Text] [Sopena] Some days ago, you were the first one to  confirm that Fidel Castro had a telephone conversation with  Carlos Menem. How many telephone contacts did they have and  what did they discuss?    [Robaina] As far as I know, there was only one telephone  conversation arranged by a common friend. With regard to the  topic of their conversation, I think that President Menem's  account of this talk corresponded better with the truth. In  other words, they discussed subjects that do not necessarily  have anything to do with politics.    [Sopena] With regard to the different approaches adopted by  Menem and Castro, why does it bother Cuba that a democratically  elected Latin American president, whether Menem or any other,  should say that Cuban citizens also ought to have the  opportunity to choose their rulers in freely contested elections?    [Robaina] It does not bother us at all, but I think that  both  countries face different realities. I believe that we should  not be questioned as if we lived in a normal country because my  country continues to be a country whose living conditions are  those of a besieged stronghold. And a besieged stronghold  cannot afford the luxuries it would aspire to if it lived under  normal conditions.    [Sopena] Has the accession of Bill Clinton to the U.S.  presidency somehow changed things?    [Robaina] No. Perhaps the only substantial public change is  that Clinton is not as aggressive as Bush. But leaving this  consideration aside, perhaps there is an even more repressive  stance on the trade embargo. Hence, there is no reason  whatsoever for being overly enthusiastic.    [Sopena] Let us imagine a possible scenario in which, in a  move comparable to Nixon when he recognized the PRC, President  Clinton decided to lift the embargo and Cuba became a country  just like the others. What would change in Cuba? Would there  be an economic and political opening?    [Robaina] Well, seeing is believing. However, I would say  that, under normal living conditions, Cuba will develop a work  system in which everything may be analyzed.    [Sopena] The embargo seems to be the main argument put  forward to explain Cuba's dire financial straits. But is it not  a way to hide the domestic economic system's inherent  inefficiencies, which have nothing to do with the embargo?    [Robaina] There is no denying the fact that there are  inefficiencies but, comparatively, the embargo continues to be  the main cause of our problems.    [Sopena] How far will the current economic opening drive go?    [Robaina] As far as it can adapt to our circumstances. We  will widen those possibilities as we become more acquainted with  the system once the foreign capital we need comes to our country  and is channeled into investments.    [Sopena] Would Cuba privatize some sectors of its economy?    [Robaina] We believe the state has proved that it is  efficient in many areas. There are others, however, in which we  have started to work together with the private sector.  Nevertheless, I think that a long road lies ahead of us so it  is still too early to evaluate what we will do afterward.    [Sopena] Does Castro wholly mistrust private activity?    [Robaina] Both Castro and all of us have seen that in some  places where the economy is administered by the private sector  it has proved to be efficient whereas in other places it has  not. Moreover, I believe that the neoliberal model has yielded  good results in some places and is teaching us things that we  have to study in-depth. This includes the partnership with the  private sector, and even the privatization of what has to be  privatized in some areas. However, one should not run away with  the idea that these changes will come overnight.    [Sopena] The world is changing rapidly nowadays. Does Cuba  not run the risk of staying behind?    [Robaina] We cannot afford to make mistakes because what  others do without being subject to pressure, we must accomplish  under pressure.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE MISSING IN CANYON FIGHT  </P> <P> It is not surprising that the feud between two neighbors over a canyon adjacent  to their property (June 6) should elicit a great deal of response. But to  castigate the family involved is to lack the perspective needed to judge their  action.  </P> <P> Gary and Charlene Dapelo received permits and went through planning reviews  like any other citizen. They did not build a toxic factory; they built a grass  field surrounded by trees.  </P> <P> There are probably not a dozen people in all of Orange County who could locate  the canyon in question. It is neither visible to, nor usable by, the public.  The reason? The above portion of the canyon was filled in to build roads nearly  30 years ago and homes up the canyon have all but obliterated it.  </P> <P> This was not an untouched priceless ecosystem; it was the last remnant of a  geological formation that has been destroyed acre by acre over the last three  decades.  </P> <P> The Dapelos' action is a microcosm of Orange County's development, similar to  the building in Laguna Canyon, the oak grove in San Clemente or the stretch of  once pristine coastline between Corona del Mar and Laguna.  </P> <P> The loss of California's open spaces is understandably mourned. But it is the  responsibility of the governing bodies to review the laws and represent the  people. Mr. Dapelo went through the proper procedures; he did not ignore or  subvert the process. It seems unfair to penalize him for what he was given full  entitlement to do.  </P> <P> JIM KEMPTON  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

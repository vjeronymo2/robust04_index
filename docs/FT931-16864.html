			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Israeli agent dies in stabbing: Palestinian shot dead in Gaza AN ISRAELI secret service officer was stabbed to death in Jerusalem yesterday and a Palestinian shot dead in the Gaza Strip as tensions persisted over deportation to Lebanon last month of 415 Palestinians accused of being Moslem militants from the occupied territories. Police said Mr Chaim Nachmani, a 25-year-old man stabbed and bludgeoned to death at an apartment in a wealthy inner suburb of Jerusalem, was an officer of the General Security Service, or Shin Bet, who was involved in an operation at the time. It said his killer, apparently an Arab, was known to the authorities, but gave no further details. Mr Nachmani was the first member of the security forces to be killed since Israeli carried out the controversial deportations on December 17. It was understood to be the first killing for 10 years of an officer of the Shin Bet. The service is responsible for much of the intelligence and undercover work carried out by Israeli forces in the occupied territories and is feared and hated by most Palestinians. Earlier in the Gaza Strip, an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot dead and 11 others were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops following the lifting of a four-day curfew on the heavily populated territory. Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, flew to Cairo to discuss the deportations, which threaten Middle East peace talks. Later Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said it would be 'really helpful to the peace process' if Israel would heed UN security council resolution 799 and reverse the deportations. But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told students before news of yesterday's killings the move had curbed Gaza and West Bank violence: 'It served as a real blow to the Islamic fundamentalist terror groups.' Israeli police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at thousands of ultra-orthodox Jews demonstrating in Jerusalem against the uncovering during building work of ancient graves.</p>

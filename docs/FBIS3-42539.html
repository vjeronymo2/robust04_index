			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Kalashnikova, under the rubric "Partners": </F> "TsAGI and NASA Have Signed a Memorandum on Cooperation: The  American Side Is Interested in the Russian Intellect and  Technologies"]    [Text] A delegation of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) visited Moscow for a working meeting with  officials of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) and  in connection with the anniversary celebrated by its TsAGI  colleagues. The head of the delegation, Wesley Harris -- the  deputy director of NASA -- is the immediate head of all four of  its research centers. The intensive two-day talks between Harris  and the deputy chairman of the State Committee on Defense  Sectors of Industry of Russia, Anatoliy Bratukhin, resulted in a  memorandum on cooperation between Russia and the United States  in the field of basic aviation research.    The document is to serve as one of the appendices in an  agreement on cooperation between Russia and the United States  that is supposed to be signed on 16 December 1993 at a meeting  between Vice President Albert Gore and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. On behalf of the Russian government, the appendix  will be countersigned by the chairman of the State Committee on  Defense Sectors of Industry, Viktor Glukhikh. The document is to  expand the possibilities for joint work that were alluded to in  the August agreement on cooperation in space.    It will be primarily TsAGI and the Central Institute of  Aviation Materials (VIAM) that will actively interact with NASA  on the research program outlined.    The American partners are interested primarily in the  Russian  intellectual potential, our methods of basic research, and a  number of "high-level technologies" that, in the United States,  are less effective or don't exist at all.    For TsAGI, in the words of its director, German Zagaynov,  the  signing of the agreement during the anniversary was profoundly  symbolic -- the document was initialed in the same room in which  A. N. Tupolev designed his first airplanes.</p>

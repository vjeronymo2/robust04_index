			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Sea Containers shows improvement Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based container leasing, ferries and hotels group, yesterday announced second quarter pre-tax profits down from Dollars 15.8m to Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 7m). The result was struck on turnover up from Dollars 97m to Dollars 115.5m. However, the figures for the corresponding period last time benefited from a non-recurring Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement of a long-standing claim against British Rail. Stripping out this gain, pre-tax profits for the period showed a near-40 per cent increase. After a tax charge of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 204,000 credit) net profits came out at Dollars 13.3m (Dollars 16.1m). Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 80 cents (Dollars 1.31 adjusted for scrip issue). This brings pre-tax profits for the half year to end-June to Dollars 4.75m (Dollars 5.34m) on revenue ahead to Dollars 193.8m (Dollars 172.8m).</p>

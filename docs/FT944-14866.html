			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Brazil moves to underpin currency and curb inflation Brazil has moved to curb foreign investment flows and limit consumer credit as part of wide-ranging measures to underpin its new currency, the Real, and head off inflation. The measures include a one-off 1 per cent tax on foreign investment into the stock market, and an increase in tax on Brazilian companies issuing bonds overseas from 3 per cent to 7 per cent of the total. The tax paid by foreigners on fixed interest investments in Brazil is to be raised from 5 per cent to 9 per cent. The central bank also raised limits on the amount of dollars that could be bought in the foreign exchange market. Financial markets reacted calmly yesterday to the measures. A private sector banker said the measures were welcome, even if they led to a short-term dip in foreign investment. 'It is next year that the real investment will come,' he said. The Real was steady yesterday at 0.86 against the dollar, while Sao Paulo's stock market slipped less than 1 per cent in moderate volume to close at 47,244. The package follows the introduction of the new currency in July under an anti-inflation plan drafted by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, then finance minister, who went on to win the presidential election earlier this month. The Real's introduction has cut monthly inflation from 50 per cent to less than 2 per cent. However, the new currency has appreciated more than 15 per cent against the dollar since July, partly because of inflows of foreign capital attracted by Brazil's high interest rates and promising stock market. The inflow has put pressure on the exchange rate, leading to complaints from exporters that it is making their goods uncompetitive. Some of the measures, including changes in export credit arrangements and the removal of limits on dollar purchases in the foreign exchange markets, are designed to stop further appreciation of the Real. Outgoing president, Mr Itamar Franco, denied the package had been held back until after the elections to assist Mr Cardoso's chances, but said it would help him keep the economy on track next year. Mr Franco also denied the measures would lead to recession, as some consumer groups claim. The package includes tighter rules on credit cards and shorter repayment periods on some of Brazil's most popular forms of consumer credit. Since the Real's launch, sales of consumer goods such as televisions and cars have increased sharply, many financed by credit. , a director of department store group Mappin, one of Brazil's largest, said the measures would 'definitely affect demand'. although traffic in the stores was normal yesterday morning. The measures to tax foreign investment were also seen as a move towards an interest rate rise. Without the new taxes, any rate rise would have accelerated the flow of foreign investment into fixed rate securities, adding to pressure on the exchange rate. Brazilian bond issues on the Euromarkets is expected to decline, following issuance this year of more than Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn). But investors say the price of Brazil's existing dollar denominated bonds could rise.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Community to resume Lebanese aid A EUROPEAN Community team will visit Beirut next week to co-ordinate resumption of economic co-operation with Lebanon, after the last two western hostages, two German aid workers, arrived in Cologne yesterday. Lebanese officials hope the end of the hostage crisis after the liberation of Mr Heinrich Strubig and Mr Thomas Kemptner, will encourage a return of western investors. The EC is unfreezing Ecu166m (Pounds 117m) in financial aid, comprising Ecu41m in grants, Ecu3m in risk capital and Ecu122m in loans from the European Investment Bank. Mr David Tatham, the British ambassador in Lebanon, confirmed there would be no more delays in European assistance to the Beirut government, which is suffering from a severe economic crisis made worse by shortfalls in expected reconstruction aid. Mr Tatham said European- financed projects were being drawn up with Mr Fadel Shallak, the president of the government's Council for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Shallak has also begun negotiations with World Bank officials in Washington. After three years' captivity, Mr Strubig and Mr Kemptner were handed over yesterday to Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, a special German envoy, in the office of Mr Rashid Solh, Lebanese prime minister. It was the first time western hostages were freed under the auspices of the Lebanese rather than the Syrian government. 'The release of the German hostages closes the dark chapter of hostage-taking in Lebanon forever,' said Mr Solh. Mr Giandomenico Picco, the United Nations envoy principally responsible for their liberation, said that contrary to earlier press reports, the two Germans had been held by their kidnappers until yesterday morning. The 'Holy Warriors for Freedom' led by Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, an official of the pro-Iranian Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement, fulfilled their promise to liberate their captives within 48 hours of a statement issued on Monday. Christopher Parkes adds from Bonn: The release clears the way for a visit to Germany by Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister. Mr Dieter Vogel, the Bonn government spokesman, said economic links had already much improved in the past year.</p>

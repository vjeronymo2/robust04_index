			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Technology: Globetrotters at spaghetti junction - Technically Speaking Advertisements for notebook computers are so exotic. They usually feature Club Class man, dashing from office to airport, from airport to hotel - always with his little electronic wonder under his arm, ready to perform wherever he goes, set to plug in to data banks anywhere in the world. Would it were so. Alas, in reality, use of notebook computers continues to be stymied by the protectionist designs of the world's electrical and telecoms utilities. In the past year I have struggled with a variety of electrical and telecom sockets in Japan, India, Austria, Switzerland, France, Britain, Canada and the US, and have more than once been tempted to stomp my little wonder to bits. Electricity is the life blood of notebook personal computers because batteries tend to be short lived. But the globetrotting PC user had better be prepared for trouble of two kinds. The first is voltage, which varies from 100 to 240 in the above-mentioned countries. Some PCs come with a converter that adjusts automatically. Others are not so well equipped, so two converters may have to be carried. The second problem is the plethora of plug-socket standards around the world. This has been largely solved by the design of universal adaptors available in most airports. But be warned - the Swiss have out-smarted even them, with a recessed, lozenge-shaped socket good only for their very own three-pronged plugs. Telecoms companies too have been imaginative. The introduction of plug-in telephones dates back about 30 years, but their spread outside of North America is much more recent. Still, only Japan, among the countries I have experienced, took the sensible route of adopting the US-Canadian RJ standard plug-socket system. This is sensible because most modems are equipped with RJ sockets. The easiest way to get around this problem is to buy a cable that has an RJ plug at one end and the local plug at the other. These are not always easy to find (and in some countries are illegal), but often at international conferences, embarrassed reps of the local PTT can be seen handing them out to frazzled foreign PC users. Thus, our globetrotting club class man probably needs a second suitcase filled with an array of plugs, sockets, adaptors, converters and cables. Even then, his problems may not be over. The Swiss PTT, among others, transmits high-pitched tones that record the passing of each charge segment during a customer's call. Most users are not aware of them because the beep is suppressed on Swiss PTT-approved telephones. But they play havoc with PC modems. You have to buy a special cable equipped with what is called a 'tax impulse filter' to get rid of them. You can avoid carrying around a suitcase full of spaghetti if you are willing to spend a bit of time opening up telephone junction boxes and attaching wires from your computer. In preparation for this trespassing, take a cable with an RJ plug at one end and expose the wires at the other. All telephone circuits around the world are basically the same, consisting of only two wires. Many PTTs try and confuse the would-be trespasser by surrounding them with several other wires, but it takes only a short time to sus out the real ones. Another gambit that worked in Delhi once was to use the telecom line attached to a facsimile machine. Most facsimile machines, like modems, are equipped with an RJ socket, so it is simply a matter of pulling out the plug from the fax machine and putting it into the modem. I read an article recently claiming that a US telecoms company was beginning to install coin boxes equipped with an RJ socket specifically for the mobile PC user. It sounded too good to be true. Perhaps it was written by a PC user with a vivid imagination. Or perhaps I was dreaming.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Home Office strike 'had little effect' A ONE-DAY strike yesterday by 9,000 Home Office workers belonging to the two largest Civil Service unions had little effect on the public, the department's management said. Officials of the CPSA and NUCPS unions said passport offices and airport immigration desks were disrupted by the strike. The unions are protesting about the contracting out and market testing of government functions. The Home Office said staff had walked out 'in considerable numbers' but services were still provided. The unions are seeking assurances that staff will not be made compulsorily redundant and will be protected by employment legislation if services are contracted out.</p>

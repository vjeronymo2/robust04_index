			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE WINS ON LATE FIELD GOAL  </P> <P> Garden Grove High School's Adrian Ioja kicked a 26-yard field goal with 11  seconds left Friday to give the Argonauts a 6-3 victory over Santiago in a  Garden Grove League game.  </P> <P> Seven minutes after Santiago's Dan Agramont kicked a 32-yard field goal at the  start of the second quarter, Ioja tied the game with a 36-yarder of his own.  </P> <P> Neither team was able to score again until the fourth quarter. Garden Grove  quarterback Simon Fuentes (three of seven for 56 yards) marched the Argonauts  (2-3 overall, 1-1 in league) for four first downs and got them within  field-goal range, but Ioja missed a 38-yarder.  </P> <P> But neither Fuentes nor Ioja was through. With less than a minute left in the  game, Fuentes hit wide receiver Jason Baca with a 36-yard pass, and Santiago  (1-4, 1-1)was called for a face-mask penalty. Three plays later, Ioja redeemed  himself with the game-winner.  </P> <P> "Our defense finally showed up for a ballgame," said Buenafe.  </P> <P> The Garden Grove defense held quarterback Mike Carrasco to five completions in  15 attempts for 57 yards and an interception and minus-26 yards rushing,  Santiago carried for just 11 yards.HEATHER SMALLEY  </P></p>

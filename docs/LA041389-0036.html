			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: GOOD MARKS FOR GOLD SHEAFFER PENS  </P> <P> Question: My mother has a fountain pen made by the Sheaffer Pen Co. in the  early 1920s. The tip is 14-karat gold. A friend of hers told her these pens are  worth quite a bit of money. She would like to know if there is someone who  could tell her something about it. -- M.A.  </P> <P> Answer: Cliff Lawrence, who founded the Pen Fancier's Club in 1976, said if the  Sheaffer is in fine condition, it could bring more than $300 in the collectible  marketplace -- but added that it should still be a practical writing pen to  enhance its value.  </P> <P> There are about 5,000 pen collectors in this country, many of them belong to  the Pen Fancier's Club, 1169 Overcash Drive, Dunedin, Fla. 34698; telephone  (813) 734-4742. Lawrence said about 2,500 subscribers worldwide take the club's  monthly magazine for an annual fee of $30.  </P> <P> Lawrence, 56, a former lab technician-turned writing-instrument dealer, said he  also publishes a mail-order list, which generates sales of up to 200 pens a  month.  </P> <P> "Most people who collect in this country are professional people," he said in a  recent telephone interview. "Dentists are big collectors." So are residents of  Italy, Japan and France, he added.  </P> <P> Just writing a letter was an adventure until the 1880s, Lawrence said, when  Lewis Edson Waterman developed the first fountain pen that could carry its own  supply of ink and write without gushing all over the paper or, indeed, running  dry.  </P> <P> "He started everything," he said.  </P> <P> Eventually, along came W. A. Sheaffer, a jeweler by trade, forming a fountain  pen company in Springfield, Mass., along with a factory in Fort Madison, Iowa,  where he lived. He prospered after he patented a pen filled by use of a lever  in 1908.  </P> <P> By 1912, Sheaffer was successfully mass producing pens. By this time he had  modified a process marketed by another firm, the Conklin Pen Co., which allowed  him to be the first to succeed with a pen that pumped ink up through the nib  from a bottle.  </P> <P> Then, during the 1920s, Sheaffer "introduced the lifetime pen with a white dot  on the top of the cap," Lawrence said.  </P> <P> "Sheaffer took a lot of pride in the points. The number (on the point) gave the  pen an individuality to keep track of when the pen was made."  </P> <P> What's more, Lawrence said, "any old Sheaffer pen is collectible. A good  Sheaffer in a large size can be worth $350."  </P> <P> As for his passion for fountain pens, Lawrence said he became interested in  pens during World War II when he was growing up in Lansdowne, Pa.  </P> <P> Pens and watches, he recalled, were about the only things of value being  marketed during the war. The reason, he said, was the general lack of  restrictions on products using gold and silver content, in contrast to a dearth  of brass, aluminum, tin and other strategic metals being utilized for the war.  </P> <P> "You can imagine a 13-year-old kid going to the drugstore for soda and there  were velvet-lined boxes with some of the most beautiful pens and pencils you  ever saw," he said.  </P> <P> Lawrence had about 30 pens, he said, but during a tour in the Navy during the  Korean War, his collection was lost.  </P> <P> "Then, in the early 1970s, my mother found one of my pens, a Sheaffer lifetime  pen," he said. "At the time, I was collecting radios. I dropped the radios and  went back searching for pens."  </P> <P> Although collecting fountain pens was "an addiction like any other collecting,"  Lawrence said he no longer collects them, but rather concentrates on the sales  of collectible pens.  </P> <P> "I've gotten pens no one could have found," he said.  </P> <P> He vividly remembered, for example, selling for $4,500 in 1986 a Parker snake  pen. It was so called because a French jeweler had wrapped the barrel with a  solid sterling silver snake with emerald eyes along with a similar snake around  the cap.  </P> <P>  Soble cannot answer mail personally but will respond in this column to  questions of general interest about collectibles.

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER NEA FUNDS FOR ART  </P> <P> The NEA isn't the stock market, no matter how much Fein and Meese would like it  to be. It's no wonder that 25 years of NEA funding seems interminable to people  who are always looking for a fast buck and higher return on their investments.  </P> <P> They expect masterworks to be produced and acknowledged in that short space of  time, when the examples they cite have been around for decades, even centuries.  The idea that great visual art is what garners the highest bids "at Southeby or  Christie auctions" is yet another symptom of the malignant Reagan era money  mentality: the measure of quality is in the price tag.  </P> <P> The proposal to shift NEA funds to education is admirable but redundant. All  art is, by its very nature, public, inclusive, revealing, enlightening -- in  other words, educational.  </P> <P> NEA grants aren't "government protection against free consumer choice." Rather,  they are seed money for artistic gardens which, with diligence and luck, will  prosper and perhaps, given years of critical and popular consideration, bloom  into the accepted masterworks of the world and give joy and stimulation to  everyone. And for the notion that art experts are "feasting off taxpayers'  dollars" -- well, let's just say that no single artist is getting rich from NEA  money. The price the government has paid certain military suppliers for a small  bag of bolts and a toilet seat or two could float an entire colony of artists  for years.  </P> <P> DAVID DRUMMOND  </P> <P> AUSTIN GRAY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

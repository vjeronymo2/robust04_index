			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rothmans and Vendome shares excluded from indices NEW SHARES to be issued by Rothmans and Vendome following the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods empire will not be included in the UK stock market indices, including the FT-SE 100. However, both of SmithKline Beecham's classes of shares - A shares and equity units - will remain in the indices. The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices steering committee decided not to approve a change to the rule on the definition of a UK company, proposed in September, at a meeting on Wednesday. The proposed change would have excluded both the new Rothmans companies and the SB units, and caused an outcry from the companies and from stock market practitioners. Mr Mark Makepeace, secretary to the steering committee, said that the SB units were a secondary line of a recognised UK company, and should therefore be included. The new Rothmans and Vendome capital structures each involve two companies, of which one will be UK registered. Mr Makepeace said that as investors will be able to choose not to take any franked dividends - that is dividends on which UK tax has already been paid  -it was hard to decide what percentage of the new companies would be British, and the percentage could fluctuate. Mr Hugh Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, said yesterday he was delighted that the units would remain in the indices, although he was 'disappointed that this anomaly has not been resolved once and for all'. An adviser to Rothmans said the decision was 'eccentric'. Currently Rothmans is regarded as a UK company for indices purposes. The two new companies will encompass the businesses of the old Rothmans but will not be counted as UK companies. The adviser said that when the reorganisation takes effect on October 25, 'some people will feel they have to sell the shares'. Fund managers compare their portfolios' performance to the stock market indices. One broker said, 'a lot of institutional fund managers are cross that Rothmans is not in'. He added that, in the longer term, companies not included in the indices became 'orphans' with few followers.</p>

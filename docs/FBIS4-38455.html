			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt report in the "Russia in a Transcaucasian </F> Settlement" column: "`Letters from Working People' Have Started  Coming to Comrade Aliyev"]    [Text] Judging by reports from Azerbaijan, pressure on the  opposition is mounting there. This could result in the  dissolution of parliament and imposition of presidential rule.    According to the TURAN agency, recently Geydar Aliyev held a  closed conference where it was decided to clamp down on the  opposition. The reprisals were prompted by criticism of plans  for a Karabakh settlement based on Russian proposals (providing  for the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict zone).  It is not ruled out that Aliyev will also dissolve the National  Assembly. The day before yesterday Panakh Shakhsevenli, leader  of the National Liberation Party, was arrested.    The Baku police have dispersed several rallies in the past  few days while "letters from workers" have inundated Azerbaijan  newspapers, demanding that "things be put in order." For  instance, 940 refugees from Lachin wrote in AZERBAIJAN: "The  riff-raff from the National Front are preventing you (Aliyev --  KOMMERSANT-DAILY) from restoring peace. Comrade Aliyev, the  sooner you stifle them, the better. We are ready to come to  Baku and hang them in a central square." Parliamentary  opposition members have already felt that something was wrong:  On pain of forced rotation, 17 deputies who walked out of the  National Assembly in protest against the "treacherous agreement  on Karabakh," returned to the chamber.    Yet all of this does not mean that Aliyev himself accepts  the  Russian plan: He stands by his phrase pronounced on 19 May,  "Russian troops will never return to Azerbaijan." In this,  incidentally, Aliyev is also supported by the United States.  The day before yesterday the State Department said that the  efforts by the Minsk CSCE group (its plan proposes peace-keeping  operations only under UN and CSCE auspices) is the path that  will lead to a durable settlement of the conflict.    Friction over Russian troops could be augmented by oil  disagreements. On 23 May Aliyev received representatives of the  oil consortium (British Petroleum, Statoil, Amoco, Pennsoil,  Remco, Macdermott, Turkish Petrol, and Lukoil) and told them  that some minor details have to be coordinated before signing  the contract. He also let drop this phrase (cited according to  the TURAN report): "As for the status of the Caspian, the sector  which is being developed by the republic refers to Azerbaijan."    Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry long ago sent a  letter to the British Foreign Office (the British BP company  plays a leading role in the consortium), recalling that under  the Soviet-Iranian agreements on the state border, all the  Caspian resources in the USSR territorial waters were Soviet  property. In the Russian Foreign Ministry's interpretation,  after the disintegration of the Union the resources beyond the  12-mile zone should be regarded as the "common property of the  Caspian states." This is reason enough for Moscow's close  attention to the oil talks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 27 (AFP) -- Two inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are on their way to  North Korea to replace their two colleagues who have been  working at the contentious Yongbyon plant for several weeks, an  IAEA spokesman said Monday [27 June].    Hans-Friedrich Meyer said the two new inspectors, who should  arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday, will continue supervision of the  experimental nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometres (56  miles) north of the capital.    North Korea created a crisis earlier this month by refusing  to allow international supervision to check whether material has  been diverted from the Yongbyon complex for military use.    One of the two inspectors currently in Korea will leave  Tuesday and the other will leave at the end of the week after  briefing his two colleagues, Meyer said.    "It is essential for us that two inspectors remain on the  spot," Meyer stressed, adding that the two officials obtained  visas without any trouble.    The duration of the inspectors' visit has not been fixed,  but  an "old rule" of the atomic watchdog fixes inspectors' tours of  duty at three weeks.    Bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea  are  scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 8.    North Korea paved the way for the new talks by agreeing not  to refuel the reactor, and not to reprocess nuclear fuel -- to  make the plutonium needed to manufacture atomic weapons -- and  to allow the IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea.</p>

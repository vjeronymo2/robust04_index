			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / E German shipbuilding row forces resignation EAST Germany's shipbuilding crisis has claimed its first political victim, Mr Alfred Gomolka, prime minister of the economically troubled state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - adding to the woes of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). Mr Gomolka is to resign today after losing a vote of confidence at the weekend within the CDU. He fell from favour after dismissing his justice minister, Mr Ulrich Born, who had criticised his support for the sale to western shipbuilders of three large shipyards. The dispute centred on Mr Gomolka's unpopular move to privatise the shipyards, the region's main industry, by splitting them instead of merging them into one company as demanded by unions. He is the third east German CDU prime minister to lose his post following the state leaders of Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. All were officials in the CDU when it was closely allied with the ruling Communist party. The upset underlined the CDU's shaky organisation in the east, a region that is crucial to Chancellor Kohl's chances of retaining power in the next general election in 1994. The CDU has lost a series of state elections in the west but still controls four of east Germany's five states.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hang Seng Bank ahead 26% in stiff competition HANG Seng Bank, a listed subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, yesterday reported a 26 per cent growth in 1992 net earnings to HKDollars 5.69bn (USDollars 736m), from HKDollars 4.5bn in 1991. The profits, reported on a full-disclosure basis, were better than expected. They were seen as positive for Hongkong Bank, which has the largest banking presence in Hong Kong and owns 61.5 per cent of Hang Seng. But Hang Seng's directors emphasised the low growth and competitive nature of business in Hong Kong. Deposits and advances grew by only 6 per cent against nominal growth in the colony's economy of nearly 15 per cent. Mr Alexander Au, deputy chief executive, said the bank expected a year of steady growth. 'It is too much to expect spectacular growth year after year,' he said. The directors said last year the bank emphasised trade finance and project finance. It has sought profit growth from non-interest income sources, notably foreign exchange trading and treasury operations, and from investment, fee income and rents from properties. They also noted that Hang Seng had embarked on a programme of rationalisation. This would involve improving the operation of its 126 branches in Hong Kong, and the centralisation of back-office functions. They said the implementation of these measures would boost economies of scale - including savings in manpower and the release of office space for rental - and reduce its already low cost-to-income ratio. To mark Hang Seng's 60th anniversary, directors declared a special dividend of 27 cents a share and a one-for-10 bonus issue. This was in addition to a final dividend of HKDollars 1.17 a share and a one-for-five bonus issue.</p>

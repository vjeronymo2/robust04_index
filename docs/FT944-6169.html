			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Retirees able to defer annuities until rates rise - Personal pensions Members of a tax-approved personal pension scheme will be allowed to defer purchasing an annuity at pension date, if they wish, until age 75. They will also be able to withdraw amounts during the deferral period which are broadly equivalent to the annuity that their fund could have provided. The changes will take effect after Royal assent is given to the finance bill. Under the tax rules an annuity must be purchased when any benefit is taken from a personal pension fund. This means that people who retire when annuity rates are low may have to buy a considerably smaller annuity than they could have done with the same fund if they had been able to postpone purchase until annuity rates were more favourable. Under the proposed measures, personal pension scheme members who defer purchasing an annuity will be able to make income withdrawals in the deferral period broadly equivalent to the annuity that their fund could have provided. Income withdrawals will be reviewed every three years to ensure the pension fund is not too rapidly depleted. Investment income and capital gains will continue to build up tax-free during the deferral period. The proposed measures will apply whether or not members elect to take the tax-free lump sum at pension date. Amendments are proposed to allow the trustees or managers of approved pension schemes to purchase annuities from certain insurance companies established in other European Union countries. One of the ways that tax-approved occupational and personal pension schemes provide benefits is by securing pensions through the purchase of an annuity from a life insurance company. At present the tax rules limit annuities to those provided by UK-authorised insurers. The Third Life Insurance Directive creates a single market in insurance products throughout the EU. Under the Budget proposal, the range of insurance companies that can provide annuities to tax-approved pension schemes will be extended to include those in other EU member states. It will, however, be necessary for the foreign insurance company to appoint a fiscal representative in the UK (or enter into other arrangements) to secure compliance with the company's tax obligations.</p>

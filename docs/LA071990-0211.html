			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> REGAL CANYON ROAD WORK  </P> <P> Complaining that neighborhood safety is being compromised by an absence of  sidewalks, a group of Walnut residents have persuaded the City Council to fund  the improvement along Regal Canyon Road south of Amar Road.  </P> <P> The residents, who appeared before the council last week, cited a traffic study  that showed that 479 vehicles pass along the road each day. They argued that  children can't ride their bicycles along the winding road without peril and  that pedestrians are at risk of being hit by vehicles.  </P> <P> Before unanimously approving the construction of sidewalks at a maximum cost of  $20,000, the council asked city staff to determine how many other streets lack  sidewalks and to define the city's responsibility in installing them.  </P></p>

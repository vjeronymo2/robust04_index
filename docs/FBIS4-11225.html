			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said yesterday that  "Chile is against protectionism and the formation of closed  trade blocs, as we want to avoid having the world fall into  trade wars that are harmful to trade and investment." Aninat  made this comment in a speech before the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) Assembly in Guadalajara, Mexico.    He added that Chile will use every international meeting to  denounce this practice. He noted that "after long efforts to  increase the quantity and variety of its goods and services,  Chile is operating with an export capability of 33 percent to  the Latin American countries, 31.8 percent to Europe, and 31  percent to Asia. [no closing quotation marks as published]    Aninat also proposed the formation of open and sophisticated  regional groups for investment and international trade.    He added that the Chilean Government was pleased to hear the  reaffirmation made by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  that Chile continues to be the primary candidate for joining  NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], made up of the  United States, Mexico, and Canada, or for negotiating a  bilateral agreement "because we are not against either of the  two formulas," said Aninat.    Aninat also recognized the contribution made by the IDB for  regional integration. He expressed optimism that this  organization would support the hemispheric summit called by  President Bill Clinton in Miami next December.</p>

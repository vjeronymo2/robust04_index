			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] People have wondered why the two-headed government  opposed and refused to raise the issue of national  reconciliation at the unconditional roundtable in Pyongyang.    Observers said the roundtable in Pyongyang ended without  producing any significant results. People held that it was all  because the two-headed government refused to talk about national  reconciliation as desired by the entire Cambodian nation and  people.    The goal of this unconditional roundtable was to discuss  national reconciliation. However, the two-headed government  under the command of the communist Vietnamese and the Western  alliance clearly saw that the so-called unconditional roundtable  would surely examine different aspects of the issue of national  reconciliation. This stress on national reconciliation was a  bitter pill for them to swallow; it was a blow to their heads at  the roundtable. But the masses were well aware of the  importance of national reconciliation at the roundtable. They  saw who was good, who was bad, who wanted national  reconciliation and peace, who continued to kindle the flames of  war, who continued to attack others, and who were defending  themselves. It was for this reason that the two-headed  government refused to raise the subject of national  reconciliation and instead brought up other aspects which  opposed and buried national reconciliation.    All this once again clearly shows that the two-headed  government does not want national reconciliation, because the  communist Vietnamese and the alliance of Western powers do not  want national reconciliation; this is because they oppose it and  want only to continue the war. They are fishing in troubled  waters and are scrambling to promote their own interests.    The Cambodian nation and people see clearly that it is  necessary to join forces and carry on the struggle, pending  national reconciliation, and fight to end the Vietnamese war of  aggression as soon as possible.    The two-headed government under the command of the communist  Vietnamese and Western alliance continues to oppose the king's  national reconciliation initiative and kindle the flames of war  in Cambodia. When they were leaving for the roundtable in  Pyongyang, which was purported to be held without any  preconditions, Prince Ranariddh, representing the American  puppets, and Hun Sen, representing the communist Vietnamese  puppets, repeatedly set a precondition by calling for a  cease-fire; whereas at home the puppet General Staff in Phnom  Penh informed all their military units that there was no  cease-fire whatsoever and that the cease-fire announced by the  two-headed government was just a political ploy.    During the roundtable on 27 May, the two categories of  puppets under the command of the communist Vietnamese and  Western alliance did not mention the issue of national  reconciliation at all. On the contrary, they raised the same  preconditions that they had regularly set before.    On the cease-fire issue, the party of Democratic Kampuchea  was of the opinion that in order for the cease-fire to proceed  correctly and effectively it should be jointly controlled by  observation groups made up of all Cambodian parties and five  neutral countries, to be located in central, eastern, and  western Cambodia. However, the two categories of puppets were  opposed to the idea of allowing neutral countries to take part  in supervising this cease-fire. That was an intentional  obstacle created to sabotage the national reconciliation  roundtable in Pyongyang.    The majority of opinion both inside and outside the country  clearly saw that the two-headed government under the command of  the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance did not want  national reconciliation and peace. They wanted only to continue  igniting the war; so they urged their two puppets to attack the  people and resistance forces while taking the opportunity to  further their own strategic interests. The communist Vietnamese  wanted to take the opportunity to bring more Vietnamese  nationals into Cambodia and expand the size of the already over  4 million Vietnamese immigrant population to 6, 7, 8 or 10  million in order to demographically annex Cambodia and  exterminate the Cambodian race. As for the two categories of  puppets, they are too intoxicated by dollars and inebriated by  power. They forget everything Cambodian. Instead, they are  foolishly forcing the children of the people to go to the  battlefields and die in their place. They will do anything so  long as they can preserve their corrupt power and continue to  embezzle and build up their own personal interests at the  expense of the people and their children's lives.    This is an act of treason to the nation and people, an act  of selling out the nation to foreigners. As a matter of fact,  the two-headed government is doing everything at the command of  the communist Vietnamese and Western alliance. They do not want  to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation and peace. If  Cambodia achieved national reconciliation and became unified, it  would affect the communist Vietnamese strategy of swallowing up  Cambodian territory. So, the Cambodian nation and people have  no other alternative but to continue joining hands and holding  aloft the banner of the struggle for their own defense until  genuine national reconciliation and peace are achieved and  happiness brought back to the country and the national  community, thus allowing the people to live their normal lives.    Do the communist Vietnamese puppets and the communist  Vietnamese, whose desire is only to annex Cambodian territory,  have any desire to see Cambodia achieve national reconciliation  and peace?    Before he went to Pyongyang for the roundtable, puppet Hun  Sen vociferously announced that he did not want to hold talks  with the Khmer Rouge and did not expect any results. He said he  went to the roundtable just to placate other people. These  remarks show that the communist Vietnamese, the communist  Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance have not changed their  stance. They continue to oppose the king's national  reconciliation plan.    The stance of the party of Democratic Kampuchea is well  known  to our nation and people. It is for peace and national  reconciliation and it supports the king's national  reconciliation plan. The Vietnamese puppets under the command  of their bosses, the communist Vietnamese, have demanded that  Democratic Kampuchea hand over the liberated zones to them and  dissolve its army so that the communist Vietnamese and the  alliance can control and run Cambodia as they please. More to  the point, they have aimed at crushing the national liberation  resistance movement to enable Vietnam to incorporate Cambodia  into its Indochinese federation. This is part of the  long-standing, threadbare strategy and stance of the communist  Vietnamese; nothing has changed. For this reason, can one rely  on the communist Vietnamese and their puppets for national  reconciliation, national concord, and peace? No. The communist  Vietnamese want to do away with all of us who are Cambodians in  order to turn our Cambodian territory into a part of Vietnam.  As for the Vietnamese puppets such as Chea Sim, Hun Sen, Sar  Kheng, and others, they are merely elements installed in power  by Vietnam to serve Vietnam's war of aggression, which has been  going on since 1979. They are Vietnam's out-and-out lackeys  serving Vietnamese interests 100 percent. They never care about  the interests of the Cambodian nation and people. Their nature  is Vietnamese. They only want to kill Cambodians just as the  Vietnamese, their bosses, do. Our nation and people know the  true nature of the Vietnamese and their puppets. We never hoped  that they would mercifully bestow peace and national  reconciliation on Cambodia. Hearing the aforementioned rotten  remarks of puppet Hun Sen is more than enough.    Past, present, and future experiences in Cambodia and the  world show that no one should expect aggressors to give away  peace and independence. The peace, independence, and survival  of any country facing aggression can be won only through the  struggle of the people in that country. This is true for  Cambodia. If we want to achieve peace and national  reconciliation, our entire nation and people both in the cities  and the countryside must join hands and wage the struggle by all  possible means until our nation and people achieve genuine  peace, national reconciliation, independence, and national unity.</p>

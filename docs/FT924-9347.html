			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (8): A state of chassis - Angela Long seeks a road out of the dark ages A BOREEN, in Irish, is a little back road, likely to feature overgrown hedgerows and an assortment of potholes. Charming as they are, they are not exactly suitable for large transport vehicles. Ireland is full of boreens. One of the attractions of endorsing the Maastricht treaty in last June's referendum, according to the government headed by Mr Albert Reynolds, was the IPounds 6bn in EC funds which would build bigger, better roads and other infrastructural necessities. A standard map of Europe map shows the difference between road networks on mainland Europe and those in Ireland. While German, Dutch and French motorways appear as black spiders' webs on the page, Ireland boasts a few lines: the N1 down the east coast, the N6 across from Dublin to the west and the N7 down to Limerick and Cork. Irish people in their early thirties can remember national rejoicing when the double carriageway on the Naas road was opened. These few miles of modern road linking the capital with a town to its south-west represented a symbolic breakthrough to the world of the autobahn, which Ireland must join  -or be forever peripheral in every sense. As recently as two years ago Mr Oliver Haslette, the then president of the Construction Industry Federation, was complaining that Ireland was 'in the Dark Ages' as far as transport went, with 'the most diabolical roads you could imagine.' - But more than 40 important road projects presently eat up about IPounds 600m of government funds - plus the essential EC funds - across Ireland. The National Roads Authority (set up in 1988) and local authorities are charged with carrying out the planning. The National Development Plan adopted by the government in 1989 gives priority to improving Ireland's supply infrastructure, emphasising the vital sea routes and small but growing air freight; sea, road and rail account for nearly 99 per cent of freight carried to and from Ireland. The Industrial Development Authority likes to mention the telecommunications network, recipient of big investment in the 1980s, as another important component of Ireland's infrastructure. But roads - to carry goods and agricultural produce to the ferry ports of the east coast - are the first plank in the policy. Of these, the Dublin Port Access road project is the biggest in cash terms; its budget is IPounds 96m. Athlone, smack in the middle of Ireland, is a town which benefited typically from a new road which was Ireland's largest single civil engineering venture. Before the 1990s, Athlone's had main street was choked with trans-national traffic heading for Galway and points west. The Athlone bypass has changed that. Other towns, such as Arklow in County Wexford, are scheduled to get the same relief. Improving local quality of life is one thing; improving the livelihoods of the local people is another - a prospect arising from the hoped-for increase in export/import trade after the Channel tunnel speeds journey times to continental Europe. 30 per cent of Irish exports go to Britain, but there is a big balance for the continent and beyond. More than half of the inward-bound bulk shipments on ferries (oil and coal, for example) come from countries outside the EC. The Republic has four main ports, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare. Roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) services go only to the UK and France, but the lift on/lift off services (lo/lo) also go to the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Belgium (Antwerp) and Germany (Hamburg). Much of the present sense of crisis is because of the imminent opening of the Channel Tunnel. The thought of being the only country in the EC without direct road/rail access in the market of 350m consumers is a psychological handicap for Irish exporters. Commentators point out that a joint, concerted, Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland transport strategy is the best solution for both. Dr Con Power, chairman of the interim National Roads Authority is among those who have taken to task both Dublin and Westminster for the lack of any integrated transport policy. It would apply not only to roads: the rail link between the two capitals also needs to be upgraded and provided with fresh rolling stock. The Chartered Institute of Transport recently declared that Ireland would have to spend IPounds 2bn on urgent infrastructure projects if her competitiveness were not to be seriously affected. Apart from the familiar arguments about roads and upgrading ports, the CIT estimates that 60 new rail locomotives are needed, and 14 new ships should ply the sea routes to Britain and mainland Europe (a point emphasised by the tragic deaths of two teenagers last August, when an old ventilation system on board a ferry malfunctioned, producing toxic gas. While the rest of Ireland grumbles that it misses out on Dublin's advantages of being close to the ports, and campaigns for new roads, Dublin labours under the burden of its traffic problem. The port is right on top of the city centre; heavy transport vehicles clog famous thoroughfares. The government has commissioned a report, combining civil servants, consultants and interest group submissions, on ways to handle Dublin's existing traffic and divert vehicles which have to use the central routes because there are no obvious alternatives. It is having a long and quarrelsome gestation.</p>

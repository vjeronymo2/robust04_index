			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (1): Tiger-like aspirations - A third world success story in the 1980s, the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius seeks now to integrate closely with the world economy. But the islanders' easy-going style may be at odds with long term ambitions WHEN a finance minister describes a 4.9 per cent real growth in GDP over the past year as 'a fairly good performance', he is surely indulging in understatement. Or he manages the economy of Mauritius. The year ahead will be better, Mr Ramakrishnan Sithanen reassured listeners to his budget address in June: he forecast growth of over 6 per cent. This was more in line with what Mauritians have come to expect. Over the past decade, the Indian Ocean island has maintained a record of sustained development remarkable by international standards, and positively phenomenal in comparison to Africa, some 1,500km to the west. But an era is ending: a changing world trade environment and the erosion of Mauritius's advantages, such as cheap labour, means that the going will be tougher, the competition sharper. It was 10 years ago that the government of Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, bit the bullet of structural adjustment, observing the conditions of successive IMF stand-by programmes, and winning World Bank backing. Mauritius was in a parlous state, with inflation exceeding 30 per cent, an overvalued currency, and unemployment topping 20 per cent, until the transformation began. The mono-crop (sugar) economy was able to broaden its base. The export processing zone (EPZ) was encouraged by realistic exchange rates and government incentives. Drawing on a cheap, literate and multi-lingual (English and French) work force, and concessional access to western markets under the Lome convention, the EPZ catapulted the island into the ranks of the world's leading clothing exporters. The island's idyllic beaches were already attracting tourists. But a hotel building boom, in response to the attractive investment climate and vigorous marketing, has seen the number of visitors treble to the 300,000 expected in 1992. At the same time, the budget deficit has been falling from 14 of GDP in 1980 to a forecast 0.7 per cent for 1992-3. External debt servicing which consumed 26 per cent of export earnings has dropped to single figures, and there is near full employment. The overall result is a third world success story, where over the past decade growth has averaged around 6 per cent a year. With a population increase of only 1 per cent, it means that real living standards have risen by some 5 per cent annually, propelling per capita GDP from well under a thousand dollars to over Dollars 3,000. But Mauritius owes its success to more than the right doses of IMF medicine. One of the main planks in the platform on which the island's take-off has been based is singled out by Sir Anerood: 'Political stability in a democratic context' - to which he might have added ethnic and religious tolerance. The 1m islanders are a harmonious mix of Hindu, Moslem, Creole and small minorities of French and Chinese origin, culturally diverse but seeking political consensus. 'Parties hiding behind words like 'militant', 'socialist', and 'workers' have come to occupy the middle ground in politics,' says one commentator, 'and any coalition is possible.' Nothing illustrates this better than the governing alliance of Sir Anerood's Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM) and the Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) led by Dr Prem Nababsing, deputy prime minister, and including Mr Paul Berenger, the able foreign minister. Even before they joined forces in 1990, it was clear that personalities rather than policies divided them. The alliance won last September's general election by a comfortable majority over Dr Navin Ramgoolam's Labour Party, the main opposition. But the government cannot afford to be complacent. The remarkable statistics conceal weaknesses in the government's economic management, likely to be exposed in the 1990s. One prickly problem is the increasing cost of the Mauritian 'welfare state'  -free education, health facilities and other social services. Pay awards due next year will be inflationary, and a skills shortage is impeding growth. The poorly regulated building boom in the tourist sector has led to substantial overcapacity, as well as exacerbating environmental problems belatedly addressed. Comparatively little progress has been made in implementing the long overdue reform of the sugar industry, while the considerable potential of the horticultural sector has yet to be exploited. For all the talk of diversification of the EPZ, from its textile base into areas such as high technology, there has been only modest progress. Meanwhile both sectors face further challenges. Uncertainty about the relationship with China helped prompt Hong Kong industrialists to invest in the EPZ in the 1980s. 'Now my uncle in Hong Kong is more interested in China's economic zones' says a Mauritian of Chinese origin, explaining the fall in investment in the zone. Sugar will be hit by reform of the EC's common agricultural policy and the cut in subsidies to Lome members. And if the Multi-Fibre Arrangement is phased out, the market advantages enjoyed by the island's textile sector will be eroded. Challenges do not end here. The post-communist era has produced new competitors for investment, such as Vietnam, or China, where labour costs are below Mauritian levels. Much is expected from the fledgling financial services sector - the combination of an emerging stockmarket, offshore banking and the freeport of Port Louis: 'The financial services sector is poised to become the fourth pillar of our economy', says Sir Anerood, 'and help maintain its growth momentum and lead us on the path to become a Newly Industrialised Country.' This strategy - an aspiring Indian Ocean tiger drawing inspiration from Singapore or Taiwan - seems overly ambitious. Government officials and business leaders frequently refer to 'the African market', whether as a source of funds for the offshore banks, or as a destination for which international traders will use the freeport as a stepping stone. But the level of interest in the island's offshore facilities suggest that Africans prefer to bank either with the former big centres (notably London and Paris) or in traditional locations such as Switzerland. And as an economic hinterland, Africa provides Mauritius with little encouragement. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of world trade is not only small - about 3 per cent - but either stagnant or declining. Nor do Mauritians seem prepared to respond to a more demanding world by working harder and longer. Civil servants in an over-staffed administration (the private sector is only a little better) still clock in at nine, rushing for the exits at four in the afternoon. The island's tendency to sit on its collective laurels makes for a comfortable life. But the would-be tiger of the Indian Ocean has a long way to go.</p>

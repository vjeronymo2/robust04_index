			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments in El Salvador monitored  through 11 January 1994. Source is cited in parentheses  following the item.    Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera stated that the most  important  fiscal events of 1993 were the reduction in the number of taxes  and the increase in tax collection. Segrera explained that the  fiscal reform reduced from 25 to three the number of taxes paid  by Salvadorans. "Currently, there is only the value-added tax  (VAT), the income tax, and the tax on imports which is paid at  the Customs Office," he said. He stressed that "despite the  reduction, tax collection increased thanks to a drop in tax  evasion." He added that the fiscal deficit, which is 1.8  percent of the gross national product and which amounts to 1.167  billion colones, qualifies El Salvador to become a candidate for  IMF credits. He emphasized that "the deficit can be handled  indefinitely as long as it is adequately financed." (San  Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 12)</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Technology: How Fuji banks on the personal touch Fuji Bank, Japan's third largest bank and a big player in world derivatives markets, is aware of the value of computers in the fast-moving environment of swap and option trading. The company recently bought a Cray mini-supercomputer for its New York-based subsidiary's derivatives operations, linking it via a wide-area network to workstations on the desks of its London and Hong Kong traders. Back at headquarters in Tokyo's Otemachi business district, Fuji's derivatives traders do not yet have the power of a Cray to help them in their decisions. 'The pace of these markets is getting so fast that we cannot compete without computers,' says Yoshiki Takeshima, general manager of Fuji's market risk assessment division. Fuji's derivatives traders use IBM and Hitachi workstations running price simulation models for yen and dollar interest-rate swaps, futures trading and options developed by programmers in the bank's financial engineering division. The models use historical pricing data and traders' simulations of future price movements based on past trading patterns to give a market price for the derivatives the bank offers to corporate clients for hedging purposes. Takeshima stresses that the models are only guides for traders. Although Fuji also uses some artificial intelligence, it does not let the computers trade automatically. 'The trader makes the final call on the price,' he says. Japanese investors still prefer their decisions to be made by a human being, according to Takeshima. Telling investors that advanced technology is calculating the price of a derivative can sometimes actually kill demand for the product. Takeshima, a 23-year veteran of Fuji, is charged with making sure the models contain adequate provisions for risk. His department looks over the models and checks that they do not leave the bank overstretched. Value-added risk calculations make the models accurate for most situations, except market panic. Takeshima sees Fuji being drawn into a spiral of ever greater investment in computing power and software just to stay afloat. Once Japan's Ministry of Finance lifts rules governing the booking of profits from overseas derivatives trading and allows trading in other financial products, the bank will need more complicated models to stave off competition. 'The game will never stop,' says Takeshima.</p>

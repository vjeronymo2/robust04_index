The leaders of the three opposition parties were briefed  before the cabinet meeting by the prime minister's aides.    "We are determined to support the government precisely  because we believe in a united foreign policy," said Miltiadhis  Evert, leader of the main opposition New Democracy party.    Mr. Evert took the opportunity of a previously scheduled  working lunch with European Union ambassadors to express Greek  fears that airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets could lead to  a Balkan conflagration. He also outlined a New Democracy  proposal for a friendship pact among Balkan states.    Political Spring leader Andonios Samaras, a former  conservative foreign minister who resigned from New Democracy  over its position on the Skopje issue, expressed his party's  full support for the decision.    "We had suggested that the prime minister could either fight  or give up... Today he took the decision to fight -- which we  have persistently asked," he said in a statement. "Our support  is implicit as long as our national struggle be waged  responsibly, consistently and soberly at all levels and without  being undermined by defeatist consciences."    Greece's two main left parties, the Communist Party (KKE)  and  the Coalition of the Left and Progress, the latter not  represented in the current parliament, criticised the  government's decision in separate statements.    Describing the measures as an "adventuristic distraction",  KKE leader Aleka Papariga said they would only serve to raise  tensions in the region and "facilitate the plans of the United  States and NATO."    She added that she had sent a letter to Mr. Papandreou  requesting a parliamentary debate on developments in the Balkans.    "The measures that the government has decided to take  imprison us in the logic and tactic of tension that only serve  others' interests," said the Left Coalition's leader Nikoalos  Konstandopoulos. "We become a part of the crisis...and we are  in danger of being blamed for the tension and losing everything  in the Skopje issue."</p>

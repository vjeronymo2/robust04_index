			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Mexican forces pursue armed Indian rebels Mexican federal forces yesterday pressed their hunt for armed Indian peasants in the southern state of Chiapas after dozens of people were killed in heavy fighting sparked by a rebel uprising, Reuter reports from San Cristobal de las Casas. Officials said the peasants, who have declared war on the government in their campaign for the rights of native peoples, had not responded to an offer to negotiate. The self-proclaimed Zapatista National Liberation Army, a band of about 600 armed peasants, many of Mayan descent, continued yesterday to occupy at least three of the four small towns where the began uprising on New Year's Day. After an overnight lull in the fighting, helicopters yesterday roared over the forested hillsides around San Cristobal despite heavy early fog as the full search for the guerrillas resumed. Gunfire and grenade explosions could be heard in the mountains surrounding the city. Government soldiers were patrolling the town, the largest in the area, taking control of the centre and all roads in after the rebels fled on Sunday. Officials claimed federal forces were pushing the rebels out of Ocasingo, east of San Cristobal. The peasants took over the towns, calling for land reform and a new government, on the day that the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. They accused the government of a history of genocide and said that Nafta would be a death sentence for Mexico's indigenous peoples. The rebels are apparently concerned that industrial development in the north expected to result from the pact could harm their way of life. For (the government) it doesn't matter that we possess nothing, absolutely nothing; not a home, not land, not work, not education,' the rebels said. Mr Rafael Gonzalez, secretary-general of the state government, said the government was prepared to negotiate, with the Roman Catholic church as mediator. He also said the death toll was likely to rise: 'We fear the number of civilian casualties may be higher than we have confirmed.' The army said 30 people, including six soldiers and 24 peasants, died on Sunday and that another 27 people had been killed on New Year's Day. It was not clear whether the civilians the official referred to included the armed peasants. Government and church officials in Chiapas said the region's indigenous people had become increasingly angry in recent years because the economic changes wrought by President Carlos Salinas have not reached them. The peasant group apparently takes its name from Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, who led peasant uprisings and land takeovers early this century. Chiapas is a poor rural state that has been the site of numerous conflicts involving indigenous groups and farmers and ranchers in recent years.</p>

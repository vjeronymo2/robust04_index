			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 17 March carries within  its regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the combat  situation in the republic.    Reporting from the Press Center of the 370th Brcko Brigade,  correspondent Dijana Hadzic says that ``after being defeated by  the members of the armed forces of our country yesterday, the  chetniks today continued their fierce shelling of the defense  lines of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the  operational zone of Operation Group West and the Bugojno city  center from the direction of Kupres and Donji Vakuf.    ``In a strong counterattack the free territory of our  country  has been expanded. The fighters of the 370th Brcko Brigade at  [word indistinct] captured a T-55 tank, an antiaircraft gun,  mortars, and a large quantity of infantry weapons and equipment.  In fierce fighting, the aggressor lost 30 soldiers.    "Members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  from Donji Vakuf's 370th Brcko Brigade are scoring only  successes in this region. In less than 24 hours the enemy has  lost another two T-55 tanks. A general danger alert is in force  in Bugojno as we report."    According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic, "after the  bestial shelling of Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin yesterday,  in which one person was killed and several wounded, the night in  the Bihac and Cazin area was somewhat quieter. Nevertheless,  the chetniks sporadically shelled their old targets, the suburbs  of Bihac, the outskirts of Cazin, the Bihac-Cazin road, and the  industrial zone."    Sadikovic also reports that a "new artillery-tank attack was  launched on the Grmusko-Srbjanski plateau early this morning,"  and that "the attack is still in progress."    Travnik correspondent Ahmet Begicevic reports that "owing to  the shelling, a general danger alarm was sounded in Travnik at  about 2200 [2100 GMT] last night. The chetniks fired an  artillery shell at the town from the Vlasic plateau, causing  substantial material damage and wounding one person. Travnik  was also sporadically shelled overnight. At 0730 this morning,  the general danger alarm was sounded again after another shell  had been fired on the town."    According to the studio announcer, "the extremists of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] seriously violated the cease-fire  agreement on several occasions yesterday, especially in the  central parts of Mostar, the Information Service of the 4th Army  Corps reports. The fighters of Vinko Martinovic yesterday  violated the cease-fire that is otherwise being observed across  the entire operational zone of the 4th Army Corps. Members of  this formation fired several times using an RPG [expansion  unknown] and splinter ammunition at the line of separation from  the direction of the Health Center. The HVO extremists also  attacked the road junction near the bus station in Mostar with a  sower of death [M-84 machine gun]. Provocations continued  throughout the night.    "Regarding the latest serious violation of the agreement on  the cessation of hostilities, the Command of the 4th Army Corps  has lodged a protest with the Spanish UN battalion, expecting  the representatives of the peace forces finally to do something,  considering that previous warnings have not yielded any results.  (?Similar) provocations by irresponsible groups and individuals  from the HVO were also registered on the Prozor front, in the  Orahovica region.    "The defense lines in this part of the 4th Army Corps'  operational zone were also the target of artillery attacks by  the Serbian aggressor, especially in the region of (?Djelimic),  the Information Service of the 4th Army Corps reports."</p>

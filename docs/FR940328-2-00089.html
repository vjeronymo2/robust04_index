			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, in terms of market depth, the NYSE's October monitoring report suggests that stock tends to be stopped in minimum variation markets where there is a significant disparity (in both absolute and relative terms) between the number of shares bid for and the number offered. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  That report also suggests that, given the depth of the opposite side of the market, orders affected by the Rule 116.30 pilot tend to be relatively small. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  For a substantial majority of stops granted, the size of the stopped order was less than, or equal to, 25% of the size of the opposite side quote. Based on such data, the NYSE concludes that the imbalances on the opposite side of the market from the orders stopped were of sufficient size to suggest the likelihood of price improvement to customers. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its initial proposed rule change, the NYSE provided the following example illustrating the relationship between quote size imbalance and the likelihood of price improvement: Assume that the market for a given stock is quoted 30 to 301/8, with 1,000 shares bid for and 20,000 shares offered. The large imbalance on the offer side of the market suggests that subsequent transactions will be on the bid side. Accordingly, the NYSE states that it might be appropriate to stop a market order to buy, since the delay might allow the specialist to execute the buyer's order at a lower price. After granting such a stop, the specialist would be required to increase his quote by the size of the stopped buy order, thereby adding depth to the bid side of the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A relatively large order might begin to counteract the pressure the imbalance on the opposite side of the market is putting on the stock's price. Accordingly, it might not be as appropriate to stop such an order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE has stated, both to the Commission and to its members, that specialists should only stop stock in a minimum variation market when an imbalance exists on the opposite side of the market and such imbalance is of sufficient size to suggest the likelihood of price improvement.

Revell, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated December 27, 1990; NYSE information memo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=6 f=1 --> #1809 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , dated September 12, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

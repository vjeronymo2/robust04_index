A group of 20  deputies thinks that this fuel, designated humanitarian, must be  put at the service of the people only and must not constitute a  weapon for manipulation by foreigners. The group accuses the  international community of exacerbating the situation by wanting  to deliver humanitarian products to nongovernmental  organizations who would be the only beneficiaries, at the  expense of the people.</p>

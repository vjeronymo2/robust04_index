			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: NZ setback as bond tender fails THE New Zealand government's ambitious borrowing programme suffered an unexpected setback yesterday with the failure of the February bond tender. The tender was the first to face a substantial shortfall since 1986 when the Reserve Bank sold most of a tender to Rakiura Holdings, a small merchant bank, which promptly failed. Interest rates jumped sharply on news that only NZDollars 233m (USDollars 129.4m) of the NZDollars 350m was filled. The lack of support for the issue concerned financial markets, as the government is scheduled to borrow a further NZDollars 2.45bn before June through monthly tenders to meet latest projections of increased budget deficits. Dealers said the failure, in the tender's indicator maturity, November 1996, was surprising as it had been the most popular in recent tenders. A Treasury spokesman said he believed it may have been due to technical reasons.</p>

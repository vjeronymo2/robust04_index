			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / High-street spending rate slows The rate of spending in high-street shops slowed slightly in May, the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trade survey showed yesterday. But the CBI pointed out that UK traders were still reporting that sales were rising on an annual basis, and the recovery appeared to be continuing at a moderate pace. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trade survey panel, said: 'So far tax increases which came into force in April do not appear to have had any real impact on the course of the high-street recovery, but we need to be cautious as it may be some time before their full impact is felt.' The proportion of wholesalers, retailers and car dealers reporting increased sales volume was higher than last year. Those reporting an increase minus those reporting a decrease gave a positive balance of 29 per cent. This compares with a positive balance of 19 in April and a positive balance of 28 last year. Most of this growth was caused by a surge in wholesalers' sales. Retailers reported a dip compared with last month. The number of retail outlets reporting an annual rise in sales was a positive balance of 12, down from a balance of 22 in April, but in line with returns in the first quarter. The result disappointed City analysts, who warned that official retail sales data, to be published tomorrow, may show a slowdown in consumer activity. Meanwhile, the balance of motor traders reporting an increase in sales was only 16 - the lowest figure so far this year. The survey, which was conducted in the last two weeks of last month, showed that big retailers were continuing to fare better than small ones, the CBI said. Within the sectors, specialist food suppliers fared the worst, with the majority of these retailers reporting that their level of business was down. The CBI said yesterday, however, that this slump followed an exceptionally strong level of sales last May. Retailers in the furniture and carpet sector reported that sales were relatively flat compared with a year ago, but the DIY and hardware sector reported that sales were up - a trend that may reflect the patchy nature of the housing market recovery. Footwear and leather goods shops reported the fastest annual growth in sales, with more than three-quarters of retailers reporting that sales were up on an annual basis. Economists said this might reflect price competition in this sector - an analysis that was echoed by the CBI, which said that with consumers still extremely price conscious, there were few signs of any inflationary pressure. The number of retailers reporting a rise in prices rose to a positive balance of 30 in last month, from a positive balance of 20 when the question was last asked in February. The balance of retailers expecting to raise prices in the coming month was a positive 28 compared with 29 in February. The number of wholesalers reporting price rises fell significantly.</p>

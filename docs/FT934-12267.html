			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Matsushita and Sharp down sharply at midterm MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial and Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics companies both report sharp falls in first-half profits . Matsushita confirmed expectations of a substantial deterioration in its first-half business by reporting a 43 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y29.7bn (Dollars 280.2m) from Y52.3bn. The company blamed the continuing weakness of consumer demand, and slow recovery in its other main markets for the poor parent company results. Sales for the half year were 6 per cent down to Y2,147bn. Matsushita was particularly hard hit by an unusually cool summer, which not only depressed demand for air conditioners but also dampened consumption overall. Meanwhile, the yen's appreciation against major currencies including the US dollar, D-Mark and Asian currencies resulted in a first-half loss of Y9bn. Domestic sales were down 7 per cent while exports suffered a 5 per cent decline. Of Matsushita's separate product categories, sales of video equipment fell 11 per cent and audio products 6 per cent. Home appliances, including air conditioners, registered the largest fall among product groups of 17 per cent. On the other hand, sales of rice cookers which use induction heating and combined TV/VCR units were buoyant. Matsushita, which is looking for growing second-half demand for its thin TVs and wide-screen TVs, is forecasting full-year profits of Y63bn, down 35 per cent, on sales of Y4,350bn, a 4 per cent fall from the previous year. Sharp, meanwhile reported a 23 per cent fall in first half pre-tax profits for many of the same reasons that affected Matsushita. Pre-tax profits came to Y20.2bn, a decline of 23 per cent on sales of 575.2bn, down 1.4 per cent from the previous year. The company, which has been building up expertise in liquid crystal displays and flash memories, saw its exports rise 1.5 per cent during the period. Sharp is forecasting stable sales for the full year at Y1,150bn and pre-tax profits of Y41bn, down 8 per cent. The company does not expect the Japanese economy to recover easily due to an expected increase in unemployment and continuing yen strength.</p>

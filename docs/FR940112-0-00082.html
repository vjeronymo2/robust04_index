In this case based on projection of expenses at the Medicaid rate, the individual may become eligible on the first day of institutionalization (the 16th of the month). (Although the State may be a full-month coverage State, retroactivity to the first day of the month would have no effect because the individual has no previously incurred medical expenses.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The individual enters the institution on the 16th of the month. The monthly spenddown liability is $900. The projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate to the end of the month are $800 (one-half of the $1,600 monthly rate). The individual has no other expenses at this time. Based on projection of institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate, the individual does not meet spenddown. Thus, the individual will not be eligible on the 16th of the month. The individual may become eligible at a later time during the month should the amount of actually incurred and any remaining projected expenses (e.g., the amount after application of any reasonable limits established by the State) equal or exceed the spenddown liability. In such a case, eligibility would still be retroactive to the first day of the month in full-month coverage States. (When a combination of incurred and projected expenses is used, ``remaining projected expenses'' does not include any expenses that have already been incurred. Further, any expense used to meet spenddown liability is not reimbursable under Medicaid.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters asked how income would be applied to the cost of care after an individual is determined eligible when the Medicaid rate is used instead of the private payment rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no change in the treatment of income once an individual is eligible for Medicaid. Regulations at 42 CFR 435.725, 435.733, 435.832 and 436.832 specify how an eligible individual's income is to be applied to the cost of institutional care. For clarification, we provide some examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An individual's monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $925. The monthly Medicaid rate is $1,000. The monthly spenddown liability is $600. The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the month. Since the projected monthly Medicaid rate ($1,000) exceeds the monthly spenddown liability ($600), the individual is considered eligible on the first of the month. Thus, the post-eligibility treatment of income rules apply. First, to account for the individual's responsibility for $600 in spenddown liability, the State should consider as a starting point for the amount it will pay to the institution only $400 of the $1,000 in institutional charges. However, from the individual's $925 in income, the State would deduct $630 ($30 protected for personal needs and $600 in unreimbursable medical expenses reflecting the individual's spenddown liability). (Income also would be protected for the maintenance of the individual's spouse and family under specified circumstances and, at the option of the State, for the maintenance of the individual's community home.) This leaves $295 in income that can be contributed toward the $400 in institutional charges taken into account in the post-eligibility process. Thus, of the original $1,000 bill, the Medicaid program would contribute $105 ($400_$295) and the individual would contribute $895 ($600 in spenddown liability plus $295 determined in the post-eligibility process).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The State uses a 3-month budget period. Eligibility is being determined for the last quarter of the year. The individual's monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $910 ($2,730 for the quarter). The 3-month Medicaid rate is $3,720 ($40 per day &times; 31 days per month &times; 3 months). The 3-month spenddown liability is $2,250 ($750 per month). The individual is in the institution as of the first day of the quarter (October 1). Since the projected Medicaid rate for the quarter ($3,720) exceeds the spenddown liability for the quarter ($2,250), the individual is eligible on the first day of the quarter. Thus, the post-eligibility treatment of income rules apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the State would begin eligibility with, and apply the post-eligibility rules for, the same 3-month period used in the spenddown calculations. (The State may begin eligibility with the month or day spenddown liability is met, if later, and apply the post-eligibility rules for the shorter period only if the later date does not cause the individual's share of the institutional charges for the spenddown period to exceed the individual's contributable income for the period.) To account for the individual's responsibility for $2,250 in spenddown liability, the State would consider as a starting point only $1,470 of the $3,720 in institutional charges. However, from the individual's $2,730 in income, the State would deduct $2,340 ($90 protected for personal needs for the quarter and $2,250 in unreimbursable medical expenses reflecting the individual's spenddown liability). (Income also would be protected for any other allowable deductions.) This leaves $390 in income that can be contributed toward the $1,470 in institutional charges taken into account in the post-eligibility process. Thus, of the original $3,720 in charges, the Medicaid program would contribute $1,080 ($1,470^$390) and the individual would contribute $2640 ($2,250 in spenddown liability plus $390 determined in the post-eligibility process).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

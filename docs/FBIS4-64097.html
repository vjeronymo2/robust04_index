			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 26 TASS--Leaders of the  Dniestr [Dniester] region regarded as slander the statements  made by commander of the 14th Russian Army Aleksandr Lebed who  accused Tiraspol leaders of illegal possession of weapons and  asked the Russian leadership to deprive them of Russian  citizenship which they were abusing.    According to Vladimir Ivanov, aid to the president of the  Dniestr Republic, Tiraspol leaders really have firearms in  personal possession but he stressed that these weapons were  handed to them in a legal way. He also confirmed that some  Dniestr leaders were granted Russian citizenship but denied the  statements of the command of the 14th Army accusing them of  abusing this citizenship for illegal trade in weapons.    A spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Moldavia [Moldova]  told ITAR-TASS that the police also had information about  misappropriation, illegal possession and re-sale of weapons by  Tiraspol leaders and mafioso structures in the Dniestr Republic  patronized by them.</p>

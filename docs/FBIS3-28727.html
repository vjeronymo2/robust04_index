			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] A government official disclosed on 9 February that a  U.S. official in charge of the Japanese-U.S. framework trade  talks has proposed a plan to submit at the 11 February  Japanese-U.S. summit meeting an "interim report on  consultations" which includes a side-by-side listing of points  of dispute between Japan and the United States as they currently  stand. The United States has apparently taken this step after  judging that it has become difficult to reach an agreement with  Japan in such individual trade sectors as automobiles and auto  parts, over which negotiations have been stalled. Because the  United States has termed this report as being "interim" in  nature, there is a strong possibility that the trade talks will  virtually be extended. Therefore, prospects are that  negotiations now will turn to dealing with the case of the two  nations failing to reach an agreement.    The interim report plan has been proposed by W. Bowman  Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy  and who is the U.S. official in charge of deputy-level  negotiations. The report is said to list, side by side,  Japanese and U.S. assertions over such issues as "numerical  targets." The agreement reached by Japan and the United States  last July concerning the new framework trade talks stipulates  that an assessment be made of the progress in the trade talks at  a deputy-level meeting prior to the summit meeting and that a  report subsequently be submitted to the leaders of the two  nations.    A Japanese Government official asserts that "because the  United States has further pressed for setting numerical targets  even in the area of government procurement, where negotiations  have made relative progress, the trade talks as a whole have  regressed instead."    In this connection, a senior official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on the evening of 9  February: "No work has been done to narrow the gap between  Japan and the United States at the resumed negotiations in  Washington between Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of  foreign affairs, and W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the  president for economic policy. They are already talking about  what to do now."    On the same evening, MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said,  "There is a wide gap (between Japanese and U.S. assertions)."  He expressed the hope that a negative impact on bilateral  relations can be kept to a minimum even in the case of an  agreement not being reached.</p>

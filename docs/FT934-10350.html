			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re plans 'option' rights SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group after Munich Reinsurance, is raising up to SFr700m (Dollars 466m) in 1994 and 1995 through option-based rights issues. These would be in addition to the previously announced 1-for-10 rights issue later this year to raise SFr575m. Mr Arnold Saxer, chairman, said the funds were needed to strengthen the group's capital base. He forecast that 1993 net income would be at least 10 per cent higher than last year's SFr281m. Premium income was expected to rise 15 per cent. The capital raising for 1994 and 1995 is by way of two sets of options, one exerciseable until end-1994, the other until end-1995. The options will be on the basis of one option of each type per bearer or registered share held. Every 20 options will entitle the holder to buy one registered share.</p>

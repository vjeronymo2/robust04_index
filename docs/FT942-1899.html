			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / People: Larger portfolio for Castleman Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, has reshuffled the responsibilities of its senior directors, freeing its current head of investment banking, Christopher Castleman, to take charge of large client relationships. The bank has tried to sharpen its management following the appointment of Patrick Gillam as its chairman, and Malcolm Williamson as its chief executive. It has yet to shake off decisively its image of being accident-prone. The reshuffle places Castleman in charge of major client relationships for the group around the world as well as some strategy issues. Peter Wood, who already controls finance and risk, will take overall responsibility for strategy. John McFarlane, who heads treasury and capital markets, will take over responsibility for merchant banking, capital markets and stockbroking. This is intended to create a single unit for all trading and markets activities. David Moir, the executive director responsible for the Asia Pacific region and group personal banking, will assume responsibility for custody, private banking and private trust businesses within the bank's Equitor group. David Brougham, the executive director responsible for banking activities in Europe, America, Africa, Middle East and South Asia, will take additional responsibility for credit and credit services.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Stress at work should be seen as safety issue, says report Stress at work is increasing sharply and should be recognised officially as a health and safety issue, a report urged yesterday. Professor Tom Cox of Nottingham University, who prepared the report for the Health and Safety Executive, said the problem needed government recognition if employers were to tackle it effectively. The report, published ahead of HSE guidelines due out next year to help employers manage stress at work, recommended further research into the problem, along with training for employers. Recent Manchester University research showed that 90m working days a year were being lost in the UK through stress. The recommendations come at a time when growing numbers of employees are seeking compensation from their companies for stress-related illnesses. Several test cases are due to come before the courts. In one, a former City worker alleges that her 10-15 hour day caused a mental breakdown. Another employee claims that stress through overwork led to a gynaecological disorder. In a third case, a junior production manager is claiming that shortage of staff led to illness through overwork. According to one of Britain's leading stress counsellors, the problem is growing more acute as companies emerge from recession with smaller workforces and leaner managements. Mr Alistair Anderson, managing director of Personal Performance Consultants UK, which has contracts with 60 companies covering 130,000 workers nationwide, said he had noticed a disturbing number of suicides involving work pressures. 'I believe the demands on the workforce are greater than they have ever been,' he said. 'Downsizing in companies has meant that often people have been left ill-equipped and ill-prepared for the job expected of them. That in itself creates great stress.' The report by Prof Cox, an occupational psychologist, identified excessive periods of repetitive work, lack of management support and overdemanding work schedules as contributory causes of stress. Added factors were low pay, poor relationships with managers, lack of variety, shift working, long hours, job insecurity and conflicting demands of work and home.</p>

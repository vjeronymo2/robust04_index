			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Communications device from IBM INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is making its first foray into the nascent market for hand-held computer/ communicator devices with the introduction of Simon, a hand-held cellular telephone-cum-computer. The device is to be sold in the US by BellSouth Cellular, one of the leading US cellular telephone service providers. Simon weighs just over a pound and looks much like an ordinary cellular telephone, with a touch-sensitive display instead of the usual dial pad. However, unlike earlier 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple's Newton, Simon is primarily a communications device. Its functions include: facsimile, paging, electronic mail, calendar and appointments diary, address book, calculator and pen-based note pad, as well as cellular telephone. Unlike Apple Computer's Newton, which deciphers handwritten notes and turns them into text, Simon stores the image of a written note and sends it via the cellular network to a standard facsimile machine. IBM has granted BellSouth Cellular exclusive distribution rights to Simon in the US. The product will carry the BellSouth name.</p>

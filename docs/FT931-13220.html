			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Untimely truce MR RANIERO Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's internal market commissioner, has made a disappointing start in his new job. His apparent offer last week of an indefinite truce to governments that flout or fail to implement the rules of the single market is, at best, a public relations blunder. At worst, it suggests a loss of nerve which could jeopardise the progress achieved to date towards economic integration. Mr Vanni d'Archirafi argues that it is better to secure positive acceptance of single market measures, even if that involves delays, than to provoke a political confrontation by imposing them. There are only two areas in which such an approach may be defensible. One is in the initial implementation of new VAT and excise procedures, the complexity of which has created genuine confusion in many parts of the EC. The other is in efforts to win agreement on the free movement of people across internal frontiers. The Community's legal authority in the matter is not clear-cut, and much depends on voluntary co-operation between member states in dealing with problems such as terrorism and drugs. Heavy-handed coercion from Brussels now could be counter-productive and hand ammunition to opponents of the Maastricht treaty. However, there is no case for extending leniency to the rest of the single market programme, covering goods, services and capital. Its realisation is a formal treaty commitment, enshrined in the Single European Act and in almost 300 EC directives painstakingly negotiated since 1987. Implementation and enforcement of these measures are no longer a matter for the political discretion of Mr Vanni d'Archirafi or anyone else. They are an unambiguous legal obligation. Barely half the single market directives have so far been turned into national law by all 12 parliaments. Any hint that the Commission intends to relax the pressure now can only encourage further legislative procrastination and disregard for Community rules. Past experience has shown that, left to themselves, many governments renege on EC undertakings. It is not reassuring that Italy, which appointed Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, is one of the worst offenders. The Commission needs to make clear that such backtracking will not be tolerated. Failure to do so now would further weaken its authority, robbing the single market of impetus, and ultimately threatening the cohesion of the Community.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Theatre Center's Latino Theatre Lab will commission seven new  plays from six Latino playwrights with $220,000 in new grant money, the LATC  said Monday. Some of the funding -- $200,000 from the Ford Foundation and  $20,000 from NBC -- will be used to expand the actors' ensemble at the Lab.  Director Jose Luis Valenzuela said the new plays will chronicle the Latino  experience and reflect Latino concerns. The Lab, a multicultural nonprofit  professional theater company and theatrical training laboratory organized in  1979, has produced five plays at LATC under Valenzuela's direction.

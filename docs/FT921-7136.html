			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (3): Statistics prove a point - Exhibitions HOW EFFECTIVE are exhibitions? The industry is well aware that this key question has worried many users of its services over the past decade: they think exhibitions work but are a little unsure just why and how. Hence, recent research carried out by Taylor Nelson Business Services for the Exhibition Marketing Group provides some of the much-needed statistical research into the industry's effectiveness. Some 1,400 respondents across 13 industrial sectors were interviewed as part of the research, and the exhibitions business fared well in comparison with other forms of media. While the trade press was seen as the best medium for a new product launch - cited by 33 per cent of the sample - trade exhibitions came next with 24 per cent, well ahead of direct mail (8 per cent), newspapers and public relations (7 per cent each). But as the most effective medium for quality sales leads, trade exhibitions came top - with 24 per cent - followed by the trade press (23 per cent), sales reps (14 per cent) and direct mail (12 per cent). And as the best medium for corporate image and public relations purposes, exhibitions trailed only the trade press by 24 per cent to 28 per cent. Public relations itself came third with 11 per cent of the sample citing it. The survey came up with some interesting other information about why visitors attend exhibitions. Keeping abreast of technology was cited as the main reason, followed by just 'seeing what's new'. But what exhibition visitors want to see, the survey shows, is more staff on stands who are technically minded and knowledgeable about the product; order takers and sales reps were not particularly sought after, although their role was acknowledged. Mr Phil Soar, chief executive of the publicly-quoted Blenheim Exhibitions Group, believes that exhibitions must sell themselves by being different from other media, not by competing with them. 'The world will move to more and more narrowcast forms of media,' he forecasts. 'Exhibitions are the perfect narrowcast medium - they can and do attract very specific, highly motivated and interested audiences.' The Exhibition Industries Federation (EIF) has also taken concern about the effectiveness of exhibitions to heart and has commissioned research studies into their benefit to exhibitors and visitors alike. It says that, based on its surveys, the average number of sales leads generated by exhibitors was almost 300 per exhibitor, with nearly three-quarters of these new leads. Exhibitors expected that more than a quarter of their leads would be converted into sales. More ambitious effectiveness studies are now being carried out by the EIF. Such efforts are clearly needed as the latest figures from the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA) show that, even before the full impact of the recession was felt last year, spending on trade, technical and consumer exhibitions was down for the first time in two decades. ISBA's survey of advertising expenditure in 1990 found that while total advertising spending rose from Pounds 9bn in 1989 to Pounds 9.211bn in 1991, that on exhibitions fell 9 per cent from Pounds 803m to Pounds 761m. This survey measures only exhibition spending by British companies and so underestimates the total size of the sector. The Exhibition Industry Federation, for example, says that its figures for 1990 suggest that Pounds 901m was spent by UK and overseas exhibitors, a rise of 13 per cent on 1989. The ISBA survey shows that spending on trade, technical and consumer exhibitions in 1990 totalled Pounds 594m, a decline of 2.3 per cent on 1989. Private exhibitions, such as those held in hotels or shopping centres, also experienced a drop from Pounds 173m to Pounds 160m. The reason, says ISBA, was more exhibitions switched from hotels and shops to mobile sites with lower cost structures. Agricultural events, which also make up part of the industry as monitored by ISBA, were also down: from Pounds 68m to Pounds 52m. ISBA says that this was partly due to 'consumer and craft displays to a high degree replacing the more traditional presence of agricultural equipment manufacturers and suppliers.' What is clear from the ISBA and EIF figures is that the main cutbacks are being felt in terms of smaller stands and reduced construction costs. EIF figures show that the average duration of exhibitions in 1990 was 3.4 days, compared with about 3.7 days in 1989. Spending by exhibition visitors also fell in 1990, down 6 per cent to Pounds 502m. UK-based day visitors accounted for almost 88 per cent of exhibition attendance in 1990 and, as they usually travel from work or home, and incur no accommodation costs, their overall spending per visit is much lower than domestic overnight visitors or overseas visitors. Average spending by domestic day visitors rose by some 5 per cent in 1990 to Pounds 27 a day, but after taking inflation into account this was a slight decline in spending. But spending by UK exhibition visitors who used overnight accommodation fell from Pounds 179 to Pounds 158 per visit. Only overseas visitors managed to buck the trend: they spent an average of Pounds 487 per visit in 1990, compared with Pounds 443 in 1989. How to reach such important target customers will be the focus of National Exhibitors Day at the International Confex exhibition being held at London's Earls Court this week. Ms Deborah Carlton, managing director of Blenheim Events, which is staging the exhibition, says that 'much still needs to be learned about the benefits of exhibitions as part of a sales and marketing campaign.' She adds: 'Too many exhibitors fail to set clear aims and objectives before and after an event or realise the importance of stand presentation during the exhibition itself.' The problem (although officially denied) often is that exhibition halls  - like restaurants - have both good and bad locations: exhibitors in the know steer clear of the notorious 'black spots' which few visitors seem to pass by.</p>

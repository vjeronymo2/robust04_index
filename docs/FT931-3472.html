			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Donizetti's 'Roberto Devereux' - Opera in Genoa The building of a new opera-house is such an expensive business and so fraught with potential problems that it is only the rash or the exceptionally well-funded who would be advised to contemplate it at all. In the last decade neither the Bastille in Paris nor the Muziektheater in Amsterdam met with an unqualified chorus of rapture. The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa has won more harmonious applause. Strictly speaking, it is not a new building, as the shell of its predecessor remained after war damage in 1943. It has also taken the best part of 15 years to reach fruition even from the selection of the definitive project (the Royal Opera will know about this problem). But for an opera-house totally re-conceived and built afresh, amply spacious, lavishly appointed, it is difficult to think of a city luckier than Genoa. As befits its original frontage, the interior of the theatre has kept in touch with classical features, albeit interpreted in a modern style. The auditorium (about 2,000 seats) is unlike any other in Italy, or anywhere else for that matter. The side walls are fashioned to resemble Venetian houses with their balconies forming the traditional side boxes, looking down on the stalls as though over a central piazza - a novel idea, which gives the theatre a thoroughly Italian atmosphere of its own. All this, however, is a mere counterpoint to its triumphant main theme: the excellence of the acoustics. According to a recent opinion-poll the sound qualities of the new theatre have won almost unanimous approval, and I am not surprised. The voices project with remarkable clarity. At the performance of Donizetti's Roberto Devereux which I saw on Sunday each singer had only to step to the front of the stage to ensure an enormous vocal impact. What with La Favorite in Cardiff and L'assedio di Calais at London's Guildhall School of Music in the last fortnight, it would seem that Donizetti's serious operas may be inviting re-appraisal ahead of his bicentenary in 1997. Roberto Devereux is one of the most red-blooded of all. To succeed, a performance needs to work up a real head of steam in the royal show-down that crowns Act 2 and that is what Jan Latham Koenig achieved here, conducting the very respectable Genovese orchestra. With the exception of the main character of Elizabeth I - the Polish soprano Jolanta Omilian, not a great voice, but dramatic and strong, able to stamp her authority on the opera - the roles were cast with some of the best of the younger Italian singers. Vincenzo La Scola was the stylish tenor Earl of Essex; the baritone Roberto Frontali sang a well-focused, firm Duke of Nottingham. Best of all was Gloria Scalchi, who showed no sign of strain at all in tackling the high mezzo part of Sara: clearly a notable talent. Audiences in Genoa are liable to express their displeasure at modern productions, so there was no suggestion of updating this piece of Tudor historical fiction to the era of Thatcherite domination or Italian political corruption scandals. The staging was grandly traditional, with luxurious drapes and tapestries providing opulent spectacle for its Palace of Westminster locale. On its own terms it all worked splendidly and was a first-rate advertisement for a company happily settled in its new home. With four years to go, the Royal Opera in London might also want to think about extending its repertoire to more of Donizetti's historical operas. The addition of Roberto Devereux, arguably the most exciting musically of the three works, to its existing Anna Bolena and Maria Stuarda, would make a properly regal trilogy.

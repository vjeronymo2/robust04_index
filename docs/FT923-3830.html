			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Saatchi steps into a brave new world The acronyms are becoming ever-more labyrinthine. Yesterday the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group announced that two of its agencies - the north American Campbell-Mithun-Esty (CME) and the London-based KHBB - are linking up from October 1 to create an international agency network, to be known as CME-KHBB. The group already has two international networks: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide (SSAW) and Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide (BSB). Each competes against the other as well as against non-Saatchi group agencies, and each has outposts round the globe offering the whole range of advertising services. In contrast, the new network will offer a distinctly different service, eschewing domestic advertising and clients and pitching solely for multinational business. According to Stuart Bull, who will head up CME-KHBB, the new network's multinational-only approach is driven by the accelerating cultural convergence between countries and regions. This convergence has been speeded by increased travel, improving communications technology, global fashion trends, and - in the EC - by legislation. As a result, a more homogeneous world is presented to producers of consumer goods. Multinational corporations are therefore seeking to market themselves regionally and globally, with a single, consistent cross-border advertising message. Bull argues that advertising agencies will, in future, need to be 'transnational', serving transnational clients; alternatively, they will need to remain much smaller, operating on a domestic plane, with domestic-sized revenues to match. He supports his thesis by research from the Saatchi group, which purports to show a significant mismatch between what advertisers want and what they get from a multinational agency. Saatchi asked 1,000 large companies in the Asia-Pacific rim, the US and Europe how they viewed their global advertising campaigns. The survey found that 75 per cent looked for strategic consistency - the same message aimed at the same type of audiences - in their campaigns, but just 18 per cent felt they achieved that goal. The Saatchi group is prepared to invest up to Pounds 20m in the new network over 10 years, funding generated from the network's own cash-flow. But unlike the acquisition-driven (and debt-laden) growth of the group in the 1970s and 1980s, it is intended that the CME-KHBB network grows organically. Organised on a 'hub and spoke' system, the first hubs to open are in London, Paris, Toronto and five US cities. In theory, the hubs will operate as full-service agencies, being the command centre for strategic campaigns. The spokes (five in Europe, 22 in north America and one in Hong Kong) will provide input to the planning decisions at the hubs, but exist primarily as low-cost outposts, tailoring the strategic marketing decisions to local demands and dealing with more diffuse areas of marketing such as promotions, display, customer care and direct mail. The financial spine of the new network is also a new departure. One of advertising's sacred cows - widely under attack today - is the 15 per cent commission fee paid by advertisers to their agencies. CME-KHBB's clients will pay by negotiated fee, with incentives and bonuses for achievement of pre-agreed targets. Another taboo is salaries, which represent 50-60 per cent of Saatchi group costs; CME-KHBB promises to cut that to 40-45 per cent. And while most large agencies are currently struggling to achieve margins of 7 per cent, CME-KHBB hopes to hit the road with margins of 10 per cent, aiming for a group target of 12 per cent margins by 1994, set by Charles Scott, Saatchi group chief operating officer. Peter Mead, chairman of a rival agency, Abbot Mead Vickers, believes that CME-KHBB should have a good future: 'They were very good agencies in themselves and it makes a lot of sense, as good agencies draw strength from being associated with each other.' Will the new network set the champagne popping? Its underlying 'logic' is in tune with these cautious times. On the other hand, the Saatchi empire wholeheartedly backed the 'logic' of the ferocious acquisition-bent 1980s - and came a cropper.</p>

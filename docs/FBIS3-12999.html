			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 8, IRNA -- A morning English daily  here Tuesday commented on the recent remarks by U.S. officials  on Washington's intentions to open direct talks with Iran.    "Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the  legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding  international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the  political realities of the Islamic Republic," said `TEHRAN  TIMES'.    It added that Washington's apparent change of heart is due  to  two major causes -- the limitation of the U.S. influence in the  Middle East resulted from the region's cordial relations with  Iran and failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace talks  which makes Washington to use Tehran's "spiritual influence" in  the Islamic world to revive and legitimize the peace accord.    "Iran has endeavored to stay faithful to its own Islamic  revolution while leaving open the possibility of reconciliation  with the U.S. provided that America releases Iran's assets and  refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and  destabilizing the Islamic Republic."    In the case of re-establishment of ties with Iran, the U.S.  would stand to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should  be prepared to make greater concessions, said the daily in  conclusion noting that Iranian officials are well aware of this  fact and would base their demands accordingly.</p>

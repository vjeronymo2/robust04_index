			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Call for Hussey to quit BBC by advisory council members A MAJORITY of members on the BBC's general advisory council are understood to have called on Mr Marmaduke Hussey to resign as chairman of the corporation's governors. The council, which includes MPs, academics and other public figures, held a vociferous private meeting in London yesterday att-ended by most of its 41 members. Half of the 2 1/2 -hour meeting was dedicated to discussing demands for Mr Hussey and Mr John Birt, the director-general, to quit. The demands follow the recent disclosure that Mr Birt, who took up his post on January 1, had not been a BBC employee but had his salary paid into his private company. According to those present at yesterday's meeting, the balance of opinion was in favour of the resignation of Mr Hussey, who agreed Mr Birt's freelance arrangement. This, it was felt, would make plain that the episode had been seriously damaging for the BBC. It is understood that only Mr Roger Gale, the Conservative MP for North Thanet, publicly defended both Mr Hussey and Mr Birt during the meeting. Last night, the BBC said the council had discussed the 'issue of the terms of appointment of the director-general' and concluded that 'the manner and terms of the appointment were incompatible with the standards expected of a public broadcasting organisation and involved errors of judgment by those concerned'. Both Mr Hussey and Mr Birt were present at the meeting, though they and all the governors who attended left the room while the council discussed the resignation issue. Mr Hussey told the council that the board of governors would today be given a complete explanation of the background to Mr Birt's freelance status. Considerable confusion now surrounds how far the governors have been kept informed by Mr Hussey about the deal. On March 2, Mr Birt stated that when he joined the BBC six years ago as deputy director-general, he asked to continue the tax arrangements he had with his previous employer, London Weekend Television, and that the BBC agreed. However, Mr Hussey yesterday told the advisory council it had always been the intention of the BBC that Mr Birt would eventually join the staff, but pressure of business had delayed the move. One of the coucil members who called for Mr Hussey's resignation said the mood of the meeting was one of dismay and anger. 'I am sure Mr Birt will try to tough it out. The best we can hope for Mr Hussey is that he will go after a few more months. I can't see him doing the decent thing.'

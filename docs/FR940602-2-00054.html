			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Beverly Hills Weight Loss Clinics International, Inc., (hereinafter ``Beverly Hills''), marketer of the Beverly Hills low-calorie diet (hereinafter ``LCD'') program. The Beverly Hills diet program is offered to the public in the eastern United States through company-owned and franchised clinics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondent deceptively advertised: (1) Its LCD program's success in helping customers achieve and maintain weight loss; (2) the typical rate or speed at which customers will lose weight; (3) the time frame within which customers will achieve their desired weight loss goal; (4) the safety of the Beverly Hills program in comparison to other weight loss programs; (5) the purchase price of the Beverly Hills program; and (6) the terms of the company's offers of free weight loss services. The complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills engaged in the deceptive practice of failing to warn clients it monitors of the health importance of following the diet instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Success <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The complaint against Beverly Hills alleges that the company failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims it made regarding the success of its customers in losing weight and avoiding the regain of weight lost during the program. Through consumer testimonials and other advertisements, Beverly Hills represented that its customers typically are successful in reaching their weight loss goals and in maintaining their weight loss achieved under the Beverly Hills diet program either long-term or permanently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that these success claims for customer weight loss and maintenance of achieved weight loss are deceptive because at the time it made the claims Beverly Hills did not possess adequate substantiation for those claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint in several ways. First, the order (part I.A.) requires the company to possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the success of participants on any diet program in achieving or maintaining weight loss. To ensure compliance, the order further specifies what this level of evidence shall consist of when certain types of success claims are made: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In the case of claims that weight loss is typical or representative of all participants using the program or any subset of those participants, that evidence shall be based on a representative sample of: (a) All participants who have entered the program, where the representation relates to such persons; or (b) all participants who have completed a particular phase of the program or the entire program, where the representation only relates to such persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the case of claims that any weight loss is maintained long-term, that evidence shall be based upon the evidence of participants who were followed for a period of at least two years after their completion of the respondent's program, including any periods of participation in respondent's maintenance program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In the case of claims that weight loss is maintained permanently, that evidence shall be based upon the experience of participants who were followed for a period of time after completing the program that is either: (a) Generally recognized by experts in the field of treating obesity as being of sufficient length to constitute a reasonable basis for predicting that weight loss will be permanent; or (b) demonstrated by competent and reliable survey evidence as being of sufficient duration to permit such a prediction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, as measures to ensure future compliance, the proposed order requires the proposed respondent for any claim that participants of any diet program have successfully maintained weight loss to disclose the fact that ``For many dieters, weight loss is temporary'' (part I.B.), as well as the following information relating to that claim (part I.C.): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)The average percentage of weight loss maintained by those participants ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ``60% of achieved weight loss was maintained''), <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that participants ended the active weight loss phase of the program, and the fact that all or a portion of the time period covered includes participation in proposed respondent's maintenance program(s) that follows active weight loss, if that is the case_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ``participants maintain an average of 60% of weight loss 22 months after active weight loss (includes 18 months on maintenance program)'', and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) where the participant population referred to is not representative of the general participant population for that program, the proportion of the total participant population that those participants represent, expressed in terms of a percentage or actual numbers of participants_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Participants on maintenance_30% of our clients_kept off an average of 66% of the weight for one year (includes time on maintenance program)'' or, in lieu of that factual disclosure, the statement: ``Beverly Hills makes no claim that this result is representative of all participants in the Beverly Hills program.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, for maintenance success claims made in broadcast advertisements of thirty seconds or less duration, the proposed order (part I.D.) requires that Beverly Hills, in lieu of making the factual disclosures required for such claims by Part I.C: (1) Include in such advertisements the statement ``Check at our centers for details about our maintenance record.''; and (2) provide consumers at point-of-sale with a required form that includes the factual disclosures required by Part I.C., which form must be signed by the client and retained in the company's client file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

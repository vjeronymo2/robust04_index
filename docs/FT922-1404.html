			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Letter: Lloyd's costs and assets base seen as root of problems Sir, The answer to your leader's first question - 'was there any wrongdoing?' - is 'Yes: by past committees of Lloyd's and agents, acting in concert to suppress Lord Cromer's recommendations of 1969 - to favour their interests at Names' expense'. Lord Cromer deplored the incorporation and sale of agencies and recommended a deficit clause to discourage under-reserving, but above all he pointed out that Lloyd's was peculiarly ill-adapted to the underwriting of the very classes of business in which so many syndicates specialised - high excess catastrophe risks. He pointed out that the tax regime applied to insurance companies facilitated the building of reserves and that Lloyd's needed similar treatment. He stated that tax changes were the responsibility of government and parliament too. Yet these essential needs were not made a principal plank of the Lloyd's Bill in 1982. The reason is clear. Reserves can be made only from profits in good years, but anything which reduced the base on which agents could levy 'profit' commissions would reduce the prices of underwriting agency shares. Those Names who were placed by reckless agents on ultra high risk syndicates have a legitimate complaint against the rota committees who interviewed them if the chairman did not point out to them that Lord Cromer had long ago warned against such involvement, but that Lloyd's had deliberately failed to seek the legislative changes he suggested. That is why agents and brokers should now contribute pound for pound with Names, to the exceptional central fund levy. Alan Smallbone, 30 Temple Fortune Lane, London NW11 7UD</p>

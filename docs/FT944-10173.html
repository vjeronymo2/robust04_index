			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian chocolate maker raises Dollars 30m International investors are to be offered the opportunity to invest directly in Krasny Oktyabr (Red October), the profitable Russian chocolate maker. A public offer scheduled to take place later this month in three Russian cities was open to local investors and foreigners, said Mr Richard Oliver, associate director with Samuel Montagu, one of the western firms involved. The project, sponsored by the British government's Know How fund and the Russian Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to raise up to Dollars 30m through the offer to be launched in Moscow, St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg. About 55 per cent of the company's shares are being sold priced at Rbs20,000 each. About 20 per cent of the shares are to be set aside for strategic investors, such as western companies with an interest in the foods sector. But the issue will be targeted at a wide range of investors, but we want to get 'retail investors involved,' said Mr Oliver. A number of specialist Russian funds, formed over the past 18 months, are expected to take some of the equity. These have been the most popular means of investing although earlier this month international trading began in the shares of RSNG, the large oil and gas construction company, following the successful placement of about Dollars 25m of paper with international investors. Mr Oliver said Krasny's smaller and well-defined business was much easier to value than the large energy- and oil-related concerns interesting western investors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, arrived in Cyprus this  afternoon aiming to give a new push to the proximity talks on  the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    In an arrival statement at Larnaca Airport, Lamb said that  he  is not bringing any new proposals on the CBM's, adding that he  believes there are many ideas on the negotiating table. He said  his goal is to see whether he can assist in bridging the current  differences.    In response to a question, Lamb said he did not come to  Cyprus to put pressure on one or the other side.</p>

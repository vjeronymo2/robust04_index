			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: CAE holds lead in flight simulators CAE, the big Canadian electronics group, expects to hold its share of the world markets for commercial flight simulators well above 50 per cent this year. The company has won most of the new commercial flight simulator orders in the first half of calendar 1994, including sales to Japan and China, Mr John Caldwell, president, told the annual meeting. However, this pace was unlikely to be sustained, he cautioned. In the year ended March, CAE took 10 out of 18 full-flight simulator orders worldwide, indicating a 55 per cent market share. The company is moving into simulation equipment for medical, entertainment and educational uses, and is looking for acquisitions in electronics, aerospace and industrial products. However, aircraft simulators will remain dominant for another five years. Last year, CAE took a CDollars 396m (USDollars 284.9m) write-down on its CAE-Link military simulator unit in the US.</p>

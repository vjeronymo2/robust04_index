			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Booth Industries closes division Booth Industries Group is pulling out of structural steelwork with the loss of two thirds of its workforce following continued weakness in the company's markets. However, Mr Robin Booth, managing director, said the move was not final and the company would re-enter the market when conditions allowed. He added that the decision would not take effect for three months when the present order book ran out. The announcement accompanied interim results showing further pre-tax losses of Pounds 377,970 (Pounds 110,043 profits) after a fall into the red in the second half of the previous year. Turnover fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 7.97m. Full provision for the withdrawal would be made in the full year accounts, amounting to the greater part of retained reserves. The company said these would be replaced by the sale of tangible assets 'which had been held for many years'. Mr Booth declined to identify the assets but thought there would be no problem in realising sufficient funds to cover the provisions and leave cash for expansion. The Bolton-based company will be left with its provision of high specification doors and fire engineering equipment. The company blamed the steelwork side for the losses in the six months to September 30. Mr James Booth, chairman, said the group had been restricted to working on contracts in an 'intensely competitive domestic market'. Losses per share came out at 9.45p (1.84p earnings). The interim dividend is passed (0.7p).</p>

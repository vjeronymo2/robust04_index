			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (15): The cost of making your voice heard - Voting rights / A look at the procedures for shareholders It is one thing for institutional investors to flex their collective muscles under the gaze of companies whose shares they own, but it is quite another to deliver the knock-out punch that sends an entrenched, inefficient and profligate management into the history books. For that, investors say, what you need is a really good custodian, particularly if you are talking about making your voice heard at companies you own abroad. Since 1988, the US Department of Labour has interpreted the Erisa laws, setting out the rules under which US pension schemes are to be administered, to mean that there is an obligation to scheme members to exercise their rights at companies in which they have a stake. As a result, custodians estimate that US pension funds vote nearly all the time and on every issue which is laid before shareholders at domestic corporations. Investors in other countries are far less diligent about voting their shares, but are increasingly interested. In the UK, the National Association of Pension Funds, through its Voting Issues Service, is calling shareholder attention to contentious items on corporate agendas at the annual general meeting. The NAPF says the incidence of corporate voting has risen dramatically from the less than 20 per cent level recorded just a few years ago. Voting on foreign shares by British shareholders, however, remains sketchy. In July, the US Department of Labour clarified the obligations of US pension funds to vote their foreign proxies, saying that there is the same obligation to vote shares abroad as there is to vote them at home. 'What do clients want?' asked Meade Reynolds, manager of global corporate actions in the global custody division of Mellon Trust. 'Basically they want a vote in every single market and at every annual general meeting in every market they are in.' Clients not only want to vote, they want to know the substance of issues they are voting on. For instance, Mr Reynolds said, if a new firm of auditors is appointed, clients want to know more about the previous firm. Also, clients want to see proof that their votes were actually cast. Service of this type is clearly likely to be costly. Steven Davis of the Washington DC-based Investor Research and Responsibility Center (IRRC), says the Department of Labour does offer one caveat. 'The Department said that pension plan officials can properly decline to vote a proxy where they judge that the costs would outweigh any benefits,' he said. However, because several of the large public sector schemes had been actively - and successfully - prodding their custodians to cut the cost of overseas voting for several years, there are few markets where it can be said there is no obligation to vote, Mr Davis said. Indeed, Americans have been found to outnumber domestic shareholder voters in markets such as Australia and the Netherlands where locals do not have the instinctive urge to vote their proxies so conscientiously. Among large schemes, the state of Connecticut has been successful in working with its custodian for the past few years and is now able to vote in most markets in which it invests. An IRRC study found that the percentage of non-US proxies voted has risen dramatically in the past few years from 24 per cent of all shares held in 1991 to 71 per cent. Mr Reynolds said that Mellon Trust, which operates in 48 foreign markets, takes the view that corporate actions and proxy voting are part of the entire package of services which a sub-custodian takes on when a contract is negotiated. Therefore, there should not be additional significant costs associated with it. State Street Bank has also been successful in negotiating contracts with sub-custodians which envisage no additional charges for proxy voting services. Mr Davis notes that until recently, many sub-custodians had to be dragged 'kicking and screaming' to perform the task of proxy voting abroad. However, given growing client demand, some are now helping to alter rules in several countries which make the costs of voting unacceptably high. Mellon Trust has compiled a list of the seven most expensive countries in which shareholders can exercise their voting rights, with Sweden leading the pack. There, an institutional investor must pay Dollars 300 to cast a proxy ballot at a meeting. Mr Reynolds explained that in Sweden, the authorities insist that the beneficial owner of shares be the actual voter. This requires the custodian to obtain a power of attorney to vote on the pension fund's behalf. Also ranking among high-cost centres is Greece, where a proxy vote costs Dollars 214, Finland, where the cost is Dollars 213 and Italy where the cost is Dollars 128. In Italy, physical representation at an AGM is required so the sub-custodian also incurs the cost of air fares and/or hotel bills in proxy voting. Other expensive countries are Argentina, Portugal and Venezuela where the cost is Dollars 100 each. 'Only these seven countries appear to feature proxy voting costs high enough to raise questions about whether the effort is worth the expense,' the IRRC said. Other countries such as the UK, Australia and Hong Kong have made proxy voting easy and cheap, Mr Reynolds said. But Mr Reynolds says that nowhere is it as difficult to exercise voting rights as in Japan. 'In Japan, 85 per cent of all companies hold their AGM on the same day. Information is given out only two weeks in advance and instructions on voting must be lodged 10 business days before the meeting.' Given the difficulties of translating a large volume of documents, sending the translations to shareholders and collecting the ballot cards, voting in Japan is a logistical nightmare. In June this year, on the day when most AGMs were held, Mr Reynolds said he travelled to Japan to hand-deliver the proxy votes and to attend one AGM. But Mr Reynolds says that US funds generally believe proxy voting is worth it. 'In Singapore and Malaysia, where companies pass these outrageous compensation packages for former directors, the Americans are saying 'No way',' he noted.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Major vows to limit role of state: Prime minister seeks to counter threat from new Labour leader Mr John Major last night promised fresh limits on the role of the state and an expansion of individual ownership as he moved to counter the threat to the Conservatives posed by Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader. In a lecture marking out the political 'clear water' between the Conservative and Labour parties, Mr Major said the government would use the second half of the present parliament to break down barriers between public and private sectors. Among a range of initiatives, he pledged a significant expansion of the government's private finance initiative and a drive to reduce the number of bureaucrats in the National Health Service. Whitehall departments would be required to demonstrate in the annual public spending round they had explored the option of private sector participation in particular projects. The government would press ahead with privatisation, although Mr Major was careful not to commit himself in advance of the present consultations to the disposal of the Royal Mail. Responding to the mounting criticism of management structures in the health service, he said legislation in the next parliamentary session would strip some layers of bureaucracy by abolishing regional authorities. In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Major signalled that the government intended to make its commitment to constitutional stability a key part of the political battleground in the approach to the next general election. Without mentioning explicitly Labour's plans for devolved government, Mr Major said he opposed changes in the constitutional settlement holding together England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. His comments, in an address to the European Policy Forum in London, were the first detailed response to Mr Blair's promise to take Labour further into the political middle ground. The Labour leader was not mentioned by name but his policies were rejected at several points in the speech. Mr Blair has shaped a political approach based on giving an active role to the state and local communities in promoting individual opportunity. But Mr Major said: 'I want people to have ownership of more of their lives, not just have things allocated as the state sees fit. Ownership and choice are essential to put power in the hands of people rather than the state.' That extension of individual decision-making would be put alongside a revolution in the way public services were delivered: 'As our reforms advance, the boundary between public and private is open country which an enabling government can scour for the best ways of using limited taxpayers' money'. Mr Major reaffirmed the Conservatives' commitment to a reduction in income taxes, pledging an extension of the 20p band as soon as the government's finances allowed. Hinting that the first priority was to help improve incentives at the lower end of the income scale, he said: 'Our ambitions to limit taxes on the least well off are far from satisfied.' The speech was seen at Westminster as a clear attempt by Mr Major to capitalise on the recent upturn in his political fortunes by offering a clear prospectus around which his party can unite at its autumn annual conference.

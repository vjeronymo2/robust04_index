			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "I Will Not Accept Any  Teasing" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Well then, secretary, will the three-party  meeting with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [Northern  League Secretary] Bossi be held in Milan? "It would be  ridiculous to have any geographical prejudices: It does not  matter whether it is in Milan or in Palermo. If the principles  are these, what poor principles they are! The meeting will be  held however." MSI [Italian Social Movement] and National  Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini lights a cigarette in his office  in Via della Scrofa, under a conspicuous tricolor flag which is  the "bone" of contention with Bossi "from the Po." He states:  "There were three obstacles and only the first communication  problem has been overcome. This seems to be a trivial matter,  but it is not, given the insults made during the election  campaign. A real accord will only be possible after having come  to an agreement on a program, without making any bungles,  pretenses, or reciprocal teasing."    [Ventura] The first obstacle is communicating. The second is  the program. And what about the third?    [Fini] Choosing the ministers. If the government is born, it  must not have any children or stepchildren; there must be  dignity on an equal footing between the allies as sanctioned by  the voters.    [Ventura] There is talk of [League lower house floor leader]  Maroni as the deputy prime minister and also minister of  internal affairs.    [Fini] Independent of the names and ministries it is a  matter  of finding an accord. And a program.    [Ventura] To what extent will you concede to Lombard  federalism?    [Fini] The starting point is the accord signed by Maroni and  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and torn up by Bossi: Italy is  one and undivided. We will then see if the Northern League will  accept compensating federalism with the presidentialist  republic's guarantee of unity. [League ideologue] Miglio was  against this, but we also have to reckon with parliament because  the rewriting of the Constitution will require a two-thirds  majority.    [Ventura] Miglio proposes the institution of macroregions.    [Fini] We agree with the elimination of the regions and the  provinces and the creation of an intermediate body that we could  call, department, district, macromunicipality, or microregion.  The important thing is for the state to retain the primary  jurisdiction over defense, foreign affairs, the Bank of Italy,  justice, but also education and internal affairs. My son has  the right to study the same subjects whether he lives in Belluno  or in Trapani, and any hypothesis of a regional police force as  there is in the United States is entirely unacceptable.    [Ventura] Where is the compromise then?    [Fini] The microregion would have legislative authority over  matters that are strictly linked to its territory. We also  concur on fiscal autonomy: Part of the taxes paid must remain  in the area where the wealth was produced. There are two  conditions: part, not all of the taxes, and that these should  not be extra taxes but substitutive taxes. We support unity and  solidarity: we will defend the rights of the South, not in an  ethnic, but in a national context.    [Ventura] The election results are bringing up the issue of  the rigid structure of the public bodies....    [Fini] There has been a political turning point in Italy, we  will therefore have to renew not only the government but also  the nomenclature, because the power has been guaranteed by the  entire management structure of the state: from banks to the RAI  [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], to state-controlled  enterprises...everything.    [Ventura] With a spoils system of the opposite sign?    [Fini] Anything but this. The criteria will no longer be  party membership, but capabilities, merits, and competence. As  far as I am concerned the current superbureaucrat can remain in  his job even if he is a Christian Democrat or a Socialist,  provided that he is good at it and honest. However, if he is  only there because of his party membership, he will have to go  home.    [Ventura] The same applies to those replacing him....    [Fini] Of course. We are leaving a regime to free ourselves,  not to enter into another regime.    [Ventura] There is a double problem in RAI: nomenclature and  legislative reorganization....    [Fini] I am not in favor of privatization but RAI, a public  body, must be managed like a private company, with competent  managers and balance sheets that correspond to the rules of a  free market economy. The television fee, publicity, and  leveling off the deficit at the end of the year at the expense  of the taxpayer can no longer continue.    [Ventura] Will the "professors" move out of Via Mazzini [RAI  headquarters]?    [Fini] The entire management structure must be reexamined,  including all the news and channel directors. We must not be  tempted to purge and to perform indiscriminate head chopping.  The old regime chased away the unreliable people to put  reliable idiots in their place. From now on no more DC  [Christian Democratic], progressive, or right-wing news. It is  the party spirit that must be canceled.    [Ventura] There is already somebody who his trying to  recycle  himself....    [Fini] Jumping on the bandwagon is Italy's national sport.    [Ventura] Will the universities also change?    [Fini] Privileges must gradually be eliminated. I do not  care whether the professor is red, white, gray, or tri-colored,  the selection must be based on merits, and without  preestablished competition.    [Ventura] The center is showing signs of breaking up. Would  you be ready to accept moderates from the Italian Popular Party  [PPI] like Buttiglione and Formigoni?    [Fini] The progressives clearly will become the opposition  while those from the PPI run the risk of becoming minor members  who therefore will have to choose: either one side or the other.</p>

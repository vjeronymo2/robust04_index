			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Russia and Ukraine slip toward Slav 'cold war': Tensions over nuclear arms, the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea MR LEONID Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, will not be a wholly welcome guest when he arrives in the US next week for meetings with President George Bush. He is seen as indulging in too much brinkmanship of the most dangerous kind in his relations with neighbouring Russia. There is a knot of issues between the two Slav states. One part of that is now being discussed between representatives from both in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa - control of the Black Sea Fleet. Both states are vying for control over this 380-ship, 70,000-man navy, now largely militarily obsolete. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States armed forces, said in Odessa yesterday that the talks would be 'very difficult' and that Ukraine should have 'at the maximum' 25 per cent of it. Nevertheless, that was a shift in the Russian position from one of claiming total control, and one which may make a compromise possible. Beyond the fleet dispute, however, are larger issues, all of which have their roots in the dissolution of the Soviet Union in which the two states were the largest and most influential members, and in the subsequent explosion of nationalist sentiment on both sides of their borders. That sentiment puts such pressures on both President Kravchuk and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia that a broader compromise is increasingly difficult. More important than the Black Sea fleet to both states is the Crimea, where the fleet is based. Until 1954, it was Russian territory: since then it has been Ukrainian, but the population is mainly Russian and in two months' time it is to vote in a referendum on the question of independence and of subsequent association with 'another state' - presumably Russia. Yesterday, Ukraine's parliament, in a move supported by a majority of deputies who it seems hope to avoid a referendum, proclaimed the Crimea as an 'autonomous part of the Ukraine'. However, almost half the 22 deputies walked out in protest, still demanding full independence. Most important to the international community is control of the nuclear arsenal, both strategic and tactical. No defence expert in Moscow or Kiev can give a precise figure of the tactical weapons in Ukraine - but a general estimate is of at least a thousand. Under an agreement with the CIS earlier this year, Ukraine said that these weapons would be moved to, and dismantled in, Russia by June 1992. The reductions form part of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty signed between Moscow and Washington in 1987. At the beginning of March, the Kiev government stopped transferring the weapons after about half had been moved - on the grounds that it did not believe that Russia was dismantling them, and that Russia would use them to increase its own arsenal. After many bilateral meetings between Ukrainian and Russian officials, both sides confirmed that the tactical weapons would start moving again  - though on the Russian side, the foreign ministry has said it has 'yet to see evidence of movement'. Moving the 176 strategic Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) is proving still more difficult. Under the Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement signed between the US and the former Soviet Union in Moscow in July 1991, the missile forces in the CIS must be cut from 9,700 to 4,900 by 1994. This includes 130 of the ICBMs stationed in Ukraine. Ukraine has agreed to give up this number - but the status of the remaining 46 SS-24 ICBMs, with 10 warheads each, remains contentious. Mr Kravchuk, in advance of his US visit, now insists on security guarantees from the West in return for their dismantling - citing 'territorial claims' on Ukraine from Russia as the reason for his caution. On the Russian side, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, has doubts about Ukraine's commitment to a nuclear-free status. He and other Russian officials argue that Ukraine wants to retain the 46 ICBMs as a means of protecting its independence, and of securing a seat at the table where Start II will be negotiated. 'It is clear that the (first) Start treaty was a bilateral treaty between the US and the former USSR. Whether you like it or not, Russia . . . should be the one which will ratify that treaty. The question for us is how many nuclear states will emerge in the former USSR,' said Mr Kozyrev. 'At the same time, Ukraine is demanding a status as a party to (ratifying) the Start treaty, (yet) it speaks of signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. This is a contradiction in terms,' he added. Mr Alexander Savelev, head of the independent Institute for National Security and Strategic Studies in Moscow, said: 'The question of who should control the nuclear arsenal is seen by the Ukraine as a matter of prestige, compounded by a feeling that it still sees Russia as a threat to its independence. In this sense, these 46 ICBMs could be used as a bargaining chip.' Meanwhile, in Moscow, conservative deputies at the recent Russian congress tabled a motion questioning the legality of the decision by Mr Nikita Khrushchev, a former Soviet leader (and a Ukrainian), to transfer the Crimea from Russia to the Ukraine in 1954. But the last thing Russian government officials and defence experts in Moscow want is any re-drawing of the internal borders of the former Soviet Union. 'Borders should not be changed in this period of transition. It is too dangerous. Where would it stop? The problem is the influence of nationalist forces in Russia who could push for these territorial changes,' said Mr Alexei Pankin, deputy editor of International Affairs, the Moscow-based foreign policy journal. The next few weeks should tell if compromises on the fleet, on Crimea and on possession of the weapons are possible: realistically, that is all the time both states have to broker a deal. Beyond that, the pressures from nationalist forces, rising faster the more pronounced their economic crises become, will drown out moderate voices and force a retreat into armed camps to a position now becoming all too thinkable: a 'cold war' between the Slav neighbours.</p>

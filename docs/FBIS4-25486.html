			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (XINHUA) -- A late-coming  high-tech park is rising in Pudong New Area as a driver of  industrial transformation in this old manufacturing center.    The 17-sq-k Zhangjiang Park is aimed at applying new- and  high- tech research and development to industrial production.  Education is also its focus.    Construction was started in late 1992. The city's first  high- tech development zone, Caohejing, was initiated six years  ago.    A grand project to compose biomedical industry is under way.  Now some world leaders in pharmaceuticals have poured money  into the zone, while local medical universities and research  institutes are planning to move some operations there. The  sector will turn out about 7 billion yuan (0.8 billion U.S.  dollars) in products by the end of this century, one-third of  the total in medicine production in Shanghai.    A "computer software town" is also being built in the park.    The Golden Bridge export processing zone in Pudong has  concentrated on telecommunications and other pollution-free  industries. Here two out of three projects are in the new and  high- tech field, while half of the factories are producing for  export.    More than forty large overseas and domestic companies have  located in the 19-sq-k area, together with a high-tech group  made up of 33 of China's top universities.    In the Waigaoqiao bonded zone, there is already a free flow  of goods, foreign exchange and personnel abroad. Businesses  ranging from import and export, to re-export, export processing,  bonded storage and real estate are in full swing.    Four deepwater berths have been completed, capable of  handling 2.4 million ton of goods a year.</p>

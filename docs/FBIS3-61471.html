			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T.V. Loseva, I.V. Nemchinov, Moscow; UDC </F> 533.72:535.233]    [Abstract] The principal problem arising in the study of  subsonic radiative wave propagation under the effect of laser  radiation, i.e., finding the mechanisms of its propagation,  measuring its velocity, and establishing the wave structure, is  addressed on the basis of numerous published sources. In  particular, a steady-state model with nonequilibrium radiation,  numerical calculations of the problem of plane subsonic  radiative wave propagation, steady-state model of an ultraviolet  laser-supported subsonic radiative wave, the dependence of the  subsonic ultraviolet laser-supported radiative wave parameters  on the radiation flux, two-dimensional subsonic radiative waves,  the quasi-steady subsonic radiative wave propagation conditions,  the effect of the irradiation spot radius, the effect of the  radiation nonuniformity, and the effect of the thin  reduced-density channel are considered in detail. The conclusion  is drawn that such laser pulse parameters as the pulse duration,  power, and wavelength and the properties of the gaseous medium  surrounding the obstacle are the determining factors in the  laser-supported radiative wave propagation. The analysis is  based on the analogy between the propagation of optical  discharges and combustion and detonation of flammable  substances.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hernan Cisternas Arellano in Valparaiso] </F>   [Text] Last night, Chilean President Eduardo Frei  Ruiz-Tagle announced the government's decision to propose  initiatives that would enhance Chile's presence on the high seas  and would give credence to the government's intention to protect  marine areas falling within the national jurisdiction. Frei  said the government is aware that the sea is one of the bases  for national development, and he thus wants to act accordingly  in that area.    He noted that the government will decisively support the  modernization of the Navy, which plays a key role in  safeguarding Chilean sovereignty, in effectively patrolling the  sea, and in protecting Chilean rights on the high seas.    Frei said he would continue to develop a comprehensive  fishing policy, which at this stage should reinforce its  administrative mechanisms to promote equitable access to these  resources and make rational use of them.    Frei announced publicly that he is committed to creating the  conditions for and facilities to bring about the adequate  improvement and development of the ports, which he characterized  as the backbone of Chile's maritime presence. In this regard,  he emphasized the decision to incorporate the private sector in  developing these ports.    Frei was the only speaker at last night's opening ceremony  of  the Month of the Sea celebration. Thus, he became the first  chief executive to open this celebration since it was instituted  20 years ago by Admiral Jose Toribio Merino, retired.    Attending the ceremony, which was held at the Playa Ancha  naval auditorium, were Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma;  Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro Arriada; Transport  Minister Narciso Irureta; Chamber Speaker Jorge Schaulsohn; Navy  Commander Jorge Martinez Busch; General Richard Quass,  representing the Army; Gen. Jose de la Fuente, representing the  Air Force; Gen. Fernando Cordero, representing the Carabineros;  and members of the Navy high command, among other officials.    Frei stated that there have been contradictory  interpretations of the right to fish on the high seas, which  have led to the abusive depredation of resources and  environmental degradation. He called for an international  regulation process to prevent this sort of abuse without  affecting the fundamental freedom to fish or the high seas laws,  and without aspiring to an extension of the national maritime  jurisdiction.    Frei pointed out that the Convention on Sea Rights grants  the  country having the coastline the sovereign rights to explore,  exploit, preserve, and administer natural resources within its  exclusive economic zone. He added, however, that regarding the  shared fish species, these rights lose their validity because  the country having the coastline has no ability to preserve and  administer the said resources found beyond the 200 mile zone.    Frei explained that in order to improve the legislation on  the high seas, which are thought of as an asset for the public  good, the objectives of Agenda 21 approved at the Rio-92 summit  must be taken into account. On this basis, Frei pointed out that  Chile has a five-point proposal which, as its first step, calls  for international acceptance of the UN Convention on Sea Rights,  which has been paralyzed as a result of disputes over ocean  mining. The said proposal considers first of all the negotiation  of an international convention on the preservation of fish  species that live in various zones and are highly migratory.</p>

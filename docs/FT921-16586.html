			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE records its best gain of 1991 THE OLD year closed with the FT-SE Index achieving its best daily gain for 1991 as the London stock market responded enthusiastically to Wall Street's overnight jump to fresh record levels. Also helping equities was the firm rejection by the UK chancellor of the exchequer of sterling devaluation suggestions. The Footsie advanced 73.1 to 2,493.1, bringing the gain on the year to around 16.3 per cent. Wall Street's renewed surge caught London unawares on Tuesday and, with the institutions mostly out of the market ahead of the year-end, share prices were left to the marketmakers. They, in turn, struggled with technical pressures imposed by the expiry of the FT-SE December futures and options contracts. The futures expiry, between 10.10 and 10.30am, dominated the half-day trading session. Of total Seaq-reported trading volume of 318.1m shares, around 80m changed hands in the two hours before the futures expiry. In Monday's full-day session 294.8m were traded. At Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mr Richard Kersley commented that the London market was still regarded as 'good value', if only the domestic economy would show some signs of improvement. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while the equity market was racing ahead, the Confederation of British Industry sharply reduced its 1992 growth forecast for the UK. A steadier performance by sterling following the Financial Times interview with Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, helped soothe some immediate worries. But the possibility that UK base rates will be forced to follow the ERM trend upwards, rather than the US and Japanese trend downwards, continued to unsettle financial markets. Tuesday's strongest gains came from the US-orientated stocks, which also benefited from last-minute window dressing by fund managers putting the best gloss on portfolios ahead of meetings with their trustees. Glaxo, Wellcome, Rothmans International, Reuters and Reckitt &amp; Colman all recorded substantial rises, but with ICI standing out with a gain of 6.7 per cent. There were very few exceptions to the general advance, although some insurance issues remained unsettled by worries over their mortgage indemnity problems. More surprisingly, many interest rate-related and consumer stocks moved ahead in spite of the continued concern over sterling and the outlook for base rates. Muted optimism regarding the Christmas sales season helped Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher and Great Universal Stores, while the leading brewers also gained ground. After the futures expiry, equities settled down for a while. However, the excitement soon resumed as such few traders as were in the City took the view that Wall Street had further to run and that it would be fatal to be left out of the Christmas rally in London. Since the beginning of Christmas week the Footsie has risen by 135 points or 5.7 per cent, largely in response to Wall Street's bullish reaction to the cut in the Federal Reserve's discount rate. Traders must now wait to see whether the investment fund managers, who have been on the sidelines for the past fortnight, will drive prices higher in the new year or take the opportunity to realise profits once the annual portfolio valuation is completed.</p>

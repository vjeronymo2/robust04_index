			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / TelecomAsia to raise Dollars 400m on Bangkok exchange TELECOMASIA (TA), a subsid-iary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand group, plans to raise about Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) through a partial public flotation on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which is expected to value the whole of TA at about Dollars 4bn. TA has received permission to list 223m new shares on the exchange. The existing 2bn shares are 85 per cent owned by the CP group and 15 per cent by Nynex of the US. Foreign investors will be able to buy about 40 per cent of the new shares, with the rest going to Thais, according to stockbrokers in Bangkok. The company has appointed 60 local finance and securities companies to underwrite the issue. The flotation reflects the ambitions of governments and telecommunications operators in the region. TA has a franchise to build 2m telephone lines in the Bangkok area. Another consortium, including the Japanese operator NTT, has a franchise to build 1m lines in the provinces, sharing a proportion of the network revenue with TOT, the domestic telecoms concern. TA, whose main overseas underwriter is Salomon Brothers, begins a publicity 'roadshow' in Hong Kong today, moving on to Europe and the US. With about 3 lines per 100 people, Thailand is better placed than India, the Philippines and China, but behind the economic leaders in the region. Hong Kong has 47 lines per 100; Taiwan and South Korea about 35. Mr Andrew Harrington, Salomon Brother's Asia telecoms analyst, estimates that by 1997 Thailand will have about 4.5m lines  - 9 per 100 people. The price will be set later and the shares offered to the public from November 22 to 26, with official trading starting in mid-December. Stockbrokers expect a price of 40-50 baht per share. Mr Veeravat Kanchanadul, TA vice-chairman, said the money would be used for projects in Thailand, China and IndoChina and 'value-added' services. TA recently raised Dollars 1.9bn in project financing for its Dollars 3.2bn contract to install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok. TA has plans to take a stake in a satellite launch venture for China and to install 100,000 lines in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and at least 200,000 lines in China's Hubei province. TA predicts that it will emerge from loss in 1994 to reach a net profit of Bt3bn in 1995, rising to Bt14bn in 1998. Cultivating sales, Page 28</p>

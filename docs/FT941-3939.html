			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Knave or knight? Sir, I recall the legendary island populated only by knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who never do. The logical problem, when you meet a native, is to devise a question the answer to which will tell you unequivocally whether your interlocutor is a knave or a knight. Is there perhaps a parliamentary question which would do the job? Martin Lam, Wembley, Middlesex HA9 9QJ</p>

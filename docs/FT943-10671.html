			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Ministers freed by Gambian military Gambia's new military rulers yesterday freed all the former government ministers who were detained after last month's bloodless coup, Reuter reports from Banjul. The junior officers who seized power in the small West African country on July 22 also released public officials but senior security personnel remained in custody. All 10 ex-ministers detained after the coup went to their offices yesterday to formally hand over government files to their successors appointed by Lt Yahyah Jammeh's Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council. Finance Minister Bakary Darbo, who fled with ousted President Sir Dawda Jawara after the coup, was the only member of the former cabinet to keep his job. Lt Ammeh, head of state at only 29, justified one of Africa's increasingly rare military takeovers by accusing Mr Jawara's elected administration of corruption. Mr Jawara, who had led the former British colony since 1965, was granted temporary asylum in neighbouring Senegal.</p>

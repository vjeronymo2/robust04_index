Thus they rope off yet another 'women only' area today, this time labelled First Sex. Here programmes 'made by women for women' can be shown in safety. The silliness of this patronising folderol becomes obvious when you imagine our reaction if they suggested we needed special programmes 'made by men for men' (9.00). The documentary series 20 Miles From Piccadilly Circus has been doing just what its title implies and showing how remarkably rural a village  -Eynsford - can be even when it is very close to the metropolis. This week the village policeman provides the main focus (7.30 ITV). The latest television cook, Gary Rhodes, goes to Norfolk for sausages and onion gravy in Rhodes Around Britain (8.30 BBC2). Later BBC2 begins another series of One Foot In The Past (9.45).</p>

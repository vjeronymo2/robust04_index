			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Northern Ballet Theatre Northern Ballet Theatre is in the midst of a regional tour with a triple bill. That in itself is welcome news. For years our ballet companies have had to cajole audiences with full-length offerings of often dubious merit but of proven appeal because of their title. The 'Give them anything, but call it Swan Lake' syndrome is, I trust, in decline. Triple bills at Covent Garden have latterly played to excellent houses; this spring, English National Ballet will again tour mixed programmes. Ballet is being shown as something more than feathers and fairies, with Veronese lovers as the only alternative. NBT's new programme has its own audience-lure in A Simple Man, which brought LS Lowry to the stage. Two new pieces complete the bill. I am not persuaded that the Theatre Royal, Brighton, is the right place to see dancing: sight lines are odd; the lighting on Tuesday night was cursory; the orchestra is too visible; the stage cramps movement. Both novelties are concerned with plotless dance; neither conveyed much sense of formal design to sustain incident. Graham Lustig's D'Ensemble demands far more space than Brighton could offer. Set to Dvorak's wind serenade, it shows five couples being radiant or dewy-eyed or boisterous, and, in these surroundings, too close to each other for comfort. It is taxing for the men, somewhat predictable for the women, and it merits a larger stage for its dances to be appreciated. Decoration is by Kaffe Fassett - known for his knitting designs - and proposes bright costume colours (which do not make the women's frocks any less dowdy) and a backdrop that looks like a flowery and up-market subject for a jigsaw. Extenzion is choreographed by Derek Williams, much admired as a dancer with the Harlem Dance Theatre. It is said to be a 'jazz ballet', a genre more notable than most for its cliches. The men in such exercises strut, throw off multiple technical feats with energy if not finesse, and generally indicate that St. Vitus is their patron saint. The women are called upon to behave as if on day-release from the Reeperbahn. And so it proves in this exhausting and foolish item. The chaps run and spin; the women flaunt it. The stage is bathed in red light for part of the time. There is a score by Philip Feeney that contains fascinating sonorities but must clatter in the dance's galvanic footsteps. At the back of the stage is a drop showing a version of Craigie Aitchison's Pink Vase, Still Life, which has nothing to do with anything else that is happening, and to which I would not like to give house-room. It is all hugger-mugger, and during Extenzion's too generous span I thought enviously of Simeon Stylites. NBT's casts were devoted over and above the call of duty to their tasks. They plainly believe in what they are doing; I admire them and wish I could share their convictions. NBT's tour is sponsored by BT, which also supports the company's touring Education Programme</p>

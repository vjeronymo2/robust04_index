			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ORIOLES CAN DO NO RIGHT THESE DAYS  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles are at the point where a slump degenerates into a  catastrophe, where a succession of little slips accelerates into a freefall.  </P> <P> Where they once did no wrong, they now do no right. Where they once cleared the  bases with two-out hits, they now strike out. Where they once made daring plays  that left opponents fumbling, they now fumble. Where they once pitched game  after resplendent game, as though it wasn't even a challenge, they now ask for  one well-pitched game, start to finish. Just one. And don't get it.  </P> <P> Not so long ago, it seemed they might never lose. Now it seems they might never  win again. They are tense, always behind, their eyes suddenly full of the sad  fear that overwhelmed them at the beginning of last season, when they lost 21  straight games. Now they have lost 13 of 14, and that old, spoiled-meat smell  is back. Horrors! Stephen King has slipped in and started writing the script:  Return of the Zer-O's. Yes, they're baaaaack.  </P> <P> That they still are in first place in the American League East is but an  illusion. They are chasing the teams chasing them. The others are gathering  their wits for a pennant race. The Orioles are at wits' end, out of pitchers  and answers. They have splashed about in the sunny happiness that is first  place for 68 straight days, but unless they straighten their sagging posture,  their tenure will soon end.  </P> <P> This hard truth became evident Tuesday at Fenway Park, where the Orioles played  two games with the Boston Red Sox, one in the afternoon and one at night. Given  two chances to lessen the pain of the bruises they have gathered on this Road  Trip From Hell, they failed twice, accelerating their potato-sack drop from the  heights.  </P> <P> Before the largest day-night doubleheader audience in Fenway history -- more  than a total of 70,000 -- the Orioles first lost a heartbreaker, a drama that  turned on a pop fly lost in the sun, a failed bunt that set up the winning run  and a passel of blown scoring chances. The second game was a Mike Tyson fight.  One punch -- Nick Esasky's three-run homer in the fourth inning -- and down  went the sucker.  </P> <P> And so the Orioles were left with hard numbers to study. Just 13 days ago, they  left home with a 7 1/2-game lead, humming along as comfortably as a tuned-up  roadster out for a spin on a new blacktop. Now, their lead is one game. If they  lose to the Red Sox on Wednesday night, they will return home Thursday in  second place.  </P> <P> "It hasn't happened overnight, but it has been a very short period of time,"  Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson said. "It's tough to believe we're playing the  way we've been playing. Every game I think we're going to go back to the way  we're capable of playing. Then after each game we come back and say, 'Well,  maybe the next one.' It's tough to believe it's happening, but it is. I see it.  And it's not going to go away until we make it go away."  </P> <P> It would not take that much. One well-pitched game. One clutch hit that turned  a loss into a win, frowns back into smiles. One moment of improvised  brilliance; something. But when losing hangs around, it becomes a habit. "The  more it's there, the more you know it's there," Robinson said. "The more you  lose, the more pressure you feel. It becomes a harder cycle to break."  </P> <P> When the cycle lasts this long, every mistake becomes magnified, for without  it, perhaps, the cycle might have ended. The first game Tuesday was full of  such very little, very big mistakes. It was a game that could have come close  to righting the Orioles, and instead, it made matters worse.  </P></p>

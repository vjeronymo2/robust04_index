General Tran Van Quang, alleged author of remarks reported  in  one of the documents, said the study by U.S. Intellegency Agency  [as heard] released in Washington on Monday backed the Vietnam's  stand that the documents were fabrications. He said the verdict  by the U.S. agency would help speed up normal relations and  benefit both Vietnam and America.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 14m seeks to expand range Devro International, the Scottish-based company which makes sausage casings out of the protein collagen, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.1m in the six months to June 30, a 17 per cent rise on the pro-forma figures of the corresponding period of 1993. Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said the company was 'continuing to progress as planned.' It would continue to examine opportunities around the world 'to extend and improve our product range.' Sales rose 3 per cent to Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 46.3m), of which 1 per cent was due to exchange rate factors. Devro, which was founded by Johnson &amp; Johnson, was floated on the stock exchange last year after earlier being bought out by its managers. The company said it had done well in the first half in the UK, the US and the Australian markets, in all of which it has manufacturing plants. But it suffered a 19 per cent drop in sales in Japan, mainly because of recession. New product lines are being brought out for the Japanese and Scandinavian markets. New manufacturing plant has been installed at Bellshill in Scotland to increase output of collagen film. Devro is also testing a new product, aimed at the US market, for sausages of up to 45mm diameter, compared with its present limit of 30mm. Despite increased raw material costs, operating margins rose from 27 per cent to 29.5 per cent. Interest received of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 470,000 charge) reflected increased cash on the balance sheet of Pounds 9.2m, against Pounds 4.2m at December 31. Earnings per share were 7.9p (6.4p) and an increased interim dividend of 2.35p is being paid (2.08p). COMMENT Devro is a conservatively run company whose future lies in the gradual erosion by collagen of traditional gut sausage casing. To speed up the process it is developing several new products for its far-flung markets. Its results were in line with expectations, but the shares fell 19p to 230p on a poor day for the stock exchange. There was evidently some profit taking as the market realised that Devro's operating margin will have to be even more powerful to offset the rising tax charge of the next few years. Some analysts are questioning its growing cash pile, but Devro insists it is under no pressure to reduce it, though it does not rule out acquisitions. Analysts are sticking to their forecast of about Pounds 29.5m for the full year, meaning earnings per share of 16.5p and a prospective multiple of 14. That suggests a period of consolidation for Devro.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: Greece seeks alumina plant partner Greece is seeking a third partner to participate in an Dollars 850m Russo-Greek project to build an alumina refinery in central Greece, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETVA), in charge of the venture, said yesterday that the new partner would have to contribute at least one-third of Dollars 350m in overall equity but could undertake management of the refinery. Work at the site started in 1988 but was interrupted last year because credits from the Greek state investment budget could no longer be guaranteed.</p>

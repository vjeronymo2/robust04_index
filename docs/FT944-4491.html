			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / What is the access deficit contribution? BT's prices are capped by a series of formulae which relate its tariffs to the retail prices index. It receives fees, which are closely monitored by the regulator, from competitors for accepting and delivering calls in its role as dominant operator with a network which stretches almost everywhere in the UK. As network owner BT is obliged to provide a universal service at reasonable cost. In practice, it is prevented by Oftel from charging line rental which would reflect the fully allocated costs of providing and maintaining customer connections to the network. BT funds this access deficit through artificially high call charges. When a competitor connects to BT's network to route a call to its destination, the cost of carriage charge includes the cost of providing customers' connections. The access deficit contribution is intended to compensate BT for this loss of revenue. Most of its competitors have had part of this fee waived as an encouragement to competition. Interconnection charges to BT can represent between a half and two-thirds of a competing operator's costs.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Intel subsidiary signs pact with Chinese group A unit of US chip maker Intel signed a co-operation pact with Jitong Communications, an information and telecom vendor under China's electronics ministry, Reuter reports from Beijing. The deal involves Jitong opening an exhibition centre in Beijing this year to show Intel networking and personal conferencing products. It will later be contracted as an authorised dealer for those products. Intel indicated the Jitong pact would lead to lucrative contracts in China's national data network development. Jitong is seen as an important contractor with China's so-called Three Goldens - an urban digital network, dubbed Golden Bridge; a national smart card credit clearing network, called Golden Card; and a unified customs administration network, called Golden Customs.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / People: Prudential picks outsider to fill Jackson's hole Next month Bob Saltzman will become the first person from outside the founding family to be president and chief executive of Jackson National Life, one of the largest US life insurance companies, writes Alison Smith. Set up in 1961 as a family firm, Jackson National was acquired in 1986 by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, but the senior management remained in place. David Pasant, the younger son of the founder, left last June after 20 years with the company. Saltzman, 51, was appointed after Mick Newmarch, the Pru's chief executive, had seen a number of candidates found by a search consultancy. Newmarch says Saltzman, who spent the past ten years at SunAmerica, one of Jackson National's rivals, was chosen on the basis of his 30 years' experience in the industry and because of his success at SunAmerica where he was executive vice-president. In the gap before Saltzman was appointed, Jackson National was run by John Knutson, chief operating officer, who will stay with the company. 'He has been minding the shop pro tem and dependably, but we were interested in someone to take responsibility for the whole operation,' Newmarch says. He was not, he added, disappointed at not being able to appoint a chief executive from within Jackson National; Pasant was only in his early 40s when he left, so the succession policy was bound to be different from what it would have been had the chief executive been older.</p>

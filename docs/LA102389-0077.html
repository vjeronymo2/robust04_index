			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> THE QUAKE AT A GLANCE;  </P> <P> THE DAMAGE  </P> <P> The state Office of Emergency Services now estimates damage at more than $6.4  billion, including about $1 billion to state highways and bridges. U.S. Sen.  Alan Cranston's office estimates total damage at $7.12 billion, including $2.5  billion in San Francisco alone.  </P> <P> The OES estimates 405 single family homes, 104 mobile homes and an unknown  number of apartments destroyed, and 107,768 single-family homes, 20 mobile  homes and 320 apartments damaged.  </P> <P> The OES estimates 99 businesses and three public buildings destroyed, and 1,554  businesses and 24 public buildings damaged.  </P> <P> The state estimates that 7,362 people were displaced from homes, 5,000 of them  in Santa Cruz and 1,100 in San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Casualties  </P> <P> Deaths: Latest figures from the state Office of Emergency Services show that 60  people died, with 38 of the bodies found in the wreckage of the Nimitz Freeway  in Oakland.  </P> <P> Injuries: The state tally is 3,012, with 900 of them in Santa Clara County, 862  in Santa Cruz and 566 in San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Services  </P> <P> Bay Area Rapid Transit added trains, buses and ferries and increased schedules  to handle above-normal loads as transportation officials sought ways to ease  traffic jams expected today as people return to work.  </P> <P> Electric power, water and other utilities were restored to most areas. Drinking  water and portable showers were trucked into mountain areas like Redwood  Estates, where water service will not be restored for days.  </P> <P> Telephone service to the 2.5 million Bay Area customers suffered little from  the earthquake, except for overburdened use. But officials worry that weekend  rain could knock out service in some areas by seeping through cable casings  cracked or twisted in the quake.  </P> <P> The Federal Emergency Management Agency said seven one-stop disaster assistance  centers opened Sunday. Victims can register for everything from temporary  housing to grants and loans. One center will be located in each of the  hardest-hit counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sports  </P> <P> World Series play is scheduled to resume Friday at Candlestick, although  Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said there could be further delays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aftershocks  </P> <P> More than 2,000 aftershocks have been recorded, with 52 over magnitude 3.5 and  at least 20 over magnitude 4.  </P></p>

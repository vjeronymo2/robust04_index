			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lt-Col Vyacheslav Ilich Kim, chief of Naval </F> Engineer Services, by correspondent G. Lyubayev; place and date  of interview not given: "Postscript to a Seizure"]    [Text] Administrative structures of the Ukrainian Navy are  continuing their attempts to unilaterally resubordinate units of  the Black Sea Fleet's Naval Engineer Services (MIS). The  Ukrainian side is using the most diverse assortment of  uncivilized methods of influence to this end--persuasion and  promises, blackmail and threats, and even demonstrations of  force. Recently for example, premises of the Odessa and  Nikolayev MIS [Naval Engineer Services] departments were taken  under the control of armed representatives of the Ukrainian Navy.    How could this have happened before a political solution was  found for the Black Sea Fleet? Who specifically made it possible  for the provocative acts of seizing MIS subunits in Odessa and  Nikolayev to occur? What conclusions follow from an analysis of  these events? The editor's office is receiving many such  questions today. In order to answer them, our correspondent met  with Colonel Vyacheslav Kim, chief of the Naval Engineer  Services, and interviewed him.    [Lyubayev] Vyacheslav Ilich, when and how did you learn  that,  for example, the Odessa branch of the OMIS [Department of Naval  Engineer Services] snapped and is hanging by thread, if I may  put it that way?    [Kim] I got a phone call in the evening. It was from Captain  A. Sharapov, deputy chief of the OMIS. "What should I do?" was  the first question he anxiously asked. The situation was clearly  out of the ordinary. As it turns out, OMIS chief Major N.  Klyushnikov had quietly transferred his allegiance to Ukraine  and then acted unpredictably.    I couldn't see the details from by distant vantage point.  Therefore I gave Sharapov the textbook instructions. If  Klyushnikov did in fact decide to change his place of service,  then let him leave for the Ukrainian Navy. And he, Captain  Sharapov, should naturally take over his duties until a decision  was made by the commander. It didn't seem like there should be  any special difficulties. But it became clear from further  discussion that everything was much more complex than I thought.  The OMIS building was taken under guard by Ukrainian servicemen,  and this raiding party (15 well-instructed youths) would not  allow Captain Sharapov into his office, and was generally  behaving provocatively.    Does this mean that someone in Kiev decided to once again  test the patience of Black Sea Fleet seamen? The plan, I think,  is simple. If the command of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian  side were to confine themselves to restrained condemnation of  the predatory act, then the violators of the Massandra  agreements could boldly move further in their forcible transfer  of the entire infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet to Ukrainian  jurisdiction. Let them carry on with their presidential meetings  at the top according to plan, let them seek political solutions  to the difficult problems, while we at the level of the  Ukrainian Navy will start another process here--that of  confiscating another's property and changing the allegiance of  the personnel, and the spirit of adventuristic attack and a  freebooter's luck will aid us in these efforts. But can a  "state" navy be created on such shaky ground?    [Lyubayev] The answer to that, Vyacheslav Ilich, is evident  in your question. How did events develop in the Nikolayev MIS  department?    [Kim] Basically along the same mystery-novel line.  Lieutenant  Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy, chief of the MIS department, renounced  his first oath in secret and then took another--the Ukrainian  oath--together with his deputy, Captain G. Kotelenets. After  that, the story follows the familiar rut. These newly made  "officials of the Nikolayev OMIS of the Ukrainian Navy" began  summoning the department's civilian associates and demanding  their unquestioning obedience to the new department.    I don't have anything against those officers and shore-based  and seagoing warrant officers who transfer to the Ukrainian Navy  in a civilized way. That's the right of each person--to serve  wherever he sees fit. But I can't at all understand people who  say one thing today and then do quite the opposite tomorrow.    After all, no one forced that Major N. Klyushnikov to  portray  himself as being faithful to his oath forever. When I met him at  a conference of MIS department and unit executives I asked him  what he would do if Ukrainian "emissaries" asked him to stand  beneath the yellow and blue banner. Nikolay Vasilyevich  protested with righteous indignation. How could you ask me such  a thing, Comrade Commander, I never would, for anything! But  then just a few days later he goes and quietly transfers his  allegiance and allows the Ukrainian side to seize the OMIS by  force.    The same hypocritical situation (I simply can't find any  other words) essentially repeated itself in a conversation with  Lieutenant Colonel Ye. Krichevskiy. He sent his deputy to the  conference I mentioned above in his stead, and so I had to  telephone Yevgeniy Ruvimovich, who "fell ill" unexpectedly, and  ask him point-blank--had he already taken another oath? His  answer was no. Krichevskiy was not about to soil his honor as an  officer, he was faithful to the Black Sea Fleet, and so on in  the same spirit. And then I learned that Yevgeniy Ruvimovich had  been toying with me. With the first psychological attack by  Ukrainian recruiters, he agreed to carry out a "revolution" in  the department.    [Lyubayev] The impression is created that the Ukrainian  naval  department is "snipping away" at the Black Sea Fleet's  infrastructure by just one means--from above. They persuade or  frighten a subunit chief and force him to change his allegiance,  and then it is assumed that all of the administration under his  control would transfer to the Ukrainian Navy.    [Kim] This is precisely how the Ukrainian side proceeded in  "disconnecting" the Odessa and Nikolayev MIS departments from  the Black Sea Fleet. You needn't even ask whether such an act is  legal. Armed seizure of two of our OMIS sections is a concrete  expression of legal tyranny which some local representatives of  the Ukrainian Navy are so eager to legalize. But this naturally  sounds an alarm: Who is going to answer, and to whom, if  material valuables in unilaterally Ukrainianized MIS subunits  are squandered? Officially, after all, Major Klyushnikov,  Lieutenant Colonel Krichevskiy and his deputy, Captain  Kotelenets, have been dismissed from their positions and  discharged into the reserves. But in reality they continue to  portray themselves as full-fledged chiefs, and no one knows how  this will end.    [Lyubayev] It is but one step from such confrontation to  dangerous conflict. In response to the forcible act by Ukrainian  servicemen, Black Sea Fleet seamen might respond with adequate  actions, and then the stage would be set for scuttling of the  soon to be held Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet.  But could this be something someone in Kiev actually wants? And  is patience on the part of the command of the Black Sea Fleet  the only reasonable response today to the provocations from the  other side?    [Kim] Judging from everything, it isn't because things are  going so well for it that the Ukrainian Navy is taking such  actions against our fleet. When you get right down to it, the  organizers of such actions can hardly take joy in their  successes in recruiting certain Black Sea Fleet officials to  serve in behalf of the idea of Ukrainian self-rule. It wouldn't  of course be all that hard to gather together a certain number  of managers like Klyushnikov, Krichevskiy and Kotelenets.  Except, will this "nucleus of executive personnel" be  sufficiently dependable and professionally mature? I hardly  think so. Anyone who once transfers his allegiance isn't going  to distinguish himself with an exemplary attitude toward his  work. Personal interests and unfulfilled ambitions are almost  always foremost in the minds of such a person.    [Lyubayev] What type of personnel are the glue, in your  opinion, holding together the unity of the Black Sea Fleet today?    [Kim] It would be the officers and shore-based and seagoing  warrant officers who are in no hurry to run from one army to  another, to change their convictions and emblems, and their  life's reference points. Such people include, for example,  Captain Aleksandr Sharapov from the Odessa OMIS, who remained  faithful to his oath, and Colonel Sergey Dybovskiy, chief of the  Nikolayev UNR, who categorically refused to assist in the  resubordination of his collective to Ukrainian will. Nor did  Captain 2d Rank Aleksandr Tkach, chief of the Izmail MIS  department, give in to blackmail and threats. In order frighten  him, they told this officer that if he did not transfer his  allegiance, he would never find a place to live in Izmail, and  he shouldn't expect anything good to happen in his future. But  no matter how hard those wretched recruiters try to win over the  real patriots of the fatherland by their ridiculous scare  tactics, they can't bring down the unified Black Sea Fleet.    It is on this optimistic note that I would like to end our  discussion.    [Lyubayev] Thank you for the interview.</p>

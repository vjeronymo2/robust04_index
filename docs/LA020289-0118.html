			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALHAMBRA, SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD SETTLE SUIT  </P> <P> An 8-year-old legal battle between Alhambra and the Southern Pacific Railroad  has ended with the city paying the railroad $6.8 million, according to City  Manager Kevin Murphy.  </P> <P> The lawsuit stems from a joint project between the city, the railroad and the  state to eliminate grade crossings along Mission Boulevard, Murphy said.  </P> <P> Previously, the tracks had been at street level, contributing to traffic  congestion at crossings. The project called for lowering the tracks 25 to 30  feet below ground level and building eight bridges to carry traffic over the  tracks.  </P> <P> The city had proposed the project, completed in 1977 for $19.5 million, mainly  to ease the city's north-south traffic flow, he said.  </P> <P> A dispute began when the railroad asked to be reimbursed for granting the city  a temporary construction easement and for what it described as decreased  property values resulting from the project. The railroad asked for $6 million,  but the city was willing to pay only $1 million.  </P> <P> The case, begun with a lawsuit filed in 1980, ended after a monthlong trial in  July, 1987, when a jury awarded the railroad $6 million plus interest, for a  total of $9 million. When the city announced that it planned to appeal the  decision, the railroad agreed to a $6.8-million settlement, which the city paid  two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "The company was interested in accepting cash now rather than waiting for a  period of time," said Anthony Parrille, attorney for the Southern Pacific  Transportation Co. He said an appeal could have taken several more years.  </P> <P> "The railroad is happy that it got compensation for its property," Parrille  said.  </P> <P> Despite the long legal battle, the project was worth it, Murphy said. Before it  was completed, he said, residents traveling from the north end of town to the  south faced lengthy delays when trains passed. The trains also impeded response  time of police and fire teams, he said.  </P></p>

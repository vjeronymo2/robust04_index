			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / House prices fall 1 per cent HOUSE PRICES fell 1 per cent last month, according to seasonally adjusted figures from Halifax Building Society. It was the sixth consecutive monthly fall, but Halifax said it expected the clear Tory win at the election to rekindle confidence, with prices stabilising later this year. That would be followed by a gentle rise before Christmas and a strengthening in 1993. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the winter and election uncertainties had kept mortgage lending subdued in the first quarter but the interest rate cuts should help it to pick up. Gross mortgage advances in the three months fell to Pounds 12.8bn from Pounds 14.9bn in the previous quarter. New lending fell nearly 15 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Toward the end of last week, the expanded military  council of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces  [Minfar] held an assessment meeting where it evaluated the  performance of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] during 1993.  The meeting was chaired by Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of  the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and Minister of the FAR. The  meeting concluded with a solemn and moving ceremony to promote  Enrique Carreras Rolas, a hero of the Republic of Cuba, to the  rank of division general.    The military council made the final assessment of all the  activities of the FAR during 1993, which had already been  previously analyzed in the last days of the mentioned year. The  review demonstrated the gigantic and fruitful effort in the  three armies with all the types of weapons that defend the  national territory, which shows a strengthening of the combat  capacity and readiness to successfully wage the people's war in  case of enemy aggression.    Significant progress was achieved in the combat readiness of  the personnel, which in Cuba includes millions of men and women  of the FAR and the reserves of the Territorial Troops Militia  [MTT] and the production and defense brigades.    Last year's maintenance and conservation of equipment and  arms and preparation of the theater of military operations  demanded arduous and intense labor that included several million  weapons and war equipment and the mobilization of hundreds of  thousands of men and women in the country to build the people's  defense tunnels and other fortifications.    These heroic deeds performed in 1993 are a continuation of  the heroic deeds achieved in the two previous years. The results  of the three years as a whole have elevated the vitality of the  combat arms and equipment, and the protection of these by the  combatants and the civil population in the face of eventual  enemy aggression. All this was achieved in midst of the  shortages of the special period.    Another important point on the agenda was the FAR's  activities in the agricultural-livestock areas, which are aimed  at achieving self-sufficiency among the troops. As in the past  year, the food production goals for 1994 represent a 30 percent  increase, which would get the FAR closer to its goal of becoming  completely self sufficient. Great emphasis was placed on all  military agricultural-livestock enterprises working towards  reducing costs and increasing productivity and yields, which is  the only way to achieve affordability and profitability. It was  mentioned that the Youth Labor Army [EJT] cares for 15,000  caballerias of land throughout the country and that they produce  632,000 tons of food annually for the national economy.    The reduction of the military budget by 50 percent was  another encouraging observation that the council session made.  This contributes to reducing the deficit of the state budget.  The elevated conduct of discipline and the moral and political  state of the troops were described as satisfactory. The council  was happy to verify that the work of the FAR's restructuring to  adapt itself to the current conditions of the national economy  was done as planned, while achieving the goal of maintaining the  defensive power of the country and perfecting the FAR's  efficiency and combat disposition, deepening even more the  doctrinal and tactical concepts of the people's war.    The homage to General Carreras, on the occasion of his 50th  anniversary as a combat pilot, highlighted his clean record, his  stand against the Nazi-fascist movement, Batista's dictatorship,  and U.S. imperialism, and his elevated patriotism, and  revolutionary spirit. These feelings successively made him a  combat pilot during World War II and the struggle against the  fascist aggressors. He joined the national army when its role  was defined by the Constitution of 1940 as body for the defense  of national sovereignty. He joined the conspiracy that emerged  from the heart of that army, as a rejection to Batista's  military coup and was jailed by the tyranny for refusing to bomb  the insurgent population of Cienfuegos.    In the unequal air combat against the mercenary aggression  at the Bay of Pigs, Carreras had the opportunity he had hoped  for since his youth: defend national independence in the most  audacious and risky situation in the skies of the fatherland. He  shot down two B-26 airplanes and made serious attacks on the  enemy naval group. His heroism in those battles and his  extensive record of service to the Revolution made him worthy of  the title: hero of the Republic of Cuba. Carreras, who is 71  years old, continues to be an active member of the FAR. He is  one of those generals that die with their boots on.    Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first substitute  to  the Minister of the FAR and head of the General Staff, concluded  the ceremony with these words:    [Begin Rosales recording] I am sure that I speak for the  Minister of the FAR and all those present when I say that  together with the fearlessness and courage, honesty and firmness  of principles, General Carreras has the virtue of modesty and  trustworthiness of which he has become a true model and which  has never been tarnished by the deserved promotions and  recognitions, including the honorary title of Hero of the  Republic of Cuba. For that reason, I would like to conclude my  speech by expressing to Division General Enrique Carreras Solas  that our party, the people, and their FAR are proud to have you  among its generals. We, the officers of the FAR, are honored to  be able to be your comrade in arms, and disciples of your  personal example. Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording]    Present at the ceremony were Retired Division General  (Hector  Rios Eregnu). (Rios), who is a retired officer of the sister  Republic of Argentina, is in Cuba with his family on a private  visit and was invited by the Minister of the FAR to attend the  ceremony.</p>

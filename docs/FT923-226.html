			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Move to avert liquidation at MMI LOCAL-AUTHORITY policy-holders of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurance company, will press creditors to accept a scheme of arrangement if this week's rescue talks with a number of European insurance companies break down. The Labour party yesterday said a scheme of arrangement would be 'the preferable action for both local-authority and individual policyholders'. In a scheme of arrangement - under Section 425 of the Companies Act - MMI would cease to trade but continue to administer the payment of claims. That would avert a potentially costly liquidation of the company. Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said such a solution 'is likely to produce better realisations from reinsurance debtors and would permit earlier dividends to creditors than in the event of a court winding-up'. Mr Clive Grenyer, under-secretary of the Conservative-controlled Association of County Councils, said a scheme would be 'the responsible course of action'. It would allow local authorities to have at least some of their outstanding claims paid. The company yesterday called off a meeting with Mr Grenyer and other representatives of local-authority associations, because of 'the delicate nature of negotiations' with the French group, Garantie Mutuelle des Foncionnaires. Municipal Mutual insisted that its talks with the French group would take place as planned this week. GMF said on Monday that it was no longer interested in acquiring Municipal Mutual's business, but it is understood to be prepared to act as go-between in MMI's talks with other members of Eurosafe - a loose network of European companies that sell insurance to civil servants and local government. GMF's chairman Mr Jean-Luis Petriat is chairman of the Eurosafe consortium, whose members also include HUK Coburg of Germany, Societe Mutuelle des Administrations Publiques of Belgium, Gruppo MEIE Assicuriazioni of Italy, Nueva Corporacion of Spain, Laederstandens Brandforsikring of Denmark, Phoenix General Insurance of Greece, Lusitania of Portugal and Les Assurances Mutuelles d'Europe of Luxembourg. An increasing number of local authorities, especially those renewing in October, are considering moving their policies away from Municipal Mutual. Brokers say insurance cover is available in both the company and Lloyd's markets, although buyers are generally having to accept much larger excesses  -the portion of any claim which they must pay. Some local authorities are reported to be finding difficulty in obtaining insurance for employers and public liability. The Consumers' Association pressed the government yesterday to issue a definitive statement on the future of Municipal Mutual.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / People: Career paths crossing Europe's skies American Airlines has moved its international headquarters from the US to London and appointed Hans Mirka, a 28-year airline industry veteran, to run its expanding international operations. Mirka becomes senior vice president international and will oversee all the airline's passenger and cargo sales and services in Europe, the Pacific, the Middle East, south east Asia and Africa from the new international headquarters. European operations include those it took over from TWA's North Atlantic routes. Mirka, who had been in charge of American Airlines' international operations at Dallas for the past three years, will be the highest ranking manager in the US airline industry to be based in Europe. Born in Estonia, Mirka began his career at American Airlines in 1964. After serving as market development manager in New York, he left to join Finnair as its sales manager for North America. In 1971, he returned to American Airlines and helped launch its first European service from Dallas to Gatwick. He also worked for Continental and PanAm before returning to American in 1989. ***** British Aerospace has, for its part, appointed a new chairman for its North American subsidiary responsible for both North and South America. Robert Kirk, the chairman of CSX, the US transport group, is replacing Brian Thomas at the head of BAe's American operations. He will continue as chairman of CSX. Kirk was appointed a non-executive director of BAe last year becoming the UK company's first non-British director. The appointment was part of BAe's efforts to strengthen its board after the fiasco of its controversial rights issue last autumn and the resignation of Professor Sir Roland Smith as chairman of BAe. ***** Air UK, the Stansted-based airline, has appointed Marcelle Speller to its board as marketing director. Speller was previously vice president strategic planning with American Express Travel Related Services for the UK and Ireland. She is also a former vice president marketing for Europe and the Middle East for Inter-Continental Hotels and has worked for Avis and Heineken Breweries. Her appointment at Air UK coincides with an intensification of competition in the European air transport industry as a result of the European Commission's airline liberalisation policy and the development of a single European air transport market. ***** Cathay Pacific has replaced John Olsen, its previous general manager for Europe who left to become chief executive of Dan Air's parent, Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, with Tony Tyler, who arrives from head office in Hong Kong. Tyler, 36, joined Cathay Pacific parent John Swire in 1977, moving to the airline a year later. More recently he was manager of Italy and France where he was responsible for setting up new routes to Hong Kong from Paris and Rome. He has also worked on the service from America and Japan. Since 1988 he has been general staff manager looking after all aspects of group personnel policy. He will be based in London, developing capacity and frequency of the European routes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the URNG (Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F> Unity) General Command on the resumption of peace negotiations,  dated 20 January 1994]    [Text] With the signing of the Framework Agreement on 10  January in Mexico City, the negotiations process, which was  impeded by the obstacles placed by recalcitrant sectors of the  Army and private sector, is resumed.    This agreement to resume the negotiations is a step that  must  be duly assessed; at the same time, its essence and scope must  be defined.    The signed document is an instrument and sets a stage that  entails permanent and growing application. This is the renewal  of a process that opens the doors to difficult and complex  phases of dialogue and negotiations. This cannot be downplayed  or overestimated. We have a great deal before us; we can  achieve a great deal.    This framework, as a whole and given its specifications,  guarantees the contents of the negotiations.    A necessary and essential starting point for the solution to  an armed conflict with the characteristics of the Guatemalan  conflict is the recovery, as a basis and foundation, of all that  is positive from the process that began with the signing of the  Oslo Agreement. Above all, the agreed upon agenda in Mexico  should be maintained at the negotiations table. The essential  political, economic, and social topics, which are called  substantive, must not be excluded.    The fact that the participation of civilian sectors in the  negotiations was agreed upon through an assembly, which will  discuss and decide the substantive issues, and that the result  of this opinion will be one of the most important for the  negotiations between the Government-Army and the URNG represents  progress. It carries undeniable political and social weight  which undoubtedly neither of the parties can ignore.    The civilian sectors, summoned by the Legislative Assembly  president, appointed by the Episcopal Conference, will  sovereignly decide on the assembly's name, operation, internal  policies, and mechanisms.    The terms of agreed upon legality and representation do not  mean any limitation due to legal reasons; the parties have  explicitly agreed upon this. It has also been made very clear  and agreed upon to engage in a clean process, not to manipulate  or hamper the assembly's work. The term "nongovernment" means  those organizations that do not belong to or are not linked  directly or indirectly to state structures.    The civilian sectors, led by the Legislative Assembly  president, whom both parties hope will be Monsignor Rodolfo  Quezada Toruno, have a constructive stage that its  representatives can take advantage of to foster and express  their aspirations. [sentence as published]    The negotiations must be open and trustworthy for the  parties. Through the Legislative Assembly president, mechanisms  will be created so that the civilian sectors can have the  necessary information. So that certain aspects of the  negotiations will not be manipulated, the reserve required by  the international organizations is necessary, something we  accept. This is not an attempt to hide the issues and results  of the negotiations, nor does it constitute any limitation on  the civilian sectors to freely express themselves on the issues  they broach.    The United Nation's nature of moderation, with its powers to  convene, as promoter of initiatives and as an adviser, is the  most adequate, given the characteristics of our negotiations  process to resolve the armed conflict in our nation. The United  Nation's moral weight and guaranty of verification of all the  agreements, substantive as well as operative, make it essential  for the feasibility of the process.    An agreement on fulfilling human rights is not excluded from  the negotiations. This issue, which should be immediately  implemented and verified internationally, is the initial and  irreplaceable point of the first negotiation session. It is the  first test of political willingness, but, above all, it is a  fundamental condition and guarantee for the agreed upon  negotiations.    An overall agreement is only possible if all of the points  on  the agenda are satisfactorily resolved. This year's goal, as  indicated in the agreement, is to make all of the necessary  efforts to attain the signing of a firm and lasting peace  agreement. The temporary framework does not present nor  condition the contents and development of the negotiations, nor  does it mean the negotiation is concluded beforehand.    The URNG Command affirms its willingness to continue  fighting  for all of the people's aspirations. It trusts that within the  framework of this agreement, with the guarantees that the  various sectors of Guatemalan society should give, these will  provide their decisive contribution for the construction of a  just and democratic peace.    [Signed] URNG Command    [Dated] 20 January 1994</p>

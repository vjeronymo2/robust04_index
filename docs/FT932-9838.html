			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Urban renewal policy attacked THE WORK of urban development corporations has proved expensive and has not had much impact on inner-city communities, says a report published today. The study, prepared for the Baring Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, says the government has failed to give the corporations a clear remit about their responsibilities to local communities, leaving each corporation to decide for itself. The report singles out the corporations' emphasis on property regeneration for criticism. The government, which funds the corporations, should clarify their objectives, it adds. The report says the government has been ambivalent about the corporations' role in helping to create jobs. It includes a mid-term analysis of the performance of the Tyne &amp; Wear and Teesside development corporations, which it says have together spent more than Pounds 300m in the past five years, becoming big operators in the business of reconstruction. But the report, by Durham University's department of sociology and social policy, describes the performance of the two corporations in job creation as disappointing. It recommends that corporations should be less secretive and set up systems to monitor community benefit. It predicts the government will conclude that corporations turned out to be 'an expensive experiment with a high cost-per-job and poorly targeted benefits'. More than Bricks and Mortar?

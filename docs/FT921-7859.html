			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): UK heads the EC theft table - The latest vehicle security methods MOST people have either experienced or know somebody who has experienced car theft. That is a statistical probability, as demonstrated by the fact that the UK leads the rest of the EC in the number of vehicle related thefts - 7.1 per 1,000 head of population, according to figures compiled by the Insurance Service. Compare that with the figures per head of population for France (4.2), Italy (3.64) and Germany (1.14) and it is not hard to see why these crimes have become such a hot topic for the motor industry, government and fleet operators. Among the UK Home Secretary's reactions to this growing problem was a declaration of his intention to make 'joyriding' a criminal offence. The resultant Aggravated Vehicle Taking Bill has now completed the committee stage in the Lords, to be followed by a third reading in the Commons. Furthermore, the Home Office this month launched its new Pounds 5m initiative, Crime Prevention Year 1992. The intention is to involve the public, as well as businesses, industries and organisations, in an attempt to eradicate car crime. Among those most seriously affected by these problems are companies such as rental and leasing companies. which operate vehicles as their prime source of revenue. For this reason, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) has over the past five years been operating an annual award scheme for manufacturers it considers do the most to build into their products deterrents to the thief. But progress appears to have been disappointing. Mr Freddie Aldous, BVRLA vice-chairman, says: 'As far as the majority of companies are concerned, very little has been done, contributing to a situation which is, at best, depressing. Manufacturers have a clear social responsibility to ensure that cars, vans and trucks are made as difficult as possible to be used illegally and action cannot be delayed any longer.' Among the few exceptions, according to the BVRLA, has been Vauxhall, which has won the award three times. When making its third presentation to Vauxhall, the association congratulated the company for remaining a clear leader in the field and for demonstrating that additional progress had been made over the previous 12 months. At present, Vauxhall fits deadlocks to five out its six car model ranges, which the company claims account for more than 80 per cent of new Vauxhalls now on sale. Immobilisers, too, are standard where alarms are fitted, such as on higher level Astras, Cavaliers and Carltons, plus all Calibras and Senators. Vauxhall claims this accounts for 25 per cent of all its cars. Among Vauxhall's other security measures are the provision of car stereo units with either removable displays or, on the new Astra, displays which are located separately from the control unit and payment to its dealers for etching on every window surface the registration number of all new cars and vans. Renault, too, is taking steps to make its vehicles more secure. The company has initiated a programme whereby its complete range of high-performance cars will be protected by the Renault Anti-theft Protection System. This is a key-operated engine ignition inhibitor, hidden within the car, although a dashboard light shows the system is in operation and there are windscreen logos to warn the potential thief. The new device was introduced with the recent launch of the Renault Clio 16-valve. It has since been phased in on the 16V and Cabriolet versions of the Renault 19, 21 Turbo and 21 Turbo Quadra, plus Alpine GTA. In addition, Renault's Bureau des Etudes in France is evaluating a new vehicle security device known as Verrou Logiciel (literally: 'digital lock') for lower-specification models. Due for introduction in the UK towards the end of the year, this is an electronically-controlled keypad, located in the passenger compartment, on which the driver has to key in a numbered code before the car's engine management system can be 'unlocked'. According to a Renault spokesman, one of the options under evaluation is that of linking this device to the Renault 'Plip' remote control system for the central locking, so that one beam from the driver's key ring allows both the doors to be unlocked and the engine to be started. Meanwhile, at BMW (GB) - which has received a commendation from the BVRLA security award judging panel - a call was made in November for the removal of car tax and VAT from engine immobilisers, to reduce retail prices and encourage consumer demand. 'Should the Treasury support the Home Office by adopting tax incentives, BMW would respond with 100 per cent fitment of immobilisers as soon as practically possible,' promised Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB). He adds that in September the Home Secretary asked manufacturers to fit deadlocks, visible chassis numbers and immobilisers to new vehicles. While BMW has been fitting deadlocks to all its models since 1988 and visible chassis numbers since September last year, he believes that, without these tax incentives, 100 per cent fitment of immobilisers would be mean too large an increase in car retail prices in a recession. The Whitehall view is that the complexities of implementing such tax incentives - and the fact that they would have to be initiated not by the Home Office, but by the Treasury which has other priorities - make this an unlikely event during Car Crime Prevention Year. However, BMW has responded to the Home Office's initiative by announcing a Pounds 1m car security programme, to run from February 24 to March 20 this year. While there is still no commitment on fitting immobilisers, the scheme includes a free car security audit at a BMW Dealer, a BMW approved anti-theft system fitted for half the normal retail price and enhancements to the deadlocking system on eight older BMW 5 and 7 Series models. Fleet operators, though, have already been given a financial incentive to be security-conscious by the Association of British Insurers, which has regrouped car insurance ratings, to make higher-performance cars, and others more likely to fall prey to criminals, more expensive to insure. Consequently, fleet operators are facing large rises in premiums on these cars, and some may decide not to issue them to their staff. Since a significant proportion of sales of these cars are to companies, this may produce a noticeable reduction in the number on the roads. If so, it could be a partial solution to the problem.</p>

Our colleague  Nambaje tells us more:    [Nambaje] The decision was prompted by the low level of  safety following the killing of Martin Bucyana, who came from  Cyimbogo, when some people started looting and burning the homes  of Tutsis. Over the past three days, a man and a woman were  killed and more than 20 houses were burned down. Some people  are homeless, and others have fled. Last night, 50 people,  mainly children, slept at Cyangugu Parish. Currently there are  70 people at the teachers' college in Mururu who fled their  homes in fear. Today, Cyangugu Prefect Emmanuel Bagambiki met  the inhabitants of (Tete) and (Mutongo) to consider ways of  restoring peace in the two sectors, and throughout the entire  Cyimbogo commune. In other sectors, such as (Muruhongo) and  (Karenzo), the atmosphere is tense. [passage omitted].</p>

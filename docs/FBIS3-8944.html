			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 12 (CTK) -- The HZDS Presidium  discussed the urgent political situation in Slovakia after the  passage of a no-confidence vote in Premier Meciar and his  government in Parliament on Friday. The meeting was attended by  cabinet ministers and HZDS parliamentary deputies.    Meciar said that the HZDS expressed dissatisfaction with the  activity of Slovak President Michal Kovac which harmed the  reputation of the Slovak Government and the Slovak Republic.  The movement also expressed concern about the internal  political situation in Slovakia and the situation among citizens  as the situation is not stabilizing but, on the contrary,  fragmentation of the political scene is taking place.    Meciar said that on Monday the whole cabinet will resign  along with him. At the same time ministers in Meciar's cabinet  rejected the offer by President Kovac to hold their functions  until a new government is appointed because the president had  insulted them in his speech when he accused them of corruption.  "He should bear the responsibility and consequences by himself,"  Meciar said, referring to Kovac.    It is highly improbable that Parliament would agree on early  elections because the opposition does not want them, Meciar  said. He said that a fight for who would be the premier in a new  government was currently going on and there were also problems  with its personnel filling. "Peter Weiss, chairman of the  Democratic Left Party (SDL), believes that he will be the  premier but he did not notice that behind his back a coalition  between Milan Knazko (former Slovak foreign minister and HZDS  deputy chairman), Ludovit Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak  National Party (SNS), and Jan Carnogursky (chairman of the  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), is being formed which have  more votes that the SDL has, Meciar said.    Referring to the SDL Meciar said that the HZDS Presidium  considered the SDL leadership not trustworthy and specifically  Weiss and Milan Ftacnik who had breached all agreements. Meciar  voiced doubt that the confidence between the HZDS and SDL could  ever be restored. He said he had delayed his speech in  Parliament on agreement with the SDL because before the vote on  confidence in the government a vote on the early election date  could have taken place.    During today's meeting Meciar proposed that he leave the  post  of the HZDS chairman given his defeat in Parliament. However  the Presidium, in a secret ballot, unanimously confirmed him in  the office.</p>

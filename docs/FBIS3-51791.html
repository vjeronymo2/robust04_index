			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto from the "Good Morning From Mexico" </F> newscast]    [Text] This weekend, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, admitted he perceives signs  of exhaustion in his dialogue strategy with the rebel group,  which have brought the peace process to a standstill. This  problem, Camacho said, is reflected in three worrisome issues,  whose adequate solution depends on continued confidence in the  strategy and in renewed progress.    The first issue, he said, involves serious concerns about  the  proceedings implemented through the Amnesty Law for the purpose  of making it increasingly restrictive. Camacho went on to  explain that this is the key issue among many difficult factors  in the conflict, and if it is not resolved it may lead to the  loss of a great opportunity for amnesty and the return of the  EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation] nonmilitant members  to their communities in a reprisal-free climate.    The second issue is a question: What is the agenda and,  especially, how can national issues be resolved and the  Republic's institutions strengthened without upsetting the legal  order? Concerning this issue, Camacho Solis pointed out that  amnesty contains guarantees for the state and society and,  therefore, the cessation of hostilities is a condition for its  concession. The requirements for the implementation of amnesty,  however, must be imaginatively and actively fulfilled.    Regarding their agendas, which the fulfillment of the  consolidation of the peace process depends on, Camacho said the  regional agenda will, by and large, redefine the relationship  between the Chiapas communities and the institutions. Changes  must be made, even in public priorities, to devote more  attention to the Indian regions. Meanwhile, the national agenda  cannot associate the possibility of change within the country  with the dynamics of an armed movement if there is to be a  democratic government.    The third issue, Camacho stressed, is that demands have been  made of him to explain the connection between his activities and  politics. In this regard, he pointed out it is essential to  achieve a political solution to this conflict to ensure a  favorable climate for 1994. Everyone, he insisted, must execute  the policies entrusted to him. Camacho said he will be  completely devoted to this task as long as he can be useful.</p>

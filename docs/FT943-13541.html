			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Strong second quarter at WMI Waste Management International, the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the US, reported strong second-quarter turnover and profit increases underpinned by volume growth and acquisitions. Pre-tax profit for the three months to June 30 increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 37.1m) on revenues ahead 22 per cent to Pounds 286.9m (Pounds 234.9m). The quarterly results lifted pre-tax profit for the first half to Pounds 82.2m (Pounds 71.5m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Pounds 542.9m (Pounds 455.7m). Mr Nigel Wilson, finance director, said volume growth accounted for 14 percentage points of turnover growth in the second quarter, price increases generated 2 percentage points of the increase and acquisitions added 8 percentage points, while currency movements reduced growth by 2 percentage points. Operating profits in the second quarter increased by 20 per cent from Pounds 39m to Pounds 46.7m and from Pounds 73.3m to Pounds 88.6m for the first half. Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the group had made 'good progress' during the second quarter with sustained growth in both revenue and profits. 'These results have been achieved through a balance of new projects, acquisitions, productivity gains and cost reductions,' he said. 'While pricing has remained weak, we have experienced volume growth in some markets. In Europe, our business performance has been mixed, in part reflecting the slow and uneven economic recovery in the region.' During the quarter the group spent Pounds 13m on 16 small acquisitions including purchases in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Earnings per share increased by 9 per cent to 7.3p (6.7p) for the quarter and by 7 per cent to 13.6p (12.7p) for the half year, with higher minority interests partly offset by a reduced tax rate.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor V. Chernyak, doctor of economic </F> sciences: "What To Save: the Hair or the Head?"    [Text] Inflation rates declined considerably over the  past several months in Ukraine from 80-100 percent at the end of  last year to 12.6 percent in February, 5.7 percent in March, and  6 percent in April of this year. How should that be viewed? In  several ways, I believe. On the one hand that is a sign of  economic stabilization, primarily of the monetary system. On the  other hand the slowing down of inflation is accompanied by a  sharp drop in production (this drop amounted to 39.1 percent in  four months of this year as compared with the same period last  year). In essence that spells destruction of the economy.    In economics not only the result is significant but also the  method by which it was obtained. A decrease in the rates of  inflation was obtained by strictly monetary methods: by the  conduct of a rigid monetary and credit policy, as well as a  policy of wage freezing. Over the past four months wages  remained at the same level. In February the average wage of  workers in the state sector amounted to 760,100 karbovantsy,  which is 40 percent below the minimum consumer budget. The  freezing of wages and their irregular payment resulted in  diminished demand becoming a factor in lower production, while  poor credit availability aggravated the nonpayment crisis.  Inflation cannot be slowed down by halting production. That  would be saving the hair but losing the head.    At present the main issue is not curbing inflation but  animating production. Our principal problem is not the problem  of inflation, but that of production, and now also that of  marketing because of the depressed demand. It is necessary to  bear in mind not only the growth rate of prices, but also their  level (compared to wages).    The government anti-inflationary policy of the past two  years  was directed at restraining wages and controlling enterprise  consumption funds, that is, at the suppression of effective  demand. V. Lanovyy and especially V. Pynzenyk were responsible  for its formulation. Such a policy does not suit our realities  since in our case we have mostly an inflation of costs and not  an inflation in demand. Suppression of demand conditions a  further decline in production and it is specifically the decline  in production and a shortage of goods today that constitute the  main reason for inflation, along with, of course, monopolism and  the lack of a competitive environment.    Therefore the development of production on the basis of  privatization, demonopolization, restructuring, promotion of  entrepreneurship, and stabilization of the financial system must  become the basis of the anti-inflationary policy. It is clearly  necessary to introduce indexation of wages and all income while  eliminating control over enterprise consumption funds.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A rationing plan aimed at a 25% reduction in water use by more than 200,000  customers of the San Jose Water Co. was approved by the state Public Utilities  Commission. Effective immediately, residential customers will be allocated 75%  of the amount of water they used in 1987. Industrial customers are to get 90%  of their 1987 amounts. Initially, the need for water savings was estimated at  45%, but last month's rainfall eased the problem. The San Jose Water Co. serves  San Jose, Los Gatos, Saratoga, Monte Sereno and parts of Cupertino as well as  unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County.  </P></p>

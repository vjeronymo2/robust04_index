			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian companies close well to verify size of Cuban find Canadian companies exploring for oil in Cuba have closed a well that recently yielded light crude, to allow them to verify the size of the oil field in Cardenas Bay to the east of Havana, the capital. The deposit, which has a low sulphur content, is of a higher quality than oil that has so far been found in Cuba, according to officials of Cubapetroleo (Cupet), the state oil company. It was found by Sherrit and Talisman Energy of Canada, which are among several foreign firms prospecting in Cuba. The well was sunk to 3,240 metres and the oil was found at 2,500 feet. Production is estimated at 3,750 barrels a day. The discovery will be encouraging to Cuba's struggling domestic oil industry, which has been unable to produce enough to meet a shortfall in imports and end the island's crippling energy shortage. Imports last year of 5.7m tonnes of crude were about half of the island's needs. Domestic production is expected to rise from 1993's 1.15m tonnes to 1.3m tonnes this year. But Cupet officials are hoping for more significant growth over the next few years if some of the foreign companies exploring onshore and offshore find commercially exploitable deposits. The Cubans are keenly awaiting the results of seismic studies of a concession being explored by Taurus of Sweden, which they say has indicated the presence of oil and gas. The government says about Dollars 50m is being invested in oil production this year by Cupet and foreign companies, following investments totalling Dollars 20m last year. Following the granting of a six-year contract in 1991 to Total and Compagnie Europeanee des Petroles of France to search for oil in Cuba, several other foreign companies have been searching for oil in Cuba. Canadian and European companies were invited in February 1993 to bid for concessions to explore for oil onshore and offshore of the island, covering 11 blocks. Seven blocks are onshore, three offshore and one covering offshore and onshore; they range in area between 1,400 sq km and 6,000 sq km. The contracts run for 25 years and are based on production sharing between the foreign and local companies. The foreign companies are expected to provide all the capital and the technology. The likely prospectors include Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil, which is expected to take over an exploration agreement between Cupet and Braspetro, Brazil's state-owned company.</p>

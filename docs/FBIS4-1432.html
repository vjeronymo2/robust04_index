			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by State President F. W. de Klerk in </F> Pretoria -- live]    [Text] [De Klerk] Ladies and gentlemen, having visited a  number of polling stations and having been fully informed about  the electoral process this morning, I can say that one is glad  to be able to say that at the biggest percentage of all polling  stations things are going well.    However, logistical problems are experienced at quite a  number of.... [pauses] I would like to call upon, first, all my  followers, but also all South Africans to please be patient and  to assure that they bring out their vote. The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] -- I've just spoken to Judge Kriegler  -- they're doing their level best to solve the logistical  problems. They have all sorts of contingency plans in order.  The government is rendering full assistance with regard to all  the requests that we've received from them. Planes will be made  available, helicopters, to deliver polling papers wherever  there's a shortage.    What is necessary is that we now stick to it, and that we  exercise patience. We have received requests to declare  tomorrow also a public holiday. I am sympathetically looking at  that request, but we are at the moment talking to organized  business in order to also get their views with regard to the  implications. If that can help to solve the problem, we will  sympathetically consider it, and an announcement may be made  later this afternoon.    The National Party will render its full assistance to the  IEC  in trying to solve the logistical problems, and the IEC need, I  think, the support of all the parties. They are in charge of  the election, but without the support of the parties and the  public they also have a very difficult task. So let us help,  let us be helpful, let us cooperate, and let us make use...    Can I lastly say that, to the best of my knowledge, extended  hours is being considered for tonight and, if need be, tomorrow  evening until very late, so that each and every South African  willing to bring out a vote can do so.    [Unidentified official] Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if  you want to ask your questions, can you just wait for the loud  speaker. First question?    [Unidentified correspondent] [Words indistinct] the security  forces involved at the moment in a clamp down on certain party  elements in the wake of the recent bombing attacks?    [De Klerk] Good progress is being made, and the moment they  fell that announcements with regard to the progress won't  negatively affect the rest of their investigations, they will do  so. But I can say positively that progress has been made and is  continuing at the moment.    [Correspondent] Does that mean...[pauses] Has there been  some  sort of a clamp down [words in distinct] reportedly have been a  number of arrests.    [De Klerk] We're not talking...[pauses] It depends on how  you  define a clamp down. We are bringing the perpetrators of the  last series of bomb attacks to book, and we are having success  in doing so. It is not a blind clamp down in any sense of the  word that people are being arrested just because they are right.  People are being arrested because they are suspects with regard  to specific crimes.    [Correspondent] We're hearing reports about people being  told  that they can't vote because someone in another area can't vote,  and polling stations being closed, and people being turned away,  hour after hour, because ballot papers aren't there. Do you  think that there is a growing perception among many voters that  this is becoming not a free election, not a fair election?    [De Klerk] It is true that in a number of instances, for  reasons that the IEC can explain to you -- we are not in charge  of this election, it is being run by an independent agency --  that polling papers were not available at a number of polling  stations, that therefore there was a problem with the  distribution.    It is for those reasons that steps are being considered such  as lengthening the hours of voting today and tomorrow, such as  flying in withdrawing ballot papers from certain ballot  stations, flying it in, delivering it to the places where  shortages have occurred or where it was delivered late. The IEC  chairman assured me that they are getting on top of the problem  with regard to the polling stations where they have problems,  and I therefore don't think that it will affect the freeness and  fairness of the election. What is required is patience and  understanding by the voters negatively affected.    [Correspondent] If the far-right feels they are not being  properly represented, as indicated by the bomb blasts, what can  a government of national unity do to prevent a situation similar  to Northern Ireland in the future in this country?    [De Klerk] Well, first, I think your premise that the  far-right can in any way rightfully claim that they not being  accommodated is a wrong premise, because the Freedom Front [FF]  is participating, and all the feed-back that I'm getting is that  in droves, even in areas which used to be totally CP  [Conservative Party]-dominated, in droves, people who voted for  the CP in the last election who voted no in the referendum, are  coming to the polls and they're voting either for us or for the  FF.    Therefore those who are not now participating is really a  small minority of the far-right, which in itself is a minority  among the whites, and they're not representative of a large  group of people. Second, if we have to deal in future with  elements such as the IRA -- I'm told the IRA is really  controlled by 300 people; I don't know whether it is true or  not, but somebody told me that on a visit to England, that it is  really a handful of people -- then we will have to act very  firmly against them. It would be terrorism, and we would have  to take every possible step to assure that they don't  destabilize the country against the will of 99 percent of all  South Africans.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] After a string of  political pardons, could we be assured that if the bombers are  caught they wouldn't be running free in a matter of a few months  or a year or two, for political expediency?    [De Klerk] Could you just repeat that please?    [Correspondent] I said, after a spate of political pardons,  and people being released for sabotage, can we be assured that  if these bombers are caught they will not be released in a  matter of months or a year or two for political expediency?    [De Klerk] Well, in terms of the agreed-upon constitution,  no  cut-off date with regard to indemnity and releases for political  crimes can go beyond December 1993. It would therefore require  an amendment of the constitution with a two-thirds majority of  Parliament, before that cut-off date can be shifted.    [Official] Thank you. The gentleman over there, and after  that, Conrad Burke.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, reports [words indistinct]  there were ballot papers in Botswana, for instance, where the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] sticker was not there [words  indistinct] If people did use the ballot papers without the IFP  stickers, would those ballot papers not be regarded as spoiled  papers?    [De Klerk] That question must be directed at the IEC. If you  want an opinion from me, I would venture to say that they should  be regarded as spoiled ballot papers. It has also been decided  by the IEC when the decision was taken that the IFP would be  accommodated by way of a sticker; that if that sticker is placed  onto the paper in such a way that it obscures or intrudes on the  space of any other party, that would also be regarded as a  spoiled ballot paper. So on the basis of that, I would say yes.  The IEC, of course, has wide jurisdiction, and one of the  solutions which could be looked at, where the stickers are not  available timeously, would be as has been done overseas, to  allow voter to write the name, IFP, onto a ballot paper and in  that way to indicate that he or she would like to vote for the  IFP. But this is a matter in the hands of the IEC. I can only  offer an opinion.    [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Mr. de Klerk, you've been to a  range of polling stations. Is it your impression that the  voters have been suitably educated, that they know what's going?    [De Klerk] Yes. Wherever I went, I inquired of the persons  in charge of the polling stations whether they had any  particular problems, and their reports to me indicated that  things were going smoothly, and that they did not experience any  particular difficulties. They were forced to make some  difficult decisions: people unqualified to vote coming and  insisting they would like to vote -- that sort of thing  occurred. But with regard to the problem of illiteracy and so  on, I get the overall impression that the people in charge are  being very helpful and that they assist such people. It is  having an effect, and other factors too, on the tempo of voting,  and Judge Kriegler said it is going slower than they expected.    [Burke] Just to follow up. Have you had any contacts with  Mr. Mandela?    [De Klerk] Yes. I've spoken to him twice in the past hour  telephonically on this issue, on the request which is supported  by his party with regard to the declaration of tomorrow as a  public holiday, and I will, when I take a decision, also  communicate with him again.    [Correspondent] Could you comment on your feelings when the  flag changed last night? Did you have some feelings at one time  at least about the old flag? Can you comment on that?    [De Klerk] Well, the old flag will always have a special  place in my heart, but I'm part of the school which rather likes  the new flag, and I don't have any problem with it.</p>

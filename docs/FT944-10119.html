			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Clinton looks to foreign policy continuity Even if President Bill Clinton had not wanted to stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against Bosnia, this week's sweeping Republican victory in congressional elections would have made it much more difficult to avoid the decision. Congress voted in August for an ultimatum: if the UN had not agreed to lift the embargo multilaterally, US participation in its enforcement must end by November 15. Mr Clinton's decision will comply with Congress's demand three days ahead of its deadline. But the White House is well aware an alternative and much tougher resolution was sponsored by Senator Robert Dole, who will take over as leader of the new Senate majority when the next Congress takes office in January. Administration officials insist there will be continuity in foreign policy, despite the change of power in Congress. Indeed, some of Mr Clinton's advisers hope that foreign policy will be one field he can till on his own, since his freedom in domestic policy will be sharply curtailed by a Republican Congress. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, attending the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta, spelt out seven policy objectives on which he said he was confident of broad bipartisan support, though he conceded there could be 'tactical' differences with the Republican-controlled Congress on implementation. Mr Christopher said the US policy would remain unchanged on: Economic security and open international trade A comprehensive Middle East peace agreement Nuclear non-proliferation Support for Nato and European integration Ukraine and other independent states of the former Soviet Union Commitment to a continuing US role as a Pacific power New opportunities to deal with 'global' issues, notably terrorism, drugs and organised crime. A State Department spokesman said Mr Christopher had decided to spell out these points clearly after being questioned closely about future US policy by other Apec foreign ministers over dinner on Thursday. There is plenty of room for conflict between the administration and Congress. Although the Republicans have over the last 15 years mostly argued for a free presidential hand in foreign policy, that changed noticeably when they lost the White House in 1992. Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, expected to become chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, is a moderate on foreign policy issues, most interested in Israel, human rights and drug trafficking. Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois is more conservative, and could play a larger role in shaping Republican policy, if he does not take over the chairmanship of the judiciary committee; but he, too, could be described as an internationalist. But moderate is the last word anyone would choose to describe Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who will take over as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Helms has already promised to work to cut the tiny US foreign aid budget and US contributions to the UN - on which it is already wildly in arrears. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, number two Republican on the foreign affairs committee, may play an important role in moderating Mr Helms. He has formed a strong alliance with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a conservative Democrat who seems likely to retain at least some of the influence he has held in Congress as chairman of the armed services committee. One other weapon of which Mr Helms has made full use in opposition, and which he may be expected to wield freely as chairman, is the Senate's power to confirm ambassadors and other top officials. He has already delayed the appointment of Mr Robert Pastor as ambassador to Panama, and that nomination now seems likely to die. Mr Clinton, who campaigned against Mr Bush as the 'anywhere but America' president, has spent more days outside the US in his first two years in office than his predecessor. Over the next two years, he may spend even more time abroad, if he finds presidents and prime ministers more congenial than Senator Dole or Senator Helms.</p>

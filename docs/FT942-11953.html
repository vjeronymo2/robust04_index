			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Sweden pays price for sins of the past - International A modest rally in Swedish bonds last week suggested the market might finally be coming back into favour for the first time in months. On many counts a correction is overdue given the mauling which has taken Swedish 10-year bonds to a spread of more than 200 basis points over German bonds, from just 90 points three months ago. Yet there are plenty of reasons for believing the market will find it hard to break decisively out of its current range. These include general turbulence in international financial markets, worries about Sweden's burgeoning state debt, and the prospect of a tough re-election battle for the centre-right government this September. Mr Andrew Davies, bond analyst at the London Bond Broking Co, though a buyer, says the attractions of Swedish market are relative. 'We are buyers of Swedish bonds because yields are now only 45 to 55 basis points below those of Italy and Spain,' he states. In one sense Sweden's bond market drop is surprising, given that inflation has fallen to only 1.8 per cent in spite of a 20 per cent drop in the value of the Swedish krona over the last 18 months. Government projections suggest inflation will be held to 1.9 per cent for the year as a whole, before climbing to 2.8 per cent next year. What has happened is that foreign investors, who last year were big buyers of Swedish bonds, have this year been big sellers - and they have been selling into a relatively narrow domestic market. The rationale for the buying was that Sweden's economic problems were so severe that it would be forced to bring down interest rates very sharply. In fact, the central bank has pursued a much more cautious monetary policy than many pundits expected. This meant that when turbulence hit international bond markets in February, many of Sweden's foreign bondholders headed for the door. Although very much in thrall to what happens in Germany, Swedish bond yields have risen much more than German. Here it seems the country is paying a price for the sins of its past. It is a point acknowledged by Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister, who said last week: 'The market has a long memory of our very large devaluation in 1982 and a long memory of our poor inflation performance during the 1980s.' The country's track record explains why the Riksbank, the central bank, has made inflation its top priority in the months since Sweden floated the krona in November 1992. It also explains why the country resorted to its first issue of index-linked bonds two weeks ago. Effectively, the Riksbank has ruled out further cuts in its key marginal rate - currently 7.25 per cent - until either the krona strengthens or there is evidence of fiscal tightening. Fiscal tightening, though, is not on the cards in the short-term, as the supplementary budget presented by Mrs Wibble last week made clear. The markets were not surprised by the absence of tough measures, both because of the election and because the government has lost the guarantee of support from New Democracy, the populist party on which it relied for its majority. The savings promised by the government for the second half of the decade - a total of SKr100bn in the six years to 1999 - are not something which can be guaranteed, especially with opinion polls indicating that it will be the opposition Social Democrats who triumph at the election. Although it would be natural to think that the Social Democrats might seek to lower unemployment by expanding the public sector, the markets are taking a different view. They seem to believe that Sweden will tighten fiscally, whoever comes to power in September, otherwise bond yields would almost certainly be higher than they are, given the size of the country's budget deficit in relation to GNP. The budget did contain some encouraging news, particularly evidence that the budget deficit and borrowing requirements are falling by more than was expected. The budget deficit for the year beginning July 1 is estimated at SKr150bn, or 9.7 per cent of GNP, while the borrowing requirement is put at SKr195bn. In the current fiscal year, the deficit is predicted to be SKr198bn and the borrowing requirement SKr240bn. Optimists about the Swedish bond market say the cyclical component of the budget deficit is much greater than the structural one, which means the deficit will fall relatively quickly as the economy recovers. Heartened by recent inflation projections, the optimists expect the currency to strengthen, as the economy improves, allowing further interest rate cuts. Pessimists remain to be convinced on the inflation score. They also doubt that Sweden can achieve the 3 per cent a year growth it needs between 1996 and 1999 to meet its target of stabilising public debt at 45 per cent of GNP. The play-off between the two factions almost certainly guarantees continued volatility in trading over the next few weeks. The crucial elements in the equation will be developments in the German market and the position adopted by foreign traders.</p>

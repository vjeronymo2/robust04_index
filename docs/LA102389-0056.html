			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> KEDG-FM, which won a court battle to refer to itself as K-LITE, has received  approval from the Federal Communications Commission to change its call letters  to KLIT-FM. The station will continue to play the current mix of adult  contemporary "soft hits" with no changes in personnel, music or frequency  (101.9). KLIT program director Lawrence Tanter explained the moved by saying,  "The call-letter change is reflective of our slogan K-LITE and will certainly  assist the editors at the ratings services in giving us accurate credit." The  station, owned by Golden West Broadcasters, has suffered from fairly low  ratings. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

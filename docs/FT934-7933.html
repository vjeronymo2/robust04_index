			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Bolivian workers agree to end strike BOLIVIA'S government and unions have defused a conflict over the firing of state workers and agreed to resume talks on how to sort out the country's problems, officials said, Reuters reports from La Paz. The agreement came after eight weeks of growing labour unrest which peaked in a national strike on Monday. The deal was signed on Tuesday just hours after Bolivia's trades union federation, the COB, voted to suspend their indefinite strike which began at midnight on Sunday. The new centrist government, which had said it would not negotiate while the strike was on, agreed in return to reinstate 1,100 out of 10,000 workers sacked as part of plans to modernise the economy.</p>

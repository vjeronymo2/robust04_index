			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Clinton lays out Gore's agenda SENATOR Albert Gore will lead a future Democratic administration's efforts to break the logjam in Washington by enacting a legislative programme within 100 days of taking office as vice-president, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas said yesterday. Mr Clinton said that if he was elected president, Mr Gore, whom he chose this week to be his vice-presidential running mate, would take the lead in passing laws designed to restore US competitiveness, contain health care costs and improve national education standards. 'I don't want Al Gore to be the kind of vice-president that sits in the US Senate waiting to vote to break a tie. I want him to break the logjam in Washington,' said Mr Clinton, who is due to be anointed as the Democratic presidential candidate at next week's party convention in New York. Under the US constitution, vice-presidents preside over the Senate, but they do not vote unless the 100 senators are evenly divided. Mr Clinton acknowledged that the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, shared part of the blame for the Washington logjam. 'There are people in our party who have contributed to the paralysis out there, but I don't think you can lay that at Al Gore's feet,' he said. Mr Clinton's supporters are hoping that the selection of Mr Gore to be the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate will boost their campaign on the eve of the convention, which itself can usually be relied on to provide a further lift. Mr Clinton and the Democrats should have the limelight to themselves next week, as President George Bush is going fishing, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire who is expected to run as an independent candidate, seems likely to adopt a similarly low profile. Although some recent opinion polls show Mr Clinton recovering from his shaky start this spring, three polls released this week still placed him third. Mr Bush led in two and Mr Perot in the third. The results of all three polls, however, were so close as to suggest a statistical dead heat. In addition, the opinions of those questioned were only weakly held, so these polling results provide virtually no guide to what might happen in the November 3 election.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Howard may still be on probation over law and order: How the Lords have given the home secretary a rough ride over his criminal justice proposals The Lords gave a third reading last night to the criminal justice bill, the troubled centrepiece of Mr Michael Howard's campaign against crime. But it is not clear whether the home secretary is finally free of their lordships, or merely on probation. Mr Howard had no such doubts in October when he won a standing ovation at the Conservative party conference for a rousing speech promising to 'take the handcuffs off the police and put them back on the criminals where they belong'. To roars of approval from the party faithful he unveiled 27 law-and-order initiatives, including new prisons, tougher anti-terrorist powers, action against 'jury-nobbling', and an end to repeat cautioning of offenders by the police. Separately Mr Howard proposed a thorough shake-up of the criminal-justice system involving a big increase in the home secretary's influence over police authorities and the introduction of contracts for justices' clerks, who advise magistrates. The trouble began with the police and magistrates' courts bill, which embodied the changes to police authorities and justices' clerks. Harried by a bevy of former Conservative ministers, including Lord Whitelaw, Mr Howard was forced to back down on both issues. There was even more trouble when debate began on the criminal justice bill. In the Commons Mr Howard was forced to promise action against violent videos to head off a widely supported amendment by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP. In the Lords there have been five main changes at the hands of Conservative peers: Plans to weaken the so-called right to silence by allowing judges to call defendants to the witness box were watered down after criticism from Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice. Lord Ackner, a former law lord, pushed through an amendment blocking plans to reform the compensation system for criminal injuries. Lord Stanley of Alderley, a Conservative backbencher, led a cross-party coalition which forced a five-year delay in government plans to abolish local authorities' duties to provide campsites for gypsies. Lord Carr, a former Conservative home secretary, persuaded peers to water down plans for secure centres for offenders aged between 12 and 14. Lord Brightman, a former law lord, successfully urged the Lords to defy the government and create an offence of selling or offering to sell information about personal financial affairs. There have been other unwanted amendments too. For example last week Earl Ferrers, a home office minister, had to accept a Labour amendment creating a new offence of male rape with a maximum life sentence. Friends of Mr Howard point out that most of his 27-point law-and-order plan has emerged from the legislative process unscathed. They also say that Mr Howard will seek to reverse some of the changes when the bill returns to the Commons. But the bill must then return to the Lords, where peers may insist on reinserting the changes. In any event, the bill's rough passage through the Lords has wrecked Mr Howard's timetable for implementation. The bill should have been on the statute book by next month but will not now complete its Commons stages until MPs return from their summer break in October. Mr Howard's apologists argue that other bills have suffered at their lordships' hands in this session - notably the education bill, which was savaged by peers on all sides of the house. Nevertheless, Mr Howard's difficulty in winning approval for his much-trumpeted law-and-order programme has removed much of the gloss from his parliamentary reputation and stoked speculation that he may be moved or even dropped from the cabinet in Mr John Major's impending reshuffle. Mr Howard promised his party conference audience that his 27-point plan was 'just a first instalment' in a sustained campaign on law and order. His thinking then was that a second criminal justice bill would be introduced next year. Not surprisingly officials say this now looks unlikely.</p>

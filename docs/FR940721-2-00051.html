The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. HCFA is proposing to revise the CMCR and IMCR by adding a new routine use for release of intermediary and carrier maintained beneficiary data to servicing Medicare banks and/or provider banks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this new routine use is to allow fiscal intermediaries (FIs) and carriers to send claims payment and beneficiary information to providers or their banks either directly, or through a Value Added Network (VAN) telecommunications service and for provider banks to use this information to perform account management activities on behalf of providers. Under this scenario, the electronic funds transfer (EFT) and the electronic remittance advice (ERA) flow together through the banking system. The consolidation of Medicare beneficiary and payment information will reduce paperwork and administrative costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA filed an altered system report with the Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on July 18, 1994.

The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IMCR and CMCR systems of records were last published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 55 FR 37549; September 12, 1990. Currently, there are 23 routine uses in the IMCR system and 25 in the CMCR system that permit disclosure of information to individuals and/or organizations for a variety of reasons, the majority of which relate to the timely and accurate processing of Medicare claims, payment safeguards activities, and research. There are safeguards in place, as described in the safeguard section of both systems, to protect the data which have been developed in accordance with part 6 of the HHS Information Resource Management Manual and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Information Process Standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

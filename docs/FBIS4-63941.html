			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- A general meeting of the  Tallinn branch of Pro Patria yesterday decided to put forward  parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis' name as new party chairman in  preference over Prime Minister Mart Laar.    Most party members who spoke at the meeting criticized Laar  and stated their support for Nugis.    The speakers voiced apprehension that, if Pro Patria  continues under Laar's leadership, the party may not attain the  5-percent threshold vote at the next parliamentary elections.    Nugis, too, was critical about the premier's performance and  advised him to resign.    Pro Patria convenes in Tallinn June 11 to discuss election  of  new party chairman and the situation in the government and the  ruling coalition.    The party council ruled on Monday [23 May] that election of  new chairman doesn't automatically imply replacement of premier.  Laar, on the other hand, asserted on Friday that he regards Pro  Patria congress decisions as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria  elects a new chairman I'll resign," he said.</p>

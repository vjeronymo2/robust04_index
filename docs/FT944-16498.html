			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / NHS hospitals 'selling land to fund repairs' More than a third of National Health Service trust hospitals expect to sell land or other assets to fund developments and repair programmes worth Pounds 1.27bn over the next two years, a survey published today shows. The findings underline the importance being attached by developers and construction companies to the government's private-sector finance initiative, which expects a growing proportion of the country's infrastructure to be funded from private sources. The recent revival in residential and commercial property values has led to an increase in land sales and deals being offered by hospitals seeking funds to improve health facilities. The study of the construction and property requirements of 178 trust hospitals by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows that 34 per cent expect to use asset sales as their main source of funds for future developments. Another 23 per cent expect to use finance raised from banks, leasing arrangements or some other private-sector source to support investments. Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital Trust recently announced plans to give away land and buildings on its prestigious Chelsea site to private bidders willing to develop and run hospital services. The successful bidder will be given the opportunity to redevelop a redundant clinical building and nurses' home. Construction groups submitting bids include George Wimpey, Tarmac and Sir Robert McAlpine. Barratt, Britain's third-largest housebuilder, and Watford-based Country Metropolitan Homes have announced a joint Pounds 100m development plan at Highlands Hospital at Enfield, north London, which is transferring to the nearby Chase Farm hospital. Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the institution, said: 'Growing pressure on trusts to self-finance building and maintenance works means that they are having to develop new funding methods. Our research shows that this is increasingly likely to be obtained through internally generated sources, such as sale of assets, rather than borrowing from banks or cost-cutting exercises.' Some 86 per cent of trust hospitals expect to carry out some form of new building work over the next two years with nearly two-thirds of trusts planning to spend more than Pounds 500,000, emphasising 'the pent up demand for repair and maintenance work in the health sector'.</p>

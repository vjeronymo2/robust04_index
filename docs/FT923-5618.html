			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Property: Buyers flock to Dublin's fair city DUBLIN'S run-down, tatty days - when property was cheap, goods dear, and fashionable people shopped in London - are over. High street names are commonplace now, lining main streets and cobbled alleys; shops are spruced-up and paintwork fresh. Residential trends are changing, too. 'In the past 12 months, there has been a marked shift in demand,' said Ken MacDonald of estate agent Hook &amp; MacDonald. 'Young, first-time buyers and investors are buying in the city centre, for convenience.' He cited New Row Square off Patrick Street: this entire modern development of 96 one- and two-bed flats sold within three days of its February launch. Other developments are taking place along the quays either side of the River Liffey, south around Dublin Castle and the cathedral, and north around Mount Joy Square - about 400 acres in all. Recognising the strong demand for residential housing in the city centre - and anxious to clean up and refurbish the remaining shabby inner-city neighbourhoods, as well as generating new construction - the government has introduced an urban renewal programme with favourable tax breaks for those buying properties there. Nowhere are these breaks more favourable than in Temple Bar, a small pocket of narrow, cobbled alleyways and fringe theatres, pubs, clubs and muralled walls tucked away between the the city's financial headquarters on Dame Street and the river. Traditionally, it was a centre for craftsmen such as printers, publishers, clock-makers, bookbinders and cutlers. But mass production in the 1950s killed the crafts. The national bus company, CIE, then chose Temple Bar as the ideal site for its central terminus. But its plans floundered and, in the 1980s, it leased the properties at low rates to traders. Theatres and galleries were established along with bistros, pubs and shops. Temple Bar's tax breaks work in two ways. They favour the refurbishment of existing buildings over the construction of new ones - and they are generous to a fault. For example, until April 5 1996, those who buy properties are entitled to a 100 per cent write-off against tax on the refurbishment costs. Live in the property and, subject to certain conditions, you can get an additional 100 per cent write-off on the developer's cost of acquiring the building (net of site value) or its market value on January 1 1991 (again, net of site value), whichever is the lower. New buildings are eligible for a 50 per cent write-off on capital investment. The government aim is to create a cultural and recreational quarter, rather like London's Covent Garden, in which people can live as well as play. Temple Bar's first residential project, the Royal Exchange, was launched at the end of June. Once a hotel, built in 1766, the completed exchange will have 15 one and two bed flats over shops. Priced between IPounds 56,000 and IPounds 75,000, all were sold off-plan in the first weekend of the launch. Similarly, 5-6 Temple Lane South, a new block of fairly compact residential units over commercial, sold as soon as word was out. But there are more on stream, one a joint venture between Temple Bar Properties (the government company set up to develop the area) and Temple Bar veteran Patrick Oman. Oman, who runs an international removal company, was active in Temple Bar when there was dereliction all around and the bus terminal threat remained. He developed his warehouses in Crown Alley into shops selling Doc Martens and recycled clothes plus a boutique, a music store and a rock music venue known as the Rock Garden. Crown Alley became the main street in Temple Bar. Now, Oman is developing a Victorian block facing Dame Street next to the Central Bank. Foggy Block, he calls it, after the Foggy Dew pub (which he describes as 'a cheap, scruffy pub serving the best pint of Guinness in Dublin'). The pub will stay but there will be a couple of licensed restaurants, a dance gym and 40 flats priced between IPounds 55,000 and IPounds 85,000. Since they will qualify for the maximum tax concessions, all are likely to have been sold by the spring. Further details from Hook MacDonald, 52 Merrion Square, Dublin 2; Temple Bar Properties, 20 East Essex Street, Dublin 2; and the Irish Mortgage Corporation, 46 St Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.</p>

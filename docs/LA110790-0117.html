			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> TORTURED LEGACY OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS;  </P> <P> IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOLOCAUST; THE SECOND GENERATION BY AARON HASS CORNELL  UNIVERSITY PRESS $19.95, 178 PAGES  </P> <P> "He who has been tortured," Jean Amery observed, "remains tortured."  </P> <P> The epigraph, which appears at the outset of "In the Shadow of the Holocaust,"  is an eloquent summing up of the fate of the men and women who, by accident or  miracle or act of heroism, managed to survive Auschwitz or Babi Yar or the  Warsaw Ghetto. But what is the fate of the children of survivors, the young men  and women who call themselves the "Second Generation?"  </P> <P> What we learn in Aaron Hass' "In the Shadow of the Holocaust" is that the  survivors of the Holocaust were so deeply scarred by their ordeal that their  own children, too, remain tortured -- in more than a metaphorical sense.  </P> <P> Hass, a psychology professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills and a clinical staff  member of the UCLA department of psychiatry, styles "In the Shadow of the  Holocaust" as a psychological study of survivors and their children. But his  most important credentials, I think, are more intimate: Hass is a child of  survivors, a speaker of Yiddish, and an heir to the awful legacy of the  Holocaust.  </P> <P> "Events that occurred 50 years ago, before my birth, follow me," Hass writes.  "Growing up meant being constrained, often paralyzed, by hearing, 'How could  you do this to me after all I have suffered?' " When asked where he was from by  someone from the old country, the American-born Hass would respond that he was  from his parents' hometown.  </P> <P> Hass the psychologist devotes much attention to the technical demands of  designing a sound psychological study and reaching defensible conclusions about  his subjects. But it is Hass the storyteller who penetrates the real mysteries  of the tortured body and soul and allows us to understand the strange and  terrible burdens the second generation has been forced to bear from earliest  childhood.  </P> <P> "For survivors, their children were symbols of birth and restoration," he  observes. "These parents may have harbored unconscious magical expections that  their offspring would undo the destruction of the Holocaust and replace lost  family members, provide meaning for their empty life, and vindicate their  suffering."  </P> <P> Hass allows us to see that the horror of the Holocaust was transmitted to the  second generation in strange and sometimes contradictory ways. Many children of  survivors were overprotected by parents who knew that the world was a  demonstrably cruel and dangerous place; the bogymen of their childhoods wore SS  uniforms, too.  </P> <P> At the same time, parents sometimes nurtured children with a strange fury: "I  remember having eggs rammed down my throat and vomiting them up, and then  having more shoved down again," one woman recalls. Another remembers: "My  brother once dropped a basket of eggs, and my father started chasing him with  an ax."  </P> <P> As a result, Hass suggests, the legacy of the Holocaust for the children of  survivors is two-edged: guilt and anger co-exist in their hearts. "The  experience of being a child of survivors," Hass writes, "is reflected by three  words uttered by almost every such person with whom I came into contact: fear,  mistrust, cynicism."  </P> <P> At times, the most articulate and moving witness is Hass himself, at least when  he discards the white coat of the social scientist and bares his own soul in  confessional prose that is anguished but somehow lyrical. "The idea of God is  not a comfort to me," he confesses, "but a taunt." And he invites us to ponder  the impact on a 9-year-old boy of hearing a father recount his wartime exploits  as a partisan in a darkened apartment on the solemn fast-day of Yom Kippur:  </P> <P> "We found out that a German officer would be at the farmhouse of a Pole who had  betrayed Jews to him," his father would recite in Yiddish every year. "We tied  them up and cut a small hole in each one's arm. For hours we put salt in the  open wound. Then we shot both of them."  </P> <P> I was still reading "In the Shadow of the Holocaust" when The Times published  an obituary of David McCalden, a benighted man who dedicated himself to arguing  that the Holocaust never happened. It occurred to me that McCalden may be dead  and gone, but the lies that he told are still being repeated. And I was  reminded of the real burden of the Second Generation -- a burden that Hass  himself does not overlook.  </P> <P> "Most children of survivors were admonished 'to remember,' " he writes. "But  what must the second generation not forget? Six million is not an impressive  number. It is abstract and it numbs rather than sensitizes. One person's story  has the potential for illumination."  </P> <P> Next: Nancy Mairs reviews "In Silence: Growing Up Hearing in a Deaf World" by  Ruth Sidransky (St. Martin's Press).  </P> <P> </P></p>

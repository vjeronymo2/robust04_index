			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev today reiterated that there is still the  possibility of a political solution to the Bosnian crises  despite the tension building in that former Yugoslav Republic.    In an interview with reporters after his talks with visiting  Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, Kozyrev called on  the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations to  work out a joint plan with Russia for ending the bloodshed in  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    "While NATO is elaborating a military plan, we want to make  a  peace plan together with them," he added.    Without such a peace plan, "I think it would be a defeat of  the international community," he said.    The Russian foreign minister also said, "We cannot agree  with  the actions of those Bosnian Serbs who put civilian facilities  under artillery fire."    "It is quite evident that these people have taken the path  that runs counter to the Serb interests -- Serbia as a single  whole and Bosnian Serbs. Russia cannot describe this path other  than barbarity and crime. How can one trust these people?"  Kozyrev added.    He believes, however, that there is still hope for a  political solution. "There are other Serbs, including in  Bosnia, whom I call the 'party of reason'. There is President  Milosevic in Belgrade, with whom I spoke several hours in a row  on the eve of April 17. His stand is very reasonable."    Asked about Russia's plan on relations with NATO, the  Russian  minister said Moscow is working on a package of proposals which  can serve as the basis for cooperation with NATO.    This package is more serious than the one offered to Moscow  by NATO, he said, without elaboration.</p>

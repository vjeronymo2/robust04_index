Conversation With Political Weekly's Chief  Editor"]    [Text] We have already reported that the political weekly  GLASNOST has begun publishing once again after a gap of several  months. At the request of readers, I met with Chief Editor  Yuriy Izyumov and asked him a number of questions.    [Kozhemyako] Yuriy Petrovich, not everyone is aware of what  happened to your newspaper. Why were readers deprived of it for  so long?    [Izyumov] GLASNOST, along with PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA,  and other opposition publications, was banned by order of the  Russian Ministry of the Press and Information on that fateful 4  October last year. Moreover, that same day people burst into  the editorial office armed with sections of steel pipe and other  equipment. The place was ransacked. Then, on the instructions  of the presidential administration, the journalists were robbed  of the building that we had legally occupied since the day the  newspaper was founded. I filed charges with the People's Court  in Moscow's Sverdlovskiy Rayon protesting flagrant tyranny.    The case has finally has been examined. The court found the  Ministry of Press and Information order banning the weekly  unlawful and overturned it. The newspaper is with us again!    [Kozhemyako] How do you define your present stance in the  multifaceted world of newspapers? What guides you in shaping  your course?    [Izyumov] We are still a communist newspaper. We have close  links with the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU and will, as far  as we are able, promote the restoration of the CPSU as a unified  Communist Party and the USSR as a unified state. We are  convinced that the USSR cannot be restored without the  restoration of a unified Communist Party. The sooner all  communists join forces, the faster such vital tasks for all the  peoples as the cessation of fratricidal wars and the restoration  of Soviet power will be accomplished.    [Kozhemyako] How do you see the weekly taking shape as a  unionwide newspaper?    [Izyumov] No borders and customs houses can prevent us from  writing about the life of working people and pressing problems  throughout the territory of the Soviet Union. We are trying and  will continue trying to provide articles from every republic in  each edition and tell the truth about what is going on there.  It is important to help people grasp the political hurly-burly  around them. To this end we will talk about the nature of  various parties, political associations, major firms, and banks.  Whereas others paint some as angels and others as devils, we  plan to publish objective portraits of the best-known figures  from all the republics.    [Kozhemyako] What can you say about your political  opponents' attitude to the weekly?    [Izyumov] Our motto is only to tell the truth about  everything, whether anyone likes it or not. To our great regret  virtually no one likes the truth. That is why we have so many  enemies among our political opponents. Regrettably, we are  experiencing some animosity from some of our comrades in arms.  Their long CPSU membership has not taught them to respond  correctly to criticism.    [Kozhemyako] What difficulties is the editorial office  experiencing?    [Izyumov] There are certainly many difficulties. We are  glad that despite all the ordeals, the material hardship, and  the severe repressive pressure the editorial collective has  survived and even grown stronger -- as a collective of  like-minded people working not so much for their pay as for a  noble idea. But our money problems are extremely acute. In  addition, subscription has been wrecked and the distribution  system disrupted. During the four-month ban the editorial  office lost all its financial income and its bank account was  seized. That is why GLASNOST asks communists and all the  newspaper's friends to:    -- collect donations to enable us to continue publishing the  newspaper;    -- organize circulation of GLASNOST via party  organizations;    -- promptly convey urgent information to the editorial  office.    Our mailing address is: GLASNOST Editorial Office, 14 New  Square, Moscow 103132. Telephone: 231-47-18.</p>

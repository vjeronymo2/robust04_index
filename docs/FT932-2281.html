			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Peace, but not at any price: Unprecedented demand for United Nations forces has overstretched the world body's resources Events of the past week, in the tragedies of Bosnia and Somalia, cannot fail to raise questions over the credibility of the peacekeeping capability of the United Nations. In the past few years, after the end of the cold war, the scale and the ambitions of UN peacekeeping efforts have rapidly expanded. Some people dared to hope the organisation might at last be coming into its own as the ultimate guarantor of the international system. But these expectations, enormously puffed up by the spectacular eviction of Iraq from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War, now look decidedly overdone and premature. The danger now, at the end of a week in which UN aircraft have smashed Mogadishu and Lord Owen has conceded that his Bosnia peace plan is dead, is that the United Nations itself will be seriously discredited. Part of the problem is the speed with which the United Nations' peacekeeping ambitions have expanded. In the past four years, it has launched 14 peacekeeping operations, more than the total number set up in the previous 40 years. It is not just the number but the scale of these operations which has increased, especially in the past two years. In the four years 1987-91 the numbers of soldiers involved averaged 10,000-15,000, but last year the total rose to 48,000, plus another 15,000 police and civilians. It is now considerably higher. The most immediate consequence has been an exponential increase in costs. In the first half of the 1980s, peacekeeping operations cost on average a little over Dollars 200m a year; in 1988-91 the figure was Dollars 400m; last year it was Dollars 1.4bn, and the total for the current two-year period 1992-93 is scheduled at Dollars 3.6bn. Part of the explanation is that some of the old UN peacekeeping operations, launched decades ago, are still under way; they may still be performing a modestly useful function, but they have not yet brought peace, and they have not yet been wound up. This is particularly true of the Middle East, which has been the object of six different peacekeeping missions, half of which are still functioning after many years. In 1948, the UN sent a mission to supervise the truce after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and it's still there. In 1949, another mission was sent to observe the ceasefire in the conflict over Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan, and it, too, is still functioning. But the real reason for the cost escalation is that, in the liberated era of self-confidence after the cold war, the most recent UN peacekeeping operations are both much larger and more ambitious than most of those in the previous 20 years. Traditional operations, during most of the post-war period, were deliberately low-key and non-confrontational. Typically, their purpose was not to compel the end of a conflict. Rather their intention was to help stabilise the wind-down of a conflict which was already being brought to an end by the combatants - for example by monitoring a ceasefire. The mandate for the 1973 Emergency Force mission, for monitoring the ceasefire after the Arab-Iraeli war, is the classic definition of this kind of role: the force must have the full consent and co-operation of all the parties on the ground; it would only have weapons of a defensive character; it would not use force except in self-defence; and it would operate on the assumption that the parties to the conflict would comply with the decisions of the UN Security Council. This kind of low profile was not what the founding fathers of the UN had in mind. The terms of its charter envisaged an altogether more muscular approach. Under article 43, the Security Council would be empowered to take virtually any measures to deal with a threat to the peace, including the use of military force. All member governments would undertake to make armed forces available to the council as required, and the council would be advised by a Military Staff Committee made up of the chiefs of staff of the permanent members of the council. These ambitious plans were effectively neutralised by the cold war, though not before the UN had made two spectacular and large-scale forays into the peacekeeping business. The first was the Korean war of 1950, when it authorised the mustering of an international coalition to repel the invasion of South Korea by North Korea; but it was able to do so only because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time. Much more traumatic was the Congo operation of 1960, triggered by the secession of Katanga and the deployment of Belgian troops to protect Belgian nationals. This was voted by west and east for opposite motives: the Americans supported the expedition because they feared the Soviet sympathies of the new Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba; the Russians supported the expedition because they suspected a western plot to recover control of Katanga's copper resources. The expedition was a constant source of east-west friction, which reached peaks of intensity with the murder of Lumumba and the death in an air crash of Dag Hammarskjold, the UN secretary-general. After the confrontational trauma of the Congo operation, the UN kept its head well below the parapet for the next 20 years. All peacekeeping activities from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s were confined to small-scale and consensual operations. Considering its modest ambitions, the 1973 Arab-Israeli ceasefire mission was quite a substantial peacekeeping operation, which mustered between 4,000 and 7,000 men and cost Dollars 446m over six years. More normal was the Arab-Israeli truce mission of 1948, which is still functioning, and which consists of fewer than 300 men and cost only Dollars 25m last year. The turning point in UN peacekeeping came with the accession to power of President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in 1985. His co-operative posture permitted the organisation to take a higher profile. But the subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union confronted the UN with a series of unprecedented challenges to its peacekeeping role. The classic problems in the 1960s and 1970s were conflicts between sovereign states. Today's classic problem, by contrast, is the internal disintegration of states, inter-ethnic conflict and civil war - such as in Yugoslavia, for example, Cambodia and Angola. This shift goes some way towards explaining why recent UN peacekeeping operations are so large by historic standards. Monitoring a ceasefire already agreed by two sovereign states is inherently much easier, and militarily much less dangerous, than trying to sort out a civil war. The UN force in Cambodia runs to 20,000 people, at a cost of Dollars 637m in 1992, while the force in the former Yugoslavia totals more than 23,000 men, and that in Somalia 28,000. By the same token, however, the difficulty of the challenge partly explains, but only partly, the very mixed results achieved so far. The Namibian operation in 1989-90 was a spectacular success in supervising the transition from a war of independence, through elections, to independence itself. But the Angolan operation has so far been a lamentable failure: elections have taken place, but the civil war goes on. In Cambodia, elections have been held, and now everyone is holding his breath in the hope that a new coalition hangs together. The most difficult cases of all so far are provided by Somalia and what remains of Yugoslavia, and it is here that UN credibility is really at stake. In Somalia, it is difficult to discern whether the UN has a strategy, or whether we are seeing a sequence of different tactics. Unless some constructive strategy comes into view, it will be difficult to reconcile air strikes with any normal concept of peacekeeping. In the former Yugoslavia, the UN had a strategy of providing humanitarian aid, combined with economic sanctions against the warring parties. Now it has an additional strategy of providing 'safe havens' for the Moslems. But neither has been backed by enough force to be implemented adequately, and neither is preventing the military carve-up of Bosnia. The evidence so far suggests that the UN is not yet really suited to dealing with civil war and ethnic conflict. Almost by definition, the organisation has to operate on the basis of a large measure of international consensus. Intervention in civil war raises difficult questions: about the circumstances in which the international community may have the right to interfere in a sovereign state; and about the practical feasibility of bringing a conflict to a stable and peaceful conclusion. The further the UN ventures down the road of intervention and compulsion, the more essential, and the more difficult, it becomes to devise a plausible political strategy and to secure the necessary consensus. As a result, we see the UN Security Council adopt contradictory policies: it votes for safe havens in Bosnia, while knowing that it does not intend to supply the necessary troops to protect them. UN official calculations are that somewhere between 7,500 and 34,000 troops would be needed to protect them. But so far member states have not volunteered even the smaller number; and even the higher number would be too few in the absence of co-operation from the warring parties. So far there has been no such co-operation. This lack of commitment by the member states also shows up in the peacekeeping budget. At the latest count, member states were Dollars 1.47bn in arrears for all peacekeeping operations, of which Dollars 549m was owed by the US and Dollars 91m by Russia. Eighteen months ago, when the UN was buoyed up by its new-found confidence, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general, called on member states to implement the charter and activate Article 43, by making available stand-by forces for the Security Council. His appeal fell on deaf ears: the world community is not yet ready for such a step. The final word has not yet been heard on the UN's peacekeeping role, nor even on its role in Bosnia and Somalia. But the evidence so far is that western governments are unwilling to venture far down the road of heavy military intervention, and are anxious to ensure, by pre-emptive monitoring and negotiation, that these two test cases are not repeated elsewhere.</p>

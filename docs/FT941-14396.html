			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Globex eyes a Dublin challenge - The CBoT may join the Irish exchange When Globex, the troubled global electronic futures exchange, attempts to relaunch itself later this year, it could face competition from an unlikely source: a new exchange development in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre. So far, only Finex, the relatively small New York-based exchange, has taken space in the Dublin Exchange Facility, which is due to open on April 15. But the Chicago Board of Trade is one of a number of exchanges actively considering the Dublin option, and the Philadelphia Board of Trade and Simex in Singapore are also involved in discussions. The facility is 'available for American and Asian exchanges to service European customers,' said Mr Paul Cronin of Ireland's Industrial Development Authority, which has backed the project. The CBoT would be a notable catch for Dublin. The exchange is widely expected to drop out of Globex, when the contract between the system's three backers, Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBoT, is redrawn in April. Globex is a high-tech, electronic trading network which allows traders in other time zones to deal in futures outside normal exchange hours. But volume has been disappointing, prompting speculation that the concept of 24-hour electronic trading is flawed. The Dublin idea takes a different stab at the same problem of out-of-hours trading. But unlike Globex, the Dublin facility will simply replicate existing open-outcry trading arrangements, allowing pit trading in the European time-zone with low overheads. 'We have a contractual agreement for Globex with Reuters, but, come April, it is unlikely that we will meet the (contract) requirement, and Reuters has the option to pull the plug,' explains Mr Fred Grede, vice-president of administration at the CBoT. 'The board is aware of that and has been thinking about other options.' He added that the Dublin development is 'definitely an option - we believe, quite candidly, that open outcry has been a superior trading system. The concept is very appealing - the one issue in everyone's mind is the infrastructure in Dublin.' The CBoT is also considering linkages with other exchanges, but discussions with Liffe in London were abandoned, and talks with the Matif in Paris and the DTB, the German futures market, were preliminary. Even with the greater array of products provided by the CBoT, there is no guarantee that a critical mass of trading could be achieved in Dublin. The question of whether traders really need to trade outside their own time zones, given the global reach of most securities houses, applies to the Dublin project as well as to Globex. But the Irish Industrial Development Authority has created a favourable environment with a 10 per cent tax rate for exchanges and member firms - so the venture promises to be a relatively cheap one for participants. Trading permits for Finex Europe, the Dublin branch of Finex, are to cost only Dollars 10,000, and cheques have already started arriving - including one from Mr William O'Connor, the former chairman of the CBoT. Finex decided to expand into Europe two years ago, according to Mr Sean McNamara, an independent trader at CIG Asset Management and a member of the Finex board. 'We approached Globex to join the system and they told us we were not invited,' he recounts. The exchange then decided that a physical move to Europe would be a better option. Dublin 'is a platform for us to access the European marketplace,' says Mr McNamara. 'We are not trying to build a Liffe or a CME; if we can do 2,000 contracts a day, 50-100 people will be making a nice living and we will have a platform from which to grow.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218) and trainee Wu Hongxiao </F> (0702 4767 1420)]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Feb (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Municipal  Government has found a new way to tackle difficult problems in  its work, that is, by conducting in-depth investigations and  study to promote work. It is understood that of the 468  investigation and study projects launched by the municipality  last year, 352, or 75.2 percent, had been completed by the end  of the year. Of these, more than 90 percent have been used in  actual work.    Leaders of Beijing Municipality took the lead in undertaking  investigations and study. Last year, Chen Xitong, secretary of  the Beijing municipal party committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan  conducted investigations and study on more than 30 occasions in  various districts, counties, universities, colleges,  institutions, factories, mines, shops, and remote villages in  rural areas. They familiarized themselves with local situations;  handled official business on the spot; asked questions directly;  and examined, amended, approved, and passed on investigation  reports. Motivated by the leaders, all leading cadres in  various departments, districts, and counties took the initiative  to undertake projects and participated in investigations and  study. Most departments used the investigation and study  results as the criterion for evaluating cadres' performance of  their duties. Some units even established a cadres'  investigations and study responsibility system for inspecting  and supervising cadres' work on a regular basis.    A key factor of Beijing's fruitful results in conducting  investigation and study lies in the combination of leaders with  the rank and file and professionals with the masses. Relevant  departments under the municipal committee worked concertedly  with counties and districts in carrying out key municipal  investigations and study projects. While conducting  investigations and study for their long-term development plans,  Xicheng, Dongcheng, Congwen, and Haidian Districts invited  experts and scholars from scientific research institutes and  universities to tackle key problems together. In this way, they  complemented each other with their knowledge and improved the  quality of investigation and study results.    Beijing Municipality also persistently geared investigations  and study to serve policymaking and trouble-shooting purposes.  In choosing investigation and study topics, the municipality  emphasized the pertinence and timeliness of projects. As a  result, most projects were related to improving work to a higher  level or solving difficult and hot issues. While applying  investigation and study results, the emphasis was put on  investigating and solving problems at the same time. The  municipal foreign economic and trade department, in view of  declining foreign trade and exports in the first quarter last  year, promptly organized investigations and put forward and  implemented immediately six countermeasures, thus stopping the  decline in exports and increasing exports by 12.3 percent last  year, the highest in history. The municipal urban construction  department, based on citizens' reports on problems existing in  transportation and the city appearance, conducted investigations  and study and put forward 10 suggestions for comprehensive  improvement. Implementation of these suggestions has brought  about initial successes. Haidian District conducted  investigations and study focused on ways to scale new heights in  the new technology and industrial development and experiment  zone, and summed up questions in the fields of capital,  qualified personnel, and development space, thereby helping the  municipal government formulate relevant policies.</p>

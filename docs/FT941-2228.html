			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Lucas rises to Pounds 20m despite fall in sales Lucas Industries, the UK motor and aerospace components group, said that cost reductions were continuing to rebuild profitability, but warned that its markets remained weak. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive, said: 'With aerospace and defence spending remaining much depressed, it is too early to be optimistic about any early overall recovery in Lucas markets.' Lucas's pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 20.1m in the six months to January 31. Sales fell from Pounds 1.29bn to Pounds 1.19bn. Sir Anthony said the cost-cutting momentum established last year had increased. Substantial further progress increased profits by Pounds 29m. These savings, together with increased sales volumes, more than offset the adverse effects of stock reduction on output, the lower recovery of engineering costs from customers and currency translation of foreign earnings. Restructuring programmes continued, with costs of Pounds 9.8m charged to the Pounds 88.4m provision established in 1991-92 and another Pounds 4.9m against first-half profits. A net 1,000 jobs were lost. Sales had again outperformed general industry trends. Sir Anthony said: 'Automotive demand in the UK and US is recovering and we sense that the bottom has been reached in the continental European automotive market.' Lucas said net borrowings at the half-year were cut from Pounds 479m to Pounds 360m, gearing of 48 per cent. The reduction was helped by disposals, last year's enhanced scrip dividend, a sale and leaseback of six US sites and a better working capital performance. Automotive operating profit increased from Pounds 13m to Pounds 27m. Strong sales, up from Pounds 792m to Pounds 830m, reflected continuing success in the diesel sector. Aerospace profits increased from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 8.9m, although sales declined from Pounds 323m to Pounds 252m because of softer defence markets and reduced production by airframe manufacturers. Sales by applied technology businesses declined from Pounds 172m to Pounds 107m, due to disposals. Demand remained soft, with particular deterioration in Japan and Germany. Operating profits fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 800,000. Earnings per share were 2.2p, against a loss of 0.2p, and the interim dividend was held at 2.1p. Lex, Page 20</p>

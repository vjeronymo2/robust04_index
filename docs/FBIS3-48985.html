			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on New Year's message extended by King Mihai to </F> Romanian nation on 30 December -- place not given]    [Text] Romania's former sovereign, Mihai I, sent a message  to the country on the occasion of the New Year.    After recalling the events four years ago when our people  began to free themselves from the dictatorship and communism, as  well as the difficult work, so that the hope that was born from  the blood shed in December 1989 may materialize, and after  emphasizing that, due to the support by friends abroad, Romania  was admitted to the big European family and that each Romanian  citizen will thus be able to appeal to the Council of Europe  every time the institutions in Romania violate the regulations  regarding human rights, that the United States has granted us  most-favored-nation status -- the advantageous customs regime  granted to friendly countries -- former King Mihai expresses his  gladness that, through his public interventions and personal  contacts, he was able to contribute to the recognition of the  place due to Romania within the community of nations.    The message then emphasizes, quote: Despite these efforts  made everywhere in order to support you in your struggle for  dignity, freedom, and prosperity, our country continues to  flounder in complete misery, unquote. Noting that everywhere  there is goodwill, creative energy, considerable riches and  capabilities, former King Mihai expresses the desire that all  these things be freed and united to serve the country for the  benefit of all. He stresses that unity cannot be achieved  without national reconciliation.    From the bottom of my heart, through my prayers, and through  my wishes, which I extend to you today, the message continues, I  want to express the desire and will to be among you and with  you. Let us contribute to conciliation and unity, and let us  help all Romanians within the country and outside it.    With belief and confidence in the future, the message ends  with the following wishes: May Romania be reborn for the  benefit of all Romanians. So may the Lord help us.</p>

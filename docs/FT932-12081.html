			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Radical plan for Lloyd's to attract fresh capital: Shake-up aims to cut costs and offers glimmer of hope to Names LLOYD'S of London yesterday unveiled a radical plan to restructure the insurance market, reduce costs and attract corporate capital for the first time. Lloyd's also confirmed that its losses for the 1990 year, which will be reported in June, will amount to between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn, a record deficit. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said: 'In a competitive world we have performed very poorly.' The market's first 'business plan' offered a glimmer of hope for lossmaking Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting - but no specific proposals to end legal actions between Names and their agents. Introducing a report highly critical of Lloyd's in the past, Mr Rowland said: 'It contains measures which overturn some of our traditions but those are traditions that no longer serve us well . . . Should membership and market not unite behind this plan, then Lloyd's may have no future.' The report calls for a 30 per cent cut in costs at the market over the next two years, which will require the loss of 2,500 of the market's 12,000 jobs by 1995. The proposals were widely welcomed by market professionals and received more muted support from Names' organisations. 'The plan is not a solution to the very serious problems at Lloyd's. But it is a well thought out strategy. There is much work to be done . . . Time will be needed,' said Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents 9,000 Lloyd's Names. Mr Shaw is chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, the sweeteners group. The proposals detail an ambitious and complex plan to isolate billions of pounds in old asbestosis, pollution and other US liability claims from policies written before 1985 which overhang the market. 'Ring fencing' past liabilities through a new reinsurance company is designed to make the market more attractive for corporate capital, which will be invited to participate in underwriting next year. 'New capital is expressing serious interest in joining us,' Mr Rowland said. The report says the market should aim to achieve a return on capital of 27 per cent for corporate capital and of 40 per cent for individual Names. The plan will also usher in radical changes in management style. 'We're bringing into Lloyd's simple practices of good management that have been absent for too long,' said Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive. New standards for competence and professionalism are to be introduced. A moratorium on legal action against lossmaking Names unable to meet their obligations, announced late last year, will be lifted at the end of this month. But Lloyd's will not issue new writs on a blanket basis and will take a commercial approach to its debtors, negotiating individual deals in some cases. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names' Association Working Party, which links groups of lossmaking Names, said: 'The plan is a welcome step into turning Lloyd's into a well-regulated and managed business. We welcome the admission that Lloyd's present problems are of its making.' Mr Rowland said Lloyd's was prepared to contribute a 'modest' amount to achieve a settlement and said negotiations would continue. Mr Gil Strathalmond, chairman of RW Sturge members' agency, said: 'This is a very pragmatic approach to the reality of the problems.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  reported progress in restarted talks on telecommunications trade  Saturday but said they avoided the two thorniest issues.    "Considerable movement was made in narrowing differences in  qualitative criteria," the U.S. side said in a statement.    But both sides said they avoided discussing quantitative  criteria, which earlier led to wrangling over "numerical  targets" for market share in other sectors and scuttled  bilateral trade "framework" talks in February.    Negotiators also skirted the sticking point of whether  Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) should be covered by the  talks on government procurement of telecom and medical  equipment, Japanese and U.S. officials said.    Both sides agreed to continue working-level talks in  midmonth, probably in Washington. "Things are moving, so that's  good," a U.S. Official said.    The Japanese side explained promises it made in a March  market- opening package to make its procurement practices  clearer and fairer.    A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said the U.S. side  seemed to "evaluate quite highly" the explanation, while the  U.S. statement said the "plan addressed a number of key issues."    "But we indicated some major areas where the plan fell short  of eliminating our concerns," the U.S. said. The U.S.  official said he could not comment further.    The Japanese official described the talks as  "forward-looking  and constructive," giving the impression that "things are moving  in a better direction." The U.S. said they were "cordial and  conducted in a positive atmosphere."    The talks will proceed, the Japanese official said, on the  basis of Japan's market-opening package, which includes widening  the scope of products subject to agreement, making  specifications fairer and simpler, making information available  on government tenders, improving the review of bidding  complaints and instituting comprehensive bid evaluations.    Washington vowed last month in an agreement restarting the  talks that it is not seeking targets, and the U.S. made no  proposals that contradicted that assurance in the Tokyo talks,  the Japanese official said.    On NTT, Tokyo insists the telecom giant is a private company  that cannot be held to government procurement promises, while  the U.S. says the Japanese Government's two-thirds ownership of  publicly traded NTT makes it a government entity.</p>

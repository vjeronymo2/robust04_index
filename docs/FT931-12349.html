			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / German bank chief squashes fast-track Emu idea THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday squashed an idea, promoted by French and German leaders, that a select group of European Community countries could establish monetary union ahead of schedule. Mr Helmut Schlesinger also warned that monetary stability had to be restored in Germany before there could be any further progress towards Emu. The Maastricht treaty 'states clearly that Emu can only start, in 1997, if a majority of the member states meet the required entry criteria', he said in a speech in Brussels. 'I am sticking to the text . . . The next time is 1999. I have no intention of shortening the period,' he told a press conference later. Mr Schlesinger said he had been 'surprised about some public speculation envisaging the start of a far more narrowly defined Emu, for instance, without the Benelux countries'. While he did not name the source of the speculation, he was apparently responding in part to recent statements from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand. They agreed in a television interview that it could be possible to accelerate progress towards union. Recent French media reports have suggested the possibility of a Franco-German monetary pact. Mr Schlesinger underlined his opposition to his chancellor's ambitions with a sharp reminder of the economic difficulties to be overcome in united Germany. The country suffered from huge regional income differentials and structural problems unequalled anywhere else in the Community. Such difficulties had affected inflation rates, but stability had to be regained. It was in the interests of all EC member states that the country with the anchor currency - the D-Mark - should be able to return to full stability. This was 'a prerequisite for any move forwards on the road towards Emu'. In the run-up to the establishment of a European central bank, national central banks had to retain responsibility for monetary policy. 'This also means that a country cannot be pressured to relax its monetary policy at a stage when its fight against inflation has not yet been successful,' he insisted. Mr Schlesinger, who said he expected 4.4 per cent average inflation in western Germany this month, made plain that the rate of price increases had to slacken before interest rates could be reduced. However, he stressed, monetary policy was not dictated by dogma. 'In cases where growth prospects have deteriorated and unemployment has increased, the Bundesbank has never kept interest rates high longer than necessary if there were signs of inflationary pressures easing,' he added. Germany had slipped from near the top of the European prosperity scale to the middle. Despite a high rate of price increases in January, Mr Schlesinger said he hoped west German inflation would fall this year to little more than 3 per cent. Currencies, Page 25</p>

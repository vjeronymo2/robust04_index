			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: H&amp;C sells Malaysian quote HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield, the agribusiness, chemicals and plantations group, will gain more than Pounds 5m by selling the quotation of its Malaysian rubber business. In a complex deal announced yesterday, Harrisons is selling its 51 per cent stake in Linatex for MDollars 5.25 per share, or about Pounds 14.7m, to Phileo Assets of Malaysia. The sale will be subject to Linatex, which produces rubber for industrial use, selling all its assets and business to Harrisons for Pounds 10.2m. Other conditions include regulatory and minority shareholder approval. Under Malaysian regulations, Harrisons will eventually have to find a local partner to take a minority stake in Linatex. Mr Graham Wickenden, group finance executive, said that in previous cases in Malaysia a minority stake was between 25 and 30 per cent. Based on the price paid by Harrisons, the group will gain a further Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3m on the sale of the minority. Phileo Assets intends to use the Linatex quote to take over Phileo Peregrine Securities, an Ipoh-based stockbroker which is 30 per cent owned by Hong Kong's Peregrine Group. The move comes amid heavy trading in shell companies on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange over the last six months as businesses seek funds for expansion. A recent report from Morgan Grenfell Asia shows that shell companies are trading at a premium of between MDollars 40m and MDollars 50m above net tangible asset value. Mr Wickenden said the Phileo offer was pitched at MDollars 70m above the NTA of Linatex, placing the deal in the top quartile of deals done to date.</p>

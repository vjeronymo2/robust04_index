			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM BOY ARRESTED AFTER HIS SISTER, 12, IS SHOT IN HEAD  </P> <P> A 14-year-old boy who told police that three armed robbers broke into his  family's house and shot his 12-year-old sister in the head was arrested  Thursday on suspicion of attempted murder, authorities said.  </P> <P> The boy allegedly made up the story after shooting his sister with a small  caliber rifle in her upstairs bedroom, Anaheim police said.  </P> <P> The boy was not identified because of his age.  </P> <P> The suspect's sister was taken to the UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange where  she was in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Her parents, James  and Marie Hubler, were at the hospital but declined to discuss the incident.  </P> <P> "During the investigation, it was determined that the boy was alone with his  sister" at the time of the shooting, Police Lt. John Cross said. Minutes before  the girl was shot, the boy apparently had been target shooting in his back  yard, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators declined to say why they believe the boy shot his sister.  </P> <P> Police said they arrived at the family's two-story beige stucco house in the  1900 block of West Bayshore Drive about 12:35 p.m. after receiving a call about  a shooting.  </P> <P> A neighbor said he heard three gunshots.  </P> <P> "There was one shot, and then another about five minutes later, and then one  about 15minutes later," said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Police took the boy to Orange County Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> The shooting was the second time in three weeks that a juvenile was shot in the  head by a teen-ager in Anaheim.  </P> <P> On May 24, Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, was fatally shot with a .38-caliber pistol  by a classmate in Anaheim Hills. The Orange County district attorney is  reviewing the case to determine if manslaughter charges should be filed.  </P></p>

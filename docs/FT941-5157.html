			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Whitewater blues Yesterday's headlines suggesting that the Clinton White House is now seriously embroiled in the Whitewater affair will have caused groans in many foreign ministries. Not that Mr Bill Clinton's administration is universally admired abroad. On the contrary, it has been the subject of much hand-wringing and eye-rolling over the past year. But the main charges against it were inexperience, and lack of sustained attention to foreign policy issues. The former defect is now beginning to be healed, in the nature of things, by the passage of time. The latter may not be wholly curable, but there have lately been signs of improvement. Nothing could be more certain to cause a relapse than for the president to get bogged down in a prolonged scandal. The heartiest wish of all those foreigners who depend on or have to deal with the US must be that the affair could be got quickly out of the way. Alas, that is one thing that will certainly not happen. The special counsel appointed in January, Mr Robert Fiske, has an open-ended brief to look into a broad range of matters concerning the business dealings of Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary when Mr Clinton was governor of Arkansas. His investigations are expected to take about 18 months, which would be a miracle of speed compared to the inquiry into the last big political scandal, the Iran-Contra affair. That was recently completed after seven years. A better hope is that while Mr Fiske is burrowing his way through a mountain of obscure evidence, public attention will move elsewhere and the administration will be able to concentrate on its political agenda. That was certainly what Mr Clinton and his advisers hoped would happen when Mr Fiske was appointed. So far the opposite has occurred, thanks to the clumsiness of some of those advisers, including the president's own legal counsel, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, who resigned on Saturday. He and nine other officials - five from the White House, four from the Treasury - have been subpoenaed by Mr Fiske to explain a series of meetings at which they discussed the scope of a federal regulatory inquiry into Madison Guaranty, the failed savings and loan institution at the heart of the Whitewater affair. Those meetings may have been entirely innocent, but their purpose is not clear. Inevitably suspicions have been aroused of a cover-up, or conspiracy to obstruct the course of justice. No one in Washington has forgotten that it was such a cover-up, rather than the original misdemeanour, that led to the downfall of President Nixon 20 years ago. There is as yet no reason to suppose that this affair will have any such dramatic denouement. But its latest twist only reinforces the Watergate lesson. A president accused of wrongdoing, however trivial or implausible, must not only allow the matter to be independently investigated, but must bend over backwards to avoid any appearance of seeking to influence the outcome.</p>

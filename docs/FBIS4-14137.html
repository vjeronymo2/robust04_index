			<p>BFN     [Text] India has described Islamabad's decision to hold  elections in the northern areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as  a cosmetic exercise intended to perpetuate illegal occupation.  In response to a query by newsmen in New Delhi, the External  Affairs Ministry spokesman said Islamabad has denied democratic  rights and violated the human rights of the people of the  region, which was occupied by it through aggression four decades  ago. The spokesman said the recurring violence including  sectarian strifes speak of the political alienation, economic  deprivation, and backwardness of the people in the region.</p>

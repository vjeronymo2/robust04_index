			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Curb on executive pay awards urged by prime minister: Major calls for boardroom rises to follow lead set by government MR JOHN MAJOR last night urged business leaders to restrain boardroom pay awards as he pledged that a commitment to build up Britain's manufacturing base was now central to the government's revamped economic strategy. In his annual speech to the Lord Mayor's Banquet at Guildhall, the prime minister said that last week's Autumn Statement had demonstrated that a 'commitment to industry is right at the heart of our policies'. But he warned also that government would not allow the gains provided by the pound's devaluation to be frittered away in higher inflation. The government, Mr Major said, had set an example by restricting public sector pay awards to a maximum of 1.5 per cent. While acknowledging that it could not dictate the level of awards in the private sector, he said: 'It would be wrong of me not to use this gathering tonight to say very frankly that costs must be controlled everywhere, not just on the shop floor but in the boardroom too. We have set a lead in the public sector. I hope we will see that mirrored in the private sector.' His speech came as Mr Norman Lamont told MPs last week's special measures to help the economy, combined with recent falls in interest rates and sterling, would be 'good for jobs, employment and growth'. The chancellor, however, also gave a clear hint to the all-party Commons Treasury and civil service committee that the government might have to raise taxes if its borrowing needs did not decline with economic recovery. 'If as the economy recovers, it emerges that we have an underlying deficit, that is something that we will have to address,' he said. Their comments coincided also with a new report from the Confederation of British Industry suggesting that a modest improvement in retail sales petered out last month, as uncertainty about the economy continued to hit consumer confidence. Mr Major used what is traditionally the occasion for a broad-ranging review of the domestic and overseas scene to underline again his determination to push for a speedy agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In what Downing Street confirmed was an implicit sideswipe at the French government, he warned that the deteriorating world economic outlook meant that Europe had to resist a 'dangerously strong' instinct 'to look inwards, put up the shutters and slam the door on the free trade that has brought prosperity to the postwar world'. In an assessment of the domestic economic outlook which reflected the government's determination to 'talk up' the confidence of industry and consumers, Mr Major said that cuts in interest rates since 1990 had saved industry Pounds 10bn. In parallel, sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism had left an exchange rate which was 'fiercely competitive', providing companies with an edge over overseas rivals in domestic and foreign markets. The government had further bolstered those advantages by increasing tax incentives for investment, reducing the tax burden on the motor industry and allowing for much greater private sector participation in infrastructure projects. Stressing the focus on help for manufacturing, he said: 'I do not regard manufacturing industry as a marginal add-on optional extra - it is fundamental to our future prosperity.' Mr Major - who said that he was 'sick and tired' of hearing people 'talk down' Britain's achievements - added it was now up to business to capitalise on the advantages.

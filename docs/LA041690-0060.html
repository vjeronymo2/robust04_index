			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURY DEVELOPING SWEEPING BANK REFORMS;  </P> <P> BANKS: THE RISING COSTS OF THE S&amp;L BAILOUT ADD IMPETUS TO THE MOVEMENT FOR  CHANGE.  </P> <P> Treasury officials, spurred by the enormous cost of the savings and loan  catastrophe, are developing proposals for what could be the most sweeping  changes in banking regulation since the 1930s, government and industry sources  said.  </P> <P> Officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations have sought many of the  changes since the early 1980s, but the effort now has a new urgency because of  the breakdown of the S&amp;L bailout program unveiled by the White House a year  ago. The cost of the bailout has been projected at more than $300 billion over  30 years, and the estimates continue to rise.  </P> <P> Officials want to air the proposals in coming months, but do not plan to  propose formal legislation until after fall elections. Among proposals being  discussed within the administration are a major change in deposit insurance,  the possible elimination of a separate thrift industry, revamping the  jurisdictions of regulators and eliminating the barriers between commercial  banking and the securities business, government and industry sources said.  </P> <P> The Treasury's goal is to further deregulate the financial services industry --  for example, allowing banks to sell insurance and stocks -- and to ensure that  supervision is strengthened to prevent abuses, the officials said. The  officials also are trying to promote and protect the industry as foreign  competition increases.  </P> <P> Such broad legislation likely would touch off intense lobbying by banks and  securities firms seeking to protect special market niches, industry and  administration officials said.  </P> <P> The Treasury, which is leading the effort, asked the Federal Reserve Board, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission to  submit recommendations for how to accomplish these goals, an administration  source said Sunday.  </P> <P> Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has decided to use a congressionally  ordered study on federal deposit insurance reform as a vehicle for the  comprehensive package of financial laws and regulatory revisions,  administration officials said.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L bailout legislation passed last August required the Treasury to  submit such a report to Congress within 18 months. Administration officials  said they cannot revamp deposit insurance without other fundamental  restructuring.  </P> <P> In the past week, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson and other Treasury  officials have discussed the proposals in private with industry officials and  key Capitol Hill lawmakers. Robson, speaking to the Independent Bankers Assn.  of America in Washington on April 2, outlined three of the major legislative  changes that the administration intends to seek, said bankers who attended the  meeting.  </P> <P> According to congressional staff members and industry officials, the  administration proposes to combine the thrift industry's deposit insurance fund  with the fund that guarantees commercial bank deposits, and to abolish the new  Office of Thrift Supervision.  </P> <P> Many S&amp;Ls would be merged with banks, and the thrift industry's role as a  government-backed housing finance industry would end, these sources said.  </P> <P> Treasury officials also are considering a number of ways to change the federal  insurance of consumer deposits, including reducing the maximum deposit insured  from $100,000 to $50,000, limiting customers to one federally insured account  per bank and introducing some combination of government and private insurance  of accounts.  </P></p>

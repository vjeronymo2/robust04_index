			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The rapidly solidified aluminum alloy developed by  Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal), has been  adopted for the construction of the rotor for the Lysholm  compressor (a screw-type compressor) to be installed on Mazda  Motor Corp.'s new automobile model, the (Yunos) 800. This  compressor was originally developed by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Co., Ltd., for the world's first mirror cycle engine  to achieve the dual objectives of high performance and low fuel  cost. Mazda Motor Corp. decided to use the aluminum alloy for  the rotor, the requirements of which included that it be  lightweight, have high heat resistance, and have a low thermal  expansion coefficient.    The rapidly solidified aluminum alloy is produced in the  form  of an ingot from powder obtained by rapidly cooling and  solidifying a molten aluminum alloy. The rapidly solidified  alloy has a denser and more uniform structure than do alloys  made by the traditional melting-casting method. In addition, it  is possible to expand the limits for adding silicon and iron to  the aluminum alloy with the rapid solidification process.  Therefore, the new alloy is expected to become a heat- and  wear-resistant, high-performance material with excellent  machinability.    The new compressor to be used for (Yunos) 800 of Mazda Motor  Corp. has the screw-type rotor, which combines the three-winged  male part and the five-winged female part. In order to provide  the highest possible performance, the compressor has been  designed with extremely narrow clearances between the rotating  male and female rotors and between the compressor casing and the  rotors.    Therefore, the rotor material must be lightweight and highly  heat-resistant, and it must have a low thermal expansion  coefficient. Sumitomo Metal developed the new alloy to meet  these requirements.</p>

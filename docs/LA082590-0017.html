			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MARSHALL GIVES RED SOX PENNANT HOPES A BOOST  </P> <P> Mike Marshall might be exactly what the Boston Red Sox need for the stretch  drive.  </P> <P> In only his third game in the American League, Marshall singled home the  go-ahead run in the ninth inning and the Red Sox beat the Blue Jays, 2-0,  Friday night at Toronto.  </P> <P> The victory, in the second game of the four-game series in the Skydome, gave  the Red Sox a two-game lead over the Blue Jays in the American League East and  assured they will leave Canada in first place. Even if the Blue Jays win the  next two, the Red Sox will hold a percentage-point lead.  </P> <P> Blue Jay left-hander Jimmy Key went seven innings and did not permit a runner  to reach second base. The Red Sox's Dana Kieker (5-6), meanwhile, spent much of  the night working out of jams. But their was no score in the ninth and Duane  Ward (2-7) was in relief for the Blue Jays, throwing a fastball timed at 96  m.p.h.  </P> <P> Wade Boggs singled to left and with one out Mike Greenwell singled to right,  Boggs going to third.  </P> <P> The count went to 0-and-2, but Ward apparently tried to sneak a fastball past  the former Dodger slugger. Marshall lashed it through the drawn-in infield to  score Boggs.  </P> <P> The Red Sox, knowing that Marshall had a back problem, sent three minor  leaguers to the New York Mets for him and immediately started a rehabilitation  program.  </P> <P> Their patience paid off. He homered in his debut Tuesday and his second hit of  this game made him four for 12 in the American League with three runs batted in  in three games.  </P> <P> "I'm just grateful for the chance to play," Marshall said. "One of the reasons  for me to going down to rehabilitation was so that when I did get the chance I  would be ready.  </P> <P> "I feel that I am ready. I'm just glad to help."  </P> <P> The Blue Jays have failed to hit a home run in seven consecutive games, their  longest such slump of the season.  </P> <P> An inability to bunt might have been a bigger failure. Greg Myers opened the  seventh with a double. The Blue Jays have sacrificed only 14 times all season,  worst in the league.  </P> <P> Manny Lee tried to bunt, sent it right back to Kiecker, who threw out Myers at  third. Even though Mookie Wilson singled later in the inning, the Blue Jays  missed their chance to go ahead.  </P> <P> With a lead they probably would have brought their bullpen ace, Tom Henke, in  instead of Ward.  </P> <P> Texas 2, Minnesota 0 -- At Arlington, Tex., the Rangers won the first of the  three games third baseman Steve Buechele will miss on suspension on a two-run  double in the seventh inning by Jeff Kunkel.  </P> <P> Buechele drew a three-game suspension for his part in a melee Aug. 17 with the  Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium.  </P> <P> Buechele charged the mound after being hit by a pitch from Greg Hibbard. A  melee followed.  </P> <P> It was the ninth defeat in a row for the Twins. Kunkel emerged from a  one-for-14 slump with his game-winning double.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 1, New York 0 -- Tim Leary (7-16) found another way to lose at New  York.  </P> <P> He made a wild pitch with Bill Spiers on third in the fifth inning and the  Brewers' shortstop scored the only run.  </P> <P> It was the 11th time this season that the Yankees, who had won six in a row  before losing to the Brewers Thursday night, have been shut out.  </P> <P> The Brewers' Paul Molitor opened the game with a single to extend his hitting  streak to 18 games.  </P> <P> Baltimore 5, Cleveland 4 -- Cal Ripken Jr. celebrated his 30th birthday with a  sacrifice fly in the 11th inning at Baltimore. The Orioles are 11-4 in extra  inning games.  </P> <P> The Orioles' Gregg Olson failed to hold a lead in the ninth. He gave up a home  run by Carlos Baerga that made the score 4-4. It was only the second home run  against Olson and both have cost him saves at Memorial Stadium.  </P> <P> Billy Ripken walked to start the winning rally in the 11th.  </P> <P> Kansas City 4, Seattle 3 -- Willie Wilson tied the score with his second home  run of the season to open the ninth inning at Kansas City and rookie Brian  McRae's infield hit drove in the winning run.  </P> <P> It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Royals.  </P> <P> Seattle relief ace Mike Schooler threw two pitches in the ninth, then left  after his shoulder stiffened.  </P> <P> "It felt like my arm pulled out of its socket," Schooler said. "That's the only  way I can describe the feeling. I knew something was wrong." DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 16 March carries in its  regular 5-minute newscast three further reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Updating the situation in Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "the  chetniks from Donji Vakuf and Kupres have been shelling the town  fiercely since this morning. The army groups from Operative  Group West have been resisting all these attacks, and they even  launched counterattacks on some parts of the front. As of today  it is units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army that are in  control of Mala Suljaga, where they have also seized one T-55  tank. These good fighters of the B-H Army have inflicted heavy  losses on the chetniks in terms of manpower. In retaliation for  this morning's defeats, the chetniks have turned their guns on  the residential parts of Bugojno. The general alarm has already  been sounded several times but the chetnik shells were faster  with the result that one civilian has been killed and six  wounded so far." As for Gornji Vakuf, he says "the cease-fire  between the B-H Army and the HVO is holding surprisingly well."    Enes Ratusic reports from the B-H Army 4th Corps that "there  have been no serious military activities to violate the  cease-fire between the B-H Army and the HVO in the 4th Corps'  theater of operations. However, provocations by some extreme  HVO individuals and groups have not entirely ceased." He says  that "there has been some heavier fire in the northern sector,  particularly in the area of (Bijelimici), where the chetniks  used tanks against the defensive positions of the B-H Army and  civilian targets in the surrounding villages."    In his report from the Zvornik front, Nijaz Banjanovic says  that "the chetnik artillery fell silent yesterday evening, so  last night and this morning have been marked only by the usual  small arms fire directed at the defense lines of the 206th  Chivalrous Brigade."</p>

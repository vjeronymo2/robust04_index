			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 15 February  carry articles discussing the North Korean stance in connection  with its nuclear issue with the 21 February International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting approaching,  which reportedly would lead to referring the issue to the UN  Security Council and then to sanctions on North Korea by the UN  Security Council.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 15 February carries on page  4  a 1,000-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Pak Tu-sik  entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue Heading for the UN Security  Council -- China and Japan Openly Revealing Their Intention of  Seeking Practical Profit." The article refers to the remark  made by Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa at the U.S.-Japanese  summit talks held in Washington on 11 February. He is quoted as  saying: "If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN  Security Council, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations  within the scope that our local laws permit." The article notes  that Japan's attitude in attaching a string to the issue  suggests that Japan is seeking a reward for its cooperation with  the United Nations in dealing with the North Korean nuclear  issue. The article then notes the Chinese position of delaying  the UN Security Council's moves toward resolving the North  Korean nuclear issue and says, "China makes it clear that China  does not want the UN Security Council to take up the issue  directly. China may not want the North Korean nuclear issue to  be referred to the United Nations, which may well create a  crisis near China and expose the Chinese position to the  judgment of the international arena. Meanwhile, it is also true  that China regards the present situation as a golden opportunity  to expand its influence on the Sino-U.S. relations and on the  Korean peninsula."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 2 a  600- word article dispatched by reporter Chong Pyong-chin from  Washington in the "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Facsimile  Dispatched by Ho Chong." The article notes two different pieces  of North Korean reactions reaching the ROK Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu's Washington field camp dealing with the North Korean  nuclear issue around noon on 13 February [EST], one being the  North Korean NODONG SINMUN and Central Broadcast's bellicose  warning "We will regard any sanctions and pressure on Korea as  an act of war provocation," and the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman's negotiation-seeking comment "The U.S.  Government should make clear its correct position toward the  third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." The article notes that Ho  Chong, North Korean representative to the United Nations, sent  facsimile of the latter, namely, the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman's comment, to the news agencies and even to  the residences of correspondents from around the world in  Washington. The article notes that North Korea did not show  such a kindness for the former, namely, the NODONG SINMUN and  the Central Broadcast's warning. The article concludes, "We may  be able to discern the North Korean `nuclear strategy' from the  behavior of the North Korean UN mission distributing door to  door the `proposal aimed at negotiation,' instead of the  `warning,' with the deadline for the UN Security Council  decision on sanctions approaching only several days away, timing  it with the ROK foreign minister's visit to the United States."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a  1,300-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Chong  Pyong-chin entitled "What Is the True Intent of the North Korean  Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Comment -- North Korea Tries To Get  Open Confirmation of Its Behind-the-Scenes Agreement With the  United States." The article notes the meaning of the North  Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment issued on 12  February and says: "the ROK and the United States regard it as  the North Korean proposal that the United States confirm the  secretive and intermittent exchange of views between the United  States and North Korea." The article goes on to note the  remarks by an ROK Government official who accompanied Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu on his visit to the United States, who is  quoted as saying: "We think that North Korea openly asked for  the card which the ROK and the United States was going to  present. This seems to be the North Korean intention of leading  the situation positively rather than negatively." The article  then notes, "North Korea is, in fact, asking the United States  to help North Korea establish its justification for its own  people at home, in allowing the IAEA inspection team to visit  North Korea, that the inspection team could come to North Korea  because of its own good will" rather than being forced by the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. The article also  notes that North Korea wants to have the U.S.-North Korean  behind-the-scenes exchange of views notarized so that it can  secure the anticipated fruits if the third round of U.S.-North  Korean talks are held."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a  900- word article by reporter Yu Sung-u entitled "Why Is North  Korea So Indecisive Between Hardline and Dialogue? -- Hardline  and Moderate Negotiation Strategy Utilizing Time Before  International Sanctions." The article notes the background  behind North Korea's sending two different messages one after  the other in connection with its nuclear issue, that is, while  it maintained a stiff stance for some time on the nuclear  inspection by the IAEA, North Korea hinted on the possibility of  resolving the issue through dialogue at the last minute. The  article notes, "Some North Korean watchers believe that North  Korea takes this position because it thinks there is still some  time left before actual sanctions are taken." The article then  notes the opinion of another group of watchers that says that  "North Korean President Kim Il-song may have tentatively taken  back the authority on diplomacy and economy from his son Kim  Chong-il to institute the authority himself. This may have  caused the issuance of the apparently conflicting messages."  The article notes the opinion of yet another group of watchers  that says "North Korea is trying to fully use the time before  the actual sanctions are taken," because it could still use the  double tactic of negotiation of hawk and dove before the  sanctions can actually produce effects.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 4 an 800-word  article entitled "The Last U.S. Persuasion To the North" by  correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington.    The article reports that the United States is making its  final persuasive move through the North Korean mission in the  United Nations and the PRC is also doing everything possible to  join the effort to persuade North Korea. The article reports  that such persuasive efforts are based on the analysis that  North Korea values the clue for dialogue [taehwaui pulssi] as  has been revealed through the remarks of a North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman on 12 February.    The article notes the fact that most conditions except one  or  two were agreed upon between North Korea and the IAEA and that  the ROK foreign minister's "appeal" during his recent U.S. visit  encouraged the United States to continue to be persuasive.    The article notes that "persuasion does not mean any more  concession but is focused on having North Korea realize the  situation after the nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security  Council."    The article reports that the ROK Government is criticized  for  having weakened the "stick character" of the persuasion by  announcing that it will continue dialogue with Pyongyang even  after the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN  Security Council.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a  1,200-word article by correspondent Yang Sung-hyon from Ottawa.    Comparing the two communications made by North Korea on 12  February -- the hard-line toned NODONG SINMUN commentary and the  moderate remarks of a Foreign Ministry spokesman -- the article  reports that the government analyzes the former as "for domestic  use" targeting the hard-liners and public opinion inside North  Korea, and the latter as a message to the international  community.    The article analyzes that "ROK Foreign Minister Han's visit  to the United States provided North Korea with a pretext for  changing its direction" and adds that government officials  believe there is a great possibility that North Korean  working-level officials reported such moves of the ROK and the  United States as an "achievement of the Republic's demand."    The article notes that it is still too early to be  optimistic  because the United State and the IAEA have yet to assess North  Korea's true intentions and North Korea has to confirm with the  IAEA if the IAEA's expression of "inspections for the continuity  of safeguards" coincides with North Korea's demands.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  700-word  entitled "Attention on North Korea's Last Nuclear Card" by  correspondent Yi Sung-chol from Ottawa.    The article notes that ROK and U.S. officials agree that  North Korea will soon suggest the resumption of dialogue with  the United States and that the attention is focused on when and  what the contents will be.    The article quotes an ROK Government official as saying:  "analyzing the 12 February remarks of the North Korean Foreign  Ministry spokesman, North Korea is focusing on facilitating  pretexts rather than insisting on their demands."    The article reports the official also added that North Korea  has finally realized that it is impossible for the United States  to pressure IAEA more to ease inspection conditions.    The article reports the ROK and U.S. authorities are  discussing the optimum level of pretexts available to the  expected demands from North Korea.    As to the timing, the article reports that related officials  expect North Korea will request the United States to hold a  dialogue on 19 February at the latest and that a high-ranking  ROK Government official expects that the IAEA's resolution to  refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council  will be adopted on 23 February.    The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are  studying  countermeasures based on three assumptions before 19 February:  First, when North Korea expresses its willingness to accept  nuclear inspections; Second, when the nuclear inspections begin;  Third, when no agreement is reached.    The article reports that an ROK Government authority said if  North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspection, there is a  great possibility that the United Nations will adopt a  resolution to impose sanctions with a deadline for nuclear  inspections.</p>

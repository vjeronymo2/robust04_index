The  ministries plan to review the current system of sending  technicians from the private sector overseas -- the current  technical assistance is applied to the field of shipbuilding and  heavy electrical machinery -- to extend the scope of technical  assistance to nonmanufacturing industries. At the same time,  the ministries will ask companies through the Federation of  Economic Organizations of Japan to use the revised system. The  ministries believe that the system will not only enrich  international contributions by the Japanese private sector but  also enable companies -- which are promoting the restructuring  of their organizations or downsizing their technical departments  -- to send their technicians overseas.    The two ministries established the "skilled technicians"  system in 1987 which was designed to send private enterprises'  technicians to developing nations as technical advisers. The  costs of sending them and a portion of their salaries are  covered by the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the  Employment Promotion Corporation. However, because of the  bubble economy, private enterprises have not taken much interest  in the system, and the number of companies which make use of the  system has not increased so far. In fiscal year 1993, only 17  companies applied to take advantage of the system.    In view of the fact that companies promoting the  restructuring of their business systems are increasing, both the  Foreign Ministry and the Labor Ministry have decided to make the  system more helpful. The ministries also hope to send abroad at  least 60 technicians annually. The ministries are considering  sending survey missions to Vietnam, Indonesia, and China to  learn what areas of technical assistance are needed.</p>

The minister made this statement after being summoned before  the Interior Policy Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, which  wanted to hear his views on the draft amnesty law. The  commission is collecting information to determine procedures for  handling the rebels who participated in the 1992 military  uprisings, as well as procedures under which charges can be  dropped.    Gen. Montero Revette said although he is not familiar with  the text of the draft amnesty law, and although he cannot oppose  any congressional debate or approval of the law, "we cannot  grant a blanket pardon to all officers who participated in the  foiled coup attempts." There are some officers who cannot  return to their military institutions because they adopted  political stands and have made political statements. He  explained that the draft amnesty law contradicts military  principles that endorse handling such cases on a case-by-case  basis and not by way of a general policy. In other words,  within the military, each case is unique unto itself.    Gen. Montero Revette pointed out that the Defense Ministry  will expedite the dropping of charges by studying each case  individually. He added that this policy was recommended by the  office of President Rafael Caldera as a means for resolving the  cases of the arrested military officers. He said that so far  charges have been dismissed against 319 rebels -- 270 before the  new government was installed, 10 by decision of court-martial,  and 39 since 2 February. As part of an effort to quickly  resolve the problem, he said that last Sunday a military  commission led by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Nicolas Valencia  Vivas went to Peru to negotiate the return of those servicemen  who have sought asylum in Peru.    The minister denied that an offer will be made to those who  are imprisoned to exchange their freedom for a discharge from  the Armed Forces. He also said it is not true that those who  have been released are being harassed, adding that they are not  being given any command posts and are constantly being rotated.  The minister explained that those who have requested a  discharge have been offered help in finding a job. Those who  return to the Armed Forces are kept "under observation" for one  year, while their commanding officer prepares monthly  evaluations. At the end of one year, they are then assigned  command posts.    Gen. Montero Revette stressed that under no circumstances  should this be considered a witch hunt. He added that there are  not enough intelligence officers to conduct an individual  follow-up on each person against whom charges have been dropped.  Referring to the case of Commander Hugo Chavez Frias, Gen.  Montero Revette reiterated that Chavez Frias has expressed his  wish to be the last person released, adding that his wish is  being respected. The general indicated there was little chance  of Chavez Frias returning to the FAN [National Armed Forces]  because his case is one of "the most complex, considering he was  the leader of the uprising."    On another subject, the defense minister said that his  ministry has abolished what seemed to be a policy of  investigating and arresting civilians for voicing opinions  through the media. Currently, no civilian is under arrest in  connection with the uprisings. The Defense Ministry's policy is  not to open a case against civilians for voicing opinions to the  press. To facilitate the process, we have decided that any  necessary information must be coordinated with the ministry  through its various departments. [sentence as published]    In conclusion, he said there have been some changes in the  military institutions, and he invited the deputies to provide  the names of those "officers who are members of AD [Democratic  Action], Copei [Social Christian Party], National Convergence,  and Radical Cause" in order that necessary steps can be taken.  The politization of the Armed Forces will not be permitted as  far as military promotions are concerned, because this is being  used as an argument for not accepting into the FAN anyone who  has publicly voiced political opinions.</p>

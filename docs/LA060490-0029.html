			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rap It Up: Amateur rappers will soon get an opportunity to "get on the mike"  and maybe appear on a rap album.  </P> <P> Music Plus and Epic Records are co-sponsoring a statewide contest for unsigned  rap musicians, and the winners will be included on a compilation cassette,  "Music Plus Street Rap '90." Music Plus officials said the project reflected  the company's commitment to supporting rap music with a positive message and  fighting the stereotype that all rap music is a threat. Entrants should submit  a cassette with their original rap song and an official entry form at any Music  Plus store between June 21 and July 15. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

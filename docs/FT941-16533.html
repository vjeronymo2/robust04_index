			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Scott inquiry teeters between dynamite and damp squib: Jimmy Burns explains why allegations of conspiracy and cover-up remain unclear Nine months after the start of its public hearings, it is still not clear whether the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry will produce political dynamite or a damp squib. Tomorrow, as the inquiry resumes its public hearings after the Christmas recess, the former home secretary Mr Kenneth Baker will face his grilling. Later this week the former foreign secretary Lord Howe will be called. They will be followed next Monday by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and former foreign minister Mr Tristan Garel-Jones are also due to appear. What is yet to be established is whether the Thatcher administration deliberately engaged in an organised conspiracy to supply arms illegally to Iraq. It is also unclear whether Mr Major's government tried to ensure a cover-up for past mistakes by issuing public-interest immunity certificates to prevent government documents being disclosed in the trial of three former executives of Matrix-Churchill, the machine-tool manufacturer. In the eyes of some observers, the inquiry is running out of steam. One former senior aide to Baroness Thatcher said: 'The inquiry is too bogged down in minutiae. The worst Scott might conclude is that she (Lady Thatcher) was presiding over an incompetent government.' Yet others closer to the present administration have not ruled out the possibility that the inquiry could put further strains on Mr Major and his government. 'I haven't heard many colleagues talking about Scott recently,' said one Conservative MP close to the government. 'But there is some explosive material here.' The issues with the most explosive potential are the use made by ministers of immunity certificates authorising the withholding of documents, and the extent to which British companies, with the complicity of officials and ministers, were engaged in arming President Saddam. At the time of the Matrix-Churchill trial in November 1992 ministers said that disclosure would be injurious to the public interest, endanger the lives of informants and threaten the efficiency of government. Mr Heseltine said that Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, had advised him it was his duty as a minister to sign the immunity certificates. He later told the Commons that 'what I knew, what I should have known, the questions I should have asked' were matters that would be 'properly examined by the Scott inquiry'. The inquiry has now established that officials and ministers, other than those who signed the immunity certificates, knew that Matrix-Churchill executives were involved in intelligence activities. It has also established that export licences for dual-use equipment were approved even though the intelligence services knew that British manufacturers were contributing to the enhancement of Iraq's military capability. Lord Justice Scott is thought now to be prepared to dispute the attorney-general's advice to the government. He may also seek to discover why the Matrix-Churchill trial took place, given the remarks by the former trade minister, Mr Alan Clark, that it should not have. But lawyers who have been following the inquiry closely believe the judge's terms of reference are too narrow to establish the full truth of what went on in the 1980s. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the secretary to the inquiry, said: 'We are not a general investigating authority looking at the extent to which companies breached export regulations. Our interest is in establishing what the government knew about companies breaching export regulations.' Further controversy could arise from the balance the judge seems to have tried to maintain between the interests of justice and the interests of Whitehall. 'The judge wants to be seen to be scrupulously fair so that his report will be taken that much more seriously,' said one of his officials. Some Whitehall officials believe ministers have tried to pass blame on to them and warn they could kick up a fuss if they end up as scapegoats. 'We feel as if we've been dumped on,' one witness grumbled.' A high-ranking political source said this week that Whitehall was awaiting with particular anticipation the evidence of Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, whose guidance notes put the onus of political responsibility on ministers. But the inquiry is taking much longer than expected. The publication of the judge's final report is not expected until the end of the summer and until the furore that surrounded its instigation has dissipated. It may now be all the harder to detect whether the inquiry will focus more on political responsibility, or opt instead for a broad critique of the inefficiencies of government and the shortcomings of legislation.</p>

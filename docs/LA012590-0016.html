			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MY BEST RECIPE: COFFEE CAKE FOR BREAKFAST OR TEATIME  </P> <P> "My mother's ancestry was a combination of Scotch and German," Ann I. Davis  writes, "but when it came to cooking, her German side prevailed. This recipe  for Glazed Coffee Cake, Kaffeekuchen mit Zucker und Nuss, exemplifies her flair  for a sugar-nut topped coffee cake that is perfect for breakfast, luncheon or  tea."  </P> <P> GLAZED COFFEE CAKE  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1 egg, beaten  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups flour, sifted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 15 to 20 crushed pecans  </P> <P> Cream 6 tablespoons butter and 1 cup sugar. Add beaten egg, beating until  smooth. Sift baking powder with salt and flour and add to creamed mixture  alternately with milk and vanilla. Pour cake mixture in greased square or  rectangular pan. Sprinkle cake with cinnamon and dot with remaining butter. Top  with crushed pecans. Bake at 350 degrees 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Immediately after removing coffee cake from oven, boil remaining 1/2 cup sugar  with 3 tablespoons cold water until ribbony but not crystallized. Pour glaze  over cake. Cool before cutting. Makes about 9 servings.  </P> <P> ANN DAVIS, Los Angeles  </P></p>

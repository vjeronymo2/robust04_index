			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Paris all at sea over shipyard subsidy deal - Withdrawing threat to scuttle OECD accord is proving difficult The French government is trying to wriggle off the hook on which it impaled itself when it publicly threatening to torpedo the international agreement to ban direct subsidies to shipbuilders from 1996. It will not be easy. Even before he formally opened his campaign for the presidency, Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, was fulminating at the accord, negotiated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development last July. Mr Chirac dubbed it the 'maritime Blair House', a reference to the preliminary transatlantic farm deal two years ago that was so hated in France. His presidential rival, the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, must therefore make any climb-down as discreet as possible. In fact, unlike French complaints about the agricultural Blair House, the Balladur government has no real quarrel with the way the European Commission negotiated the OECD deal on behalf of the European Union twelve. It simply rues the fact that the previous Socialist government joined other EU governments in giving Brussels a negotiating mandate in the first place. Instead of being able to use OECD consensus rules to stymie any ship subsidy ban at the outset, Paris now finds itself with a choice of submitting to the desire of all its 11 EU partners to ratify the accord, or blocking an international agreement that already carries the signatures of the US, Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The latter option puts Paris on a collision course with Bonn, which is keen to get the OECD deal ratified during its EU presidency, preferably by EU foreign ministers on November 28. Paris is banking on Bonn's help in finding a formula to save face. It was US complaints against German subsidies that triggered the OECD negotiation, and Paris reckons it deserves to be reciprocated for agreeing to let Bonn give a special, temporary subsidy (equivalent to up to 36 per cent of turnover) to the Rostock yards in eastern Germany. The main effect of the OECD deal would be to ban, from January 1 1966, direct subsidies which, in the EU, are allowed to be up to 9 per cent of a ship's cost. The Commission is now advising France to cease its fixation about the ban of this direct subsidy, and to make the most of permitted indirect aids. The OECD accord allows governments to pay up to 100 per cent of a yard's research costs and 25 to 35 per cent of its development costs, as well as some environmental and training aid. But CSCN, the French shipbuilders' association, was yesterday unenthusiastic. 'Shipyards on average only spend 1 per cent of turnover on research, and perhaps 2 per cent if you define research 'creatively' like the Japanese,' said a CSCN official. 'Even if the government pays for all of this, it wouldn't compensate for the disappearance of direct subsidies.' The OECD accord gives three other EU countries - Spain, Portugal and Belgium  -longer to phase out direct subsidies, because they have agreed to new capacity reductions. But France refused any further formal restructuring, arguing in the words of Mr Fabrice Theobald, head of CSCN, that the industry 'has so little capacity left to lose'. Over the past 18 years, employment in the sector has fallen from 25,000 to 4,800. Some 4,000 of these work at St. Nazaire for Chantiers de l'Atlantique (CAT), which is owned by GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British joint venture. It has a new plan to boost productivity by 30 per cent over five years, but hopes to do this with minimal cuts in capacity or jobs. Apart from CAT, French civil shipbuilding is composed of Constructions Mecaniques de Normandies at Cherbourg (which tried to save Swan Hunter in the UK from going under), Chantiers du Havre, and smaller operations at St Malo, Dieppe and Lorient. None of these locations - even St Nazaire, which has high unemployment - warrants regional aid, which other European yards are eligible for, certainly not on the scale of Rostock's. Some of these companies get a few French naval contracts. But the vast bulk of that is reserved for the French navy's own huge DCN yards at Brest, Lorient and Toulon, which employ about 30,000 people. The OECD accord allows governments to subsidise 'home credit' to their own shipowners to the level they subsidise 'export credit' to foreign buyers of their ships. But, with the French merchant fleet now only ranking 36th in the world, France complains it hardly has any shipowners left to take advantage of these 'home credits'. French shipping is unquestionably in poor shape; the average age of the 210 French-flagged vessels has doubled to 15 years over the past decade. Compagnie Generale Maritime is pulling out of Asian and North Atlantic routes in an effort to cut its losses so that one day the government can realise its plan to privatise the shipping group. The private Bollore group has also scaled down its shipping operations. Of the 15 ships on order from French shipowners now, only four are to be from French yards. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand is the result, as Mr Theobald admits, of his industry's decision to sidestep cut-price competition from Japan, Korea and Poland in containers and bulk carriers, and to specialise in passenger liners, LNG gas carriers and ferries, where they only face Finland and Italy. In one sense, this has paid off. CAT has in terms of orders 20 per cent of the world LNG market and, with the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line recently ordering a new 2,000 passenger cruiseship and placing an option on another, the St Nazaire yard has a similar share of world orders for passenger liners. But the upshot of such specialisation is that French yards depend on exports for more than 90 per cent of their business, and have left themselves little home market to fall back on.</p>

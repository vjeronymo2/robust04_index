			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec today started his three-day official visit to  Vietnam during which he will meet his Vietnamese counterpart  Nguyen Manh Cam, Premier Vo Van Kiet and Chairman of the  National Assembly (parliament) Nong Duc Manh.    Zieleniec, who is accompanied by more than twenty Czech  entrepreneurs and businessmen, will also attend economic  seminars in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The seminars are meant  to acquaint Vietnamese partners with the economic changes and  business conditions in the Czech Republic.    "I consider Vietnam the main goal of my Asia tour,"  Zieleniec, who is also to visit Malaysia and Australia, told  journalists.    He said that Vietnam had been coming through an important  stage in its development and besides, it has been ever more  actively participating in the developments of the Asian region  which is intensively developing. Vietnam cannot be regarded in  isolation but as the region of operation of the Association of  South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which has a future, Zieleniec  said.    He said that for a centrally managed economy, as the  Vietnamese one, it is important to establish contacts on the  government, official level, adding that it could be proceeded  from the traditional economic relations between Vietnam and the  Czech Republic. For Vietnam the Czech Republic represents a  sort of transfer to Western technoloogy.    The changes which have occured in the Czech Republic since  the November 1989 revolution were the reason why countries with  a centrally planned economy made the Czech economic situation  difficult to understand, Zieleniec said, adding that it was  important that his presence demonstrate to Hanoi the Czech  Republic's interest in cooperation.    Asked about the Czech government pro-export policy and of  how  the government sought to facilitate Czech firms' entrance into  foreign markets, Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic did not  have a tradition of managing all the economy by the state.  Nevertheless the Czech government supported exports with such  measures as, for example, his current visit, Zieleniec added.    On the problem of unsettled Czech claims in Vietnam  Zieleniec  said that they would be discussed but stressed the need for  "balance."    He said that unsettled debts sometimes prevented further  cooperation the profit from which would have been bigger than  the very debts.</p>

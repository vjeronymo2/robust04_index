			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 2, IRNA -- Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, has upped the stakes in Britain's diplomatic row with Iran  by making fresh allegations that Tehran supposedly "practices  state terrorism."    The new accusations, made in an interview with BBC World  Service Wednesday night, follows comments from Foreign Office  Minister Douglas Hogg, falsely describing Iran as a "factor of  instability in the region" during a visit to Qatar.    Both remarks are uncharacteristic of the norms of diplomatic  protocol that supposed to be based upon mutual respect and are  seen jeopardizing the already strained relations between the two  countries after the reciprocal expulsion of senior diplomats.    In his interview, Hurd claimed that the expulsions, started  by Britain last Thursday, were "not a game," but believed that  it was up to Iran, and not Britain, to ensure that the  tit-for-tat exchanges did not continue.    The sting in his remarks was in resorting to old allegations  about Iran's "supposed involvement in terrorism", which have not  been heard from a British minister since Tehran severed  relations with London in 1989.    The foreign secretary cited the Rushdie affair and  orchestrated smears about Iran's links with the IRA to maintain  that it was Tehran, and not London, that should change its  behavior before there could be "decent relations" between the  two countries.    But he made no mention of the `forged documents' issued  earlier in the day by the Foreign Office that apparently  hoodwinked no one into believing its claim of Iran's involvement  in discrediting Britain's already discredited policy in Bosnia.    The documents disclosed are two among many floating around  over the past year and are so ludicrously written that it is an  insult to even the most illiterate to suggest they were produced  by "Iran's intelligence service", as claimed by the Foreign  Office.    Even more incredible were the conflicting statements put out  by the Foreign Office, which came after maintaining last week  that its excuse for expelling an Iranian first secretary would  remain confidential because of its apparent childish nature.    Hurd's tact in his interview was to claim that it was now  impossible to go on "excusing inexcusable behavior." But behind  his words, the question left open as to who was trying to  convince whom about who in stooping so low to worsen the  diplomatic row.    The sudden change of events in Britain's relations with Iran  can be traced to the U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to London on April 25, when he was reported  to have asked for further UK support in Washington's campaign to  isolate Iran.    With Hurd due to meet Christopher in Oxford this Saturday,  it  is presumed that he can be briefed about subsequent campaign  that was launched with the smears about the IRA [Irish  Republican Army] links only four days after his visit.    But still left to be answered by the British Government is  the earlier embarrassing discovery of an intelligence service  bug in the Iranian Embassy, which the succession of UK insults  have been trying to camouflage.    Indications are that Britain's increasingly erratic and  often  eccentric foreign policy is the result of a power-struggle,  where hardline anti-Iran opinion currently has the upperhand to  produce unpalatable behavior reminiscent of its colonial past.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US to review chip agreement with Japanese THE US government is to conduct a high-level inter-agency review of the implementation of last year's agreement with Japan on semiconductor trade, a move signalling growing concern in the US about lack of progress on improving foreign access to the Japanese chip market. 'We are extremely troubled by the lack of progress,' Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said when announcing the review yesterday. 'A detailed examination of the facts will help to determine whether the arrangement is being implemented properly, and what must be done to overcome any impediments to market access.' Under the terms of the 1991 agreement Japan recognised US expectations that the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market should rise to more than 20 per cent by the end of 1992. However, according to the last available data, the foreign share stood at only 14.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991, and has been virtually stagnant for the past two years. Official figures for market share in the first quarter of 1992 are not expected until mid-June, but unofficial measures from industry sources suggest that Japanese imports of most types of semiconductor products have declined sharply over the past few months, reflecting weakening economic conditions in Japan. The announcement of the inter-agency review 'is one more indication that Japan must take immediate steps to improve access to its semiconductor market,' Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the US Semiconductor Industry Association, said. 'It also sends a strong message that the US government will insist Japan adhere to the terms of the agreement.' The inter-agency review - drawing in the Trade Representative's Office, the Commerce and State departments, and several other bodies - will begin this week and is expected to file a report by August 1.</p>

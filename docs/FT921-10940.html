			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BP BP's extended foray into food processing does not rank in the first division of failed oil company diversifications: remember Mobil the retailer, or Exxon in its brief days as an electric motor manufacturer. But the group's decision to label its nutrition division a 'non-core' business certainly places it in the league of embarrassing mistakes, not least because such high hopes were invested along with BP's cash. Three years ago, BP made a similar change in the status of its coal business, saying nutrition would be the engine of future non-oil growth. So much for that. Assuming the division will now be sold off piecemeal, BP should avoid write-downs of the sort associated with rivals' ventures. It will be rather harder to hide from scrutiny a return on capital averaging only 6 per cent in the past five years. BP may try to restore investors' faith by increasing its final dividend next week, even though it would thereby increase the pressure on its cash flow. The group's narrow concern is to make the nutrition division self-funding in the meantime. Given that the business was cash-generative in 1990, that should be simple. Selling it will be rather harder. But if BP is lucky, it could raise up to Pounds 700m, equivalent to about a tenth of group debt. Whether it can raise anything like that this year is another matter. The broader question concerns big oil's inability to do anything sensible with its profits except invest them in further exploration or pay them out to shareholders. If the recent round of dismal fourth-quarter results from US oil companies is an accurate reflection of the industry's woes, it might be as well to avoid the sector altogether.</p>

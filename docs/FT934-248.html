			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Patten attacks China on Basic Law Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, yesterday accused China of making up the Basic Law, its post-1997 constitution for the territory, as it went along and of indiscriminately throwing out proposals discussed by the governments of Britain and the colony and in the interests of Hong Kong people. Responding to a statement issued by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office on Monday saying China would disband all elected bodies when it regains sovereignity in 1997, Mr Patten said it reflected the rule of man rather than the rule of law. 'Even if that was reasonable, it's clean against the Basic Law itself, Article 160 for example. It's not a matter for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to decide what is or is not in line with the Basic Law. It's a matter for the National People's Congress standing committee. So I don't know what the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office think they are doing. 'Their position appears to be that whatever Hong Kong people want, whatever the Legislative Council discusses, whatever we propose in the Hong Kong government or the British government, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and senior Chinese officials will throw it out,' he said. He added that legislative councillors would ensure fair and open electoral arrangements prevailed at the end of the day.</p>

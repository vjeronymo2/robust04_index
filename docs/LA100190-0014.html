			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> SHERRILL MILNES AT EL CAMINO  </P> <P> If Sherrill Milnes had thrown out the rule book Saturday at El Camino College  -- the recital rule book, that is -- he would have led with his strengths: a  personable manner best illustrated in the group of American songs that closed  the evening.  </P> <P> It was here, in the irony-tinged fire and brimstone of Malotte's "David and  Goliath," that Milnes' dramatic mastery came across compellingly.  </P> <P> The 55-year-old baritone was the preacher at the pulpit. And his voice rang out  with power that matched the narrative, with inflections that made the  interpretive point.  </P> <P> It could be seen as well -- despite the obligatory regalia of tuxedo and white  tie -- because nothing stood between him and the character he was portraying.  </P> <P> And for this final group of mostly old-time songs that included "Duna," the  tall singer allowed himself to chat, offhandedly, with the audience. He was  perfectly charming and natural.  </P> <P> But for the Italian-German first half of the program, he followed prescribed  practice -- offering a group of antiquities that warmed up his voice.  </P> <P> Perhaps it was an off night. Perhaps after three decades before the public,  Milnes can at times be expected to be in less than top form. Perhaps this  material and a stiff, almost mannered demeanor robbed him of his natural  advantage.  </P> <P> In any case, he seemed to be missing his characteristic richness of tone. In  two Schumann lieder, however -- "Widmung" and "Der Nussbaum" -- when he used an  aptly inward approach and could cover the voice instead of trying to project  it, the results were poetic.

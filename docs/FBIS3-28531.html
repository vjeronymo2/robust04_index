The editorial  reads in part as follows:    The international situation has developed quickly and  complicatedly since the seventh party congress. Our country is  making efforts to overcome difficulties and move forward. There  still remain many weaknesses and shortcomings. Nonetheless,  under the party's leadership, we have overcome to a very  important extent the socioeconomic crisis, continued to maintain  and consolidate political stability, and broadened diplomatic  relations. Those particularly important achievements have  created the preliminary conditions for our country to gradually  shift to a new state of development to serve the goals of  national industrialization and modernization.    Realities over the past years testify to the correctness of  the party's major renovation policies and to the appropriateness  of its actions. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party  congresses have been applied in a practical fashion.</p>

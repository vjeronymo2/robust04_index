			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / People: Woodhead's homecoming to FOX London FOX, the troubled commodity futures and options exchange, is taking on Robin Woodhead (right) as its new chief executive from October, in succession to Phillip Thorpe, deputy chief executive of the Securities &amp; Futures Association, who had been running the market in a caretaker role since last October. Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe and chairman of FOX since June, says he is pleased with the quality of candidates applying for the post 'bearing in mind it is not the easiest market to develop'. FOX was hit by scandal last year, which cost the jobs of both the then chairman and chief executive, Saxon Tate and Mark Blundell. It has also struggled for years to establish credible markets even in its core soft commodities products such as sugar and coffee. The appointment is something of a homecoming for Woodhead, 42, who played a central role in setting up London's oil futures market, the International Petroleum Exchange, from 1980. He was chairman for IPE's first four years, during which time he was also managing director of Premier Man, a joint venture between Premier Consolidated and ED&amp;F Man. In the early days the IPE used the facilities of FOX's precursor, the London Commodity Exchange and so Woodhead has worked with a number of staff, some in key positions, who are still at FOX. He then went on to form the National Investment Group, a network of regional stock brokers, which was sold four years later to Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management. A lawyer who spent part of his childhood in Rhodesia, Woodhead has recently been a consultant for Swiss Bank Corporation on southern Africa. Jenkins, who retires later this year from Liffe after presiding over its first highly successful decade, says that enthusiasm and open-mindedness were two of the prime qualities he had been looking for and found in Woodhead. The latter was yesterday in South Africa and unavailable to comment on his plans to revive FOX.</p>

Our  correspondent Eva Hulkova reports about their meeting at  Hradecek [Havel's private cottage] that ended a short time ago.    [Hulkova] The aim of my visit was to learn about the  feelings  of our neighbors, Andrey Kozyrev said during his visit today to  Hradecek, where he arrived by helicopter. According to Vaclav  Havel, their very intensive talks had one subject: the future  security setup in Europe and, in this context, the role of NATO  and the CSCE.    Havel and Kozyrev briefed each other about the political  visions of their countries and about the social reality in their  countries that influences these political visions.    Havel explained to the Russian foreign minister the causes  of  alarm whenever there are views voiced in Russia containing the  hidden intention of including the Czech Republic in the Russian  sphere of influence. Kozyrev showed understanding for this  explanation and told journalists that, if the words "sphere of  interest" evoked the past, he was fully prepared not to use that  expression.    Kozyrev appreciated the opportunity to meet Havel, besides  other things, because the Czech President is actively building  democracy and a new system in Europe.    Regarding the [NATO] ultimatum [to the Bosnian Serbs], Havel  understands it, but, at the same time, he understands why Russia  was dissatisfied with the fact that it was consulted about this.    The two officials agreed that talks like the ones they held  make sense and should continue.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eldar Zeyna: The Blank Spots Where Material Was </F> Removed: A Few Words on the Free Press in Azerbaijan"]    [Text] If one talks about Azerbaijan as an independent  state, it is first and foremost a republic that is independent  of the standards of an independent state.    In the third year of Azerbaijan's "independent" existence,  there is no new constitution, no law on citizenship (all the  rest of the laws written for Azerbaijan's citizens are, as a  result, turning into a code) and no passport. It has no  legitimate parliament (the National Assembly is functioning  instead, with a five-fold smaller staff) and only in the sixth  year of the war did it begin to build a regular army. Is it any  wonder, after this, that the activity of censorship -- that  age-old scourge of the "fourth power" -- is not regulated by  legislation?    No, though of course, some National Assembly acts about  censorship do exist. For example, in the autumn of 1992, the  "Law on Mass Information Media" was passed, and one of its  points is direct prohibition of censorship of the press (the  explanation of relations with the state through the court is  proposed). For some time after this, the role of censor was  played by Iskender Gamidov, the indefatigable minister of  Internal Affairs, who would pace up and down the editorial  offices and, with his own hands, beat up the editors of  newspapers that had wronged the People's Front (ZERKALO,  AYDYNLYG, ISTIGLAL).    By 2 April 1993, however, the government, without beating  about the bush, had introduced a state of emergency and  reinstated political and military censorship. In this period the  publication of the newspapers ISTIGLAL, SABAKH and GYZYLBASH was  shut down, and the type pages of the opposition newspapers were  "adorned" with the blank spaces left from the material that had  been cut.    On the whole, the shift in power in June 1993 had no effect  on the situation: censorship was retained all the same (the new  powers thoughtfully extended the state of emergency introduced  by their predecessors), it was just that the group of "lads for  flogging," in which the former pro-government newspapers found  themselves, was changed. The case is recalled, for example,  when, last summer, a piece was removed from the reprinted  newspaper AZADLYG, and from some reference book for the  biography of Geydar Aliyev, at that time speaker of parliament  (now the president). The piece pertained to his former  chairmanship in the KGB and membership in the CPSU Central  Committee Politburo. A whole chunk of his life was removed  (which, incidentally, did not overly burden Aliyev himself).    Then not long ago, in January, a few paragraphs from S.  Talbott's September report before the United States Senate  Foreign Affairs Committee, with an account of that country's  official position on the change of power in Azerbaijan, were  removed from the newspaper ISTIGLAL. It took this newspaper two  months of battling with the censorship and an appeal of the  "Helsinki Watch" to G. Aliyev, for the "Amnesty International"  report on the state of human rights in Azerbaijan in 1992 (!) to  be passed through.    The thing is, censorship is constructed according to the old  Soviet model of "inside-out glasnost": let the whole world know,  but just don't corrupt the domestic reader. Censorship can be  understood in some places: after all, there is so far no law on  censorship which would regulate its relations with the press and  the government, and no list of the state and military secrets  which formerly existed in almost every state office. One has to  work in the old way, primarily aimed at not offending the "first  person" of the state in any way.    The situation did not change with the September canceling of  the state of emergency, along with political (but not military)  censorship, nor with the December passage by the National  Assembly, in response to the grumbling of the press, of a  special decree forbidding politicians to engage in censorship.    The only innovation is a particularly feeble one forbidding  the newspapers now to leave the blank spots left from the  materials removed, and making them fill them in with something  loyal or bring the lines together. "Or else, you see, those  abroad will think that our country has censorship and no  democracy," the censor requiring this ingenuously explained to  one of my friends.    The present regime is in general beneficially distinguished  from the preceding "democrats" by its greater sensitivity to  world public opinion. This is, in my opinion, the only effective  means of pressure on the regime in the direction of liberalizing  the attitude toward the independent press. The government's  counteracting of this liberalization is mainly along the line of  strong "educating" of the press, in order for the president to  subordinate to himself personally both the censorship and the  only newspaper publishing house, "Azerbaijan." On the one hand,  the censor explains "that such-and-such is good and  such-and-such is bad," and on the other hand -- the publishing  house sets up an obstacle to unpleasing newspapers. It takes no  special art to do this, incidentally, when one considers the  difficulties experienced by the independent press, as compared  with the government press, when it is based on self-provision  with metal plates, paper and the rest of the things necessary  for printing, 95 percent located in another sovereign state  (Russia), with which bank and transport relations are  complicated.    All the newspapers of Azerbaijan are now in debt, except  perhaps the government-subsidized "officiosa." But while in  Russia private enterprises and banks can subsidize a certain  political group without being afraid that the road to normal  activity will be cut off to them, in Azerbaijan this is fraught  with major troubles. So it is not by chance that Etibar Mamedov,  chairman of the National Independence Party, stormed into  parliament on learning that they wanted to check the account of  his party newspaper, MILLYAT, to find out the channels by which  money was arriving.    If one considers the fact that AZADLYG, the newspaper of the  People's Front, at the time when the PFA [People's Front of  Azerbaijan] was in power, managed not only to make ends meet,  but to lease an entire building, buy computers and even  subsidize the holding of two PFA congresses, then the  information that, through the raykoms of the "Yeni (New)  Azerbaijan Party," headed by the president, certain major  enterprises alluded to the need for donations to the party organ  of the same name does not seem all that groundless.    Having been contributing to the independent press for four  years now and having survived several introductions and  cancellations of censorship and five changes of power, I can  with full responsibility summarize that after a certain  temporary ebb, each of these changes has led to even greater  "screw-tightening" with respect to the press which is  independent of the government (and the ruling party).  Concentrating censorship and the press media in the same hands  and persistently expressing, in the pro-government press, the  idea that "a state at war does not need hundreds of newspapers"  -- all that cannot help but put one on guard.    The striving for monopoly over the printed word is not the  casual whim of a certain specific ruler, but the expression of  the general striving of a pleiad of "fathers of the nation,"  replacing each other in Azerbaijan, toward political monopoly  (it is not by chance that they call the press the "fourth  power"). The press is an irritant, damaging the false democratic  image of the government, and at the same time it is very  vulnerable, particularly in a post-totalitarian state such as  Azerbaijan. The treatment of the mass information media may  therefore be regarded as a barometer of the moods of any  specific government.    These are the abc's, and therefore, when the West, which has  tantalized us with the delights of its democracy for dozens of  years, is now shamefully ignoring the obvious anti-democratic  trends in the attitude of a certain specific government of  Azerbaijan toward the press, ascribing this sometimes to the war  and sometimes to the infancy of our democracy, I am inclined to  regard it as assumed naivete. Well, the government of the  People's Front cannot be national and democratic if its minister  beats up journalists, and the president, in response to the  complaints, promises to add to this with the help of the court!    The smell of the Caspian oil, which both regimes promised  the  West, has clearly dispelled its feeling for the recurrences of  totalitarianism. But really, from whom can we ask and expect  help, if not from the West? Several Western petroleum companies  have representatives in the republic, but not a single  department of democratic funds or institutions, which in itself  shows the direction of the West's interests.    In this connection, the story comes to mind of one of the  American presidents who reconciled himself to the arbitrary rule  of a Latin American dictator, because he was "his own son of a  bitch." The United States had no fewer problems with this  country (Nicaragua) because of this approach, and in the end a  revolution broke out, and this error in reckoning will echo for  a long time. So is it not simpler (and cheaper, in the long run)  to develop democracy in Azerbaijan instead of implanting "our  own" dictators?</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Arnotts given boost in fight for improved offer ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company facing a hostile ADollars 8.80-a-share bid from Campbell Soup of the US, yesterday said its two biggest institutional shareholders had undertaken not to accept the offer. Mr Bill Purdy, chairman, told shareholders in a letter that the AMP Society and National Mutual Life, which hold a combined 10.8 per cent of Arnotts, believed the bid was too low. The announcement will provide a significant boost to Arnotts' campaign to force Campbell to increase the offer, which the board has dismissed as 'opportunistic'. Mr Leigh Hall, AMP investment manager, said the offer was 'inadequate'. Campbell, which owns almost 33 per cent of Arnotts, is seeking a further 17.2 per cent for majority control at a cost of ADollars 206m (USDollars 142.3m). The offer values the company at ADollars 1.2bn. Most opposition to the bid has come from family shareholders, who jointly control about 20 per cent of the stock. The rejection of the offer by two institutions is likely to stiffen resistance among uncommitted shareholders. Mr Purdy said only three of 3,000 Arnotts shareholders contacted by the company had said they would accept the offer. He did not say how many shareholders had responded. Arnotts' shares closed 3 cents lower at to ADollars 9.17 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

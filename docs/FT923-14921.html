			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: Demise of a shady genius THE RECKONING by Charles Nicholl Cape Pounds 19.99, 413 pages CHRISTOPHER Marlowe's end offers an inviting subject for inventive speculation. Here the author admits candidly that his is 'an attempt to fill in with probabilities and speculations and sometimes with guesswork. I am not telling a story but presenting a complex and rather painstaking argument'. Painstaking, certainly. An historian of the period can agree that the author has done his homework well, has pursued the careers of the poet's shady companions into the underground, and come up with some new facts concerning them, for what that is worth. The title of the book refers to the dispute and scuffle at table over 'le reckoning', according to the coroner's inquest over Marlowe's body. William Shakespeare knew how he came by his end, and uses the same word in his reference to it in As You Like It. But was it 'murder', as this enthusiastic explorer of the background has it in his sub-title - and as he implies all the way through - 'the killing' of Marlowe, 'the stabbing', as if it were intended? 'We arrive at a conspiracy', etc. Nobody thought so at the time. Dr William Urry, who knew more about Marlowe and his Canterbury background than anybody, went through the jurors at the inquest with a tooth-comb. He found what a respectable body of citizens they were, perfectly satisfied with the evidence as to what happened that deplorable day in May 1593 in Eleanor Bull's house at Deptford. Marlowe and his companions had been there all day, eating and drinking. At the end of the day there was a dispute over the reckoning. From lying on a couch Marlowe aimed a blow with his dagger at Ingrain Friezer, who wrested it out of his hands with a blow which, alas, killed him. There was nothing mysterious about it. Many people knew what Marlowe was like. He had been involved in affrays before, and knifings - in one of which somebody else was killed. We learn that he was 'given to sudden privy injuries to men' - quick on the draw, as we would say. Marlowe was known to be an unstable, questionable personality, not only devoutly homosexual but - what was more dangerous - aggressively undevout about religion. He was in every way heterodox, rebellious against convention. People called him an 'atheist'; actually he was an intellectual deist, who had no use for conventional religion. The one thing that remains important to us now is his wonderful genius: dead at 29, he was the greatest loss our literature ever suffered.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUMPHERY IS ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS;  </P> <P> RAMS: SINCE BEING MOVED TO THE RIGHT SIDE, VETERAN CORNERBACK SAYS HE MUST BE  PREPARED TO BE TESTED BY QUARTERBACKS.  </P> <P> Unless you can talk a mile-a-minute, spew boxing cliches like left jabs, demand  a trade every week or so, complain religiously about San Francisco 49er  salaries, or dream up a zany armed forces salute for your defensive  coordinator, you can't really replace LeRoy Irvin at cornerback.  </P> <P> So, naturally, Bobby Humphery isn't trying. Let's just say Humphery is assuming  the right corner position once rented by Irvin, who was released last spring by  the Rams after 10 seasons of notes and quotes.  </P> <P> In fact, Humphery, acquired on draft day from the New York Jets for a  fifth-round pick, has been as controversial as a sunrise, and just about as  consistent. The questions concerning Humphery's cover abilities, or lack  thereof, have given way to some answers.  </P> <P> Humphery, 28, has intercepted passes in each of the past two exhibition games,  although he said those plays were no big deals in establishing himself as a  Ram.  </P> <P> "It may help," he said, "but I don't see it that way. I'm just trying to show  the coaches and the team that I can contribute to what they have. That's my  ultimate goal."  </P> <P> The Rams, more than others, have been sold on Humphery for some time, even  after one of their own, Flipper Anderson, beat him deep in a game last season.  Humphery, in turn, has taken to his new environment with caution.  </P> <P> "It's like taking a new job," he said. "You come out and do the best you can,  and try to do what the company asks you to do, and do it to the best of your  ability. That's the way I've looked at that. I'm just trying to let them accept  me as a player and try to do the things they want to see in a player."  </P> <P> When the trade was made, Humphery was supposed to play left corner and lend  veteran leadership to Darryl Henley, the projected starter at right corner.  </P> <P> But since Henley's hip injury, Jerry Gray has been moved from free safety back  to left corner, with Humphery switching to right corner. And that may not be  such a great deal for the new corner in town.  </P> <P> Why? Because opponents figured to pick more on Henley and his inexperience than  on Humphery, an eight-year veteran. But with Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl  selection, back at corner, quarterbacks, given a choice, will probably prefer  working against Humphery.  </P> <P> Is he prepared?  </P> <P> "I'm going to have to be," he said. "I can see why, because he (Gray) is very  talented and he's very smart. I'm trying to get as comfortable as he is. If  they want to come to my side, I'm going to be up to the task. I'm going to have  to be up to the task."  </P> <P> Humphery said other teams used the same strategy in the years he played in New  York.  </P> <P> "It wasn't so much that I was the weak link, but it was just because teams are  mostly right-handed and that's the way they chose to attack us," he said. "I'm  used to being thrown at a lot. I've got to be up for the challenge."  </P> <P> Defensive end Gary Jeter, who played six years with the Rams before signing a  two-year deal with New England in 1989, was released Tuesday by the Patriots,  but has told reporters there he still wants to play.  </P> <P> Given the Rams' current crisis at defensive line, might the 35-year-old Jeter  return to Anaheim?  </P> <P> "We would probably talk to him," Coach John Robinson said. "Just to see where  he is, see how he's doing. He had an injury early in camp that's pretty close  to being healed."  </P> <P> Jeter, suffering from hip and thigh injuries, had not played for the Patriots  this summer.  </P> <P> The Rams offered Jeter a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1989, but  he left as a Plan B free agent to New England, which offered him two years and  some enticing guarantees.  </P> <P> Jeter received $250,000 in base salary last season and a $200,000 reporting  bonus, plus other incentives. His 1990 base salary of $250,000 was not  guaranteed, however, leaving the Rams some room to negotiate.  </P> <P> In 1988, his last year with the Rams, Jeter recorded 11 1/2 sacks, second on  the team to Kevin Greene's 16 1/2.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Mel Owens, the 10-year veteran linebacker, is still bedridden with his back  injury. He's allowed to get up one hour per day for physical therapy. Owens  originally injured his back in training camp at UC Irvine. He aggravated it on  the long plane rides to and from Berlin, and wrenched it completely Aug. 18 in  a game against San Diego. "It was like stripping gears," he said. "What can you  say? That's football." There is no timetable on Owens' return. . . . New punter  Keith English reported to camp and worked out with the team Wednesday. He said  he figured something was up with the Rams when the Chargers gave him every kick  in the Aug. 18 game at Anaheim Stadium. Turns out San Diego was showcasing  English, who was a free agent last year who couldn't catch on with the Raiders.  English said he spent a total of three exhibition games with the Raiders but  didn't kick in a game. "It's kind of tough when you're a free agent coming out  of college and they won't let you kick in preseason," English said.  </P></p>

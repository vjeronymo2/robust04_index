			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / IMF cash resources 'facing strain' THE international Monetary Fund's cash resources could fall to their lowest level in years if its member countries do not quickly put into effect the Dollars 62bn (Pounds 31.4bn) capital increase they agreed two years ago, IMF officials have warned. Faced with heavy demands for money from new members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the IMF's available cash resources fell last year to Special Drawing Rights 20.9bn, the organisation's reserve currency unit. The officials said their liquidity position could worsen considerably by the end of this year unless they receive the funds from the quota increase. 'We do see the liquidity situation as potentially becoming quite strained,' one official said. The biggest problem for implementing the quota increase, which would raise the IMF's capital base by 50 per cent to SDR135.2bn (Pounds 100bn), has been the reluctance of the US, the IMF's biggest member, to pass the necessary legislation for its share. The Bush administration has now rolled the IMF quota increase into a package of aid measures for the former Soviet Union; this bill has been delayed by wrangling over aid for US inner cities, but congressional aides say they expect it to pass, probably at the end of this month. But even US acceptance will not be enough to implement the quota increase. Under the IMF's rarely simple operating rules, the quota increase cannot come into effect until a separate amendment to the organisation's articles, providing for the suspension of voting rights for countries which do not fulfil their obligations to the IMF, has been ratified by three-fifths of the member countries possessing 85 per cent of the voting rights. Even with the US's 18.9 per cent of voting rights, this level will not be reached until some other substantial member countries such as Italy have ratified the amendment. IMF officials said the Washington-based organisation's usable resources fell last year as a proportion of liquid liabilities to 82 per cent. This liquidity ratio is projected to fall to about 50 per cent by the end of the year without the extra resources that would be brought in by the quota increase. Members can usually pay three-quarters of their quota in their domestic currency, which for most countries is not readily usable elsewhere, so the quota increase is expected to provide nearly SDR30bn of immediately usable resources, roughly doubling the IMF's liquidity. Even without the addition of the former communist countries, calls on the IMF's resources have increased substantially, the IMF's annual report, published yesterday, says. New commitments in the financial year ending April 30 totalled SDR8.7bn, against SDR5.6bn in the previous financial year. Arrangements with Argentina, India and Brazil accounted for most of this. Additional members from the former communist bloc and elsewhere have brought the IMF's membership list to 169 countries. With the completion of pending applications from republics of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, as well as from Micronesia and San Marino, the IMF will have 178 members. 'For the first time, the IMF can be said truly to have moved towards the goal of universal membership,' an official said.</p>

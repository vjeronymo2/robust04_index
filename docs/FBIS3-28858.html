			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] According to various diplomatic sources, the  U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh has been in close contact with the  two-headed government and the Vietnamese communist puppets'  General Staff officials, especially Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, and  Long Sopheap, in order to follow up and set plans for their  military operations against the people and the national  resistance forces in various areas, particularly the Route 68  region from Samraong to Anlung Veng. [passage omitted]    The same sources reported further that the Americans know  perfectly well that there are a large number of Vietnamese  forces in the puppet army's General Staff, the various military  regions, the divisions, and the special intervention units. The  Americans have even known about the Vietnamese communists'  activities in arranging for the puppet colonels and generals to  study in Vietnam in January and setting up plans for continuing  military operations in the current dry season.    This proves that the Americans have joined hands with the  Vietnamese communists; that is, while the Vietnamese communists  openly stage the play, the Americans act as the paymaster behind  the scenes. Openly, the Americans have kept claiming that there  are no Vietnamese in Cambodia. This is a concrete activity in  line with the U.S.-led Western alliance's policy and strategy to  smash the Cambodian national resistance forces, especially the  Democratic Kampuchean forces, so that they can scramble for the  flesh and blood of the Cambodian nation and people in the  interests of their economic strategy and other interests.    Actively following the aforementioned policy and strategy,  they have inducted the ANKI forces of the FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the troops of the other Paras  [former non-communist resistance groups] into the Vietnamese  communist puppet forces and sent them to launch operations  against the Cambodian people and national resistance forces  since August 1993. Since then, they have launched operations at  Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap,  Samraong, Oddar Meanchey, Anlung Veng, and various other areas.  This is why the flames of war continue to blaze in Cambodia.  This is why the Vietnamese communists have been so bold and  kept flowing into Cambodia without any fear.    However, the history of previous centuries and the current  new developments clearly attest to the truth that the aggressors  will certainly face shameful defeat vis-a-vis a nation and  people who dare to fight for the survival of their country and  race.</p>

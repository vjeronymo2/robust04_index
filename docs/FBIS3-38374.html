			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Italian Republican Party is on the verge of a  split. A section of the party wants to remain with the  Democratic Alliance [AD] and is criticizing the decision of  [Giorgio] La Malfa to take the party toward the position of  [Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party secretary] and  [Mario] Segni [Pact for Italy leader]. Guido Dell'Acquila  reports:    [Dell'Acquila] The four-leaf clover of the AD and the ivy  leaf of La Malfa do not thrive in the same kind of soil. La  Malfa's decision yesterday to join Segni and Martinazzoli split  the party in two and was also greeted negatively by the AD--the  organization to which some notable Republicans continue to  belong.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Do you  consider anyone who joins the left-wing slate to be outside the  Republican Party?    [La Malfa] Of course, if the Republicans join a certain  slate, then whoever joins another slate, or campaigns for  another slate, is obviously travelling down a different road.  [end recording]    [Dell'Acquila] Even if Bruno Visentini is keeping quiet for  the time being, Giorgio Bogi is not. He is part of the AD, and  he wants to remain there.    [Begin Bogi recording] I understand perfectly well that  standing on the same slate as opponents is not a reconcilable  antagonism. However, in this particular case, we will continue  to be part of the AD as Republicans. [end recording]    [Dell'Acquila] Giuseppe Ayala, the notable independent  deputy, is also abandoning La Malfa.    [Begin Ayala recording] I am one of the founders of AD. I  have always believed in the organization, I continue to believe  in the organization and I will always believe in the  organization. I am sorry that the Republican Party is no longer  involved, or at least not all of the party. Let us see how many  republicans remain, in my opinion there will be many. [end  recording]</p>

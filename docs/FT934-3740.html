			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / News Corp abandons 'super' share plan News Corporation, the Australian media and film company headed by Mr Rupert Murdoch, last night withdrew its controversial plan to issue shares with 'super' voting rights to existing shareholders. The plan, announced in October, created concern in Australia, where differental voting rights are not currently permitted. Critics saw it as a means by which the Murdoch family interests could establish an entrenched controlling position at News Corporation. The Murdoch family owns about one-third of News' shares, but its stake has slipped as the company has been obliged to issue new equity to fund acquisitions and pay down debt. The proposed scheme would have allowed the family to stabilise its interest - and even increase it via further purchases of 'super' shares, which provide multiple voting rights - while the company could have continued to issue ordinary shares. Mr Murdoch acknowleged that Australian authorities were unlikely to decide on the scheme for many months. The News board had decided at a meeting in London to withdraw the plan.</p>

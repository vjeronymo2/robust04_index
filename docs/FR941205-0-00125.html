			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Method 555&blank;Several commenters noted that the method detection limits (MDLs) for some analytes were greater than MDLs in the alternative method (EPA Method 515.1), or were too high to meet monitoring triggers, which are specified at 40 CFR 141.24(h)(18). Thus, they questioned whether Method 555 was a suitable alternative to Method 515.2. EPA believes commenters mistakenly looked at MDLs in Table 2 of Method 555, which shows the results of spikes at 10 ppb. However, spikes at 0.5 ppb (Table 5 in the method) resulted in MDLs that are equivalent to Method 515.1 MDLs, and these MDLs have been validated in a second laboratory (EPA, 1992a). EPA also notes that monitoring triggers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for several organic contaminants, including Method 555 analytes, may be amended in a future rulemaking (EPA, 1993b, 1994f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great Lakes Instruments (GLI) Method 2 (turbidity)&blank;Some commenters objected to the method because it is vendor and instrument-specific. EPA generally develops and approves methods that are not vendor-specific. Users are not limited to the GLI method; generic methods SM 2130B and EPA 180.1 are approved for turbidity. However, under the Alternative Test Procedures (ATP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program EPA has approved vendor-specific methods or products as alternatives to approved methods (53 FR 5142, February 19, 1988). GLI Method 2 was evaluated under EPA's ATP program and recommended for approval as an alternative method. EPA realizes GLI is the source of copies of GLI Method 2, which is a factor a laboratory choosing to adopt this method must consider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters believed the GLI method should be approved as a version of an international procedure, ISO 7027. The ISO procedure measures turbidity via either 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; scattered or transmitted light depending on concentration. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments conforming to ISO 7027 specifications are similar to the GLI instrument, only the GLI instrument uses pulsed, multiple detectors to simultaneously read both 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; scattered and transmitted light. EPA has received no data on the ISO 7027 use of separate 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; scattered or transmitted light measurements to judge equivalency to other approved turbidity methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E, Low Level Amperometric Titration&blank;A commenter noted a typographical error in a calculation in SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E, which the Standard Methods Committee has agreed to correct. In approving SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E, EPA will print the correct formula for SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). The Standard Methods Committee will publish a correction to this method in the next (19th) edition of Standard Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Eaton, 1993a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SM 6610 (APHA, 1994)&blank;A commenter asked to approve this method as an alternative to EPA Method 531.1. EPA aided the development of this method, which was published in 1994 in a supplement to the eighteenth edition of Standard Methods. EPA agrees with the commenter, and will approve SM6610 for analysis of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfone, aldicarb sulfoxide, carbaryl, carbofuran, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, methomyl, and oxamyl.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Method 1613, Revision B, dioxin (EPA, 1994i)&blank;EPA was asked to replace the approved Revision A of Method 1613 with Revision B. EPA agrees with the suggestion. As with Revision A, users can greatly simplify use of Revision B of Method 1613 when only 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD) is to be determined in drinking water samples by using procedures described in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed Revision A of Method 1613 for the monitoring of several chlorinated dioxins and furans under the Clean Water Act on February 7, 1991 (56 FR 5090), and approved it only for measurement of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD under the Safe Drinking Water Act on July 17, 1992 (57 FR 31803). In response to comments on the 1991 proposal, EPA developed Revision B. The only technical changes made in Revision B that affect determination of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water matrices are (1) slight changes in performance specifications based on the compilation of data from interlaboratory and other studies, (2) additional language intended to provide analysts with increased flexibility to use liquid solid extraction procedures, and (3) further clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the documentation required when analysts employ the flexibility provided in the method to use alternate techniques not explicitly described in the method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

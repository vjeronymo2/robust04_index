			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: London Activity in the UK government bond market is likely to be subdued this week as investors wait to see whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut interest rates at or around the time of the Budget on November 30. The market is fired-up for a base rate cut following last week's encouraging economic data, in particular the small rise in inflation. This has provided Mr Clarke with a good excuse for easing monetary policy, should he need to sweeten the tax increases which are widely expected to be announced in the Budget. A good M3 figure in Germany today, and cost of living later this week, may tilt expectations even more firmly behind a UK base rate cut, as markets gear up for a drop in Germany's lending rates. There are few economic data to influence opinion in the UK this week, although on Friday the CBI produces its monthly survey of manufacturing trends. Last week, the drop in retail price inflation from 1.8 per cent in September to 1.4 per cent in October pushed gilts up about a point. Since then the market has drifted down by about 5 basis points, but it is likely to remain well supported this week, against a background of low inflation and the strong expectations for a further easing of base rates.</p>

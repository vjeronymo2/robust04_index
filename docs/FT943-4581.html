			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Technology: Designing ways with electronics - A new application that may transform an industry Etching technology is about to put new life into high-tech electronics design which might otherwise reach its limits by the end of the century. This is the view of Hewlett-Packard in Boblingen, Germany, where a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) investment is under way to make products whose computational speeds are four times higher than those available today and whose weight is more than halved. At the high-tech end of the electronics spectrum, two trends are emerging which indicate a demand for higher performances, says Manfred Buchwald, HP program manager. One is the arrival of multimedia applications where the massive volumes of computation impose a high-speed requirement. The other is a growing miniaturisation trend in telecommunications where the emphasis is on size and weight. The more sophisticated the electronics, the more components there are to be crammed into as small a space as possible on a circuit board. The limitations that Buchwald foresees, however, concern not the size of individual components but the circuitry connecting them. This also becomes more complex the more components there are. The circuitry is laid out on a stack of boards connected by electrically-conducting holes. Developed by Dyconex in Zurich, HP's electronics facility combines a new method of making the electrically-conducting holes with a new backing, or substrate, material. Instead of drilling the holes - an operation which is not practical for hole diameters of less than 200 microns because of the brittleness of drilling tools - a chemical etching process is employed. Plasma etching is already used for delicate cleaning tasks, such as the removal of fingerprints from surfaces. It uses microwaves to crack oxygen molecules in a vacuum. These attack the polyimide, reducing it to carbon dioxide and water. The process is quick, enabling all 30,000 holes on one board to be made in 15 minutes, compared with conventional mechanical drilling which takes 4 1/2 hours, according to Buchwald. The Swiss DYCOstrate technology brings other benefits. The smaller hole size permits the width of the lines and spaces to be minimised - to less than half their current width within a year, says Buchwald. More circuitry can then be crammed on to a smaller area, reducing the number of layers needed for the full circuit board, the fundamental component of electronic equipment. 'Experience so far has shown that DYCOstrate will reduce the number of layers from an average of eight-10 to two-four which will give a thinner and lighter substrate with significantly improved electrical and thermo-mechanical properties,' says Buchwald. With fewer layers, the distance between components is shorter and the connection is straighter, so that the transmission of a signal from one component to another is faster. Today, computers send signals at a rate of 100m-150m per second (their clockrate is 100-150 MHz). With DYCOstrate, Buchwald believes this will be speeded up to 400 MHz by 1996. The development time for an electronics product will also be considerably reduced as a result of DYCOstrate technology, Buchwald says, because it is easier to design for fewer layers. For a 12-layer board, it takes a computer program about two days to calculate the best possible component layout, he says. But, if the number of layers can be reduced to four, this calculation can be completed in 30-45 minutes. The result, says Buchwald, is that the overall development time of a product can be cut by one to two weeks by cutting the number of layers in the electronic boards from 12 to four. This is especially important for getting products to market on time. Items such as workstations have a sales life of only 26-30 weeks before the arrival of next-generation equipment. HP is pinning great hopes on the new DYCOstrate technology. Its success will depend on its early use in the industry and the degree to which it becomes accepted as a standard. Buchwald is optimistic. 'Within five years, 50 per cent of the Boblingen facility's output will be produced using the Swiss know-how. If not, something is wrong.' If HP's hopes are realised, DYCOstrate's Swiss inventors have a bright future. They still own the technology and will sell licences to any manufacturer wishing to buy it.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Arts: The cutting edge of jazz Who would bring crazy new music like this to the regions if the Arts Council ever dissolved the Contemporary Music Network? Could the people of Leeds reasonably expect to see American musicians blowing down the wrong end of trombones, without Arts Council funding? Is it right that Brighton be exposed to 'shifting grids of sand . . . film scores without films' at all? Winters have been warmed by the sublime and sometimes ridiculous sands of half-hinged modernists, often bringing with them to the regions lectures and workshops, courtesy of the Arts Council since 1971. But for how much longer? The Arts Council is reorganising its touring department and until hard decisions are made in March, the future of CMN beyond next year is uncertain. Drummer Bobby Previte and his Empty Suits, whose UK tour closed at The Junction in Cambridge on Sunday, are the kind of musicians whose mad, passionate work is the hallmark of a CMN programme. With scores which create a dense but ordered background to searing improvisation, this earth-moving quintet's music alternately bludgeons and caresses to bewildering effect. Two keyboards gurgle subterranean style, the icy tones of muted pocket trumpet are exchanged for valve trombone (whose operator shouts into the bell end sometimes) and the drip-drip of electric rhythm guitar explodes into wah-wah heat. Shifting from hard bop sounds to heavy rock, Previte lifting and lowering the dynamic as much by facial expression as by his playing, it is challenging and funny music. It is tight, too, and the musicians are all working hard from charts. Some of the work was commissioned for the Moscow State Circus and alludes to tangoing white rats and unsmiling clowns. Later, a metal barnstorm evolves from Ravel-inspired piano work, penny whistles confusing the atmosphere. To reduce the availability of esoteric and expensive music like Previte's (why is experimental and minimalist music usually made by large ensembles?) might seem a painless way of reducing the touring budget. But CMN is like a travelling oasis for regions starved of well-organised cutting-edge art, especially now the regional arts boards have been trimmed. To a point, London can look after itself, but what other major promoter would take Glenn Branca's Symphony No 10 for massed electric guitars to Cardiff or Bracknell, for example? The CMN spring programme continues with tours from Glenn Branca at the end of this month; London Brass at the end of March (new pieces including Michael Nyman's tribute to John Cage) and the Northern Sinfonia in May (a new cello concerto by Poul Ruders).</p>

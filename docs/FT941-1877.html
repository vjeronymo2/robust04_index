			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: RVI confident after cutting loss to FFr1.4bn Renault Vehicules Industriels, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of the French state-owned automotive group suffered a net loss of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 230m) last year compared with FFr1.62bn in 1992. The group said it hoped to halve the loss in 1994, however, and claimed that it could survive without an injection of new equity capital. When Renault's planned merger with Volvo of Sweden collapsed late last year, it was claimed that RVI would require additional capital without the support of Volvo's stronger truck operations. Mr Shemaya Levy, new RVI president, said that following the failure of the merger the group's international strategy was now focused on achieving synergies with Mack Trucks, its US subsidiary, which was expected to return to profit in 1994 after several years of losses. Renault was not discussing an alliance with Fiat of Italy, 'certainly not at the level of truck-making,' he said. RVI's consolidated turnover was virtually unchanged last year at FFr25.1bn. The group's financial fortunes differed sharply in Europe and in North America. Demand for new trucks fell sharply in west Europe last year, and RVI's turnover in Europe declined by 13 per cent, while its operating loss in the area rose to FFr699m from FFr429m a year earlier. 'We hit the bottom of the cycle in the summer of 1993, and we are now in a phase of slow, progressive recovery,' said Mr Levy. The European operation was now steadily reducing its losses. In contrast to Europe, demand for heavy trucks in the US had risen strongly. Mack turnover increased by 24 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, and halved its operating loss to Dollars 72m from a loss of Dollars 152m in 1992. Mack had broken even last month, said Mr Levy, and it would achieve a profit in the whole of 1994. Mr Levy dismissed the suggestion that Renault trucks was the weaker part of the French group and had had most to gain from the merger with Volvo and most to lose from the failure of the deal. 'We have done no worse than our European competitors,' he said. 'It is true we have not benefited like Fiat or Volvo from currency changes. But chiefly by reducing stocks we have been able to bring down our debt from FFr3.7bn at the end of 1992 to FFr3.1bn by the end of1993, and with a lower break-even point, we are well placed for the recovery.' There was no need for the capital increase that Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, his predecessor, had talked of in the context of the merger with Volvo. 'We have no handicap linked to our size,' he said. He accepted, however, that RVI needed to work hard at increasing the average 3 per cent market share it has in Europe, outside France and Spain. It had maintained its investment in research and development and had retained the intellectual property rights to its share of the work done with Volvo in developing a new medium-weight truck cab. RVI would now focus on developing new engines, and possibly suspension and brake systems, with Mack, however. It would also seek to develop a common purchasing strategy with Mack to exploit the fact that some components suppliers, such as Bosch and Michelin, had operations on both sides of the Atlantic. 'This does not exclude continued co-operation with Volvo, or others, in such areas as gearboxes, axles and transmissions,' said Mr Levy.</p>

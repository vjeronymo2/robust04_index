			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Gerry Mulligan Tentet ALL-STAR gatherings often disappoint. The idea of several 'greats' all swinging together in big bands is hard to resist and sells tickets. But the promised synergy rarely materialises, as was the case on this last star-studded night of the JVC Capital Radio Jazz Parade which featured The Gerry Mulligan Tentet and the New York Jazz Giants. Mulligan and his tentet are celebrating the legacy of the late Miles Davis and The birth of the cool sessions in particular. 'The Cool' was born in 1948 in the hot basement room of a New York Chinese laundry where arranger Gil Evans lived. He and Miles Davis were looking for a new sound which had echoes of the Claude Thornhill orchestra for which Evans then arranged and Mulligan played. Most of the ingredients for a successful rebirth were in place at the Festival Hall and Mulligan's big band is an inflated version of the Miles Davis Capitol Band which recorded in 1949/50. The tentet retains the French horn and tuba (Bill Barber was an original member) and adds a tenor. Lee Konitz sits in his old place and, in Miles' stead, for the season's live performances at least, there are the warm tones of Art Farmer. The old tunes  -'Boplicity', 'Moon Dreams' and 'Jeru' - are interspersed with favourite Mulligan and Farmer originals like 'The Flying Scotsman' and 'Blueport'. Poor sound balance which washed out the subtle orchestral colours achieved by Evans' arrangements and indifferent, sometimes sluggish playing from Konitz conspired to disappoint, however. The pleasure of hearing Mulligan's weaving and agile baritone is undiminished, especially set against his old sparring partner Art Farmer's flugelhorn. But the beauty of the short, sighing original arrangements for the ten pieces needs a separation in sound which was lacking on Saturday night and it took all of Mulligan's baritone torque to pull the ensemble along. Money might have been better spent on the recently released CD (The Rebirth of Cool, GRP Records GRD-9679) which covers the old ground in studio conditions. The New York Jazz Giants, on first, suffered a similar problem with their combination of standards and originals. Jon Faddis (trumpet), Bobby Watson (alto sax), Lew Tabackin (tenor sax) and Mulgrew Miller (piano), with a lively rhythm section, promised more than they could deliver in the face of mushy sound quality.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (6): Birds of passage - Tourists Drive into the centre of Vaduz on a normal day and you will see at least a dozen large coaches in the central parking lots and scores of tourists ambling about the town centre. Tourism, it would seem, is a brisk trade in Liechtenstein. Well, yes and no. In terms of numbers, it looks pretty impressive for a small place. Up to 150 coaches a day, 72,000 visitors a year, 150,000 bed nights. Mr Berthold Konrad, director of the tourist bureau, estimates it accounts for a tenth of the principality's economic activity. But behind those figures are some disturbing trends. The number of visitors, for example, is down from a peak of nearly 86,000 in 1985. Bed nights have fallen from 168,000 in 1985. And there would appear to be no stopping the downward trend. The problem is that Liechtenstein is so small that it does not have enough attractions for most classes of tourist today. It is not the sort of place you would take your family for a fortnight's summer holiday. While the mountainous back country is beautiful and the Swiss and Austrian Alps are nearby, it would be more sensible and probably cheaper to stay somewhere in Austria or Switzerland and make a one day excursion to Liechtenstein. Similarly, the winter sports facilities, mainly the ski resort at Malbun, are too modest to appeal to other than weekenders. The result is that the principality has increasingly become a two or three hour stop for coach tours. They come, they have lunch, they visit the prince's castle and the splendid museums, they buy some stamps and post some postcards and they leave. 'Many people who come in coaches do not even know they are in Liechtenstein,' Mr Konrad complains. Since the country has a customs union with Switzerland, there are no Liechtenstein border controls. Swiss immigration and customs officials man the border crossings with Austria. To meet the demands of those who want a visa stamp in their passports, the tourist office hires a student in summer who provides the service for SFr2. Even the principality's once lucrative stamp business is declining, as more and more children travel rather than learn their world geography through philately. The government issues only four stamps a year and pegs the prices so that children in developing countries can afford them. The tourism office tries gamely to attract new custom, always coming up with new suggestions for coach tour operators to lengthen their Liechtenstein schedules. In cooperation with hotels, it has begun to publish regional itineraries using the principality as a base, complete with detailed menus. But it seems to be rowing against the current. As he admits, there is not much night life in Vaduz. Many of the principality's visitors prefer to stay in Zurich. The hotel trade has to struggle constantly to square a vicious circle. Chronic labour shortages mean hotel operators have to import workers and pay high wages. But their room rates have to remain competitive with nearby Austrian and Swiss prices. 'I pay higher wages than Zurich hotel operators but people would not pay Zurich rates for rooms here,' one Vaduz hotel manager says. Many hotel operators have already given up, calculating that their valuable land can be put to more profitable use. The number of beds has plunged from 1,760 in 1980 to 1,400. Mr Konrad says it is difficult to mobilise popular support for the tourism industry. 'In Vaduz, they think of it as a traffic problem,' he says.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: EC-Japanese talks open on vehicle sales JAPAN and the European Commission yesterday began two days of talks on the monitoring of Japanese vehicle exports to the European Community in 1993, Reuter reports from Tokyo. An EC spokesman in Tokyo declined to comment on Japanese officials' earlier expectations that the Commission would seek a cut in Japan's vehicle exports to the Community next year from an estimated 1,185,000 in 1992 because of weak EC demand. He also declined to comment on Japanese media reports that the Commission might suggest taking into account Japanese local production in Europe when setting the monitoring target for Japanese exports. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister for international trade and industry, told a news conference that Japan intended to monitor exports only. Last April, Japan agreed to cut its new car exports to the Community over the year by about 6 per cent from 1.26m in 1991. The concept of 'monitoring' has received conflicting interpretations since a broader understanding on Japanese new car sales in the Community was reached in July last year. This agreement was intended to govern the level of direct Japanese exports to the EC until the end of 1999. The accord spelled out procedures to operate for a seven-year transition period between the creation of the EC single market from the beginning of 1993 and the throwing open of the EC market to unrestricted competition from Japanese cars. It is meant to give the European car industry time to complete painful restructuring to make it more competitive internationally. The published part of the agreement included a Japanese promise to monitor exports to the EC market as a whole in accordance with a forecast level of exports in 1999 of 1.23m (cars and light commercial vehicles) based on the assumption of demand in the EC in 1999 of 15.1m.</p>

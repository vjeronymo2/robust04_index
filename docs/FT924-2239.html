			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: David Mamet's 'Oleanna' - Theatre Even more interesting than the clash of opposites onstage in David Mamet's new play Oleanna, now playing at New York's Orpheum Theatre in a production directed by the author, are the conflicts it elicits offstage, within and between its audience members. The play is a beautifully written, elegantly constructed (save for an implausible denouement), and wholly provocative conversation piece which furthers America's national debate about sexual harassment, begun last year when then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas was accused of harassment by his former employee Anita Hill. In the brief first act, college student Carol comes to her professor's office to confess that she is floundering in his education course. John, the professor, takes her on as an educational experiment, offering her an 'A' if she will agree to one-on-one tutoring sessions. In the process of their conversation, John makes some off-colour remarks and, when Carol becomes particularly distraught, puts his hand on her shoulder. He confides in her that he is up for tenure and hoping to buy a house; the repeated phone calls from his wife and lawyer about the purchase make for a conversation full of half-sentences and interrupted thoughts - quintessential Mamet. Having set up the situation - and the audience - Mamet plays his trump card in the second act. Carol brings charges of sexual harassment against John. Unless he can persuade her to drop the case, his tenure hearing will be postponed and he will lose the house. They meet in his office twice more, the stakes rising and the gulf between their positions widening in a terrific exercise in dramatic tension, which Mamet undermines with an overwrought explosion of violence at the play's end. Did John really harass Carol, or has Carol set John up to undermine his career? Mamet left the characters' words and actions so ambiguous that it is up to each audience member to decide; differing perceptions turn casual discussions of Oleanna into confrontations. On one level Mamet is the perfect playwright for this subject matter; indeterminate language is his forte. But, given the position of women in his previous works - nonexistent, as in Glengarry Glen Ross and American Buffalo, or peripheral, as in The Water Engine and Speed-the-Plow - it is no surprise that in Oleanna he has stacked the deck against them by underwriting Carol's character. Unlike John, we are never given information as to her background, personality or motivations. This problem is exacerbated by Rebecca Pidgeon's wooden performance - for which Mamet must share blame. Presumably we are seeing what he, as director as well as writer, wants us to see: in the first act she is a lifeless, clueless, sexless creature in a shapeless sack dress who repeats 'I don't understand' with whining monotony. William H. Macy literally acts circles around her: he twitches, rants and preens all over the stage while Pidgeon sits motionless and stares stupidly at her feet. In the second act, she becomes a mannish fembot in trousers and waistcoat spouting allegiance to her 'group,' seemingly driven less by passion than programming. But Mamet's uneven treatment of the issues only strengthens his overriding point that what really matters is not who is right or wrong, but who has got the power. The closest thing this battle of a play has to a winner is not John, Carol, or the genders they represent, but the auteur himself. He is out to provoke with Oleanna, and he has done it, in spades.</p>

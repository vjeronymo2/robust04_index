This proposed action would provide an alternative treatment for grapefruit that require treatment to be moved interstate from regulated areas in Texas and California. Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before July 20, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to prevent the artificial spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas, the regulations in 7 CFR 301.64 (referred to below as the regulations) restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas in quarantined States. Quarantined States are listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;301.64(a), regulated articles are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2, and regulated areas are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;3(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined State into or through American Samoa, Arizona, California, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Louisiana, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Texas, or the U.S. Virgin Islands only if the movement is in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the regulations. Under &sect;301.64&hyph;4 of the regulations, a regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined State into or through those areas only if it is accompanied by a certificate or limited permit issued in accordance with &sect;301.64&hyph;5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in &sect;301.64&hyph;5 state, in part, that a certificate may be issued for the interstate movement of a regulated article if an inspector determines that the regulated article is free from the Mexican fruit fly, or that the premises of origin is free from the Mexican fruit fly and the regulated article has not been exposed to the pest. Regulated articles are most often certified for interstate movement in one of these ways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there are cases where a regulated article or its premises of origin cannot be determined to be free from the Mexican fruit fly. In such cases, a certificate will be issued if the regulated article is treated in accordance with &sect;301.64&hyph;10, or a limited permit may be obtained to move the regulated article interstate to receive one of the treatments specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;301.64&hyph;10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the regulations provide cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation as treatments for grapefruit  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Citrus paradisi) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , one of the regulated articles listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2. We are proposing to add a high-temperature forced air treatment to &sect;301.64&hyph;10 as an optional treatment for grapefruit. This high-temperature forced air treatment was developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an effective alternative treatment against the Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The treatment is administered in a sealed, insulated chamber on grapefruit that are at least 3.5 inches (9 centimeters) in diameter, weigh at least 9.25 ounces (262 grams), and have an initial pulp temperature of at least 77  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (25  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C). The air in the chamber is then heated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To 104  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) for 120 minutes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To 122  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (50  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) for 90 minutes; then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To 126  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (52  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C), where the temperature is maintained until the grapefruit center reaches 118  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (48  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The air may be heated in the chamber, or hot air may be introduced into the chamber. The treatment schedule includes a warning that grapefruit larger than 3.7 inches (9.5 centimeters) in diameter and 14.2 ounces (402 grams) in weight may suffer cosmetic damage as a result of this treatment because of the longer times needed to reach the required temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment to the list of approved treatments for Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 1,500 citrus grove owners and 50 shippers who would benefit by having an additional treatment option for grapefruit to be moved interstate from a regulated area. It appears unlikely that adding another treatment would increase the amount of grapefruit moved from regulated areas in Texas and California because most citrus and other regulated articles moved interstate by owners and shippers qualify for movement without requiring treatment. Treatment becomes necessary only when the regulated articles or their premises of origin cannot be certified as being free from Mexican fruit fly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

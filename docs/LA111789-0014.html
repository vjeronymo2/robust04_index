			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSCRIPTION  </P> <P> In response to "Rights Fight Memories Stirred by Monument," Part A, Nov. 3:  </P> <P> The inscription on the black granite wall of the civil rights memorial in  Montgomery, Ala., reads:  </P> <P> "Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream,"  and is attributed on the memorial to Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> This quotation is from the Hebrew Scriptures, Book of Amos, Chapter 5, Verse  24, written thousands of years ago.  </P> <P> Perhaps a credit line could be added to the wall to inform the viewing public  of the actual source of this fine inspirational thought.  </P> <P> WILLIAM SHINDERMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

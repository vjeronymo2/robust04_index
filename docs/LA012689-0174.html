			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR SELECTED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Irvine city officials announced Wednesday that Robert C. Johnson of Arizona has  been appointed to the position of director of community development.  </P> <P> Johnson resigned as director of planning and development services for Pima  County, Ariz., to take the Irvine position, which has been vacant since  February of 1988. Johnson's annual salary will be $70,000.  </P> <P> "It is one of the top planning programs in the country," Johnson said, calling  it a fantastic opportunity.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran said the post, which is the third highest city-management  position, was filled after two national searches. Agran said Johnson was  selected from a pool of about 70 applicants.  </P> <P> "It was immediately clear to me that he has excellent credentials that match  our city and its aspirations," Agran said. "I think that the job was especially  attractive to him because it would afford him the opportunity to work in a  university community."  </P> <P> Johnson, who holds a doctorate in watershed management from the University of  Arizona at Tucson, will be responsible for overseeing some five divisions  within the department. His main responsibilities will concern the city's  General Plan, zoning and open space management, officials said.  </P> <P> Johnson's department has an operating budget of about $7 million. He will  assume the office Feb. 27.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of interview with Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of </F> the National Bank of Yugoslavia, by Jasna Kesic; place and date  not given: "Monetary Projection Is a Devilish Thing"]    [Text] Very little is known about the monetary policy being  conducted by the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia] these past  months. Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, professor, has now been  governor of the NBJ for two-and-a-half months, but it is  difficult to escape the impression that during the whole time he  has been much more concerned with carrying out the economic  program than with his job as governor. That is why we asked him  at the outset whether a projection of monetary policy had been  adopted for the second quarter of this year, since half of that  period has already passed.    "Let me say first that it is true that I have been involved  with all kinds of things, but my legal responsibility is here in  the NBJ, and any careful newspaper reader will see that I am  very much involved in credit policy, in foreign-exchange policy,  and so on. There are certain matters that I cannot fail to be  involved with in the light of earlier history, and all those  issues are related. You cannot examine credit policy without  looking at budget policy, since these are two conflicting  requirements," Dr. Avramovic explained.    "As for the projection of monetary policy, it was made last  Tuesday evening in the federal government, but I am not at all  enthusiastic about any projections. Monetary projection is a  devilish thing, it depends on the rate of circulation of the  money, and no one knows what the rate of circulation is.  Accordingly, decisions on this have to be made from week to  week, since our total supply of money in circulation is only 7  to 8 percent of the national income. That is about 1,200,000,000  dinars, of which about 360,000,000 have gone to the state to  cover the budget deficit, about 300 million to buy foreign  exchange, and all the rest to the economy."    [Kesic] Can this monetary policy which you are conducting be  called "restrictive"?    [Avramovic] I have tried not to make it restrictive for the  economy. We have managed to drop the interest rate from 30  percent at the beginning of the program's implementation to 9  percent. We will be restrictive when it comes to granting loans  to the state, but monetary policy will be absolutely open when  it comes to granting loans to the economy.    [Kesic] You announced that beginning in July the NBJ will no  longer use primary note issue for credit to finance the deficits  in the federal and two republic budgets.    [Avramovic] There is no primary issue for the state any  more!  Budgets will be replenished by borrowing on the capital market,  but those amounts will be relatively modest. We want to put the  state on notice that the NBJ cannot be its permanent banker. We  have asked government bodies and agencies to prepare their  projections for May, June, and July, and then we will see how to  cover those deficits which they have, especially with respect to  using commodity reserves. We are not going to kill the state, it  is not a question of that, but it is a question of general  priorities. I think that our credit policy should bring about a  growth of production of 30 to 40 percent, and that will provide  a solution to the budget problem, since fiscal revenues will  increase 30 to 40 percent. That is the best way of replenishing  the budget, not through direct deficit financing.    [Kesic] How independent is the NBJ in conducting monetary  policy, especially when we know that the Serbian finance  minister is a member of the bank's board?    [Avramovic] O.K., those are now new things which have come  about. The most recent appointments in Serbia have altered  relations on the board. It is obvious that now we must think  about what we are going to do here next. But so far I have not  had problems when it comes to the independence of the NBJ.    [Kesic] Is the NBJ board, which conducted monetary policy at  the time when we had the highest inflation in the world, at all  capable of conducting a policy of a stable exchange rate of the  dinar?    [Avramovic] That is a hypothetical question. They were not  the only people making decisions about monetary policy, there  were general circumstances which brought that about. And you  will understand me if I do not answer your question now. I can  only say that Avramovic is independent in conducting monetary  policy and that the NBJ is independent.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: In memoriam . . . - Claire Frankel visits the Holocaust museum AT Washington's new Holocaust Memorial Museum I punched in my statistics for a folded and numbered identity card like those the Jews had to carry. It read 'Amalie Petranker, born 1930, Stanislawow, Poland: my two sisters and I often attend Jewish community events, despite the undercurrent of tension in Stanislawow. On Sundays, people would even throw stones at us as they go to church.' Amalie - my age and gender - became my emotional companion as I walked through the exhibition, her life updated at various computer terminals. The identity card brought the unimaginable - 11m dead - down to a personal level. I had not been impressed with the idea of a holocaust museum in America. It felt wrong because the Holocaust did not happen there and a museum would surely be more appropriately located in Europe or Israel. Other Americans disagreed, arguing that many survivors live there; that American troops liberated some of the death camps; that racial and ethnic prejudices are also pretty strong in some parts of the US. And there was the unanswerable fact that in no other country could the required Dollars 168m to build and equip the museum have been raised privately. The two-acre site was given by the federal government. Washington, national repository of monuments and museums with tourists to match, is ideal. The exhibition starts at the fourth floor and winds down. The visitor is hit at the beginning with a massive photograph of American soldiers, frozen in shock, staring at a pile of still-smouldering corpses at the Ohrdruf camp in Germany. The story of the SS St Louis, its fleeing European Jews not allowed to disembark in Florida, is extensively portrayed. Allied aerial photographs of Auschwitz challenge the then US government's claim that it could not be bombed. A children's Wall of Remembrance features tiles handpainted by American schoolchildren giving their views of the Holocaust. So why invest in a museum now? l can only answer, nearly 50 years later, if not now, when? Many things set this museum apart. Its 'philosophical rationale', stated in the 1979 Report of the President's Commission, was that we have a moral obligation to remember this unique horror and to study 'the diseases particular to the 20th century which led to this monstrous aberration'. It deals, uniquely with sanctioned, premeditated death, giving over the top floor for study with a 20,000-volume library, photo, film and video archives and a registry of Jewish Holocaust survivors. A learning centre and a teachers resource centre are part of the on-going, mandatory educational programme. The architect, James Inga Freed of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, NY, fled Germany at the age of nine and travelled back to the concentration camps and ghettoes for inspiration. He has incorporated some of his strongest memories into architectural metaphors. Guard towers clearly visible from the street evoke Auschwitz; heavy steel bands are reminiscent of those reinforcing the brick of the crematoria; bridges are uncomfortably glass-floored and sided with silk-screened names of obliterated victims; stairs narrow as in the perspective of rails leading to an arch reminiscent of the entrance to Birkenau; an illuminated glass fissure juts across the Hall of Witness like an earthquake. It is not a comfortable, smooth building - purposely not. At the same time, it is not kitsch either. Freed's reluctance to discuss the imagery has to do with his wish for each visitor to see and take away personal impressions. 'The building must disturb as well as invite', says Freed. It confronts. It triggers an empathetic response. Memorial also comforts. The six-sided Hall of Remembrance in the forecourt, with its clear iconography, is at the end of the tour a place for rest, contemplation, perhaps prayer. The need to personalise has been met with stunning artifacts. You walk on paving stones from the Warsaw ghetto, through one of the transporting boxcars, across a bridge from the Lodz' ghetto which separated the 'contaminating' Jews from other people. You sit and listen to survivors talk about a day in Auschwitz, adjoining a barracks complete with original bunks. Particularly memorable is a three-storey room, entirely covered with 1500 photographs collected by a survivor of the Polish village of Ejszyszki, founded in the 11th century. It was entirely wiped out in two killing days by the Nazis in 1941. The faces are ordinary, of people living in a community, feeding chickens, getting married, having a picnic. When I left the museum, I punched in my ID. Amalie Pertranka died in Treblinka concentration camp in 1943.</p>

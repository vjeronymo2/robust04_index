			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dutch bank turns in flat performance for year RABOBANK reported virtually flat net profits for 1992, but the Dutch co-operative bank said it was satisfied with its performance considering the difficult conditions it faced last year. Net profit was little changed at Fl 1.02bn (Dollars 550m), compared with Fl 1.01bn a year earlier, in spite of what the bank described as a 'remarkable' expansion of lending at a time of economic slowdown. Total outstanding loans to the private sector were up 7 per cent last year at Fl 147.3bn. Gross profits rose by 5.6 per cent to Fl 2.3bn. However, risk provisions were raised by 7 per cent in line with the increase in lending, while taxes jumped by almost 13 per cent, leaving net profit steady on the previous year. Rabobank said it faced a persistently inverted yield curve and fierce competition, both of which drove up costs. Total income, which includes interest, commission and other types of income, expanded by 7.5 per cent to Fl 7.06bn but costs rose even faster, increasing by 8.4 per cent to Fl 4.75bn. Rabobank, the first of the big Dutch banks to release 1992 figures, said income in 1993 will show a reduced rate of increase, reflecting expectations of only marginal growth in the Dutch economy.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / South Korea and Vietnam establish diplomatic LINKS THE establishment of diplomatic relations yesterday between Seoul and Hanoi removes the main obstacle to expanding Korean investment in Vietnam, writes John Burton in Seoul. Vietnam is the last country with which South Korea has forged ties as part of President Roh Tae-woo's policy to normalise relations with current and former socialist nations. South Korea had delayed establishing formal relations with Vietnam in deference to US wishes that the issue of missing American soldiers during the Vietnam war be resolved. More than 310,000 South Korean troops were involved in the war against Hanoi. Seoul, however, has allowed Korean companies to make limited investments in Vietnam. There are more than 30 Korean concerns with branch offices in Vietnam. Authorised Korean investments totalled Dollars 84.4m (Pounds 55.5m), making South Korea Vietnam's seventh-largest foreign investor. Trade has also expanded from Dollars 77m in 1988 to more than Dollars 440m this year, making Vietnam Korea's third largest trading partner in the former socialist bloc after China and Russia. The trade surplus is heavily in Korea's favour. Analysts believe that Vietnam will compete against Indonesia and Thailand for Korean investment in south-east Asia in the next few years. 'We prefer to invest in countries, such as Vietnam and Myanmar (Burma) in south-east Asia, where the Japanese are not dominant,' explained Mr Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics. Medium-sized Korean textile and toy producers have so far been among the biggest investors in Vietnam. Korea's leading industrial groups are awaiting the lifting of US economic sanctions against Vietnam, which will permit international financial institutions such as the World Bank to provide credit for infrastructure projects. All of Korea's big construction companies are seeking contracts to build or repair roads and port facilities.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Doubts rise over enhanced scrips - Their prospects following the ASH debacle THE furore over Automated Security's profit warning and enhanced scrip dividend, which led to de Zoete &amp; Bevan, its joint broker, resigning in high dudgeon last Friday, has reinforced doubts about the whole notion of enhanced scrips. When these beasts first arrived in the corporate finance menagerie in March  -invented by BZW, de Zoete &amp; Bevan's parent - they were seen as a clever way for companies with surplus advance corporation tax to cut their tax bill. At first it was suggested that enhanced scrips would be offered by only a few companies which were suffering surplus ACT because they derived a large part of their profits from outside the UK, and probably only on one occasion. But the list of companies offering these devices has lengthened, and some have come back with a second issue. Enhanced scrips offer shareholders a dividend in shares at a rate 50 per cent higher than the cash value of the payment. Share dividends do not attract ACT, while cash dividends do. If investors take up the enhanced scrip, the company saves ACT and retains the cash that would otherwise be paid in dividend. Investors getting a higher dividend were reckoned to be happy too. Non-taxpaying investors cannot reclaim tax on an enhanced scrip, but the higher payout more than compensates them. Take-up rates for enhanced scrips have been high, often 90 per cent or more. But some investors fear companies will repeatedly offer enhanced scrips, which in effect become a rolling rights issue - the company is raising money by issuing shares. Yet the safeguards demanded by the Stock Exchange for rights issues - in terms of the information required in a rights-issue document, such as working capital and current trading statements - do not apply to enhanced scrips. The level of due diligence carried out by the advisers is far lower, even though the risk period is longer. Rights issues typically take three weeks from announcement to completion, while ASH's enhanced scrip was announced in mid-July and will be completed today. Bankers respond that the same safeguards need not apply, because enhanced scrips increase a company's share capital by perhaps 3 or 4 per cent, compared with a rights issue which might expand the equity base by a quarter or a third. Further, some companies which have offered enhanced scrips seem to be using them not to get round a structural tax problem but as an alternative to cutting a dividend which they have not got the cash to pay. But the result is they have yet more shares on which to pay dividends. Forte, the hotel group, combined a cut dividend with an enhanced scrip. Lucas Industries, which announced an enhanced scrip on Monday with its annual results, would have had to pay a cash dividend from reserves. So what went wrong with ASH's enhanced scrip? Essentially, Friday's profit warning drove down ASH's share price, putting the company in the position of issuing shares at a price far out of line with the market price. Worse, from BZW's viewpoint, the broker had sold some of the new shares to its clients only days before the warning. In enhanced scrips, shareholders are not just offered the choice of a cash dividend or a larger share dividend. They have a further option to take the dividend in shares, but then sell the new shares, getting at least a guaranteed price through an underwriting arrangement with the company's broker. In ASH's case BZW underwrote the new shares at a price of 95 per cent of the reference price, the price used to calculate the number of shares to be issued to meet the dividend payment. With hindsight, this underwriting price might have been a warning. When enhanced scrips were invented, the underwriting price was typically set at 95 per cent of the reference price. But this discount rapidly attracted competition from other houses, led by Swiss Bank Corporation, willing to underwrite closer to the reference price. Now houses bid for the underwriting and the guaranteed price can be as high as 99 per cent of the reference price. Further, houses attempt to sell the shares above the underwriting price through an auction, giving the selling shareholders 'best execution' and cutting the profit which the brokers could make on the underwriting. It was not till Thursday last week that ASH told BZW it was concerned about some of the numbers it was seeing when collecting figures for its third quarter results, which were published yesterday. BZW advised ASH to make a trading statement, which ASH did on Friday morning, and also to either cancel or adjust the price for the enhanced scrip. ASH refused to do the latter within the time limit BZW had set, leading the broker to resign. The question of enhanced scrips may vanish after the next month's Budget. This is expected to clarify a proposal in the spring Budget for a system of paying ACT-free dividends from foreign income. If the main structural problem causing surplus ACT is ironed out by the budget, companies which persist with enhanced scrips thereafter would be exposed as using them for other reasons. These may be the dubious ones that their dividends have not stayed in line with the profits available to pay for them, in which case a dividend cut rather than an enhanced scrip is the answer. Investors would look closely at a company's motives for offering an enhanced scrip before accepting, and the animal may die a natural death.</p>

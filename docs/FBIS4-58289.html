			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 Apr (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper says the  purpose of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the  Russian capital Moscow this week was to express Israel's wish to  end practically a long-running estrangement with Russia,  inheritor of the former Soviet Union. It adds that the visit  also carries an implicit message, addressed to the Syrians and  Palestinians in particular, that Israel can compete for their  strategic ally if it wishes.    In Saturday's editorial, AL-AHRAM says during his visit  Rabin  convinced the Russians to agree to mediate with Syria on  searching for missing Israelis from previous wars. In addition  there are reports that Russian officials have promised Rabin  that, for the time being, they will refrain from selling any  advanced aircraft to Syria. The editorial, however, doubts that  Russia will honor its promise because of its economic situation,  which makes it willing to sell weapons to any buyer.    The paper expresses its belief that, despite several  technical agreements signed between the two countries, there are  factors that will limit the advancement of Russian-Israeli  relations and their talks on cooperation in the armament sector.    AL-AHRAM notes that current Russian policy has revised its  retreat from and strong stands against Arab causes that were  adopted at the end of Gorbachev's term and right after the  Soviet Union's collapse. Furthermore, the paper says, Israel  has no major interest in having Russia participate forcefully in  the region's peace process.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1521 GMT on 1 February carries a  "Path to Accord" program, which examines the continuing problem  of ensuring the return of people displaced by the conflict  between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the first 11 minutes  of the program, the announcer interviews ordinary people on both  sides of the conflict, some of them refugees. The program then  shows alternating excerpts of separate interviews with North  Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and President of Ingushetia  Ruslan Aushev.    In his interview, Galazov denies that any interethnic  conflict has occurred in North Ossetia, saying that what  happened was "an aggression by Ingush national extremists."  Aushev says on this topic: "The motives behind this conflict  were to push out the Ingush, carry out ethnic cleansing, then to  declare that coexistence was impossible, and then to play at  these lengthy negotiations."    Galazov says: "North Ossetia is, essentially, the only  republic, not just in the North Caucasus but in the Caucasus as  a whole, to which so-called Russian-speaking people flee. Today  we have approximately 50,000 refugees. These are refugees from  Georgia, from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Abkhazia, Chechnya, and  Ingushetia, and this fact alone probably says much." Aushev says  that but for the housing problem the influx of Russian-speaking  refugees into his republic would be more intensive. He claims  that Ingushetia has done more for its ethnic minorities than  Ossetia, for instance by guaranteeing them a set number of seats  in parliament.    Asked if he regards the tens of thousands of Ingush refugees  who fled from North Ossetia to Ingushetia as citizens of his  republic, Galazov disputes the numbers and questions whether all  of them were refugees, adding: "I believe that the Kislovodsk  agreement is a very reasonable agreement and it should be  implemented in full. There must be an investigation into who  was not involved in the bloody tragedy which was committed on  the territory of North Ossetia. After all, no one even fired  from a toy catapult on the territory of the Ingush Republic.  The tragedy occurred on the territory of North Ossetia and the  North Ossetian side, that is the leadership and public  organizations and movements can bear no responsibility  whatsoever for what occurred."    On the question of whether the two peoples could live  together, Aushev says: "Whoever does not wish to live with the  Ingush is free to leave. All the more so, since they have been  living in other people's houses since 1944. According to  highland customs, they should really have long since asked  forgiveness of the Ingush for moving into their homes and should  have left, as was done in Georgia, Dagestan, and Stavropol Kray."    Asked about the idea of joint ownership of the disputed  territory, Galazov says that he finds such attempts to resolve  the problem at a stroke "unacceptable," and adds: "In actual  fact there is no disputed territory in North Ossetia.  Prigorodnyy Rayon, like all the other rayons of North Ossetia,  is an integral part of the Republic of North Ossetia. And  according to the constitution of the Russian Federation and our  constitution, the whole territory of North Ossetia is at the  disposal of the multinational people of that republic alone.  Neither the president nor the Supreme Soviet [as heard] has the  right to do anything with this territory. And I would ask both  the leadership of the Russian Federation, and moreover the  leadership of the Ingush Republic, to stop conducting  experiments."    Aushev says that his attitude to people's ideas is positive  "as long as they produce results" and adds: "I believe that at  this stage we should not be talking about new formulae. The  first stage should be a stage of people returning to their homes  and a stabilization of the situation to the level of October  1992."    Galazov says: "The impossibility of the coexistence of  Ingush, Ossetians, and representatives of other nationalities is  not an Ossetian nor a Russian invention. This is something  which people of Ingush nationality have proved in practice." On  this same subject, Aushev says: "This is a fascist slogan. How  can one speak of the impossibility of one living with another?"    In conclusion, Galazov says: "All conflicts on this planet  will sooner or later be resolved peacefully. There is no other  way. But I believe that events should not be hastened because  any use of force, any attempt to settle the problem immediately  will result in more tragedy, will result in more bloodshed and  human victims."    Aushev concludes: "In order to emerge from this conflict we  need to live strictly according to the law and to the  constitution and to observe human rights."    Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the Interim Administration on the  territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, rounds up the  program by saying that the only way to settle the conflict and  reconcile people is by political methods. He adds: "I believe  the main thing today is for the leaders of these two republics  to sit down at the negotiating table and work out there what  each side should do, not only to extinguish but also to settle  the conflict and to begin returning people to their previous  homes."</p>

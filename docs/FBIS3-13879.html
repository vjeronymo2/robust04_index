			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat: "Is This the End?"] </F>   [Excerpts] Following the failure of Palestinian-U.S. talks  and the success of Israeli-U.S. talks it has become obvious to  everyone that the U.S. Administration is continuing to pressure  the Palestinian side in particular, and the Arab parties in  general, in a bid to renew the talks as if nothing has happened.  [passage omitted]    It has been proven to the world that the concept of security  for the Palestinians in the occupied territories must be the  basis of negotiations if they are to succeed. It has also been  proven that settlements are time bombs and a source of threat to  any future peace agreement. Hence, the call to dismantle the  settlements and place the entire settlement issue on the talks'  agenda.    We say that it has been proven to the world that these facts  are known not only to the Palestinians but to anyone who has  even a superficial knowledge of the situation on the ground.  After this convincing evidence to the world and the U.S.  Administration's continued behavior as if nothing has happened,  the outcome is that the peace process cannot continue in its  present form.    If the PLO insists that the peace process in its present  form  has reached a dead end, and if Israel and the United States  insist on continuing the peace process, the logical conclusion  is that the peace process has practically ended.    Israel and the United States are trying to seek ways out,  but  plainly solutions are needed. What would have happened if the  PLO had an armed security presence in Gaza and Jericho when the  Hebron massacre occurred?    The thought of this or other scenarios, such as whether the  Palestinian security forces would have participated in the  protests, tried to control the protests, or refrained from doing  anything, can lead to destructive results. Settlements are not  only a huge obstacle to peace, but easily detonated land mines  planted between every inch of the same land on which peace must  prevail.    If the present situation continues, the end of the peace  process will have immense and grave repercussions not only among  Palestinians but also in the region as a whole. And if the  United States keeps exerting direct and indirect pressure on the  Palestinian leadership in a bid to renew the talks for the sake  of talks, the results of this pressure will have destructive  effects on the peace process.    The statement by President 'Arafat to NEWSWEEK to the effect  that the Palestinian people will not accept to continue the  talks in the form that existed before the massacre is best proof  that the crisis has gone beyond the stage of pressure. It is  inconceivable for anyone to expect the Palestinian leadership to  lose the support and backing of its people and also lose the  chance of making a genuine peace. The U.S. and Israeli  leaderships must examine for the fourth, fifth, and tenth time  the Palestinian demands presented to them on Friday morning, 25  February 1994.</p>

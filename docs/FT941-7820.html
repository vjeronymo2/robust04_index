			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Companies switch production Du Pont opened the first large-scale CFC production site in 1931 at Deepwater, New Jersey. When it closed, 60 years later, it was the world's biggest CFC plant. The shutdown was part of a worldwide reduction in CFC manufacturing as makers of refrigerators and air conditioning systems switched over to the ozone-friendlier HFCs. Industry estimates suggest CFC capacity in the mid-1980s was about 1.2m tonnes a year. Now, it is one third that level. Du Pont is nevertheless still one of the world's biggest CFC manufacturers. Other makers include the UK's ICI, France's Elf Atochem, Allied Signal and LaRoche of the US, and Akzo of the Netherlands. Some of these companies are switching rapidly to the production of HFCs, though as a greenhouse gas, HFC may have production ceilings progressively imposed. HFC capacity has risen from practically zero four years ago to close to 100,000 tonnes a year now.</p>

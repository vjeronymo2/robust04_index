			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Administration costs push ML Laboratories into red ML Laboratories, one of the larger start-up healthcare companies quoted in London, saw a sharp rise in costs in the first half of 1994 as it moved towards marketing its first product, Icodial, a kidney failure treatment. Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 1.4m in the six months to March 1994, from Pounds 894,742 a year earlier, pushing the company to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 953,047, compared with a profit of Pounds 65,089. Sales fell from Pounds 467,242 to Pounds 385,851 because of deferred royalty receipts. Pre-tax profit was also affected by a fall in investment income from Pounds 737,792 to Pounds 339,551 as the company ran down its cash pile to pay for the increased administrative costs. The company ended the period with Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 14.8m) on deposit. Losses per share were 0.7p, against earnings last time of 0.1p. Icodial was launched in the UK last month. Mr Stuart Sim, finance director, said there would be no significant sales until the next financial year. The company is in talks concerning a detailed marketing agreement with Fresenius, the German specialist in dialysis. In March, an interim arrangement gave Fresenius exclusive rights to sell Icodial in all markets apart from Japan. ML Laboratories was floated on the Third Market in 1987, and moved to the USM in 1990. COMMENT ML Laboratories is either wildly overvalued or one of the most extraordinary bargains on the London Stock Exchange. If its drug is a success, it should take a huge slice out of a Pounds 500m-a-year market and make its current market capitalisation of almost Pounds 300m look puny. Failure means a return to obscurity. The bull story is that ML Labs now has a product on the market, which means that two of the biggest risks - scientific and regulatory - have been overcome. The third risk is marketing, which is being addressed by the deal and continuing talks with Fresenius. Finally, can the entrepreneurs that launched a small company take the business into world market? The details of the Fresenius deal should not only sort out any lingering doubts over marketing, but demonstrate whether top management has the skills to fight it out at the highest level.</p>

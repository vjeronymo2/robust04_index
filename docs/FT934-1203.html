			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Clinton plea over Libyan dissident President Bill Clinton has issued a personal appeal to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on behalf of Mr Mansour Kikhia, a former Libyan foreign minister and prominent opponent of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime who disappeared mysteriously in Cairo 10 days ago. US officials said yesterday they were 'very concerned' about the fate of Mr Kikhia, who Libyan opposition groups claim was abducted by Libyan agents soon after arriving in Cairo to attend a human rights meeting. His disappearance coincided with a call by Libya's 'basic popular committees' in Tripoli to 'crush traitors and spies' and followed a speech in November by Col Gadaffi during which he said opponents of his regime who had 'escaped to America' deserved 'slaughter'. Mr Kikhia, who came to Cairo from his home in the US, heads an umbrella group of four anti-Gadaffi opposition factions. Mr Kikhia's disappearance is a profound embarrassment to the Egyptian government, which says it is doing everything to discover his whereabouts. Yesterday, Mr Osama el-Baz, Mr Mubarak's senior political adviser, travelled unexpectedly to Tripoli, apparently to discuss the missing former minister. According to Mr Henry Schuler, Libya specialist at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies who says he is a close friend of Mr Kikhia, the former Libyan minister was given personal assurances from senior Egyptians for his security in Cairo before leaving for Egypt. Mr Kikhia's case, which was also raised last week by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, in a message to the Egyptian authorities, has raised serious concern among western governments that Col Gadaffi may have abandoned any attempts to curry favour in the west and is intent instead on reviving his self-appointed role as a maverick and dangerous nuisance. 'If it is proven that Mr Kikhia has been abducted, it would be a very serious change in policy,' said one western diplomat. Col Gadaffi has raised his anti-western rhetoric considerably since the UN voted to toughen sanctions against Libya on December 1 for its continued refusal to hand over two agents suspected of planting the bomb which destroyed PanAm 103 over Lockerbie five years ago this week. Libyan television on Sunday broadcast speeches by Col Gadaffi in which he said he would 'feed the fish of the Mediterranean on the white flesh of Britons, Americans and Frenchmen'. He also said: 'We have waved the olive branch for two years, we have accepted mediation, we have told them (the west) that we want peace, but these arrogant people have replied by reinforcing sanctions.' Earlier this month, Col Gadaffi also invited radical groups, including members of the Irish Republican Army, and Palestinian groups associated with bombings and hijackings, to Tripoli, in outright defiance of UN resolutions ordering the Libyan regime to renounce any links with international terrorism. Intense US interest in Mr Kikhia's case stems in part from concern over this apparent shift of policy. However, it also derives from the fact that he holds a US work permit, runs a business in Missouri and has an American wife, who wrote to President Clinton immediately after his disappearance.</p>

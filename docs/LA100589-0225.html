HARRAH'S WILL HELP  </P> <P> Harrah's will become Nevada's first hotel-casino to help compulsive gamblers  break the habit that enriches gaming halls but destroys lives.  </P> <P> The hotel-casino said it will donate $250 a month for the next year to operate  a hot line for addicted gamblers.  </P> <P> William Sherman, the resort's attorney, said signs soon will be posted telling  customers and employees where to call for help. The hot line will be operated  by the Nevada Council on Compulsive Gambling and could go into operation as  early as Friday.  </P> <P> Signs listing a telephone number to help addicted gamblers have been posted in  Atlantic City's 12 casinos since 1987. But casinos in Nevada have ignored the  problem of compulsive gamblers.  </P> <P> In Nevada, the Harrah's corporation owns Harrah's Reno, Harrah's Lake Tahoe,  Bill's Lake Tahoe Casino, the Holiday Casino in Las Vegas and Harrah's Del Rio  in Laughlin.  </P></p>

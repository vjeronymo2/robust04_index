In the first letter, sent to leaders in the United States,  Britain, France and Germany, Yeltsin alleged that the Western  powers had sidestepped the UN and had gone against the  Partnership for Peace accord between East and West in issuing an  ultimatum in Bosnia.    The second letter was of a very different nature,  well-informed sources said, briefing Ciampi on the Bosnian  Serbs' agreement to accept Russian mediation, and to withdraw  heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone.    Confirmation that the Bosnian Serbs had begun moving their  arms came both from commanders on the ground in Bosnia, from a  spokesman at UN headquarters in New York and from southern  European NATO command in Naples, where CIC Admiral Mike Boorda  described Thursday as "very positive."    His deputy, General Antonio Milani was more cautious,  telling  the press "the pictures we see on television, of children  playing in Sarajevo, are encouraging, as is the news that first  positions are being evacuated and the first arms handed over...  But this does not complete the mandate we have been given."    "It could prove that by Sunday night all sides will be  satisfied," he added. "A first step has now been taken."    Boorda's close aide Captain Trevor Murray told journalists  of  the careful attack plans laid over weeks of gruelling double  shifts, but was prepared to admit that bombarding Serb positions  would not be the ideal solution for the conflict in the former  Yugoslav country: "no one is kidding themselves that they can  solve Bosnia's problems with bombardments. We all know that  this is a very complicated situation."    While launching raids on Bosnia would be tricky, he added,  "a  mission in Bosnia would be considered much less risky than the  war in Iraq."    Some 100 fighter-bombers and 80 support aircraft are  standing  by in bases on Italian territory, ready to take off for Bosnia  should the need arise. More planes are on the alert aboard  three aircraft carriers -- the French Foch, the British Ark  Royal and the U.S. Saratoga -- in the Mediterranean.    A meeting of foreign ministers from France, the United  States, Britain, and the Netherlands will take place Sunday  evening in the Aviano U.S. airforce base in eastern Italy from  the Operation Deny Flight is coordinated.    On a five-day visit to Rome, Serbian opposition leader Vuk  Draskovic welcomed the Russian moves to avoid air strikes and  predicted Thursday that the Bosnian Serbs would respect the  ultimatum. "I cannot believe that (Bosnian Serb leader Radovan)  Karadzic would be so crazy as to not respond positively to these  requests," Draskovic said at a press conference in the Italian  capital.    Commenting on Russia's reluctance to back airstrikes, the  Serb opposition chief said he could understand Moscow's  resentment over the way that NATO has taken the UN's policing  work upon itself: "Russia is a great power and NATO's biggest  mistake has been to exclude Moscow from the peace process."    With the truce holding on the ground around Sarajevo, more  wounded were flown out of the Bosnian capital to Falconara  airport in eastern Italy. A first load of 12 wounded and their  helpers was followed later in the day by 14 more, to be  distributed around hospitals in Italy, Spain, the United Arab  Emirates, Austria and the United States.    In this evening's cabinet meeting in Rome, Social Affairs  Minister Fernanda Contri briefed ministers on her recent visit  to Sarajevo and told them of an accord with her Bosnian  counterpart for humanitarian aid convoys for children of all  religions and ethnic groups all over the beleaguered country.  Croatia's social affairs department has also agreed, she said,  to allow the convoys to set out from the port of Split for  Mostar and Sarajevo.</p>

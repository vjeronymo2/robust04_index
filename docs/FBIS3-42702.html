			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Margarita Petrova, Associate of </F> Rosgidromettsentr: "White Snows Are Coming"]    [Text]  <H5>  Forecast for the Month </H5>   Over a large part of the territory of Russia the circulation  features of February and the climatic descriptions are extremely  similar to those of January.    During February low pressure system activity in the  atmosphere is most intensive on the European territory of  Russia, in the southern regions of Western Siberia, and in the  eastern outskirts of the country. Almost the same as in January,  there will be strong winds and snowstorms. The high pressure  system will remain, encompassing the central regions of Eastern  Siberia and, to a considerable degree, the Far East. This month  will be changeable. The sun is already warming the earth on  calm, clear days in the southern part, but there is still severe  freezing and snowstorms.    What is February expected to be like when it comes into its  own?    In the Central and Central-Chernozem regions the monthly air  temperature is expected to be close to the many-year average  (norm), and in the Central-Chernozem region--1-2 degrees above  the norm, and it is expected to be in the range of minus 5-12.  The prevailing temperature at night will be minus 5-10 and  during the day--0 to minus 5. During certain periods of the  first and second 10-day periods during the night hours the  freezing will go down to 20-25 degrees. The weather will be  mainly dry and sunny with few clouds.    In the Northwestern region the average monthly temperature  will be close to normal: minus 7-9. The prevailing temperature  will be 5-10 degrees below zero, and during the day--from minus  2 to plus 3. But 20 degrees below during the night hours during  the first half of the month is also quite probable. There will  be snow, blizzards, and severe winds up to 15-20 meters per  second at the beginning and at the end of the month.    In the Northern region the average monthly temperature will  be 1-2 degrees below normal: minus 12-18. At night it will be  15-20 degrees below zero and during the day--8-13 degrees below  zero, but on certain nights during the first and second 10-day  periods the temperature will go down to 25-30 degrees. At times  there will be snow, blizzards, and individual strong winds up to  25-30 meters per second.    In the Volga-Vyatka region and Central Volga area the  average  monthly temperature will be 1-2 degrees above normal, and in the  north of Volga-Vyatka region--about normal: minus 7-13. The  freezing at night will go down to 13-18, and during the  day--7-12. Hard freezing at night down to 20-25 (in the northern  part of Volga-Vyatka region--down to 30) and during the day down  to 17-22 degrees may occur during certain parts of the first and  second 10-day periods. Snow, blizzards, and strong winds are  most probable at the beginning and end of the month.    In the North Caucasus and Lower Volga area the average  monthly temperature will be 2 degrees above normal: zero to  minus 5. At night it will be 3-8 degrees and during the  day--plus 1-5. At the same time one cannot rule out the  possibility of more severe freezing--down to 13-18 degrees.  Precipitation in the form of rain and wet snow will amount to  15-30 mm and, most likely, it will be during the first 10-day  period and at the end of the month. There will be infrequent  strong winds up to 15-20 meters per second.    In the Ural region and Western Siberia the average monthly  temperature in northern regions will be 1-2 degrees below normal  and amount to minus 20-25, and in the southern regions--1-2  degrees above normal: minus 12-17. In the northern regions at  night it will be 22-27, and during the day--12-17, but on  certain nights of the first 10-day period it will be 35 (in the  south--down to 25-30) degrees. In the southern regions mainly at  night it will be 15-20 and during the day 8-13 degrees. Snow,  blizzards, and strong winds are most probable during the second  and third 10-day periods.    In Eastern Siberia the average monthly temperature in the  northern half of the territory will be close to normal: 23-30  degrees, and the southern half--1-2 degrees above normal, and  will amount to 15-22 degrees. The most severe freezing will come  at about the middle of the month when the mercury will dip at  night in the north to minus 38-43, and in the south--to minus  28-33; the rest of the time in the northern half the freezing  will go down to 25-30 at night and during the day--15-20, and in  the southern half at night--15-20, and during the day 8-13  degrees. It will be slightly cloudy, sunny, and there will be a  little bit of snow only during certain periods.    In the Far East the average monthly air temperature will be  close to normal, and only in Magadan Oblast will it be 1 degree  lower. In the southern regions at night it will go down to 15-20  degrees below zero, during the day--8-13, and in the southern  regions at night 20-25, and during the day 13-18, but at the  beginning and about the middle of the month it is possible that  the temperature will drop by 7-10 degrees. Snow and blizzards  are most probable at the end of the first 10-day period and  about the middle of the third 10-day period.  <H5>  ...and for Today </H5>   According to information from Rosgidromettsentr, a cold low  pressure system began its path in the south through the European  part of the country. Following it will be freezing weather in  the majority of regions. On Wednesday in the Northwestern,  Central, and Central-Chernozem regions at night it will be 18-23  degrees, and in places 30 degrees, and during the day--15-20  degrees. But the depth of the snow cover here is sufficient to  reliably protect the plants from the cold weather.    It will also get colder in the Upper Volga region, and the  zone of the snowfall will shift to the Lower Volga Area and the  western part of Kazakhstan. There will be inclement weather with  precipitation and winds in the Northern Caucasus, where an ice  crust and fog cannot be ruled out.</p>

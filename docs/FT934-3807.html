			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resumption of central bank gold sales forecast, unless prices rise Central banks are engaged in a long-term effort to extricate themselves from the gold market and convert their huge holdings - 1.1bn troy ounces - into useful and more liquid foreign currency reserves, according to the New York-based precious metals research organisation, CPM Group. The key to future disposals will rest with gold prices, it suggests. 'If the rise in gold prices, from Dollars 326 in March to Dollars 380 in November proves not to be the beginning of a larger upward move for gold, central bank disposals will resume,' says Mr Jeffrey Christian, CPM's managing director. He recalls that central banks sold an estimated 34.1m ounces of gold from their monetary reserves during the past two years, the greatest volume since 1967-68. The bulk of the sales were in 1992 and the first quarter of this year but since that time the nascent rally in gold prices has caused the banks to refrain temporarily from selling more. 'No one wants to be selling gold at the beginning of a cyclical upward move in prices,' says Mr Christian. 'Therefore, prudence dictates caution at this time.' This caution is offset by ingrained attitudes within central banks, however. 'If a central bank has decided to reduce its gold holdings as a matter of policy, but its managers then decide to wait to sell in expectation of higher prices, they are in effect speculating on the price of gold,' CPM states in a new report. But given the perceived greater unpredictability of gold prices, there is increased resistance among managers to being seen as waiting for higher prices. CPM says that it is fortunate for gold producers that gold prices are likely to move up in the next year or so. 'If this proves to be the case, central bank gold deliveries in 1994 may be less than half the 22m ounces delivered to the physical market in 1993.'

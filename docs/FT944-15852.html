			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Toy stores disarm in US Toy stores across the US will this week be removing toy guns from their shelves, after a decision by some of the biggest retailers to stop selling weapons that could be mistaken for the real thing. The move has been prompted not by concerns that the sale of toy guns encourages violence, but because of safety fears. With many young people in the US these days carrying real guns, there is a danger that children carrying imitation firearms could be seen as a threat. In two incidents in New York over the past few weeks, youths brandishing toy guns have been shot by police who thought the weapons were real. One of the boys, a 13-year-old, died. Toys 'R' Us, the biggest US toy retailer, announced at the end of last week that it would stop selling all look-alike toy guns including western-style rifles and revolvers, plastic handguns and any weapons that could be modified to look real. It was joined by Kay-Bee Toy Stores, another big toy retailer, which said it would immediately start removing and destroying guns that resembled military or police-style weapons.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The chart shows that the cumulative effect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised rates of increase is to lower the FY 1994 budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutrality target by 13.56 percent. Together with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.54 percent decline due to updated HCRIS data, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounts for the 14.01 percent reduction in the FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital cost per case budget neutrality target compared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level estimated at the time of the FY 1994 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1994, we employed a budget neutrality factor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.8947 to realize the 90 percent target. In this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for FY 1995, the budget neutrality adjustment factor is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.7986. The budget neutrality factors are not built  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net adjustment to the FY 1994 Federal rate would therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be .7986/.8947 or 0.8926. For the final rule, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recalculate the budget neutrality factor on the basis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recent data available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 412.308(c)(3) requires that the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal rate for inpatient capital-related costs be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for exceptions under &sect;412.348 determined as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of total payments under the hospital-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and Federal rate. The model developed for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the budget neutrality adjustment factor is also used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate payments under the exceptions payment process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the exceptions payment adjustment factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1994, we estimated that exceptions payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would equal 5.15 percent of aggregate payments based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied an exceptions reduction factor of 0.9485 (1^.0515)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in determining the Federal rate. For FY 1995, we estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exceptions payments will equal 2.03 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate payments based on the Federal rate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we propose to apply an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions reduction factor of 0.9797 (1^.0203) to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FY 1995 Federal rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exceptions reductions factors are not built  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net adjustment to the FY 1995 Federal rate is therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .9797/.9485, or 1.0329. The proposed exceptions reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor for FY 1995 is thus 3.29 percent higher than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor for FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 6. Standard Federal Rate for FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For FY 1994, the Federal rate was $378.34. With the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes we are proposing to the factors used to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal rate, the FY 1995 Federal rate would be $353.87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FY 1995 update factor would be 1.0222.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FY 1995 outlier adjustment factor would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.9372.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is applied to the standard Federal payment rate for changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the DRG relative weights and in the geographic adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor would be 1.00115.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is applied to the standard Federal payment rate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital-specific rate to assure that aggregate payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal 90 percent of payments that would have been made on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable cost basis would be 0.7986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The FY 1995 exceptions payments adjustment factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be 0.9797.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Federal rate has already been adjusted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in case mix, wages, cost of living, indirect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate share of low-income patients, we propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make no additional adjustments in the standard Federal rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these factors other than the budget neutrality factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for changes in the DRG relative weights and the geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are providing a chart that shows how each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors and adjustments for FY 1995 affected the computation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed FY 1995 Federal rate in comparison to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1994 Federal rate. The FY 1995 update factor has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of increasing the Federal rate 2.22 percent compared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the rate in FY 1994, while the geographic and DRG budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutrality factor has the effect of increasing the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate by 0.12 percent. The FY 1995 exceptions reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor has the effect of increasing the Federal rate by 3.29  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent compared to the exceptions reduction for FY 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effect of reducing the final FY 1994 rate by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.74 percent compared to the budget neutrality reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1994. The combined effect of all the proposed changes is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to decrease the proposed Federal rate by 6.47 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to the Federal rate for FY 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The government will take a  four-pronged approach in its bid to build Taiwan into an Asia-  Pacific business operations center, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of  the Council for Economic Planning and Development said late  Friday [27 May].    Hsiao made the statement on the second and final day of a  two-day Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Association  of Financial Executives Institutes (IAFEI).    The government will strive to promote economic  liberalization  and entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to  enhance the sound development of trade ties across the Taiwan  strait, to improve the economic structure, and to overhaul  outdated rules and regulations, he noted.    Emphasis will be placed on the exchanges of manpower, goods,  capital and information, on cross-strait cooperation in labor  force and resources, on infrastructure construction, and on  revising laws involving transportation, telecommunications, and  financing, he elaborated.    Stressing that trade ties between Taiwan and other parties  of  the Asia-Pacific region have been cordial, he said two-way trade  reached US$120 billion last year, accounting for 75 percent of  Taiwan's total foreign trade volume.    As of the end of 1993, he pointed out, Taiwan investors  channeled about US$20 billion into this part of the world, of  which US$15 billion went to Mainland China.    Judging from Taiwan's geographical location, economic  performance, technical knowhow, high-caliber manpower, and  cultural background, the island boasts many advantages in its  ambition to become an Asia-Pacific business operations hub, he  said.    The IAFEI's Asia-Pacific meeting was held in Taipei in  coincidence with the 20th anniversary of the Financial  Executives Institute of the Republic of China [ROC], which  sponsored the two- day forum.    Governor Samuel Shieh of the central bank of China and  Indonesia's Industry Minister Tunki Ariwibowo [name as received]  were invited to deliver keynote speeches at the meeting.    The conference, which had as its theme "prosperity through  cooperation and integration," brought together a number of  financial heavyweights including IAFEI President Brian Rose,  President Emilia Bien Bien Roxas [name as received] of the Asia  Trust Group, and Director I. R. M. Ramsay of Jardine Fleming  Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.</p>

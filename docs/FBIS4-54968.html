			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jozef Janto: "Servility Coupled With Naivete"] </F>   [Text] Hungarian politicians have turned southern Slovakia  and Bratislava into a place of pilgrimage, especially now,  before the elections of 8 May. Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)  Acting Chairman Leszak had the guts to declare, while visiting  the sovereign Slovak Republic, that Hungarians are being denied  their basic rights in Slovakia. His colleague from the same  ruling party even said that covert and almost overt ethnic  cleansing was taking place in Slovakia. Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) Chairman Horn, who is counting on electoral  victory, and the chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ), who is also counting on becoming prime minister, were  more diplomatic. But all of them had one characteristic in  common: They came here to score points, that is, to play in the  election campaign the card of the Hungarian ethnic minority.    Although gentlemen from the MDF were the most unscrupulous  in  playing this card, even in Hungary not everyone wants  confrontation with their northern neighbor, particularly at a  time when the Balkans are in flames and the conflict there is  quite close. That is why Prime Minister Boross also had to  score points, but, alas, not in the sense of holding much-needed  businesslike and level-headed talks with Bratislava with the aim  of concluding agreements accommodating both sides.    One has to openly admit that Boross and the entire MDF did  score points at the meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik  on Sunday [1 May], a meeting that had already been written off  because Budapest was not interested in telling the public  anything about it. The MDF, which, with the support of 8 to 12  percent of voters, has found itself in fourth place in the  preelection opinion polls, now has a chance of gaining more  votes in the elections. It will be assisted by our infinite  servility, which was coupled in Komarom and Komarno with  naivete. This was confirmed by Boross himself when he said  after his talks with Moravcik that he "considered the meeting  significant for him personally from the long-term point of  view." While Horn (MSZP) and Kuncze (SZDSZ) had at least given  Moravcik a formal pledge that they would confirm the  inviolability of the Slovak-Hungarian border when they became  head of government, Boross was far from mentioning anything of  that sort. And he was even given the assurance that the Slovak  Government would not link the opening of several border  crossings with the signing of a readmission treaty [providing  for the repatriation of illegal immigrants]. Slovakia,  particularly its southern part, could then become a real huge  promenade....    The aims of the Hungarian politicians, particularly those  who  aspire to being future rulers, are obvious. But what, for God's  sake, was the aim of our government and, in particular, its  head, who eagerly swallows every Hungarian bait? Supposedly, we  should show the world that we are acting as good neighbors.  Every garden and family home owner or tenant surely appreciates  good relations with his neighbor. Good neighborly relations  between states are of even much greater value. However, as  always and everywhere, this must be the aim of both neighbors.  Whenever Budapest has sought good relations to date, it did so  only for propaganda reasons. We have the impression that  Moravcik's government is doing the same thing -- it wants to  prove that things work better without Meciar. Let us concede  that they do. In this case, however, servility and naivete could  backfire ruthlessly.</p>

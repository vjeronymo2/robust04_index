			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Communist Party Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov </F> by Pavel Kozlov in Moscow on 11 January: "Everyone Must Seek  Allies"; first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction]    [Text] In numerical terms, 49-year-old Gennadiy Zyuganov,  with almost 60 deputies from the Communist Party chaired by him,  represents the third-largest force in the State Duma after  Gaydar's and Zhirinovskiy's.    [Kozlov] Right from the first day, all signs point to a  struggle between Gaydar's "Russian Choice" favoring the  government and the president, and an intransigent opposition,  represented primarily by you and your supporters.    [Zyuganov] As I see it, "Russian Choice" does not seem  capable of fully appreciating the results of the 12 December  elections. That grouping did not win 60 percent of the votes, it  only collected 15 percent, and it does not control the political  process. It can block no constitutional decision on its own, so  it will have to work with other groups, and it has no internal  homogeneity: There are elements that fully appreciate that the  bombing of the White House put an end to democracy in Russia,  and there are those who are ready to launch the country once and  for all along the road to dictatorship. No group is  homogeneous, and in a short time we shall see the formation of  the classic pattern of left wing, right wing, and center.    [Kozlov] Will this parliament be even more critical of the  executive of the disbanded Supreme Soviet?    [Zyuganov] The tone adopted by any parliament depends on  what  is happening in the streets and the mood of the electorate. The  worse the situation in the country, the more critical and rigid  will be not only the parliament, but the social, and even  governmental, structures as well.    [Kozlov] Do you intend to bring the issue of a revision of  the Constitution up in the Duma?    [Zyuganov] Our experts are busy studying the text of the  Constitution. In accordance with our election manifesto, we  insist that the Constitution be approved by a two-thirds  majority, otherwise it will not be the law of consensus but the  law of division and deterioration.    [Kozlov] Who is your candidate for the position of speaker?    [Zyuganov] The idea is to appoint the speaker of the Duma  from one of the minor parliamentary parties, a widely respected  figure but one without extreme ideological beliefs, while each  of the larger parties would delegate a deputy speaker and a  committee chairman to satisfy the interests of the political  forces.    [Kozlov] What is your view of the forthcoming  Yeltsin-Clinton  summit?    [Zyuganov] It will be an important meeting because it  involves a visit by the president of a major power. After the  downfall of the USSR, the field of geopolitical forces has  shifted in favor of the United States and NATO, so these talks  have great significance for Russia, especially in view of the  state that we are in.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italian bank plans restructure Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state Treasury-controlled Italian bank, has announced a far-reaching restructuring plan as part of preparations for possible privatisation. The plan shows that Mr Mario Sarcinelli, who took over as BNL chairman in April, is moving quickly to distance the group from its turbulent past, and reposition it as a competitive 'universal' bank. One effect of the plan will be to hive off L700bn (Dollars 436.7m) of outstanding unguaranteed loans to Iraq into a separate financial vehicle. BNL Finance will buy the loans at their current depressed market value. Unauthorised loans to Iraq, made by BNL's Atlanta branch, were revealed in 1989, triggering an international outcry. BNL is fighting through the courts to force repayment of a further Dollars 350m of guaranteed loans to Iraq. The most important part of the BNL restructuring, however, is the absorption of three medium and long-term credit subsidiaries into the main part of the group. This will increase total assets of the parent company to L145,545bn from L108,506bn. Mr Davide Croff, BNL's joint managing director, said yesterday the process of BNL restructuring would be 'very quick'. However, Mr Sarcinelli, former director-general of the Treasury and vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, would not be drawn on a possible date for privatisation. He reiterated that BNL would need new capital, either through a cash injection from the Treasury, or through the transfer of a Treasury-owned credit institution into the BNL portfolio. Separately, the Treasury is preparing for the eventual sale of more of its shares in Imi, the financial services group partly privatised in January.</p>

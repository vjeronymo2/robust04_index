			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA'S DECISION TO RELOCATE LABORATORY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  </P> <P> UCLA's proposal to relocate its laboratory elementary school, as described in  three recent Times articles (Metro, May 12, Real Estate, May 13, Commentary,  16), is not driven by plans to build a new Anderson Graduate School of  Management facility on campus. I have stated the case many times to parents and  community leaders, but the misrepresentation is constantly repeated.  </P> <P> The move would, instead, enhance the school's research value to the community,  state and nation. As the national spotlight increasingly focuses on our  schools, UCLA has an unusual opportunity to contribute to a solution to the  crisis in American public education. We operate the last remaining laboratory  school in California. Through the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School  (UES), UCLA is specially positioned to conduct research on innovative teaching  techniques and other topics that can improve elementary education.  </P> <P> UES, isolated on the UCLA campus, is removed from the dynamics of a typical  neighborhood public school. Thus, the educational research that has been  conducted at UES has not focused on the students most at risk.  </P> <P> We believe that the school could better fulfill its research mission and  provide important insights into public education if it were relocated to an  urban school environment. That is why we are negotiating with the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District to relocate the school to the Ocean Park  section of Santa Monica, where it would be operated by UCLA under a long-term  contract with the district.  </P> <P> Although the current student population is ethnically diverse, the 450 students  come from all over Los Angeles. The proposed move to Ocean Park, an ethnically  and economically diverse neighborhood, would provide Seeds a student population  that is both heterogeneous and a more natural source for a useful research  base.  </P> <P> In that setting, researchers could examine the impact of the local neighborhood  on the school and the school's effect on the community. They could also study  the role of direct parental involvement in their children's education at the  school site. Research could be expanded to include other schools in the  district and students at higher grade levels. The educational achievement of  UES students who remained in that district could be charted as they progressed  through middle school and high school.  </P> <P> For these and other reasons, the relocation of UES to an urban neighborhood  holds great promise for the development and dissemination of new approaches to  public education in the United States.  </P> <P> If the autonomy of the experimental school cannot be assured in contract  negotiations, UES will remain at UCLA. Working drawings for our new management  school provide for the facility to be built adjacent to UES, requiring a  reconfiguration of a small portion of the elementary school but leaving it in  place.  </P> <P> I have stated that future land-use considerations might eventually force a new  administration to close or relocate UES. But the more important consideration  -- and the one that fuels our current proposal -- is how best to contribute to  the search for solutions to our national educational crisis.  </P> <P> CHARLES E.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Turkish Armed Forces have launched a wide-scale  operation on Munzur Mountain, on which hideouts have been  established by the Workers Party of Kurdistan and other illegal  organizations such as the Revolutionary Left Organization and  the Turkish Workers-Peasants Liberation Army. A group of  HURRIYET correspondents are following the operation, during  which the 3,188 meters mountain will be thoroughly searched.    Brigadier General Bahtiyar Turker, commander of the 4th  Armored Brigade, is in command of the operation. The terrorist  hideouts are being destroyed one after the other. It has been  reported that 60 terrorists have been killed on Munzur Mountain  in the past month. Turkish military units are searching every  inch of the heights. Colonel Kazim Baturalp, commander of the  Gendarmerie Regiment in Erzurum; Major Hicabi Bas, director of  the Operations Department for Law and Order in the region; and  Major Ibrahim Turan, director of the Intelligence Department in  the region, are assisting Gen. Turker. In addition to the  gendarmerie commando units, infantry and tank units are  participating in the operation. Col. Baturalp said: "The  treacherous elements will not be allowed to shelter in our  territory. Our heroic troops, who are engaged in hand-to-hand  combat operations, will destroy them. The Armenians will not be  able to achieve their objectives. We are determined to end the  despicable situation with the help of the military troops,  police units, and citizens. The treacherous elements will  either surrender or die."</p>

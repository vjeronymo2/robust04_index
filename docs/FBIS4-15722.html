			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Urgent" report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents </F> Lyudmila Aleksandrova, Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and  Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid, 11 April -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said that he spoke from Madrid today to U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said he expressed  his profound concern that the world may be engulfed in a very  perilous situation of an exchange of blows and urged him to  display utmost restraint. We believe that all the sides must  renounce any use of force.    This equally applies to the Muslim side, which,  unfortunately, provoked the Serb side in some localities. But  of course we regard the shelling of towns by artillery as  impermissible. At the same time, air strikes can have different  results from those intended; that is, an escalation of the  conflict instead of its suppression.    We are worried by the fact that the decision was made in a  hurry, without taking into consideration possible consequences,  the minister continued. Unfortunately, the UN Security  Council's permanent members were not consulted. The  responsibility for the grave consequences that can be expected  rests, therefore, with those who took this decision.    All this is especially annoying because by last Saturday we  already had signs of a possible political settlement, stressed  Kozyrev. Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is now in Pale,  where he arrived after talks in Belgrade.    The foreign minister called on all sides to refrain from all  military actions, including air strikes. He recalled that  Russia and Spain are members of the so-called `Yugoslav Five'  within the UN Security Council. They have now agreed to act in  close cooperation. Andrey Kozyrev ended by expressing hope that  this critical situation will be overcome.    To make a decision on air strikes without Russia was "a big  mistake and a great risk," the Russian minister added. In his  words, he would not like to aggravate the situation, but he  would like his words "to be understood correctly and taken very  seriously."    Andrey Kozyrev recalled that Russia was the initiator of the  practice of UN operations aimed at maintaining peace and of the  principle to protect the peacekeeping forces by all possible  means. We are not against using force to protect "the blue  berets." It is a vitally important issue for Russia, the head  of the Russian diplomacy stressed, and explained that many of  our servicemen are participating in the peacekeeping forces in  various conflict zones. We cannot allow them to be turned into  hostages or targets for the conflicting sides. That is why we  are firmly adhering to the position that the peacekeepers will  be protected reliably.    It is a different matter as to what extent in this specific  case there was now no other way out in Bosnia but to deliver an  air strike and to what extent this was an optimal decision, the  minister noted. That is why, in his opinion, consultations were  needed, and even more so, they are being envisaged by the  resolution of the UN Security Council. If we proceed from the  fact that consultations should be held only when we wish to hear  "yes," then what is left of the concept of consultations and  cooperation?</p>

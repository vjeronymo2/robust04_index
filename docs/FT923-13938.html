			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: CBS ahead as network advertising picks up CBS Inc, which owns one of the three US television networks, reported a 39 per cent jump in second-quarter income, helped by an improving climate for US network advertising and its rise to the top of the prime time television ratings. The group reported net income of Dollars 70.1m, or Dollars 4.53 a share, compared with Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 3.31, in the second quarter of last year. Sales increased by 10 per cent, from Dollars 710m to Dollars 780m. The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The company said the television network's unit prices improved in the prime time, day time and late night time periods. Network sales were also bolstered by the broadcast of two basketball competition semi-finals during the quarter. In 1991, the semi-finals were aired in the first quarter. But while demand for network television advertising improved, local TV and radio advertising remained sluggish. Sales and profits of the CBS television stations division increased, primarily because of the acquisition of two new businesses, while CBS Radio's earnings fell, due mainly to sales weakness. The company's net interest income was Dollars 8.9m, down from Dollars 10.8m, and its cash and marketable securities at the end of the period totalled Dollars 1.4bn, compared with debt of Dollars 1.1bn a year earlier. For the six months, the company reported net income of Dollars 88.7m, or Dollars 5.75 a share, up from Dollars 73.9m, or Dollars 4.29 a share for last year's comparative period. Sales for the half-year increased from Dollars 1.46bn to Dollars 1.86bn.</p>

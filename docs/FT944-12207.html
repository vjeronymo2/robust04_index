			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Engen declines 13% to R418m Difficult trading conditions through most of the year increased pressure on margins at Engen, the South African oil group, resulting in a 13.1 per cent fall in after-tax income to R418m (Dollars 104m) for the year to August, down from R481m previously. Although turnover increased by 9.5 per cent to R8.45bn from R7.72bn, operating income after exceptional items and inventory effects dropped 5.4 per cent to R547m from R578m. Net financing expenses rose to R49m, compared with R16m in interest income a year ago. Mr Rob Angel, managing director, said that the results represented a satisfactory performance given a generally disappointing pick-up in sales volumes to the South African market, which grew only 1.6 per cent by volume on the year, and a Dollars 1 a barrel reduction in refining margins during the second half of the year. As anticipated, net borrowings rose sharply to R787m from R335m, largely to fund capital expenditure on the second phase of expansion to a Durban refinery which will enable the company to process cheaper crude. The upgraded plant is expected to come on stream during December slightly below its R800m budget. Mr Angel, who is an outspoken supporter of full deregulation of the South African oil industry, which has historically been tightly controlled by the state, also attacked the government's 'piecemeal tampering with the regulatory system', which he said had cost Engen R100m in lost income over the past year. Nevertheless, the company reported that in July and August, petrol sales rose 5 per cent in the first real indication of economic recovery. Mr Angel said he was optimistic that sales would pick up substantially in the next financial year. Meanwhile, Engen's export performance, primarily to other African countries, continued to expand rapidly, growing 17.5 per cent to 6.7m barrels, up from 5.7m barrels previously and representing strong growth considering the company only began seeking out foreign markets five years ago. Mr Angel also said that the company was actively seeking new upstream investments, particularly in Africa, to complement its existing ventures in the North Sea and Oman.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher Albert Fisher has taken to spinning a remarkably conservative line these days. Where takeovers once ruled, organic growth and non-executive directors are now the order of the day. Having illustrated the need for an Accounting Standards Board with its annual results in October, the group has had a change of heart which may or may not be connected with the chronic underperformance of its shares. The interim figures followed the ASB's recommendations on extraordinary items to the letter, crystallising a Pounds 6m loss on the disposal of the Holco mushroom company and a related Pounds 12m write-off of goodwill through the profit and loss account. Pre-tax profits fell by 17 per cent in the first half, thanks largely to lower demand in the US where like-for-like operating profits fell by 40 per cent. Cost-cutting by new US management should bring benefits in the second half, but Fisher concedes that progress will be slow until the economy improves. The shares are on a current year multiple of less than 8. The company will have to consolidate its new identity before that changes.</p>

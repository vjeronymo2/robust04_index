			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Rallies of workers were  held at factories in Pyongyang supporting and encouraging the  struggle of the South Korean workers for wage hike.    The speakers at the rallies said that the South Korean  workers were paid less than one fourth of the minimum living  cost for their intensive labour of longest working hour in the  world. But the Kim Yong-sam group is pursuing even the  wage-curbing policy under the pretext of "share of pains", they  noted.    Charging that the South Korean puppet clique issued an order  to brand the struggle of the workers for wage hike and  "labour-management dispute" as illegal to severely counter  them and mobilised all the repressive forces to crack down on  them at the point of bayonet, they said:    "If the South Korean workers vacillate in the present-day  struggle or pin any illusion and expectation on the authorities  and enterpreneurs, it will result in binding them faster to the  chains of oppression and capital," the speakers said, and  stressed:    The South Korean workers must give a teaching to the  exploiters in concerted efforts.    The South Korean workers must wage a vigorous struggle to  get  U.S. imperialist forces of aggression withdrawn from South  Korea, abolish the fascist laws and repressive tools, let the  present "civilian" government resign and establish a genuine  independent government.    The working class in the northern palf of Korea will achieve  the reunification of the country without fail by pooling efforts  with the South Korean workers.</p>

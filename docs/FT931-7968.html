			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Tests to start on power from sea tides A TEAM of energy experts is attempting to use tidal power as a new way of generating electricity without a barrage or engineering works causing extensive environmental damage. First tests will be made this spring off the west coast of Scotland of an underwater 10kw turbine with a 4-metre rotor driven by the rise and fall of the tides. The test machine will be anchored to the seabed, and attached to a buoy  - the only obvious indication of its presence - containing radio-monitoring equipment. As the tide sweeps inshore, the current will turn the rotor, just as the wind turns the sails of a windmill, and drive the underwater generator. As the tide goes out, the apparatus will swing around and be driven by the outgoing current. The Pounds 200,000 pioneer project is being run by a consortium of Scottish Nuclear; IT Power, a research and consultancy company; and NEL, the research organisation that operates the UK wind turbine centre. If the experiment satisfies the consortium that the technology is worth pursuing, it could lead to the development of larger, commercial tidal current turbines linked by marine cables to the national grid.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION in </F> Brussels]    [Text] The Prime Minister seized the initiative at the NATO  summit early today with a dramatic new plan to bomb Serb  positions if they continue to thwart the United Nations  humanitarian operation in Bosnia.    He is calling on NATO leaders to agree to a tough  declaration  warning the Serbs they will face air attacks unless they give  way in two key areas.    The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility  in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure and  appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing  raids.    Mr Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of  Srebrenica where Serbs are preventing the replacement of 300  Canadian troops by a Dutch force and their refusal to allow the  airport at Tuzla to be reopened.    His proposal urges that plans be drawn up to ensure the  replacement of the Canadian forces and to examine how Tuzla  airport can be reopened.    "If, despite knowing in advance air support was available,  troops attempted to stop that from happening, then we would use  air support -- i.e., we would use air cover aggresively to  achieve our objectives," said a British source.    Throughout the two-day NATO summit the French have been  pressing for punitive air strikes across Bosnia, but Mr Major  warned there could be serious consequences unless these were  carefully thought through.    But French president Francois Mitterrand was among the first  to back Mr Major's proposal which will be formally tabled for  endorsement by the alliance later today.    The biggest stumbling block will be U.S. approval after  President Bill Clinton warned the summit against continued empty  threats against the Serbs.    But British sources appeared optimistic that the Americans  would sign up to the proposal.    The Allies are determined to open the Tuzla airport as its  closure is severely hampering the humanitarian operation in  northern Bosnia.    And there is widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to allow  the 300 Canadian troops out of Srebrenica at the end of their  six-month tour of duty which was supposed to end just before  Christmas.    A Dutch contingent is ready to replace them, but the Serbs  have blocked all attempts to move them in.    The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise NATO's  commitment  to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo if the  situation in the Bosnian capital becomes untenable.    A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in  Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic.    Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del  Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the  carrier Invincible.</p>

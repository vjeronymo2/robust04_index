			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Caring moves at the bottom of the ladder - John Willman on help for those with low incomes The last budget before the general election has been used to make two points about Mr John Major's approach to social policy. The first point is that he is prepared to devote resources to helping people who are at the bottom of the income ladder - in contrast to his predecessor. The most obvious indicator of this is the introduction of a reduced rate of income tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The cost of the new 20 per cent tax band will be Pounds 1.8bn in 1992-93, rising to Pounds 2.3bn in the following year - but three-quarters of the Pounds 1.8bn cost will go to people earning less than average male earnings. This allows the chancellor to point out to those on below-average income that much of the benefit goes to them. At the same time, he can sell the reduced rate band to the better-off as the first instalment of a cut in the basic rate of tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. It will also be hard for Labour to argue against the reduced rate band - until quite recently, the party was committed to introducing at least one lower-rate tax band itself. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, has been quoted in the past as saying that he regarded a 25 per cent marginal tax rate for those earning just above the tax-free allowances was far too high. At least as significant in demonstrating Mr Major's more compassionate approach in the run-up to the election are the increases in income support announced for pensioners: Pounds 2 a week for single pensioners, Pounds 3 a week for couples. At least 5m less well-off pensioners will gain something from the increase - half through rises in related means-tested benefits such as housing benefit and community charge benefit. The increases announced in the Budget come on top of rises announced last October as part of the annual uprating of social security benefits and allowed the chancellor to claim that by next October, the full income support rates for pensioners would have been increased by between Pounds 5.75 a week and Pounds 10.70 a week in total. The government will contrast these figures with the increases in the flat-rate state pension which Labour has promised to all pensioners of Pounds 5 a week for single people and Pounds 8 a week for couples. Of course the government's totals include the indexation element of last October's uprating - Labour's increases would be on top of that. And only pensioners on income support get anything out of these rises - the increasing proportion who do not need to rely on means-tested benefits will get nothing from higher income support. But that in turn allows the government to make a second point about its more compassionate approach: that while the Conservatives are prepared to be help the needy, they are hard-headed in how they do it. The Conservative approach is to be selective rather than universal, to target help to those who need it, not spray it around willy-nilly. As the chancellor pointed out in yesterday's Budget speech, pensioners are increasingly well-off, as entitlement builds up to occupational pensions and the state earnings-related pensions scheme. 'On average, pensioners' real income increased by more than a third between 1979 and 1988,' Mr Lamont pointed out. 'More than half of pensioners now have a second pension; and pensioners have seen their income from saving double since 1979.' The proportion of pensioners who depend only or mainly on the basic flat-rate state pension is falling. By promising to increase the flat-rate pension substantially to help this declining group, Labour must also find the resources to pay the same increase to pensioners for whom the flat-rate pension is relatively unimportant. This makes Labour's promise expensive one - it would cost Pounds 2.9bn, and to pay for it, Labour must increase tax and national insurance contributions for people earning much over Pounds 20,000 a year. Yesterday's increase for pensioners on income support, in contrast, will cost no more than Pounds 305m in a full year. The benefits of such targeting are emphasised by the chancellor's statement that the increase will be paid for out of reserves. The cost is so small that it need have no consequences for public expenditure - never mind require a tax increase. Whether this will impress pensioners remains to be seen. Many of the 5m pensioners to benefit from yesterday's rise will get less than the full increases: dividing the Pounds 305m between them means that the average increase is Pounds 61 a year (Pounds 1.17 a week). And there are many pensioners whose incomes are too high to qualify for income support and other means-tested benefits who would not see themselves as well-off. They may well reflect that Labour's extra Pounds 5 a week for singles, Pounds 8 a week for couples would be a prize worth having. But the increase for pensioners on income support will undoubtedly be deployed by the Conservatives in ways which attempt to neutralise Labour's appeal to pensioners - while portraying the government as one which can afford to be generous to the most needy while being prudent with scarce resources.</p>

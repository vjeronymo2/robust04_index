			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Another small ease MONEY market rates in both the UK and Germany eased again yesterday as dealers continued to believe that a cut in both countries' official rates may follow tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting, writes James Blitz. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, gave the markets the impression that UK credit policy would lean on the tight side in his testimony to MPs on Monday. However, sterling dealers saw new clues to a near-term easing of rates yesterday. The currency consolidated its position above DM2.50, peaking at DM2.5390 to the D-Mark at noon in London. A strengthening pound gives the UK government more room to introduce another base rate cut, without this having an impact on inflation. Yesterday's monthly figure for factory gate price rises was also the lowest in 25 years, indicating that inflationary pressures in the economy are very weak. Output prices were unchanged against economists' forecasts of a 0.1 per cent rise. The Bundesbank injected liquidity into the German money market at a rate of 8.9 per cent yesterday, further underlining the easier German policy on market rates, now 60 basis points below the Lombard rate ceiling. These developments registered in cash and futures prices. Three month sterling cash closed at 8 5/8 per cent, down from a previous close of 8 per cent. The December short sterling contract closed at 91.92 from a previous close of 91.89. The December Euromark contract registered new bullishness about the Bundesbank council meeting, rising 10 basis points to 91.76. Several dealers offered bills below established rates to the Bank of England at the start of UK money market operations, but said the offers were turned down. The speculation over a rate cut was reflected in the fact that only Pounds 2m of Band 1 bank bills were bought at the established rate of 8 7/8 per cent in the early round. The Pounds 800m shortage was later removed with the purchase of Pounds 440m and Pounds 282m of Band 1 bank bills in the morning and afternoon. One clearing bank dealer said that if there were no rate cuts before Friday, the market would unwind the recent mark-down of rates. 'I would expect the December futures contract to fall 10 basis points,' he said.</p>

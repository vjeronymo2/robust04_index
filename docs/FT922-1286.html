			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Wellcome Trust in talks on size of share issue WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, was last night meeting Robert Fleming, the global co-ordinator for the sale of Wellcome shares, to discuss the size of the planned issue. A preliminary indication of the amount of stock to be sold in the offering next month will be announced on Thursday. The trust is cutting its stake in the pharmaceutical company, headed by Mr John Robb, from 73.5 per cent to below 50 per cent, and possibly to as low as 25 per cent. Estimates of the amount likely to be sold are currently around 35 per cent. The amount will be fixed at a level which Fleming believes will maximise the proceeds from the sale. Shares in Wellcome, which produces Retrovir, the HIV treatment, and Zovirax, the anti-viral medicine, slipped 12p to 913p yesterday, a percentage fall in line with the FT-SE 100 index. However, since the trust announced its intention to sell a large part of its stake in early March, Wellcome's shares have fallen from 1126p, and underperformed the UK market. The recent weakness of the stock market is affecting new issues in general. The price for The Telegraph flotation, to be announced today, is likely to be under 330p, lower than earlier hopes of up to 350p. Hollinger, the Canadian publisher headed by Mr Conrad Black, is selling 26m shares in The Telegraph to reduce its stake to 68 per cent. Wellcome Trust's advisers at Fleming yesterday met managers of the nine regional syndicates assessing the level of interest among investors around the world. Fleming and the trust will agree an indicative size for the issue but the tender does not officially open until July 6 and will remain open for two or three weeks after that. It is thought that Fleming does not wish to scale the offer down once the first indication of size is published and is therefore expected to fix that at a figure it is confident of reaching. Fleming is using the 'green shoe' mechanism under which it can increase the offer by 15 per cent. It would achieve this by over-alloting shares and then buying shares in the after-market to stabilise the share price. Thus while the maximum available to be sold is 48.5 per cent, the highest amount that would be put on offer is around 42.2 per cent.</p>

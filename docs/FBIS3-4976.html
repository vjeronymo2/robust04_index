			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Recent rises of long-term  interest rates and the yen's value are unlikely to put a drag on  Japan's economy, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Thursday  [3 March].    Saito told a regular press conference that the climbs were  recent developments and did not reflect long-term trends.    Concerning the interest rates, Saito said rates were rising  from a very low point and remain at "sufficiently low levels."    He said that "at one time" the yen was said to be on another  uptrend but those expectations did not come about.    Saito said more time is needed to watch interest rate and  currency market trends.    Japanese benchmark 10-year government bond yields jumped  Monday to 3.94 percent, their highest level since just before  the Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate to a record low  1.75 percent a year in September.    Banks are moving to raise their long-term prime lending  rates, which would put upward pressure on housing loan rates.    Market players have cited a halt in the decline of business  confidence signaled by a key survey released Monday, and  concerns of oversupply in the wake of the government's  stepped-up bond issuance.    The yen also climbed Monday as reports circulated that the  United States would revive a retaliatory trade law, rekindling  bilateral trade friction and heightening expectations of U.S.  backing of a higher yen to curb Japan's huge trade surplus.    On the economy, Saito said there had been worries in some  quarters of further setbacks but they have dissipated. On the  other hand, he said, there is still no confirmation that the  economy is bottoming out.    It is still too early to judge the economy based on recent  statistics showing some hope that the worst is over, he said.    But he repeated that the effects of last month's 15.25  trillion yen economic stimulus package have yet to be felt and  expressed hope that the measures will get the economy on track  for a strong recovery in the fiscal year starting next month and  stable growth starting in the following fiscal year.    Saito declined comment on reports that President Bill  Clinton  will revive the super 301 retaliatory trade provision, saying  nothing official has been decided. He said Japan's policy  remains not to draft numerical targets to gauge progress in  opening markets.</p>

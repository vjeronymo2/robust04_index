			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Viktor Viktorovich Posuvalyuk, </F> Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special representative for a  settlement in the Middle East, by correspondent Vitaliy Gan;  from the "Panorama" program--live or recorded]    [Text] [Gan] With us in the studio is Viktor Viktorovich  Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's special representative for a  settlement in the Middle East. Viktor Viktorovich, PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat has just ended a visit to Russia. Yitzhaq Rabin  began a visit today. It is thought that attempts are being made  to draw Moscow more actively into Middle Eastern affairs.  However, some say that after our diplomacy's major fiasco in  Bosnia, this is the last straw. What do you think?    [Posuvalyuk] Vitaliy, despite the shortage of time and the  fact that this is not my area of competence, not my territory, I  would like very briefly to oppose the view of those who talk  about the fiasco of Russian diplomacy in Yugoslav affairs.  First, this problem is insoluble without Russia. Second,  events have revealed the nonuniformity, the political diversity  of the Bosnian Serbs. Third, I am convinced that had it not been  for the minister's visit--had it not been for Vitaliy Churkin's  mission--events would immediately have acquired an even more  ominous nature. Fourth, and maybe most importantly, strong-arm  methods are not in themselves effective. As someone who sat  through the bombing in Baghdad during the Gulf War, I can very  definitely testify to that.    Now with regard to the visits, Russia, as a great power, has  two key roles with relation to the Middle East. First, it is a  close neighbor, a major power with very broad  interests--economic, political, spiritual, religious, and, of  course, military. Its second role is as a permanent member of  the Security Council and a cosponsor alongside the United States  in the Middle East peace process. These visits and  talks--'Arafat's visit that has already taken place and Rabin's  visit that has begun--will be guided by these two functions,  Russia's political functions in the Middle East.    There have already been and there will be specific  conversations on bilateral relations. At the same time, the  president and the minister have already heard 'Arafat's view,  and now they will have conversations with Rabin on the state of  the Middle East peace process. Here there are mutual claims and  reproaches from both sides. I think that Russia has an  opportunity as cosponsor to smooth out some points and move  matters forward. God willing, an agreement on Gaza and Jericho  will be signed at the beginning of May.    [Gan] It is said that 'Arafat's authority and influence in  the Arab world has been on the decline since he signed the  agreement with Israel. Is that correct?    [Posuvalyuk] I think it would be more correct not to talk  about how far 'Arafat's popularity rating has risen or fallen.  I think the point is that 'Arafat has risked his political  career, his political future. Here one must talk not just about  'Arafat but about Prime Minister Rabin as well. In our view,  these are courageous political leaders; they are undoubtedly  courageous. Take 'Arafat, for example. People are burning  photographs of him, burning effigies. Incidentally, it is not  only the loudmouths and extremists who are talking about this,  but also sometimes, unfortunately, some of our correspondents  who are there. Take [RTV correspondent] Vladislav Flyarkovskiy  in Tel Aviv, who relishes this subject and has reported on it  several times already. Although, incidentally, Israeli  television avoids reports of that kind because they understand  that the matter concerns a political partner. They are  effectively in the same boat. Their future depends on the  outcome of the peace process.    As for Rabin, I was in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently, and  I  saw how the radical left-wing [as heard], the extremist wing of  Israel's political structure, is trying to whip up hysteria  against the government. For Rabin, it is an enormous  psychological strain to drive around the city and see  everywhere: "Rabin, Rabin the Traitor". I am convinced,  however, that the majority of both Palestinians and Israelis are  in favor of the peace process and the continuation of talks.    [Gan] Viktor Viktorovich, what do you think are the  prospects  for a peaceful settlement?    [Posuvalyuk] Well, we have the image--perhaps it is  hackneyed-- of light at the end of the tunnel. Using the same  image, I will say that for many decades--the conflict has been  going on practically since the beginning of the century--for  many decades, at the end of the tunnel there was either gloom  and darkness or the fire of six wars and innumerable senseless  conflicts. Now a distant light has appeared. I would not like  to fall into euphoria; a distant light has appeared. We all  fell into euphoria, incidentally, after 13 September, when the  Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. Maybe we  even underestimated the strength of opposition to the peace  process. So a distant light has appeared. In the Palestinian  talks, in particular, things are moving forward. I say let us  hope that an agreement will be signed at the beginning of May.</p>

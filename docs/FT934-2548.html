			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Martelli admits receiving funds Mr Claudio Martelli, former Socialist justice minister, yesterday admitted illicitly receiving L500m (Dollars 300,480) from Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing director of Ferruzzi-Montedison, for Italy's general elections in 1992. The admission came while Mr Martelli was giving evidence on the 15th day of the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, an influential consultant close to the Socialist party. Mr Cusani is accused of bribery and corruption and helping to falsify Montedison group accounts. According to Mr Martelli, Mr Sama said as he was given the money: 'Oh, Claudio, look, this money is mine and from the family, we are like brothers.' Mr Sama is married to Alessandra, one of the Ferruzzi founder's daughters. Mr Sama, who also testified yesterday, admitted for the first time he had given money to Mr Martelli, although the two men gave different accounts of the events. Mr Martelli, who was justice minister at the time, admitted he should have declared the funds but insisted he thought the money was from the family, not Montedison. Mr Martelli is now the second former minister to admit illicitly receiving money in the Cusani trial. Neither has been asked to say how the money was spent. Mr Sama also surprised the court by saying he had given L5bn to L7bn to Mr Bettino Craxi, the then Socialist leader, for the 1992 elections. In another development, Mr Alfredo Vito, a former Christian Democrat deputy for Naples, has become the first member of parliament to be sentenced in the corruption scandals. As a result of plea bargaining and an agreement to hand back L5.5bn, he got a two-year suspended sentence. Some L4bn will go to a children's fund run by the Naples city council and the rest will be deposited in the Bank of Italy at the discretion of the public prosecutor's office.</p>

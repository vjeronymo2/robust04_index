			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CHILD VIOLENCE INJURES 1 IN 130  </P> <P> One in every 130 children require hospital care each year for injuries  resulting from fights, suicide attempts and other intentional acts of violence,  a study found.  </P> <P> The study, based on Massachusetts data gathered a decade ago, found that such  harm is relatively common, especially among city dwellers and poor people.  </P> <P> Overall, 85% of the intentional injuries resulted from assaults, such as  fights, rape and battering.  </P> <P> The analysis was conducted by Dr. Bernard Guyer and colleagues from Harvard  School of Public Health and Boston University School of Medicine. It was  conducted in 1979 to 1982 in 14 Massachusetts communities and published in the  New England Journal of Medicine.  </P> <P> One in 42 adolescent boys was treated annually for an assault-related injury,  usually resulting from a fight. Boys were almost twice as likely as girls to  seek care for intentional injuries. One exception was suicide attempts, which  were nearly twice as frequent among girls.  </P></p>

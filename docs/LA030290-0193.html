Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RACE DRIVER ALLISON PASSES OUT  </P> <P> Davey Allison passed out today after an impromptu wrestling match with a crew  member during a rain delay at North Carolina Motor Speedway.  </P> <P> Allison, 29, the son of longtime NASCAR Winston Cup star Bobby Allison, quickly  regained consciousness and was checked out at the track's infield care center.  </P> <P> He walked out of the care center, but, at his father's urging, was taken by  private plane to Charlotte Memorial Hospital, about 75 miles away, for further  testing.  </P> <P> Robert Yates, the owner and manager of the younger Allison's team, said,  "During the rain, Davey was playing around, wrestling with one of the guys, got  held in a headlock, and a couple of minutes later, Davey passed out."  </P> <P> Hut Stricklin, who does not have a ride for Sunday's Goodwrench 500 here, was  asked to drive Allison's Ford Thunderbird in the afternoon practice session.  </P></p>

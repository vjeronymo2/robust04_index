			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Tax fears put blight on US budget relief President Bill Clinton's long-awaited deficit reduction act has, at last, scraped its way through both Houses of Congress. But, despite the palpable sighs of relief in Washington at the weekend, some economists fear that his plan could deliver the worst of both worlds. Their worry is that the revenue-raising credentials of Mr Clinton's seemingly dour package of tax increases and spending cuts have been over-sold: the promised cuts in the US budget deficit will not materialise, but Mr Clinton will nonetheless get the blame for scaring the American economy out of the recovery it needs. For, whatever communication problems the Clinton administration may have had over the past few months, the package has come with a clear message that taxes will rise. Not surprisingly, consumer and business confidence have fallen sharply this year. The US consumer confidence index, calculated by the Conference Board, a New York Business analysis group, fell to 57.7 in July, the lowest level since last October and sharply down from 76.7 in January. The index of business confidence fell to 57 in the second quarter, from 66 in the first quarter, its lowest level since the end of 1991. Yet, despite popular fears that the tax burden will rise, Professor Martin Feldstein, head of the economics department at Harvard University and erstwhile chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, contends that many of the projected tax revenues will not materialise. A longstanding critic of the Clinton tax plan, Professor Feldstein claims that many of the tax changes - such as raising the income tax rate on individuals earning over Dollars 115,000 from 31 to 36 per cent  - are so badly designed that taxpayers only need to change their behaviour a little for many of the projected new revenues to evaporate. According to his calculations, if high-earning individuals are able to lower their taxable income by just 10 per cent of gross adjusted income, then the US Treasury will only see about a quarter of the additional revenues it might have hoped for. The Administration's projections made little allowance for such changes of behaviour as tax avoidance or reduced work effort. Ironically, the government's reluctant decision to back-date income tax increases to the beginning of 1993, rather than have them start from June 30 as originally planned, provides a short-term answer to Professor Feldstein's criticisms. At least in the first round of revenue-collecting, the government is more likely to collect the full increases because they have been sprung on individuals after the event. Mr David Hale, an investment analyst at Kemper Financial services in Chicago, claims that apprehension about Mr Clinton's economic plans is behind the recent slump in consumer and business confidence. He says most households are concerned about the Clinton tax programme 'despite the fact that most of the tax increases will fall on incomes above Dollars 100,000.' It is not so much the fine print of Mr Clinton's package that is denting confidence. More important has been the plan's tax-raising reputation and a sense of foreboding about what has not yet been unveiled. The Administrations's plans for reforming the health and benefit system look set to involve further increases in marginal tax rates on wages. According to Mr Hale, companies, especially small ones, are also worried about the impact of the Clinton health and other programmes. Their fear that these will increase labour costs partly explains why many have chosen to lengthen the working week as demand has risen, rather than take on new staff. These corporate worries are bad news for the US economy. Mr Clinton's emphasis on taxing labour - both in the deficit package and through the most likely options for health funding - may have contributed to the uneven recovery in the US jobs market which has accompanied the upturn. Mr Clinton must hope that the negative effects of this uncertainty on economic growth are more than offset by the positive effect that cutting the deficit should have on investment and thus on America's long-term growth rate. Countries with higher national savings rates tend also to have higher rates of domestic investment in industry. By persuading the financial markets that the government is going to cut the deficit, the budget package should bring down long-term interest rates and makes it cheaper for companies to borrow funds. However watered-down the agreed deficit package, Mr Clinton appears to have been remarkably successful in reassuring the markets. Long-term bond yields, for instance, are at historically low levels. Entirely by accident, Mr Clinton's economic policy appears to have achieved a second success over the past few months by persuading consumers to postpone their spending decisions. For it is not just the American government which consumes too much and saves too little. While the high federal budget deficit eats up too much of the nation's savings pie, the spending habits of American consumers make it a smaller pie to begin with. Of the 5.6 percentage point decline in US national savings as a proportion of gross domestic product since 1980, 3.4 percentage points can be traced to higher public borrowing. The remainder is due to a fall in saving by the American personal sector. By inducing consumers to save more than they need to pay their expected tax bill, Mr Clinton's fiscal reform might also boost US investment by raising national savings. US personal savings, as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.9 per cent in the first three months of this year from 4.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1992, though the signs are that the trend has not continued. Mr Clinton can rightly be blamed for allowing uncertainty and fear about his tax plans to threaten America's nascent recovery. But, by pushing up private savings, he has also achieved, albeit in an accidental and haphazard manner, what many would have him plan to do on a permanent basis. US bond markets, Page 16</p>

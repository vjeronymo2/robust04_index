			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: ARTIST EXHIBITS INITIATIVE WITH CRAFTS FAIR  </P> <P> After several years of exhibiting her soft sculptures -- ducks, birds and other  small animals -- at local outdoor festivals, Ronda Mills became discouraged.  </P> <P> Lack of advertising, unreasonable admission prices and shows coinciding with  children's carnivals contributed to what she called unprofessional exhibits  plagued by low public turnout. The artists, she said, were cheated.  </P> <P> So in 1983, the West Hills resident established West Coast Artists, a venue for  local and national artists to display their products throughout Southern  California. Tomorrow and Sunday, her organization will present the ninth  semiannual Valencia Fine Arts and Crafts Festival at Old Orchard Park, 25051 N.  Avenida Rotella in Valencia.  </P> <P> Over the last seven years, the art festivals have grown -- today Mills' mailing  list consists of more than 3,000 artists, and exhibits are held at 16 locations  annually. Most shows, Mills said, feature about 100 booths, including ceramics,  clothing, country crafts, jewelry, soft and iron sculpture, woodwork, stained  glass and fine arts items.  </P> <P> "Ronda puts on a great festival," said Chet Blacketer, a sculptor who works in  iron and exhibits with West Coast Artists about 10 times a year. "She's an  honest businesswoman who, because of her own creative flair, understands the  artist. And she puts profits back into advertising so the public actually shows  up. That's important. If you're an artist, you've got to have the public see  your work."  </P> <P> The 49-year-old Yucaipa artist and his wife, Carrol, are known for their  sculptures of locomotives, Model-T automobiles and figures. Blacketer, a pipe  fitter by trade, said he and his wife spend from a few days to six months  welding fragments at 3,500 degrees with an electric arc to complete the iron  configurations.  </P> <P> Outdoor festivals, such as the ones West Coast Artists promotes, have not only  yielded a substantial public following for the Blacketers but have also caught  the business community's attention. Unocal's Westlake Village office  commissioned the couple to make a five-foot replica of an oil rig and the Hand  Prop Room of Los Angeles has contracted their ironwork as background art for  office and home settings in several television series.  </P> <P>  More than 100 arts and crafts booths will be featured at West Coast Artists'  ninth semiannual Valencia Fine Arts and Crafts Festival from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Saturday and Sunday at Old Orchard Park, 25051 N. Avenida Rotella, Valencia.  Admission is free. For additional information, call (818) 884-8284. HEATHER W.  MORGAN  </P></p>

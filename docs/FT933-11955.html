			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Reuters steps gingerly off its pile of money: Andrew Bolger explains why the UK business information group is keeping to its specialist fields Sir Christopher Hogg said bluntly: 'Too much cash is a curse, not a blessing.' The chairman of Reuters Holdings was explaining why the business information and news group had decided to hand back up to Pounds 350m of its growing cash pile to shareholders through a share repurchase scheme. Sir Christopher said he felt 'a bit strange' about the operation, which has been months in the planning. 'It's rationally sensible, but goes against the grain of conventional wisdom - that managers who don't sit on a cash pile need their heads examined.' He insisted that the decision was a brave one: it showed the group was anxious to guard against becoming 'sloppy' with cash, and against the risk of not looking hard enough at the performance of existing businesses. 'Any fool can spend money, the challenge is to spend it wisely.' Reuters, the leading supplier of information and transaction products to the world's financial centres, has been adjusting to a lower-growth environment after the boom years of the 1980s. After enjoying compound growth of 25-30 per cent per annum until a few years ago, the group will be content with double-digit revenue growth this year. This means it no longer needs the huge increases in working capital which were required at the peak of the boom. Sir Christopher said capital expenditure continued to be on a long-term 'rising trend'. Last year it rose from Pounds 148m to Pounds 194m, of which Pounds 101m was spent on subscriber equipment. Yet even that increase made little impact on the group's cash pile, which grew from Pounds 503m to Pounds 710m. Pre-tax profits rose by nearly 13 per cent to Pounds 383m - an impressive performance for a company struggling with recession in its main markets. Sir Christopher believes that Reuters should continue to concentrate on specialist markets which allow maximum exploitation of its advanced technology. 'Strategy will be unfolded in a measured manner designed to retain Reuters' focus and ensure that its products will continue to be differentiated by their careful targeting and close technical integration.' Mr Peter Job, chief executive, was confident that the group's expertise in news-gathering, database management and global network management made it well placed to meet the growing demand for sophisticated products in the financial services industry and the media. 'Timely investments in video news-gathering and dissemination will allow Reuters to make the necessary enhancements to its product line as multi-media technology develops gradually into practical applications.' Reuters last year took full control of Visnews, the international television news agency, renaming it Reuters Television, and has also joined the consortium which owns Independent Television News. Last month it announced plans to launch a Hispanic satellite news service with BBC World Service Television. The former Visnews offices and the Reuters news bureaux are being combined, with the aim of correspondents being able to file video pictures as well as words. Eventually the 200,000 Reuters screens worldwide will be able to offer subscribers live pictures of occasions which can move the market, such as a major bank rate announcement. Mr Job said the emerging 'multi-media' world offered big opportunities, but also great scope to lose a lot of money, and he was determined to proceed cautiously. 'We will limit acquisitions or diversifications to things which add spice to, or leverage, the core businesses.' Reuters' measured approach also reflects another concern - the group's realisation that it cannot afford to be complacent about its position as provider of financial information and transaction products, which account for 93 per cent of group revenue. The UK group maintains a dominant position, but is being increasingly challenged by rivals such as Telerate, Knight-Ridder and Bloomberg, all of which have targeted its blue-chip customer base and high profit margins. At today's results meeting, Reuters will be quizzed on the progress of its latest products, Dealing 2000-2, which offers automated foreign exchange trading, and Globex, which serves the futures and options market.

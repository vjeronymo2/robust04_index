			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as inflation fears hit sentiment Wall Street US equities staged an unconvincing sell-off yesterday before ending the day essentially unchanged in a market which seemed torn between satisfaction over unexpectedly strong employment figures for May and concern about the prospect of inflation, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up a tiny 0.27 points at 3,545.14. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was 2.69 lower at 450.06, while the Amex composite was up 0.04 at 440.95, and the Nasdaq composite off 4.21 at 702.01. Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 224m shares, as declines outnumbered rises by about three to two. The minor erosion in prices contrasted with a sharp decline in longer-dated bonds, when the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue lost close to one point in morning trading before recovering somewhat in the late afternoon, when it was quoted down  19/32 , yielding 6.905 per cent. Treasury prices were hit by the morning's release of employment figures for May: non-farm payrolls rose by 209,000 in the month, compared with a forecast 125,000. The April figure was revised up to 216,000 from an initially reported gain of 119,000 and the unemployment rate eased to 6.9 per cent from 7.0 per cent. The figures led to speculation that the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy. For equities, the prospect of an improved economy helped moderate the impact of fears of inflation. Allstate Insurance dominated trading for a second day. The initial public offering of 78.5m shares in the company, priced at Dollars 27 a share on Wednesday night, was the biggest IPO by a US company. The shares closed at Dollars 28 5/8 , down Dollars  3/4 . Car issues went against the downward trend, with General Motors adding Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 46 5/8 . Federal Express recovered Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 1/2 after plunging Dollars 4 3/8 a day earlier on reports that the broker, Donaldson Lufkin&amp;Jenrette, had reduced its investment rating on the stock to 'moderately attractive' following recent resignations. Shares in Wal-Mart, the discount retail group, edged Dollars 1 lower to Dollars 26 5/8 in active trading in the wake of Thursday's release of uninspiring sales figures for May. The speciality fashion retailer, Merry-Go-Round, dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 10 3/4 after Dean Witter cut its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral' on disappointing earnings. In the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 5/8 , Sun Microsystems eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32, Apple Computer lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Intel fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 112 3/4 and Lotus Development added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 . Canada TORONTO stock prices ended the week on a positive note, closing solidly higher in busy trading. The TSE-300 composite index climbed 19.62 points, or 0.51 per cent, to close at 3894.63, about 28 points up on the week. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 423 to 283. Volume was 75.311m shares and trading value rose to CDollars 713.7m from CDollars 675.1m. Eleven of 14 sub-indices closed higher.</p>

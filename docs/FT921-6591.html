			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Technology: Sun Alliance International Company Snapshot Sun Alliance was founded in London in 1710 as an insurance company. It now consists of four operating companies, focused on overseas, life, UK, and international business. They are supported by a number of companies dealing with property, information technology and other matters. These come under the care of Sun Alliance Management Services. Nature of business: Commercial insurance, in such areas as professional indemnity, shipping or any insurance required by a company in the pursuit of its business. Turnover: Pounds 3,4bn (1990) and pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m (1990) TECHNOLOGY FILE Software: The electronic mail system used is Verimation's Memo, a strong competitor for IBM's own mainframe E-Mail product, introduced at Sun Alliance in 1987. Hardware: Five large IBM or IBM-compatible mainframes (total processing capacity of 280 Mips) at two sites, running the MVS operating system. Installation: This can take anything from a couple of weeks to a couple of years to complete, depending on the facilities required. Communications: A large part of the project has been to link participating brokers, each with its own hardware system, to Sun Alliance's own IBM system. Software cost: Around Pounds 45,000 to implement Verimation for an unlimited number of users. The broker's system involved no extra Memo licensing costs. Training: SAI sent 12 people on a training course at Lucas Systems to teach them about workflow tools ('intelligent' Memo forms for electronic trading) at a cost of Pounds 1,800. Other systems: IBM's IMS is the principal teleprocessing product used in the Sun Alliance mainframe environment. Cics is used in conjunction with IBM's DB2 database. Most of the group's data is stored on IBM databases.</p>

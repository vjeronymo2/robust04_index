			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Steel back in the melting pot SINCE announcing the restart of the Multilateral Steel Agreement talks - in Geneva today - US trade officials have steadfastly denied any connection with the 84 dumping and subsidy cases filed by the nation's steel industry. They say they want to break the cycle of trade cases and restraint agreements, but to do so they must provide effective disciplines on trade distortions. The MSA talks are to deal with future dumping and subsidies, while the steel cases are considered protection against uncompetitive practices. When the talks broke down on March 31, the negotiators had generally agreed on phasing out tariffs over a 10-year period, prohibiting non-tariff barriers and setting up a mechanism for settling disputes. However, the talks foundered on the EC's wish that subsidies be allowed to continue for research and possibly for development, plant closure, workers' assistance and environmental compliance. The US also refused to give advance notification before unfair trade cases were filed. Breakdown coincided with the end of seven and a half years of quota protection for the US industry, leaving it free to pursue unfair trade complaints. Many analysts expect demands from foreign governments for further political 'suspension agreements' - resulting in market-sharing of sorts in exchange for the dropping of the unfair trade cases - after the Commerce Department announces steep dumping margins next month. Steel producers insist they will follow the cases to their conclusion and will not be pushed into accepting a deal. The International Trade Commission, which must find evidence of injury before anti-dumping and countervailing duties are made permanent, cannot be relied on for support. US steel prices are very depressed, but the cause could be attributed to the recession and over-supply rather than foreign steel. It is not impossible that, under pressure from a new administration, the industry will agree to quotas, providing price floors are built in.</p>

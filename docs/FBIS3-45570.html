The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this while responding to a  question on Sino-British talks on the financial arrangements for  the new airport in Hong Kong.    "The key matter regarding the financial arrangements for the  construction of the new airport in Hong Kong is whether or not  to observe the memorandum of understanding on the new airport,"  Wu said.    In compliance with the relevant provisions of the  memorandum,  the Chinese side has already put forward a whole set of  proposals for settling the debt burden of the future Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region, increasing the cost-effectiveness  of the airport project and intensifying necessary supervisory  mechanism, Wu said.    He added that China now hopes to see a favorable response  from the British side.    "However, some leading officials of the British Hong Kong  Government recently made remarks in public attacking the Chinese  side on this issue," he said.    "This only points to the lack of sincerity for negotiations  on the part of the British side. Therefore, should the talks be  reopened, the British side ought to show its sincerity first."</p>

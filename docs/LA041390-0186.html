			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRESIDENT CONFERS WITH THATCHER;  </P> <P> LEADERS DISCUSS GERMAN REUNIFICATION, ARMS CONTROL  </P> <P> President Bush met today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, conferring  about new pressures sparked by sweeping changes in Europe and helping the  embattled British leader shore up her image at home.  </P> <P> In more than six hours of talks at the storm-swept island resort, the two  leaders sat down for their sixth meeting to discuss the rapid moves toward  German reunification and the ramifications for continuing arms control  negotiations and the future of superpower relations.  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush, speaking to reporters en route to the conference, said  he viewed "as positive" statements from Moscow predicting that a strategic  nuclear arms reduction pact will be ready to approve by the time Bush meets  next month with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "What (Gorbachev) said about instructing his people to go forward, I viewed  that as a very positive statement, and we're sending the same signals to our  negotiators," Bush said.  </P> <P> Additionally, the President said that despite Thatcher's plummeting popularity  at home and her battles on a variety of domestic political fronts, he continued  to appreciate her insight and he restated the importance of the U.S.-British  relationship.  </P> <P> "We're very close together on our assessment on the changes that are taking  place inside the Soviet Union. . . . She has a very clear view of the realities  of the world," Bush said. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  described the first two hours of talks as "warm and productive."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush and Thatcher have "mutually supportive views" on a wide  range of issues, including Eastern Europe, Gorbachev's confrontation with the  breakaway republic of Lithuania and apparent attempts by Iraq to acquire parts  for dangerous and powerful weapons.  </P> <P> The meetings were broken up by a good deal of pomp, circumstance and food.  </P> <P> Upon his arrival, Bush was greeted with military fanfare and a blustery wind  and overcast skies. After a working lunch, he was to join Thatcher and a group  of children in Bermuda's custom of marking Good Friday by flying colorful  kites.  </P></p>

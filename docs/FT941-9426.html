			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Orchestra set to 'enlighten' Europe Perhaps it looks like an Anglo-Dutch merger designed to conquer the market. This week the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment sets out on a two-week European tour. A brisk itinerary will take it through Germany, France, Italy and Austria, where period performances of Mozart and Beethoven symphonies are the exception rather than the norm. In Austria and Germany especially, the traditional symphony orchestras guard the music of the classical era jealously, no doubt unwilling to let such a popular part of the repertoire slip from their grasp. They still have to face the real challenge - namely, that it is period-instrument orchestras these days which are giving the performances of classical music that are alive, exciting and important. Part of the reason is that they have attracted the most interesting conductors. The OAE has Simon Rattle and Frans Bruggen as its Principal Guest Conductors (a good example of Anglo-Dutch collaboration) which serves to underline the point. Rattle is in charge of this tour and his preliminary pair of concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London at the weekend gave a good idea of the vibrant musicianship that is about to set off across the Channel. One of the ironies of 'authentic' performances is that they are faster and tougher than standard symphony orchestras used to be, not dainty minuetting in period costume at all. Nothing could be further from the world of powdered wigs than the Minuet of Mozart's Symphony No 40 as it was played here, thrusting forwards with a ferocious determination, as though intent on sweeping the other couples from the dancing-floor. With the four double-basses on a raised platform, the colour of the symphony was darkened ominously. The night before Haydn's Symphony No 90 had conversely kept to light-hearted fun (naughty Rattle to overplay the surprise ending so flagrantly]). It is strange how self-conscious details of interpretation stick out so in period performances (Rattle is fond of making answering phrases first loud, then soft, which becomes very predictable) but the overall impression of these concerts was of music-making full of life. Schubert's Ninth Symphony was bracing, alert, unexaggerated. Beethoven's 'Pastoral' Symphony had a sunny warmth and spontaneity. The peasants' dance was marvellously vigorous. Klemperer would have stood gasping for breath on the sidelines. European tour sponsored by Goldman Sachs</p>

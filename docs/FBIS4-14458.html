			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Will Russia Become an Importer?"] </F>   [Text] Russia may soon turn from an exporter of weapons  into an importer, certain participants in a conference of  leaders of Russia's defense enterprises, held in Yekaterinburg,  believe. This was held within the framework of the "Weapons  Industry Day" organized by the Russian Federation State  Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry.    Representatives of 70 enterprises and institutions in  Russia's military-industrial complex discussed problems of the  survival of the defense industry in the prevailing conditions.    It was noted at the conference that, whereas in 1990 25  percent of the capacities of the military-industrial complex  produced civilian output, in 1993 only 25 percent of the  capacities of the defense complex were involved in the  production of military output.    Oleg Borisov, general director of the "Promeksport"  association, noted that the volume of Russian weapons exports  has fallen considerably at the same time: Whereas in 1988 it  totaled $12 billion, in 1993 the figure was one-sixth of this.    In their speeches, the participants also spoke of the fact  that the funding of scientific projects in the  military-industrial complex has fallen by a factor of 10-15  compared with 1989. According to the weapons developers, this  will lead to a situation where no one will take Russia seriously  on the weapons market in a few years' time.    The participants in the conference demanded that the  government take fundamental measures to support the  military-industrial complex.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Genting takes an overseas gamble / Examining the Malaysian group's move on Lonrho Drive 35 miles out of Kuala Lumpur into the hills and you come across one of the most successful money making ventures in modern Malaysia. In the cool air, 6,000ft above sea level, is the Genting Highlands resort: a complex of hotels, condominiums, sporting and amusement facilities. Most people do not go to Genting to enjoy the mountain air or play tennis - they go to gamble at Malaysia's only casino, a 60,000 sq ft emporium - one of the biggest such centres in East Asia, patronised by about 10,000 punters daily. The resort is owned by Genting Group, one of Malaysia's biggest and richest companies, which last month confirmed it and associate companies had spent MDollars 150m (USDollars 60m) building a 5.83 per cent stake in Lonrho, the troubled UK conglomerate. Genting's move on Lonrho has prompted speculation about a possible takeover bid: analysts point to Genting's cash hoard estimated to be about MDollars 1bn. Genting has said it made the Lonrho share purchases for 'investment purposes'. Lonrho has been at the centre of controversy since it sold a one-third stake in the UK-based Metropole Hotels group for Pounds 177.5m (Dollars 353.2m) to the Libyan Arab Finance Company, the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) recently warned Lonrho could be placed on the US government's list of banned companies if Libya acquired a shareholding giving it significant influence in the running of a Lonrho company. This has concerned Lonrho's second-biggest shareholder, Fidelity Management Research, the US mutual institutional investor. Lonrho's shares yesterday closed at 68 1/2 p close to its eight-year low of 65 1/2 p. Genting is a diversified group involved not only in gaming and leisure activities but also in plantations - manufacturing palm oil and rubber products, paper mills, property and financial services. But the Genting Highlands casino is Genting's core business, a cash cow viewed with envy by many a corporate rustler. Genting's main companies, listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, are Genting Berhad, the group's investment holding company, Resorts World, which looks after the gaming and hotels business, and Asiatic Development, which oversees the plantations sector. Genting is one of Malaysia's biggest corporate tax payers and employers and as a group accounts for more than 6 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. In the year to December 1991 Genting Berhad's pre-tax profits came to MDollars 581.5m, a 22 per cent increase on 1990. Resorts World contributed MDollars 459.7m or nearly 80 per cent of that figure, almost all of it believed to have come from gaming activities. Genting is what Malaysian analysts describe as 'a highly sensitive company'. Malays, who make up over 50 per cent of Malaysia's population and dominate government, are Moslems. In Islam gambling is 'haram' or unlawful. While the Genting resort is a magnet for thousands of Chinese who flock there from Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in Asia, Malays are not supposed to enter the casino complex. Genting Berhad was formed in the late 1960s with the stated aim of developing the highlands above Kuala Lumpur into an integrated hill resort. In 1971 Genting was granted the sole licence in Malaysia to run a casino. Recently large sums have been spent by the group in efforts to attract what are called 'high roller' gamblers from the increasingly affluent East Asia region. Genting is controlled by Mr Lim Goh Tong, the Malaysian-Chinese multi-millionaire and his family. Like Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, head of Lonrho, Mr Lim is in his mid-70s. Both men share a highly personalised approach to running their businesses. But while Mr Rowland is known for his flair and what at times is deemed to be his rather eccentric corporate behaviour, Mr Lim is part of the tradition of family orientated Chinese businessmen. A member of the Hokkien Chinese dialect group Mr Lim is known as one of Malaysia's cleverest property developers. Mr Lim and one of his sons, runs Genting tightly: he rarely appears in public and although he and other Genting directors were recently awarded handsome retirement gratuity payments, Mr Lim is not known for following a lavish lifestyle. Apart from his Genting interests, Mr Lim has other ventures. He recently gave a Dollars 55m loan to an American Indian tribe - the Mashantucket Pequot - to build a casino on reservation land in Connecticut. Mr Lim is also believed to have secured substantial mining rights in Vietnam. Many of Malaysia's corporate elite are questioning the rationale behind Genting's move into Lonrho. With a positive cash flow of about MDollars 300m per year Genting is actively looking at investment opportunities. But moves overseas are hampered by domestic political considerations. The Malaysian government, on whom Genting depends for the quarterly renewal of its gaming licence, might not look kindly on a leading Malaysian company investing overseas substantial amounts of capital generated within the country. It appears there are those in Genting who feel Lonrho's third-world connections have been treated unfairly by the western financial establishment and media: Lonrho, they feel, is undervalued. The government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, sees itself as a leading spokesman of the third world. Lonrho's extensive connections and business interests in the under-developed regions might make a Genting investment more politically acceptable at home. Others say Genting is chasing a trading opportunity. In the late 1980s it purchased a substantial stake in Cooper's Tires, one of the US's biggest tyre producers. There was speculation then about a takeover bid. In the event, Cooper's shares rallied and Genting sold at a considerable profit. A similar strategy might be under way at Lonrho. The Malaysian corporate community has not given a friendly reception to Genting's latest foray. 'They have been very good on their own home territory but I doubt their ability to mix it with the big boys overseas,' said one leading Malaysian financier. But no one doubts the shrewdness of Mr Lim and his close circle of advisers.</p>

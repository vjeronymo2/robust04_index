			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Golf's lizard hazard A funny thing happened to me on the 12th fairway at the new Windsor Golf and Country Club, just outside Nairobi. My caddy had proudly claimed that the course was the best in Africa. When I suggested that there were some in South Africa that might rival it, he lashed out at me. Or so it seemed. I saw a strange creature writhing on the ground. My caddy had reacted instinctively to a wild animal which had fallen from a tree and wrapped itself around my neck. 'You were lucky,' said the caddie. 'This very bad animal. If it had stung you it would have been bad for you.' Puzzled, and slightly alarmed, I finished the round and gave my protector an extra tip for his heroic action. When I tried to discover the creature's identity, I was met with laughter by Charles, the club pro. 'That,' he said, 'was a harmless chameleon.' For some reason, Africans are scared of chameleons. Unlike the nearby course at Muthaiga, whose fairways have been attracting golfers since the 1930s, Windsor is almost brand new, although you would not guess it from your first glance at the course, which threads its way through coffee farms and forest. On a clear day you can see the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya. The main hotel / club building seems to have been constructed with a built-in turn-of-the-century patina. The designers have made use of existing trees rather than planting new ones. And, this being Africa, colourfully-clad women can be seen every morning weeding out long grass from the edge of the fairways. British Airways Holidays' golf brochure features a seven-night trip that includes five nights' accommodation and breakfast at the Windsor Golf and Country Club, plus a free round of golf per day, plus two nights' full board at the Kichwa Tembo tented camp in the Masai Mara with three game drives per day.

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE HAS A POSITIVE SIDE  </P> <P> I am a very concerned freshman who attends Morningside High School in  Inglewood.  </P> <P> Although I did not participate in the protest, I feel very frustrated that the  media has brought primarily negative attention to our school.  </P> <P> I understand that our school has many problems. They shouldn't be ignored, but  the media makes it seem that Morningside is so bad that students fear walking  from class to class. I'm sure Los Angeles Times readers think bad things about  us. The school has many positive points too.  </P> <P> Many parents may have considered sending their children to Morningside.  However, I'm sure they've lost interest now. Please present both sides of the  picture in further newspaper articles about our school.  </P> <P> TANISHA BAISLEY  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

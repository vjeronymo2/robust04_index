			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Krzysztof Bien under the </F> "Commentaries" rubric]    [Text] The dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan  Kawalec, who was responsible within the Finance Ministry for  ownership transformations in the banking and insurance sector,  may be directly associated with the ill-fated evaluation of the  assets of Bank Slaski. But all signs indicate that the move was  only a pretext which the prime minister decided to use after a  series of incompetent and demagogic statements by politicians  who were not just attacking (out of ignorance or out of  hostility) this specific case of privatization and the stock  market, but who also tried at the same time to bring into  question the legacy of the economic transformations of the last  four years. There are signs that we have indeed the case of a  pretext here: There was just one sentence contained in a  communique issued by the Government's Press Office--namely that  Kawalec's dismissal "is not directly linked with Bank Slaski's  privatization."    It seems that a fundamental goal of dismissing Deputy  Finance  Minister Kawalec--which was accomplished behind the back of his  direct supervisor, that is to say Marek Borowski, deputy prime  minister and finance minister--was to weaken the Finance  Ministry's leadership which--contrary to earlier  predictions--proved resistant to political pressures aiming at  basic revisions to the economic policy. A draft of a  savings-oriented budget for this year prepared by a team headed  by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was not applauded, even by  people outside the Democratic Left Alliance. Those who were most  disappointed were Sejm deputies for the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL], who had demanded significant increases in agricultural  expenditures. But the Finance Ministry is not willing to  compromise as far as their policies go, so faced with that, the  PSL members in the coalition decided to use instruments of  political pressure--Deputy Minister Kawalec has so far been the  only victim of the scheme, but all signs indicate that the goal  was to eliminate someone above him.    The dismissal of Deputy Minister Kawalec--who was one of the  last remaining associates of Leszek Balcerowicz in government  now--most probably will not cause a major crisis inside the  governing coalition. But the manner in which it was  accomplished--that is to say, ignoring tradition-based  procedures--is proof of PSL's strong determination to  disintegrate the framework of a modern market economy which has  already been established, and that is happening in the name of  selfish interests by just one social group. Disadvantageous  changes which are happening in the economy--rising inflation,  compensatory prices, and a slowdown in privatization, among  others--are proof that the disintegration is already taking  place. The process can now be speeded up.</p>

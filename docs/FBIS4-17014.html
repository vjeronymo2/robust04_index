			<p>BFN     [Text] Before the end of the year, Russia is likely to have  a law on oil and gas and another three or four legislative acts  designed to attract foreign investments into the country's oil  and gas industry, said Deputy Energy Minister Anatoliy Shatalov.    He told the Oil and Gas '94 international conference in  Moscow on Wednesday that, in addition, Russia is shortly due to  join the European Energy Charter Treaty, which would provide  more favorable conditions for foreign investors. He said Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's December decree entitling Russian and  foreign businesses investing in the exploration and development  of mineral deposits to part of the minerals extracted from them  made it possible to embark on major oil and gas projects.    One of such projects is Sakhalin 1, Shatalov said. He said  the Russian Economics and Environmental Protection Ministries  would soon consider the project and that a contract on it would  be signed before the end of the year. Another project is soon  due to be launched, Sakhalin 2, to be handled by the MMMSM  international consortium, Shatalov said.    Output-sharing agreements will also be signed with foreign  firms which are to work deposits in the Timan-Pechora oil and  gas province encompassing parts of northwestern Russia's Komi  Republic and Arkhangelsk Region.    Apart from that, Russia's Energy Ministry and the  administrations of the country's Volgograd and Saratov Regions  by May 20 are due to finish talks with the French company Elf  Aquitane on developing oil and gas deposits in the two regions.</p>

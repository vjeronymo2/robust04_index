			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stefan Dietrich: "With a Pronounced Will to </F> Power"]    [Text] Gerhard Schroeder was not exactly spoiled by success  in the last year before his election success. First he was  defeated by Rudolf Scharping in the membership poll on the  national chairmanship of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany]. Then the party leadership abandoned him when he worked  out the energy consensus with Federal Environmental Minister  Toepfer. Toepfer's four-year-old red-green coalition, which he  himself praised as a "model for Bonn," has lost a lot of value  since the theme of jobs pushed aside all other wishes and  visions.    But anyone who thought that Schroeder would now enter the  landtag elections as a beaten man was deceiving himself.  Schroeder was there once again and that is not all--everywhere  he was the first on the scene when it was a matter of jobs. He  helped initiate the highly regarded new worktime model at the  Volkswagen Works and stood by the labor force of the Dasa Works  in Lemwerder that was supposed to be closed. However one  assesses his individual intrigues, the head of the government  was well received in his own federal land. The Schroeder posters  that got by without the name Schroeder and even without the  abbreviation SPD were evidence of his unbroken self-confidence.  "Listen, decide, and act," was the only commentary on the face  pensively supported in his hand. Thus the people were given the  message that the former Juso [Young Socialist] has finally  turned into a trustworthy land father.    Schroeder learned to deal with the adversities of life  early.  The charming bon vivant, whom many see in him and whom he  himself sometimes extols when he presents himself ironically as  the "chairman of the Toscana caucus," is just one side of his  being. The other side is that of the climber, who has developed  a respectable existence as an attorney by way of the second  educational path after very humble beginnings and thereby made  his way in politics. That took toughness, ambition, and  intelligence.    The skilled Lower Saxon--Schroeder grew up in Lippe,  Westphalia--never waited for anyone to call him. He was there  wherever opportunities opened up for him and he developed a fine  feel for what was expected of him in each case. He became  chairman of the Jusos in 1978, Bundestag deputy in 1980, top  candidate of the SPD in Lower Saxony in 1984, and  minister-president in 1990. The stations of his path were by no  means on a straight line. He left a lot of his comrades behind  on the curves.    His extraordinary rhetorical talent always helped him out.  Often enough that got him through. Schroeder's persuasive power  is based on double feedback: he almost always finds the right  tone and then, purely out of enthusiasm for the effect of his  own words, he says what the people want to hear. Hence the role  that he plays of the pragmatic or "doer" suits him much better  than his former role, that of the ideologically set SPD leftist.  Bushy eyebrows and the massive chin indicate the pronounced will  to power of a politician who is just now reaching his 50th  birthday. The fact that Schroeder's ambition will not always be  satisfied in Hannover is well-known in the SPD. Even Engholm  felt the hot breath of the Lower Saxon on his neck. So it will  be with Scharping if he does become federal chancellor very soon.</p>

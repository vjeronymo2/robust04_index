			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> NATIONAL PRIDE FUELS INTENSITY;  </P> <P> SECOND ROUND: BUT EVEN AS THE LEVEL OF PLAY RISES, LUCK STILL WIELDS A HEAVY  HAND IN DETERMINING WHO WILL CELEBRATE -- AND WHO WILL WEEP.  </P> <P> West German soccer Coach Franz Beckenbauer was right: The World Cup began with  the second round.  </P> <P> The games picked up in intensity and left millions of fans of this most human  of games reflecting upon how destiny is, after all, imponderable.  </P> <P> The team that dominated a match did not always win it. These, many fans who  consider soccer not just a game but a test of national resolve and ingenuity,  were left, as so often in soccer, to face the unappealable consequences of what  often seemed random chance.  </P> <P> The second round did not, however, bring a sudden conversion to offensive  soccer from the defensive style of play that marred the first round. The scores  tended to remain low, and the differences narrow.  </P> <P> But as most of the games in the second round progressed, they gathered force  from surges of national pride and the fear of extinction.  </P> <P> Here, on a warm and sunny summer afternoon, in Verona's agreeably middle-sized  but modern stadium -- a nice complement to the little city's large Roman arena,  still handsome after 1,900 years -- Spain and Yugoslavia fought through a  competent but scoreless first half. Had it been the first round, each would  probably have settled for a scoreless tie and slowed the game to a crawl.  </P> <P> In the first-round game between the Netherlands and Ireland, with each team  having one point under its belt, they coasted to a tie that guaranteed both of  them a place in the second round. Watching them play, an observer noted that  they acted as if they were contending not for the World Cup, but the Nobel  Peace Prize.  </P> <P> But Spain and Yugoslavia were going not for peace, but for victory, and as the  game progressed so did the intensity of play. Tied at the end of regulation,  the game went to Yugoslavia with a goal in the 93rd minute on a wickedly  powerful and cleverly placed penalty kick.  </P> <P> A similar urgency drove the games between West Germany and the Netherlands, and  England and Belgium.  </P> <P> The stormy German-Dutch match, perhaps the best of the tournament through the  second round, pitted the Germans' muscular efficiency against the great  technical skill of the Dutch.  </P> <P> A strategic curiosity contributed to the West Germans' 2-1 victory. With each  side down one player because of hotly disputed penalties, the 10-man teams  opened gaps in the field and gave opportunities to the disciplined Germans.  </P> <P> If victory always went to the insistent and skillful aggressor, however,  Belgium would have beaten England in Bologna. As it was, the Belgians had some  bad luck -- their ball hit the goal post twice, a feat hard to achieve if you  tried -- and the English played their traditionally stolid English game: strong  defense with veteran goalkeeper Peter Shilton, solid conditioning, little  passing and the long ball.  </P> <P> It was the long ball that brought Belgium down, 1-0. The score came at the  119th minute, or one minute before overtime would have ended and the game would  have had to be decided by penalty kicks, as it was when Ireland beat Romania  entirely by penalty kicks, 5-4.  </P> <P> Perhaps it was not bad luck alone that stalked Brazil and brought it to its  painful 1-0 loss to Argentina in the dazzling high-tech stadium at Turin.  Playing less defensively than it had in the first round, Brazil dominated the  game but never brought it off. Brazil hit the goal post not twice but three  times.  </P> <P> Argentina had one chance, opened by Diego Maradona, and took it to score.  </P> <P> Brazil, the team everyone loves to watch, has now missed the final since 1970.  In the last three World Cups, Brazil was eliminated after thrilling but  heartbreaking games.  </P> <P> Perhaps soccer has become too tough a game to be won by virtuosity alone.  Perhaps the fact that only three of Brazil's World Cup players came from  Brazilian clubs means that the distinctive panache has been engulfed by the  European clubs' tactical game. Most of the Brazilian players are obliged for  financial reasons to play abroad.  </P> <P> Perhaps the adulation of its fans, 20,000 of whom came to Italy, is alone not  enough to keep Brazilian soccer going in the style the whole world had come to  love. The general affection for Brazilian soccer may even have been an  obstacle, for it may have raised impossible expectations.  </P> <P> On the surface, there was no reason for such long thoughts to haunt the  Italians as the second round ended. Their team had won every game. It was the  only team to have had no goal scored against it. And it has been playing at  home.  </P> <P> Home is not merely Italy, this exuberantly soccer-mad nation. Home is Rome,  where the green, white and red Italian colors hang from the balconies of the  flats of the rich and poor alike, where work stops when soccer starts, and  where, after an Italian victory, the streets of the center of the city are  filled until well after midnight with cheerful people carrying Italian flags  and singing in the soft Roman night under a new moon.  </P> <P> Home is in particular and most especially Olympic Stadium, rebuilt on the  post-World War II Olympic Stadium, which was in turn erected upon the tawdry  mock-Empire Stadium for Mussolini.  </P> <P> There is nothing the least imitative about the new one, except that in its  style it reflects the assertively competent and functionally beautiful  engineering of its ancient ancestors. To hear the roar of the crowd of 70,000  or more when the blue-shirted Azzurri come on the field, to see the sea of  waving Italian flags, to experience the intensity of expectation and sheer  noise as the Italian team builds toward a shot at the goal, is to feel in your  ears, your teeth and your bones that in the late 20th Century, nationalism is  not dead.  </P> <P> Yet it is, at least in Italy, the most palpably benign kind of nationalism, the  joy of country without the anger of those English hooligans who discredit their  country by working out their frustrations on foreign soil. The cheerfulness and  goodness of most of the English fans inside the stadiums, however, added much  to the atmosphere of the games.  </P> <P> Two other nations' fans have shown this quality: the Irish, who are well liked  for their good humor, and the Brazilians.  </P> <P> Twice in a decade we have seen towns in mourning when the Brazilians had to  leave the tournament prematurely. This year, it is Turin th for that mourns.  </P> <P> As the quarterfinals began, the Italian hosts of this World Cup were asking  themselves the nagging question: Just how good are their Blues, the Azzurri?  When, for instance, in a swamp of humidity and a drizzle of tiny gnats in  Olympic Stadium, they beat the plucky Uruguayans, 2-0 -- or earlier, the weak  Americans, 1-0 -- were they doing just enough to win, or did they have it in  themselves to prevail all the way to the end?  </P> <P> The Italian fans ardently hoped for, and we think deserved, a positive  response.  </P></p>

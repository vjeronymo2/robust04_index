			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- During the latest  ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD), no new request was made to Japan for  quickening its economic recovery, a senior Japanese trade  official said Thursday [9 Jun].    A joint communique referring to fiscal and monetary measures  signals "strong expectations" by OECD member countries,  especially the United States, for early economic recovery in  Japan and Europe, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and  industry minister, told a press conference.    But that does not mean they must do something specific,  Kumano said.    The communique issued Wednesday at the end the two-day Paris  gathering said, "where recovery is not yet sustained, eased  monetary policy should be maintained...Where possible,  consistent with the medium-term policy objective of budget  consolidation, fiscal measures will be implemented as necessary  to ensure sustained noninflationary growth led by strong  domestic demand."    The wording shows the "well-balanced position" of the OECD,  Kumano said. But he did not elaborate.    During the ministerial discussion, the U.S. has reportedly  pressed for stronger wording to be used regarding requests to  Japan and Europe.</p>

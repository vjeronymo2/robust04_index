			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: KHD optimistic in spite of 67% tumble KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German motor and engineering group, yesterday announced a 67 per cent decline in profits for 1991, but declared the year a success. Progress in the last six months of the year had more than compensated for first-half losses, the company said. There was also a 'realistic chance' that it would record a profit in 1992, despite severe market conditions. Reporting profits of DM10m (Dollars 6m), compared with DM30m, on turnover up 2 per cent to DM4.12bn, KHD said most of the sales growth had come from plant manufacture, its smallest division. Sales of engines, which account for half the group's business, were down 6 per cent to DM2.2bn. Turnover from farm equipment fell 2 per cent, while plant sales rose 33 per cent to DM849m. Overall orders fell 10 per cent during the year, and order books at the end of December were 21 per cent lower than 12 months earlier. Mr Werner Kirchgasse, chief executive, said recently that profits would have to exceed DM100m before shareholders could expect a dividend. The last payout was in 1986. Peine-Salzgitter, the steel division of Preussag, has forecast falling profits for this year ending September 1992 Mr Kurt Stahler, chief executive, told the annual meeting that conditions in the steel market were becoming more difficult and price increases were urgently needed.</p>

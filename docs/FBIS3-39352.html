			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Richard Norton-Taylor report: "Spy Agencies Put Under Cash </F> Review"]    [Text] The Government has secretly ordered an  unprecedented review of the activities of MI6 and GCHQ  [Government Communications Headquarters], the intelligence  agencies which spend about 700 million pounds a year gathering  information on foreign targets.    The move is disclosed in a confidential letter from Sir John  Adye, GCHQ's director, to staff at the electronic eavesdropping  centre, based in Cheltenham. Sir John says the review, into  Britain's "foreign intelligence requirements and capability,"  will be "thorough and searching."    It will be completed in time for this autumn's public  expenditure battle in Whitehall and its conclusions sent to the  Permanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence Services  chaired by Sir Robin Butler, the Cabinet Secretary, which  includes senior officials from the Foreign Office, Ministry of  Defence, Home Office and Treasury.    The Foreign Office said yesterday the review would be  conducted by Sir Michael Quinlan, former permanent secretary at  the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. It would not be published.    It is clear from the context of Sir John Adye's letter to  his  staff that pressure for the review came originally from the  Treasury. He says that cabinet ministers last year carried out  a thorough review of all the security and intelligence agencies,  including MI5 which is responsible for countering terrorism,  espionage and subversion within Britain.    "The Treasury pointed out that spending on intelligence  since  1979 had grown faster in real terms than most areas of the  public service," Sir John discloses.    He reveals that GCHQ managed to limit Treasury demands for a  5 per cent cut each of the next three years in its proposed  annual budget of 500 million pounds, to between 2 per cent and 4  per cent. The number of GCHQ civilian staff will be cut from  6,500 to 6,000.    Sir John predicts permanent cuts in the money devoted to  GCHQ's two main functions -- Sigint, or signals intelligence  gathered from spy satellites and eavesdropping stations and the  agency's Community Electronics Security Group which devises ways  to protect Britain's coded diplomatic and military traffic.    MI6 -- officially called the Secret Intelligence Service --  gathers intelligence from human sources, including agents  recruited in foreign countries. It employs about 2,000 staff,  and its annual budget is officially estimated at 150 million  pounds. Later this year, it will move into new, 240 million  pounds, headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, overlooking the river  Thames in central London.    MI5 -- the Security Service -- also has an annual budget of  about 150 million pounds and employs about 2,000 full-time  staff. It will shortly move into new 238 million pounds  headquarters on Millbank, across the river from MI6.    It remains unclear whether the new Intelligence and Security  Committee of MPs and peers proposed in the Intelligence Services  Bill will be able to see the Quinlan report. Although its role  will be to "examine the expenditure, administration and policy"  of the agencies, ministers and the heads of the three agencies  will have tight control over what information the committee will  be able to see.    The members of the committee will be appointed by the Prime  Minister after consulting the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / OFT rejects City pleas over report The Office of Fair Trading has decided to publish a controversial report on fixed underwriting commissions which leading City investment banks and institutional investors have been lobbying to have shelved. The report, commissioned by the OFT and prepared by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School, concludes that securities firms and fund managers earn excessive profits on their standing fee for underwriting equity offerings. The report concludes that the fixed fee of 2 per cent distributed between the corporate adviser, broker and institutional investor is too high for the risks undertaken. The securities firms and fund managers fear that publication of the report will reflect badly on the reputation of the City and will be misinterpreted by those outside the industry. It is understood that the OFT's inquiry into fixed underwriting commissions has the backing of the Treasury which has been concerned that the overall cost of raising capital in London is too high and will erode London's competitiveness over time. It is expected that the report will be published later this month or early next month as one of a series of 'research reports' which the OFT has prepared. It is believed that it will include a summary from Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. However, the report will also include a summary of the objections which the securities industry has been raising about its methodology. The securities industry has argued that in rights offerings, the fixed commission of 2 per cent reflects the need to guarantee the placement of a large volume of securities with institutions during a six-week period. Instead, the varying risks of individual issues are reflected in the discount to the prevailing market price at which the new securities are sold. Negotiating fees on each new deal would be a practical impossibility, it says. Lex, Page 20</p>

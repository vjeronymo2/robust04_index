			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Reasons for Big Blue to feel more cheery - IBM It's far too soon to cheer a sustained recovery at International Business Machines, but the stock market expects hard evidence in tomorrow's results that Big Blue is beginning to lose the worst of its big blues. For Mr Louis Gerstner, appointed to 'the toughest job in corporate America' just under a year ago, the results will be the first indication of the effectiveness of a recovery strategy that has often seemed understated if not invisible. The principal task has been to begin the transformation of a company designed to sell mainframe computers at high gross profit margins into an organisation able to survive on the low margins typical of the personal computer business. Mr Gerstner has already grouped mainframes, minicomputers and workstations together and placed a new emphasis on 'client server' computing. With bloodbath in the industry continuing, revenues are likely to be flat at around Dollars 63bn. But the scene should be set for 2-3 per cent growth next year, about half the industry average. Earnings per share of about 63 cents are predicted for the final quarter of 1993, giving a full-year loss of 8 cents per share against a surplus, before restructuring charges and tax of Dollars 2.36. IBM UK was the company's blackest spot last year. Its performance in 1993 may be a litmus test of IBM's recovery.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant Colonel  Oladipo Diya, has warned that the present administration has  shown enough tolerance and will henceforth demonstrate in  unmistakable terms that it is a military regime.    Gen. Diya gave the warning today in Kaduna, in separate  addresses to traditional rulers and leaders of thought in the  northern states. He reiterated that the government's tolerance  in the face of provocations and confrontations by some selfish  elements did not signify weakness, but a deliberate choice to  demonstrate a high sense of maturity, to move the nation forward.    The chief of general staff said Nigerians might have been  wondering why the government had tolerated the open  confrontations against it, embarked upon by some people. The  administration, he explained, was a child of circumstance, which  came to save the country, and had used the method of dialogue to  resolve issues.    Gen. Diya, however, noted that some persons, who claim to  champion democracy, had maintained defiant attitude against  constituted authority by mobilizing newspapers and magazines to  publish falsehood, and openly abuse leaders to destabilize the  government. He observed that these people were calling for open  rebellion against the government and the installation of Chief  Moshood Abiola as president.    Gen. Diya disclosed that at the inception of the  administration, Chief Abiola himself recognized, supported, and  gave advice on the formation of the cabinet, and even nominated  some people for ministerial appointments. He therefore wondered  at the turnaround and the threat by Abiola to install himself  president by June 12 this year. The chief of general staff  warned that the administration would firmly show commitment to  peace and security of the nation.    Earlier, the Shehu of Bornu, (Alhaji Mustafa Omar el  Kaneni),  had reiterated the loyalty of northern traditional rulers to the  Federal Government. About 40 of them attended the meeting with  the chief of general staff, which was also attended by military  administrators from the northern states.</p>

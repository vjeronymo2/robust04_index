			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Valeriy Sevryukov and Sergey </F> Terekhov]    [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- "Today Russia is on the side of the  Bosnian Serbs," Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation  Council, declared at the end of the talks with Radovan Karadzic,  leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He went on to specify that it was  a question of peacekeeping efforts within the framework of the  international process of a Bosnian settlement. "Russian  President Boris Yeltsin took the initiative, and Radovan  Karadzic accepted the initiative and met it half way. The peace  process is continuing despite everything." This is not only a  great achievement by Russian diplomacy, but a demonstration to  the whole world of Russia's independent policy, Vladimir  Shumeyko emphasized.    It is now hard to separate military events from political  ones, he continued. The decision we made yesterday -- we  prepared Tuzla Airport for plane landings and humanitarian  deliveries -- knocks the ground from under the feet of those  forces that would like the confrontation to continue.    Vladimir Shumeyko also stated that he "had a very high  regard  for the meeting and the current visit by Karadzic and his  colleagues," which, according to him, "is of tremendous  importance to the destiny of peoples."    Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, on his part,  said: "Today we spoke about peace and about the possibility of  establishing peace and Russian soldiers are a hope for us." He  noted that U.S. interference in the Bosnian crisis was justified  only if the Americans did not side with anyone in the conflict.  No single country "can take the place of the United Nations,"  he noted. In order to achieve a settlement of the problem it is  important that all of those who participate in this settlement  should display an unbiased towards the various sides. We expect  Russia to be on our side, Karadzic stressed, only on the  question of achieving peace". We do not expect Russia to defend  exclusively our interests."    Radovan Karadzic also said that he does not differentiate  between the peacekeeping forces on grounds of their nationality.  Up to now, the Serbs have had "warm feelings" for all  representatives of the peacekeeping forces regardless of their  nationality. However, the Russian contingent enjoys the  "special trust" of the Serbian population.</p>

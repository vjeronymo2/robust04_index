			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> GROUP TO BUY TREES, SHRUBS FOR BARE AREA  </P> <P> More than 100 trees and shrubs are headed for a bare section of land near the  east end of Laguna Lake through the efforts of the Tree Society of Orange  County.  </P> <P> Jack Heninger, executive director of the Tree Society, said that the group,  together with volunteers who live in the Laguna Lake area, has formed a joint  committee to plant the trees and shrubs.  </P> <P> Fund raising to buy the greenery is now under way, Heninger said, and the  planting is scheduled "come rain or shine, at 9 a.m. on Nov. 10."  </P> <P> The site is at the intersection of Hermosa and Lakeside drives, near the east  end of Laguna Lake.  </P> <P> "Many volunteers are needed to make light work for all and to complete the  planting by noon (on Nov. 10)," Heninger said. Volunteers can call the Tree  Society at (714) 449-7170.  </P> <P> Heninger said the trees are being purchased at a discount from a commercial  nursery. The city of Fullerton has agreed to install water pipe and connectors  at 100-foot intervals along the bare land so that the trees and shrubs can be  watered, he added. -- BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

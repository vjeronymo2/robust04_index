			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: First-term loss deepens at Thomson Corporation First-quarter losses at Thomson Corporation, the Canadian publishing and travel group, deepened to USDollars 63m, or 11 cents a share, against a loss of USDollars 59m, or 10 cents, last time. It blamed slack demand in the travel market during the winter. Newspapers, however, remained profitable, with better advertising in North America. The final loss was struck on revenues of USDollars 1.12bn against USDollars 1.07bn. Seasonal weakness in many operations usually bring losses in the first quarter. Thomson says the latest period was not indicative of the full year. The group, which is one of biggest tour operators in the UK and includes Britannia Airways, had an operating loss of USDollars 34m against a loss of USDollars 29m. The newspaper division, which encompasses 116 dailies and 43 weeklies in North America and regional publications in the UK, posted an operating profit of USDollars 32m against USDollars 30m. The Toronto Globe and Mail posted a 5.2 per cent gain in advertising lineage, and Thomson said national advertising was improving across North America. Textbooks and services to UK newspapers had an operating loss of USDollars 23m against a deficit of USDollars 19m. Brascan, a key Edper-Bronfman holding company, reported a first-quarter net profit of CDollars 15.2m (USDollars 12.5m), or 14 cents a share, against CDollars 137m, or CDollars 1.38, a year earlier. The figures include a CDollars 210m special gain on the sale of John Labatt shares. Excluding special gains, the 1993 quarter loss was CDollars 73m. Brascan said the gains came mostly from the resource units. Pulp and base metals prices rose significantly. The group plans expansion to offset last year's disposal of its main holdings in MacMillan Bloedel and Labatt. It continues to control Noranda, Canada's biggest resource group.</p>

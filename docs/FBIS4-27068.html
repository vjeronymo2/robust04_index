Thus, their  patriotic initiative must be protected and exploited well.  China's reform, opening up, and modernization are now precisely  at a key moment. We hope that the vast numbers of returned  Overseas Chinese and their relatives will, as always, further  emancipate their mind, tap overseas potential, and positively  plunge into economic construction. Overseas Chinese federations  and organizations in various localities should mobilize and  unite the vast numbers of returned Overseas Chinese and their  relatives as well as the Chinese residing abroad to make even  greater contributions to fulfilling all tasks of Shandong.    On behalf of the fourth committee of the Shandong Provincial  Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Lin Shuniang delivered  a report to the congress, entitled "Seize Opportunity, Utilize  Advantages of the Returned Overseas Chinese, and Make New  Contributions to Shandong's Reform, Opening Up, and  Modernization."</p>

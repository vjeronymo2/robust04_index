			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Russian troops seize airport in Tajik capital THE RUSSIAN army said yesterday it had seized control of the airport in Dushanbe, capital of war-torn Tajikistan, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Akbarsho Iskandarov, acting president of the central Asian republic, said in messages to CIS leaders and the United Nations that he was powerless to stop bloody fighting and asked for help, Interfax news agency said. 'The conflict in the south of Tajikistan is growing. It can have unpredictable consequences not only for Tajikistan, but also for the Commonwealth states and, possibly, for the whole world community,' he was quoted as saying. He urged CIS leaders to take urgent measures to help the government normalise the situation. By one estimate Mr Iskandarov's provisional government, which took over after communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev was forced to resign at gunpoint last month, controls only 20 per cent of the state's territory. Moscow rushed in reinforcements to Tajikistan on Tuesday to protect ex-Soviet forces besieged in the republic by rival groups struggling for power. The dispatch of additional troops apparently forced the warring sides in Tajikistan's Kurgan-Tyube region to lift their blockade of a Russian regiment. The armed factions have seized weapons from troops serving in Commonwealth units, now under Russian control, and have taken servicemen hostage. They had also imposed an effective blockade of the Russian garrison in Kurgan-Tyube, 80km south of Dushanbe. Local officials said hundreds of people were killed or wounded in the region in weekend clashes between local opponents of Mr Nabiyev and his supporters from the neighbouring Kulyab area. Neighbouring states have expressed serious concern that the conflict, which is forcing Uzbeks and Russians to flee Tajikistan, could spread across its borders.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pioneer tumbles 50% and sees bleak outlook PIONEER Electronic, the Japanese audio and video equipment maker, suffered a 50 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y16.5bn (Dollars 149m) in the year to March and forecast another 60 per cent drop this year, which it blamed on weak domestic demand for consumer electronics. Consolidated net profits were also down 62 per cent to Y10.8bn, partly due to a Y4.86bn provision for losses on investment in Carolco, the US film company, which is being restructured. Parent sales for the year fell 8 per cent to Y382.8bn, with a 17.7 per cent drop in domestic sales and a slim 0.4 per cent increase in exports. Audio equipment sales were 24.4 per cent lower, while those of video products slipped 12.9 per cent. Car electronics sales advanced 10.5 per cent, and the company hopes demand for car navigation systems will increase this year to counter a continuing fall in demand for karaoke singing systems and other audio equipment. Pioneer recently caused controversy in Japan by suggesting that 35 managers take early retirement, prompting debate over whether the country's famed lifetime employment system was crumbling. Hit by two years of declining consumer electronics sales in Japan, the company is still attempting to cut costs. It said capital spending and manufacturing expenses would be trimmed further this year in the face of 'unpredictable world economy, uncertain currency rates, and intensifying competition'. But the outlook for the company remains bleak. For the current year, Pioneer is expecting sales of Y368bn, down 3.9 per cent, and a 71.8 per cent plunge in net profit to Y3bn.</p>

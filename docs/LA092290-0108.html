			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTS SUSTAIN RECORD WITHDRAWALS IN APRIL  </P> <P> Depositors withdrew a record $15.1 billion from the nation's savings and loans  in April, the government said Friday in another confirmation of the rapid  retrenchment gripping the industry.  </P> <P> The net withdrawal, which was somewhat offset by $2.9 billion in interest  credited to savers' accounts, reduced deposits at the 2,839 S&amp;Ls to $916  billion, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said.  </P> <P> The previous record of $13.4 billion was set three months earlier. Before that,  the record was $10.8 billion set in January, 1989.  </P> <P> Analysts attributed the outflow, the 22nd in 23 months, primarily to the need  to meet stiff capital standards imposed by last year's S&amp;L bailout law,  among other reasons.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Declaration by the Fifth All-Ukrainian Assembly of the </F> Ukrainian People's Rukh]    [Text] The two and a half years of Ukraine's national  independence have demonstrated the impossibility of resolving  the urgent issues of state construction without a decisive  choice of the direction of the state's development. The absence  of strategic definiteness and successiveness in the activities  of the supreme bodies of power, primarily the Supreme Council  and the president, have become the principal causes prompting  the decision to terminate their powers and call early elections.    The elections of the first Ukrainian legislature held in  accordance with the electoral law adopted by the last Supreme  Council of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a law of an  explicitly antistate nature, hampered the creation of a  politically determinate and structured Ukrainian legislature.    Under these circumstances, the issue of an expeditious  choice  of ways to form the bodies of state power and administration,  and their structure is becoming of primary importance. In  particular, this concerns executive power, as well as the  status, functions, and powers of the head of the Ukrainian state.    Confirming its opposition to the current executive power and  its leadership, and supporting the resolution by the Small  Council on the expediency of postponing presidential elections  until a later date when the above issues have been resolved, the  Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, in  light of the current circumstances, believes it advisable to  refrain from nominating a Rukh candidate for president.    The People's Rukh's Small Council has been requested to  finalize the decision regarding Rukh participation in the  presidential election campaign.    We are appealing to all democratic and national-patriotic  forces to join their efforts to prevent Ukraine from embarking  on the procommunist and proimperial path.</p>

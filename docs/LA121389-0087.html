			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE PAPER UNDER FIRE FOR COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> JOURNALISM: AUTHOR INTENDED ARTICLE ON ISRAELI MISSILES TO BE ANTI-NUCLEAR, BUT  CRITICS READ IT AS ANTI-SEMITIC.  </P> <P> An article and political cartoon attacking Israel in the Saddleback College  newspaper last week has drawn harsh criticism from administrators, teachers and  students, who charged that the opinion pieces were anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> The strongly worded article and accompanying cartoon, written and drawn by  journalism student Michael S. Boren, criticized Israel for stockpiling nuclear  weapons. The headline above the article states: "Israel enters nuclear arms  race."  </P> <P> The cartoon depicts a Hanukkah menorah that is tipped by singing nuclear  warheads instead of candles. On each warhead is a Star of David. The warheads  are drawn with smiles, singing: "We Wish You a Happy Holocaust."  </P> <P> Although Boren claims the commentary, which appeared in the Dec. 7 issue of the  Lariat, was meant to draw attention to the dangers of nuclear warfare, the  piece was seen as hateful by Jewish students and employees and a case of  extremely poor judgment by administration officials.  </P> <P> "Using a Hanukkah menorah as a rocket launching pad is sacrilegious," said  Frieda Gelber, a Jewish student and employee at the 23,000-student two-year  college. "I was very angry when I saw it."  </P> <P> While Gelber and other Jewish students said that they have written to Gov.  George Deukmejian, local rabbis and Jewish community leaders in Los Angeles and  Orange counties, top college administrators were requesting that the newspaper  print a retraction and an apology.  </P> <P> They said that the article, although protected by the First Amendment as the  opinion of the writer, overstepped the bounds of responsible journalism.  </P> <P> "The first time I saw that, I was shocked and appalled," Saddleback College  President Constance M. Carroll said on Tuesday. "I recognize as a historian  that the Holocaust is unprecedented in its tragedy. And the use of the  religious symbolism was inexcusable."  </P> <P> Left Up to Editors  </P> <P> Carol Ziehm, faculty adviser to the weekly student publication, said that she  met with the student staff members on Tuesday and discussed Carroll's request.  </P> <P> Her meeting with the students followed meetings with Carroll, who urged that  the article be recanted.  </P> <P> But, Ziehm said, it would be up to the students to decide if they will print a  retraction when the next edition is published on Thursday.  </P> <P> "What we are talking about here is something precious. That is freedom of  speech," Ziehm said. "It is very difficult to work within that realm without  some strong reaction."  </P> <P> Ziehm said that she read the article and saw the cartoon before it was  published, but did not advise student staff members to withhold its  publication.  </P> <P> "I was fairly certain that it was the type of strong statement that would evoke  some response," Ziehm said. "But that is something we encourage in our opinion  columns."  </P> <P> She said that although the newspaper has received only three letters to the  editor about the commentary so far, she has gotten "considerably more phone  calls." She said that she is encouraging callers to write rebuttals to the  editor, Steve Sakach.  </P> <P> 'We Regret the Insult'  </P> <P> Richard J. Sneed, chancellor of the Saddleback Community College District, said  that he and other college administrators have received an onslaught of calls  from people condemning the article and cartoon.  </P> <P> "We regret the insult to the community," Sneed said. "This was insensitive and  arrogant and does not reflect good journalism."  </P> <P> Boren's article, which makes numerous references to the ongoing conflict  between Israel and its Arab neighbors, begins with a statement that "the only  thing holy about a holy war is that holes get shot in people."  </P> <P> "After years of engaging in conventional warfare with the Palestinians, Israel  finally has launched itself into the nuclear age by announcing that it is now  the proud owner of nuclear weapons."  </P> <P> Boren goes on to write that "since the occupation of Palestine . . . the  Israelis have displayed . . . that they will resort to any means to protect  their religious claim on the land."  </P> <P> The short article ends with: "The Israelis claim that they have a divine right  to Palestine. If they are indeed God's chosen people, though, it would seem  that God might have made a better choice."  </P> <P> Boren defends the article, and says that his intention to write about his  anti-nuclear views was misunderstood.  </P> <P> "It was totally taken the wrong way," he said.  </P> <P> Because of that, Boren said, he does not intend to write a retraction or an  apology. He said, however, that he will write a second opinion piece that  outlines his anti-nuclear views more clearly.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to point out the dangers of nuclear weapons," Boren said. "I  was more concerned about the politics. That was mainly the gist of it."  </P> <P> Boren said that he is not anti-Semitic. "My girlfriend is Jewish," he said.  "Her grandfather was in a concentration camp."  </P> <P> He conceded, however that his article's final paragraph could have been  omitted. "This proves to me that there are boundaries that you can't cross," he  said.  </P> <P> But some Jewish students called for Boren to give up his position as the  Lariat's art editor.  </P> <P> "I respect freedom of speech, but this went too far," said student Sean Cook,  who said that he and his rabbi will also deliver letters to the newspaper  within the week.  </P> <P> "You have to think about what you are doing, especially in this (college)  community, where there is so much diversity.  </P> <P> "Not only Jews, but every race needs to be aware of what people are writing in  the paper," said Cook, a 19-year-old freshman. "It's not really right for any  ethnic or religious group to be abused."  </P></p>

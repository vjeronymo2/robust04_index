			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: HOMECOMING FOR CHANDRA WIDODO PRAJITNO KOESOEMODIPRODJO  </P> <P> It was 14 years ago this month that Chandra Widodo Prajitno Koesoemodiprodjo  came into our lives and changed them forever.  </P> <P> His has never been the same, either.  </P> <P> Chandra, or C.W. as we called him (he never did understand the great sense of  accomplishment felt by those who mastered his last name), was a tall, gangling  18-year-old who had never been far from the very protective arms of his mother  in Bogor on the island of Java.  </P> <P> A month earlier, we had answered the urgent appeal of the headmaster at our  son's school. Another family had been forced to back out of an agreement to  take an AFS student for a year and the paper process was irretrievably churning  along somewhere. There was the distinct possibility that a foreign student  would be traveling a long way to nowhere.  </P> <P> Our only real concern in volunteering was that exchange students are normally  placed in a home that has a child the same age. Our son was only 12, so we  sought the counsel of the then-current AFS student, a rake from Costa Rica who  was the teddy bear of every teen-age girl within a six-mile radius -- and the  nightmare of every one of their fathers who had ever seen a Fernando Lamas  film.  </P> <P> He said he would rather have been placed in a home with a younger or older  child, that he thought it was asking a lot of any American high school senior  to share the biggest year of his life with an exotic visitor guaranteed  everything from local press to a special spot in the school yearbook.  </P> <P> So we filled out the papers, went through all the interviews, painted the spare  room, read up on Indonesia and Islam -- and worried that we'd made a terrible,  terrible mistake.  </P> <P> That fear became a conviction when he arrived two weeks earlier than expected.  He was terrified and so were we.  </P> <P> He spoke almost no English, even though the information packet provided by AFS  said he was proficient in the language (our suspicions had been aroused, but  only mildly, by the letter of recommendation from his English teacher that said  he "shoes grait interest in meny tings").  </P> <P> We, of course, spoke no Indonesian. Our son was away at camp and we seemed  incapable of breaking the ice alone. Chandra sat in his room and furiously  wrote in his dairy. ("I want to go home. This place is awful." Things like  that, we later learned.)  </P> <P> We then made his life even more miserable by sending him off on a two-week-long  Explorer Scout trek in the High Sierras. His information packet said he was  involved in Scouting, but the temperate highlands of Java are a far cry from  the snow-covered Sierras. He lost 15 pounds from his already-spare frame and  spent a lot of time on the trip looking for a land bridge back to Asia.  </P> <P> That was the beginning.  </P> <P> Chandra came home last week and brought his bride of two weeks. He may have  been more nervous this time than he was in 1975, so anxious was he for family  approval. He needn't have worried; he made a fine choice. My new  daughter-in-law is lovely, bright, sweet and, like him, calls me Dad. If all  goes well, I should be a grandfather within a few years.  </P> <P> What transpired in that year so long ago that transformed Chandra from a  stranger in our midst to a full-fledged, important member of the family?  </P> <P> I'm not sure I know, but it's a phenomenon experienced by most people who open  their homes and hearts to foreign students.  </P> <P> For one thing, we were not alone. AFS and most similar programs have strong  support groups for the students and host families.  </P> <P> The students in the area get together once a week to compare notes, talk about  their problems and share experiences. So do the host parents and siblings. In  addition, each AFS student has what is called a "family friend," an adult who  is available on a confidential basis for any help required.  </P> <P> And sometimes -- though not very often -- the match isn't right and the student  is placed in a different home.  </P> <P> In our case, Chandra's attendance at a small private boys' school was helpful  too. There were only about 20 members of the senior class, so we had them all  over for a get-acquainted party and served Indonesian food.  </P> <P> We traveled a bit too, before the school term began, hitting nearby cities and  tourist attractions.  </P> <P> By the time classes started, we seemed to have settled in. An only child  himself, Chandra took particular delight in the antics of a sometimes  incorrigible younger brother, and our son was enormously proud when Chandra  made the football team.  </P> <P> He was able, soccer-style, to kick 50-yard field goals, and even though he  wound up as all-state punter, I'm not sure to this day he understands the rules  of the game.  </P> <P> Once, when he was called in with only a few seconds left on the clock to save  the game, the coach said to me: "He knew there was a crisis; he just didn't  know what it was."  </P> <P> The year that began so slowly suddenly picked up speed after Christmas. We all  knew the time was nearing for Chandra to return to Indonesia, but we didn't  talk about it.  </P> <P> We just tried to cram as much living and as many experiences as we could,  making sure he got to see San Francisco, Big Sur, Mexico, the Grand Canyon.  </P> <P> Then, it was over and we all gathered at the airport to see Chandra and his  fellow AFS students off. There were a lot of tears, from both students and  families. At some point, Chandra said he was sad, but "I don't cry."  </P> <P> Within days, a letter arrived postmarked Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in which he  confessed that when the plane left Hawaii, he had become inconsolable and that  he had cried for hours.  </P> <P> He was not alone.  </P> <P> In the years between, he wrote, we wrote. He called, we called. We exchanged  gifts and shared problems. We watched in dismay as cultural tradition delayed  his marriage for years; he was equally dismayed when my own marriage fell  apart.  </P> <P> We just do all the things families do, including staging some joyous reunions.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zbigniew Ostrowski, press spokesman for the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Cooperation, asked to comment on THE  WASHINGTON POST article that reported on Poland's sales of  modern Soviet military equipment to the United States, said that  the matter should be treated as press revelations. Apart from  this, in his opinion it is a matter for historians. Even if  such sales did take place, they would have been secret and could  now probably only be traced in the Ministry of National Defense.    Zbigniew Ostrowski pointed out that the most modern Soviet  weapons have never been available to Poland, so they could not  have been sold to the Americans. He also emphasized that the  United States does not make available the most modern weapons to  its allies, either.</p>

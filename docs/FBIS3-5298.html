The bank's survey of 800 companies produced  an index reading of 43.9, up a tiny 0.4 point from January but  staying below 50, the dividing line between an improvement or a  decline in confidence.    Although it was the second month of modest improvement in  still-depressed sentiment, the survey shows that the pace toward  recovery continues to drag, said the bank, a quasigovernmental  institution geared toward smaller firms.    Sales fell 4.3 percent last month from a year earlier,  widening from the previous February's 2.5 percent year-on-year  sales slump, according to the survey, taken in mid-February.    More companies continued to say sales prices were falling  and  to predict another fall in March. As a result, companies  reporting worsening profitability and financing continued to  predominate.    The survey's profitability index, measuring the percentage  citing improvement minus that saying things are worsening, was a  minus 12.1, slightly better than the minus 12.5 percent of  January, with a minus 9.3 forecast for March.    The financing index was minus 5.9, slipping from January's  minus 5.8, with a March forecast of minus 5.0.    Companies continued to report stock and employment excesses.  The product inventory index, in which a minus reading indicates  a surplus, worsened to minus 13.6 from minus 12.2, with a March  forecast of minus 10.0. The employment index improved to minus  4.0 from minus 5.9, with a March forecast of minus 3.9.</p>

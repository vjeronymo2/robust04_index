			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Property: Schneider's list of building woes - The developer's failure does not herald a general market collapse Frankfurt's futuristic Zeilgalerie complex has acquired a special importance since the collapse last week of the Jurgen Schneider property group with debts of more than DM5bn. The Zeilgalerie was one of Mr Schneider's most audacious developments and is at the heart of Deutsche Bank's allegations of fraud against the failed developer, who has vanished leaving behind the ruins of Germany's most spec-tacular property crash since 1945. Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and also the largest single creditor to the failed property empire with an exposure of DM1.2bn, said last week that Mr Schneider falsified documents and data when making an application for the financing of Zeilgalerie. These disclosures by Deutsche Bank have put the bank on the defensive. Critics say Mr Schneider's ability to falsify documents successfully highlights weaknesses in Deutsche Bank's lending practice and points to how the crisis arose in the first place. The main elements of the Deutsche Bank disclosures are: Deutsche Bank loaned Schneider a total of DM415m against the Zeilgalerie project; according to property consultants, the complex has a current market value of DM160m, less than the DM200m Mr Schneider originally invested in the venture. The bank claimed it was misled over Zeilgalerie's total lettable space. Deutsche Bank released the latest DM45m tranche of the loan on the premise that the complex contained 20,000 square metres of lettable space. In the event, the property contains only 9,000 sq m of lettable space. The bank agreed to the loan on the basis of a rental projection for the centre of at least DM57m a year; the true figure turned out to be about DM8m. These discrepancies have provoked dismay and ridicule in Germany's banking and property circles. 'I find it amazing,' said one leading German property analyst. 'The controls in the German banking industry are normally so tight that something like this just can't happen,' he added. 'The mistakes that have been made here are inexcusable,' said a senior Frankfurt investment banker. 'The Zeil (the street where Zeilgalerie is located) is less than half a mile from the Deutsche Bank headquarters. It (the bank) lent twice the market value and now it sheepishly says that it lent against 20,000 sq m (of lettable space) when there are really only 9,000 sq m. Were they asleep?' These charges of irresponsibility are rejected by Mr George Krupp, the Deutsche Bank board director now responsible for the bank's exposure to Schneider. 'We have no evidence of serious mistakes at this bank,' he said. Mr Krupp told German newspapers that the bank has launched an enquiry into its credit procedures in the light of the Schneider collapse. The revelations have proved an embarrassment for Deutsche Bank. But they have also prompted other German banks to take a much tougher line on outstanding requests for property finance. Analysts suggest that the worst-hit banks from the Schneider fall-out are unlikely to sanction new property development loans until their own enquiries on internal credit procedures are under way. This tightening of credit to smaller developers may prove to be one of the most significant repercussions of the Schneider affair on the rest of the property market. Other lasting effects on the market may be changes in the bankruptcy laws to offer more protection to smaller creditors, and increased pressure on German valuers to raise standards. The broader question about the impact of the Schneider collapse on the property investment market remains unclear. The German market is undoubtedly going through a tough time. Recession, which took hold in mid-1992, has led to a sharp fall in office rents. The office market has been hit particularly hard because the economic slowdown has coincided with a wave of new office schemes coming on to the market. Jones Lang Wootton, property advisers, said that the take-up of office space fell by 7.5 per cent in 1993, pushing up vacancy rates in excess of 7 per cent of the total office stock. Rising vacancy rates and weak tenant demand have pushed office rents down by between 10 per cent and 25 per cent in larger German cities. The combination of rising vacancy rates and falling rents is familiar to many other property markets around the world. However, the German property downturn differs in important respects from its international counter-parts. The main difference is that investors' demand for property in Germany remains relatively strong. Although the worsening outlook for rental growth dampened demand in 1992 and much of 1993, prices stabilised half way through last year; this was largely the result of a reduction in interest rates and an upturn in demand from investors. The most prominent domestic investors have been 'open-ended' property funds, which operate in a similar manner to unit trusts. DTZ Zadelhoff, property advisers, believes that the 'open-ended funds' currently have about D14bn available for investment. This strong domestic demand for property is likely to limit the fall-out from the Schneider affair, say property brokers. 'The impact on the market will be extremely limited,' said Mr Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's German operations. Schneider's creditor banks would face a total estimated loss of DM1.5bn-DM2bn if they disposed of the failed group's properties, as they stand. However, the banks have said that they will hold back from rapid sales. The majority of the Schneider properties are development or refurbishment projects, which will be completed and let before they are sold. The banks are unlikely to experience any difficulty in finding buyers for most of the Schneider portfolio, which include some of Germany's most prestigious commercial developments. Ultimately the investment market's resilience may depend on whether the Schneider case has a knock-on effect. The banking and property industries insist that Schneider is a one-off collapse, caused by fraud and the excessive prices the company paid for its properties. When the scale of the losses first became apparent, Schneider's creditor banks declared that the failed group's difficulties were not representative of those of the domestic market as a whole. Mr John Morgan of DTZ Zadelhoff said that the Schneider case did not herald a more general collapse in the market. 'Mr Schneider is to a large extent a single case. He did not mix with other developers and institutions. He very much played his own game,' he said. 'If the rumours are correct, this is merely a matter of fraud and not weakness in the property market,' he said.</p>

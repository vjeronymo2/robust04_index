			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Future of couture comes under scrutiny THE hotels of Paris - those with five stars, at least - are filling up. Socialites and celebrities are again flooding into the city for its haute couture collections. The 21 French fashion houses showing their collections over the next five days desperately need a successful season. For years they have accepted that they would lose money on couture - where one evening dress sells for anything up to Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 16,600) - but continue to bankroll it because of the publicity it attracts for the scents and sunglasses that really make money. Even so, the fashion houses are now under intense financial pressure after two years of recession, so much so that the French government has commissioned a formal review of the future for haute couture. High fashion at this level has long been seen as an anachronism: the rules on who can or cannot call themselves a couturier were laid down in 1947 and owe more to the austerity of post-war Paris than to the exigencies of a modern European economy. The rules cover everything from how many people a fashion house must employ to how many garments it must show. Add to the bill the hiring of supermodels  -at anything up to Dollars 20,000 each a show - to make sure the paparazzi arrive and take lots of pictures, and the overheads soar. Haute couture is so costly (many hours alone are spent in personal fittings) that only very few can afford to buy it. After enjoying a brief revival in the bullish 1980s when women with surnames like Trump and Gutfreund flaunted their husbands' profits in Paris, the market declined. And last winter's collections were a disaster: models, and clients, were too frightened to fly from New York to Paris because of the Gulf war. Yves St Laurent saw its couture sales fall sharply, after having already slipped to FFr39m (Pounds 4m) in 1990 from FFr44m in 1989. The whole market in 1991 declined by 15 per cent to FFr282m, according to the Chambre Syndicale de Couture Parisienne, which presides over the shows. Yet the Paris houses still plough in money because of the publicity. It can be no coincidence that the mainstream investors who moved into fashion in the 1980s (LVMH with Christian Dior and Christian Lacroix and Orcofi with Lanvin) have not only increased the investment in couture but have encouraged their designers to become more and more flamboyant. Some critics claim that the collections are now just a publicity stunt and the clothes are designed not to be sold but to generate press coverage. 'Self parody' crops up again and again in the reviews. Stunts notwithstanding, the fashion houses are stuck with couture. Balmain's announcement last year that was withdrawing from the scene caused such an uproar among its Japanese licensees that it was forced to backtrack. Somehow, the French government has to find a way of hauling high fashion into the 1990s without tarnishing its traditions. The report that will land on the desk of industry minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn in March is expected to recommend modest changes to the 1947 rules so that the ritual of the collections stays more or less the same. But the business of haute couture will be at least a little less expensive.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexican farmers loath to abandon land fight - A look at conflicting interests and market perceptions beneath the free trade banner MARGARITO Montes, leader of the Popular Farmers' and Workers' General Union, represents the new hope of Mexican agriculture. A rabble-raising populist, Mr Montes became famous by invoking the spirit of Emiliano Zapata, Mexico's revolutionary peasant leader, and forcibly taking land from the government and rich land-owners. Now Mr Montes is the very picture of modernity. He supports free trade with the US, the government's market-orientated agricultural reforms, and has renounced his membership of the leftish Party of Democratic Revolution. His union is now participating in a Dollars 100m dairy farm project with Canadian investors. Mr Montes has been rewarded handsomely for his conversion, with his union receiving considerable government support to set up the dairy project in Veracruz. But for Mexico's agriculture ministry it is worth the effort. If Mexico is to compete with the US and Canada under free trade, peasant leaders will have to stop fighting for land, and start investing in it. Without substantial investment in agriculture, Mexico cannot hope to compete with the US and Canada. As a result of decades of land invasions, permanent agrarian reform, and legally-enshrined communal property rights, most Mexican farms are under-capitalised, and too small to be productive. The agricultural sector accounts for just 3 per cent of commercial loans, but employs 25 per cent of the work-force. The typical size of a maize plot is 3.9 hectares, against 39.9 in the US. Mexico is particularly vulnerable in maize, where yield per hectare is just 1.9 tonnes, compared to 7.4 in the US. Mexico has protected its roughly 2m maize farmers by restricting imports, so that Mexican maize prices are double those in the US. Under a free trade agreement it is probable that protection will be removed over 15 years, with tariffs being lowered and quotas increased over this period. Most of these maize farmers are already extremely poor and a fall in maize prices will force many to leave their farms. Enter Mr Margarito Montes. The government hopes that joint ventures such his union's in Veracruz with Ault Food of Canada will become a model of enterprise between peasants and the private sector, and soak up the displaced maize farmers. At the end of May some 140 joint ventures had been formed between the business groups and small property owners or ejidatarios (common property owners), in wheat, vegetable, and poultry production, among other areas. Not everyone is convinced that Mexico's agricultural sector will enter the first world as quickly as the government would like. Mr Montes still ends his speeches with 'Viva Zapata', thus bowing to the revolutionary leader. His followers respond enthusiastically, and, when asked, expect to be handed out land soon.</p>

Finished Leningrad Higher Combined Arms  Command School imeni S. M. Kirov, the Frunze Military Academy  and the General Staff Military Academy.    Served in positions from platoon commander to commander of a  naval infantry division in the Black Sea and Pacific fleets.  Commanded an army corps. Since September 1991 has been first  deputy chief of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Main  Cadres Training and Assignment Directorate.    [End box insert]    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Valentin Alekseyevich, we live in a  difficult time, a time of trial and error, a time of "polishing"  laws and establishing young Russian statehood. Not everything is  turning out for us for now as we would have liked, as was  planned and as was promised the people, and above all, perhaps,  in the social sphere, which fully affected people in  shoulderboards... Letters and complaints come to state  authorities, to the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and  to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA from servicemen and military retirees  concerning a violation of their rights to privileges established  by laws in force. Therefore permit me to converse with you on  behalf of our readers, a portion of whose letters you  familiarized yourself with the day before.    Here is the most typical one. It came from Lieutenant A.  Yemelyanenko, who serves in the Baltic. The officer justly  complains that he is not being paid an interest-free loan and  the so-called appointment allowance. Officials refer to the fact  that his personal file has not arrived in the unit from his  previous duty station and it is impossible to give out the  money. The lieutenant concludes the letter with a question: "Why  do I have to fulfill contract terms and the Ministry of Defense  does not?"    [Yakovlev] Naturally we could not ignore this  letter. First of all we contacted the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense Main Military Budget and Finance Directorate  and received appropriate explanations. In particular they  clarified that an interest-free loan for initial acquisition of  household goods has been paid since March 1993 in accordance  with the Russian Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen."  It is paid for three years in an amount up to 13 times the base  pay and allowances. As of today it is over 1.5 million, which,  you will agree, is no small amount for young officers for the  present difficult times, although, of course, sad blunders also  occur.    In addition to this, we phoned the unit where Lieutenant  Yemelyanenko presently serves and learned that by this time the  personal file already had arrived, about which the officer has  been informed. Funds will be paid him according to the  prescribed procedure.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Letters from Lieutenant V. Tovmach,  Senior Lieutenant S. Levkov and Major A. Dadykin contain  uneasiness over the uncertainty of social guarantees to  servicemen performing contract military duty. You will agree  that there are questions here too, as they say... And the main  one is Did we introduce contract service a little early?    [Yakovlev] The organization of performance of  contract military service matured long ago in the midst of our  society. As of today it is a very important element in elevating  Russian Federation Armed Forces combat readiness, democratizing  the Army (Navy) environment, and strengthening discipline and  law and order in military collectives. It is also without  question that this system can operate effectively only on  condition that the interested parties (a specific serviceman on  the one hand and the state in the person of the Ministry of  Defense on the other) comply with their commitments fixed in the  corresponding contract.    Unfortunately, the reality is such that the mechanism of  mutual responsibility does not always operate, through the fault  of both parties. Take just time periods for concluding  contracts. Social guarantees are given officers for the entire  transition period, which is established until 31 December 1994,  but this should not at all mean that those servicemen who wish  to continue military service invariably will sign an application  about their desire to serve the homeland further on the last day  set aside for this procedure.    Circumstances force us to take many factors into account  which influence this situation. First is the accounting of  officers on whom one can plan for replacement, for appointment  to a higher position, and for schooling. Naturally we cannot  consider those who vacillate and have not determined their  choice as being potential candidates. Therefore explanatory and  organizational work continues vigorously--not forcible actions  by commanders (supervisors) to conclude contracts with those who  have not yet concluded them. Some military district commanders  issued orders on this account. This also was done in particular  in the Ural Military District, from which Major Dadykin's letter  arrived. The deputy chief of the Ural Military District Cadres  Directorate reported that a contract for performing duty under  paragraph "a" for a period of 5 years already had been concluded  with the officer based on his application.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Valentin Alekseyevich, there are many  letters in which officers are perplexed as to why the Ministry  of Defense permits them to conclude contracts only under  paragraph "a," although other forms of contracts had been  proclaimed at one time. Air Force Captain A. Andryushkin from  Pskov Oblast, Captain A. Kochetkov from Maritime Kray and many  others ask about this.    [Yakovlev] The decision on having officers  conclude contracts only under paragraph "a," part 1, Article 33  of the Russian Federation Law was made by the Russian Federation  Minister of Defense based on the right granted him to establish  forms of contracts and the procedure for concluding them  (paragraph 6 of Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree No  4983-1 of 19 May 1993 "On Certain Measures Connected With Use of  the Russian Federation Law On Military Obligation and Military  Service'"). This was substantiated by the need to maintain a  proper level of troop strength with the Russian Federation Armed  Forces reform and a large number of officer reassignments.  Officers who enter military service from the reserve can  conclude contracts under paragraphs "b" and "c."    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] We also linked great hopes for  solving acute social and everyday problems with the Russian  Federation Law "On the Status of Servicemen," which entered into  force on 1 January 1993. I recall that entire lines of people  wishing to purchase pamphlets with this and other legislative  acts formed in our editorial offices. And what happened? Many  provisions of this very necessary law are not in effect.  Moreover, there is talk of revising the others...    [Yakovlev] Let us dot the "i's." The main portion  of provisions of this document, which is really very important  for strengthening the Armed Forces, succeeded in being  implemented immediately after it was adopted. Above all this  concerns norms of pay and allowances and certain other  supplementary payments.    At the same time, it is impossible to disagree with  servicemen's concern over further delay in putting certain rules  of this law into effect (transportation privileges, payment of  monetary compensation at the moment the serviceman and his  family go on leave, property insurance and so on). It is the  responsibility of the Russian Federation Government to develop a  mechanism for implementing these privileges, but necessary  government decisionmaking has dragged out unjustifiably despite  the fact that the Ministry of Defense has made proposals on this  score.    The main reason is the extremely difficult economic  situation  in the country and absence of finances for implementing the Law  "On the Status of Servicemen." But the law exists, and any  arguments contradicting it naturally are not recognized (either  in military collectives or by military courts at various levels)  as sufficient for "freezing" established privileges. People ask  for what is due them, but there is no possibility of satisfying  their requests. Voluntarily or not, the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense ends up in the role of hostage.    The situation which has formed in this area cannot last  indefinitely. Unhealthy sentiments on this score are ripening in  the troops (fleets). There also is open speculation in the  example of some not too respectable servicemen (especially among  young officer graduates of military schools), who figure on  leaving the Armed Forces in this way with maximum advantage to  themselves.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] But is any kind of solution at all  seen here?    [Yakovlev] Several options for solving the problem  are possible theoretically.    The first and most radical one is to legislatively repeal  privileges which did not come about as unsupported by necessary  appropriations. It is not hard to predict the consequences of  such a step: exacerbation of the sociopolitical situation in  military collectives. Servicemen will consider this as nothing  other than fraud on the part of the state. The Armed Forces will  suffer not only moral, but also military-political harm.    The second way is for fastest implementation of all rules of  the law without consideration of the Armed Forces' real economic  capabilities. That approach outwardly is attractive, but at the  existing and planned level of financing of defense expenditures  it will only drive the "disease" inside the body. The Army and  Navy economy simply will not bear up under this additional load.    In my view, the talk today can and must be about phased  implementation of the law's rules that have not yet been put  into effect, with specific financing of these measures from the  federal budget, and this has to be resolved at the legislative  level.    [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Military service is a special kind of  state activity. A person in shoulderboards is bound by many  restrictions and is largely unprotected. Higher pay and  privileges are called upon to stimulate military service of  officers and warrant officers and compensate for all possible  material and moral costs. This is covered by laws, but it is  different in real life. Officers V. Kozin and V. Raskatov of the  Tambov garrison and others write that this hits the prestige of  military service hard and prompts young officers to "flee" to  "civilian life." How great is this outflow?    [Yakovlev] Yes, servicemen's insufficient social  protection and comparatively low standard of living contribute  to a drop in prestige of service and to disillusionment of a  considerable portion of the youth in selecting a military  profession. As a result there is a drop in Armed Forces manning  and a continued outflow of young officers from the Army. More  have begun to be discharged both among those who are rather  experienced but who have lost prospects in service and among  those from 31 to 40 years of age needed in the Army and Navy.    As a result, military service as a special kind of activity  is not the most prestigious profession today. Let us take a  civil aviation pilot and military pilot for comparison. Both  experience similar mental stresses and have identically high  responsibility, but the aircraft commander at Sheremetyevo-2  receives up to 3 million rubles a month, while an aircraft  commander who is a major and a first class pilot with 15 years  or more service receives approximately 400,000 rubles, i.e., 5-6  times less.    This is just one example, but many can be found, and the  comparisons will not favor servicemen. It is not surprising that  competition for military educational institutions continues to  fall. In 1992 it was 1.6 persons per slot and in 1993 it is  already 1.4, and that is for schools providing free education in  specialties that are in short supply under civilian conditions.  This trend is most noticeable in Air Force and Navy military  educational institutions, where competition essentially was  absent in 1993. As a result the schools are forced to accept  civilians who are on the borderline of professional suitability.    A trend also has become apparent toward an increased number  of cadets expelled immediately before signing a contract. The  basic reason is lack of desire to learn and disillusionment in  choice of a military profession. Over 50 percent of all cadets  who have left school have been expelled from military  educational institutions for these reasons.    In this situation, further delay in placing into effect even  a portion of privileges proclaimed by law can lead unavoidably  to a final fall in prestige of military service, which will not  enable manning the Army and Navy to the extent which permits  keeping combat readiness at the proper level.    In conclusion I will emphasize that there has to be a  precisely adjusted, long-range social policy with respect to the  Army. Only this will permit removing many acute questions which  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers ask.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Signet to close remaining Ratners stores The rise and fall of Ratners, one of the best-known retailing names of the 1980s, was completed yesterday as Signet, the jewellery group, said the name would vanish from the high street within the next few months. The group, which announced increased pre-tax losses for the year to January 29 although it returned to profit at the operating level, said sales at the chain were falling and it had decided it could not be saved. Remaining Ratners stores would be closed or converted to other formats. Mr Gerald Ratner, the former chairman, transformed UK jewellery retailing by bringing affordable products to the mass market, and built the group into Europe's biggest jeweller. But Mr Ratner's fate was sealed by a remark to a meeting of the Institute of Directors in April 1991 that a sherry decanter with six glasses on a silver plated tray which sold in his shops at Pounds 4.95 was 'total crap'. This combined with recession and rising debt to bring the group close to collapse. It changed its name to Signet but attempted to keep the Ratners trading name. Sales at Ratners fell by 8 per cent last year, and increases at renamed stores were smaller than expected, suggesting that problems went deeper. Mr James McAdam, chairman, was careful to avoid blaming the chain's demise on Mr Ratner. 'It would be simplistic to suggest it was the result of one remark,' he said. 'There were important demographic changes, changes in customers' buying habits, and the recession.' Signet has also decided to sell the lossmaking Salisbury's handbag chain, making an Pounds 87.1m provision comprising Pounds 76.3m goodwill previously written off to reserves and a Pounds 10.8m asset write-down. That increased the pre-tax loss from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 85.4m. Stripping out the provision and a Pounds 5.3m trading loss at Salisbury's, the pre-tax profit for the jewellery businesses would have been Pounds 6.9m. Group turnover amounted to Pounds 988m (Pounds 929m). Operating profits were Pounds 37.3m (losses Pounds 2.1m). The biggest improvement was in the 900-store Sterling group in the US, which accounts for 60 per cent of Signet's business. Like-for-like sales increased by 11 per cent, and operating profits doubled from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 40.4m. Like-for-like sales increased by 2 per cent in the UK jewellery business, which after the closure of Ratners will comprise just Ernest Jones and H Samuel, plus three experimental stores called Equa. It made operating profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 20.2m losses). Signet passed the dividend again, and Mr McAdam said it would be 'inappropriate' at this stage for a capital reconstruction, to pay back the Pounds 64.3m owed to preference shareholders. Group debt was little changed at Pounds 361.9m. Losses per share, including the Salisbury's provision, increased from 19.2p to 38.3p. See Lex</p>

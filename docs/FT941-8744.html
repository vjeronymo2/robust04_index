			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Average family faces Pounds 1,000 tax increase The government yesterday disclosed that tax rises from April 1995 will cost a family on average earnings more than Pounds 1,000 a year. If reductions in mortgage tax relief are added to the official figures, Labour said the tax rise would be more than Pounds 1,250 a year - the 'tax bombshell' the Conservatives accused Labour of planning during the last general election campaign. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: 'In the interests of honesty and standards the Tories should now put up billboards in every constituency saying the Conservative government is responsible for the Pounds 1,000 plus tax rise.' Confirmation of the new tax increases were contained in a written answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, to Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's Treasury spokesman. Figures show that a married man on average earnings with two children will pay Pounds 22.32 more in tax per week in April 1995. This amounts to Pounds 1,160 more a year in tax. The Conservative party's credentials as the party of low taxation have already been under attack after the recent publication of figures showing that the government will from April take more in tax from the average family than Labour did. As a result of the 1993 Budgets the total tax paid by a married man on average earnings will rise from Pounds 118.36 a month to Pounds 130.88 in April, and then to Pounds 140.68 from April 1995. The change in tax paid since 1979, when Labour was last in office, as a percentage of earnings in direct and indirect taxes, is 35 per cent from April, rising to 36.2 per cent in 1995-96. That compares with 32.2 per cent in 1978-1979. Mr Dorrell accused Labour of ignoring the fact that income tax and National Insurance contributions as a share of gross national product would still be only 16.2 per cent in April 1995 compared with 18.4 per cent under Labour in 1979. 'I am delighted for Labour to raise tax as an issue since the best way to cut taxes is to get spending under control which Labour could never achieve,' he said. He also argued that Labour's figures were hypothetical because the tax rises had not yet come into force and did not take account of the Pounds 30-per-week increase in the living standards of a typical family. However, Ms Harman said: 'There is nothing hypothetical about the government's figures since they relate to what has already been put into law. Having failed on tax they cannot claim competence in economic management.' From April personal allowances are frozen, the married couple allowance is cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, National Insurance goes up and VAT is levied on domestic fuel at 8 per cent. The new 3 per cent insurance premium tax comes into force from October and air passenger tax from November. From April 1995 the full 17.5 per cent is levied on domestic fuel and the married couple allowance is cut by another five per cent to 15 per cent. The government figures do not include cuts in mortgage tax relief from 25 per cent to 20 per cent in April followed by another 5 per cent cut to 15 per cent the following year. In a parliamentary answer to Ms Harman two weeks ago the Treasury said cuts in mortgage tax relief would cost a typical family with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage Pounds 4.40 a week from April 1995.

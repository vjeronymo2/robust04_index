			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Labour race sees frantic campaigning FRESHMEN Labour MPs were yesterday at the centre of frantic campaigning in the party's leadership race as a clarification of the election rules left open the option of last minute switches in nominations that close today. Campaign managers for Mr Bryan Gould insisted that they already had in the bag the necessary 55 votes for their man to fight the odds-on favourite, Mr John Smith, for the leadership in the contest that ends at a special party conference on July 18. The claim was not disputed by Mr Smith's supporters who have been anxious to ensure that their candidate does not win the party's top job without a challenge. Mr Gould's team also said he had the pledges to contest the deputy leadership while Mr John Prescott said he was 'quite confident' he would join the battle when nominations close at 5.15pm today. However, Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, is already seen as the front runner for the deputy's post, provoking anger among the outsiders on the left that the electoral machinery has been manipulated by the party establishment. Despite predictions, the true position remained far from clear after a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party heard officials 'clarify' the confusion that had left some convinced they could nominate second preferences. Most informed insiders predicted last night that Mr Smith and Mr Gould would contest the leadership and Mr Gould, Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott would fight it out for the deputy's job. All other contestants would fail to qualify.

At a crowded Commons meeting, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, said that misunderstandings of a weekend ruling had led some MPs to believe there was what amounted to a single transferable vote system, allowing their second choices to be registered if their first option failed to clear the 55 nomination hurdle. Walworth Road intended to make clear only that MPs could switch their votes up to the final minute, even if they had already filed nomination papers. That ruling, widely seen as a 'face-saving' move to paper over a blunder by the party's director of organisation, Ms Joyce Gould, met fresh criticism from Mr Ken Livingstone, the hard-left contender for the leadership. Addressing yesterday's PLP meeting, Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, reminded the parliamentary party reinforced by 69 new MPs: 'As from today, the mourning stops. The battle is now to fight the Tories.'</p>

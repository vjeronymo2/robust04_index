			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Old neuroses over the ERM mar restart of trading EUROPEAN government bond prices dipped in early trading yesterday before bouncing back later in the day as the markets continued to display some of the neuroses that had infected them at the end of 1992: fears that the French franc would be forced to devalue, dealing a further blow to the exchange rate mechanism, and that hefty borrowing in some quarters would force yields higher. Longer-dated UK government bonds opened slightly down from their close at the end of the old year, but promptly slipped as much as half a point in thin trade. Profit-taking was blamed for the slide, though the low level of trading suggested no big investment institutions were active in the market. Shorter-dated paper held steady during the day, leading to a steepening of the sterling yield curve and reversing the flattening that had taken place at the end of 1992. Traders warned against seeing the movement as a signal of further rises in long gilt yields in the short term - though most expect such a movement later this year, once the scale of the next financial year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement becomes clearer and the funding of the 1992/93 deficit begins in earnest. THE German government bond market shook off the resignation of economics minister Mr Jurgen Mollemann with barely a flicker. More important in determing the direction of bund prices will be the public sector wage negotiations which begin on Friday, said Mr Richard Grey, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The Bundesbank switched back to a variable rate tender for its latest repurchase agreement operation, after the series of fixed-rate repos at the end of last year. Economists warned against reading this as a sign that German interest rates are set to fall, though, and the repo rate, when it is announced today, was expected to remain steady at around 8.75 per cent. Similarly, there are few expectations of any relax-ation when the Bundesbank council meets on Thursday. PRESSURE on the French franc built up yesterday as the anticipated new year attack on the currency began in earnest. At its latest repurchase agreement auction, the Bank of France drained FFr24.5bn from the markets, indicating an intention to keep conditions tight, though the key intervention rate stayed unchanged at 9.1 per cent, with the 5-10 day repo rate at 10 per cent. These rates are well below money market rates, though, with 3-month money yesterday trading at around 12.5 per cent, prompting suggestions that the Bank of France will not be able to hold official rates low for much longer. Shorter-dated paper lost ground, with the yield on the 7.5 per cent bonds due April 1995 rising from 8.01 per cent to 8.06 per cent during the day, though longer-dated bonds held generally steady. AIDED by a stronger dollar, US Treasuries posted big gains at the long end of the maturity spectrum yesterday morning. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/16 at 103 21/32 , yielding 7.316 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.458 per cent. Overseas investors continued to buy Treasuries across the yield curve, lured primarily by the recent strength of the US currency, which makes dollar assets more attractive. This buying, combined with short covering by dealers in New York, pushed prices, especially of longer-dated securities, up sharply.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] In an incident described by the PGR [Attorney  General's Office] as one of the harshest blows dealt to the drug  trafficking mafia, on 15 June, authorities arrested Moises  Juarez Ledezma, alias El Moyo and El Dienton, a key figure in  the Sonora Cartel headed by Amado Carrillo Fuentes. El Moyo has  been charged with crimes against public health, which include  charges of funding, planting, cultivating, storing, and  transporting drugs.    In the areas of Las Minitas and Las Trincheras in Sonora,  which cover some 5,800 hectares, authorities confirmed the  discovery of caps and jackets with bogus PGR and PJF [Federal  Judicial Police] insignias, which were used by cartel members.    Meanwhile, the PGR also announced the 12 June arrest of  Eduardo Salazar Carrillo, assistant PJF inspector in Sinaloa;  Commander 2d Class Cesar Gomez Castaneda; and policemen Gilberto  Barrios Barrios and Eric Escamilla Segovia. The four men are  facing charges in connection with the possession of $306,921 in  cash, several weapons used exclusively by the Army, and radio  equipment.</p>

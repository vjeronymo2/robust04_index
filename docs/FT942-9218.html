			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BIL reviews plans for Mount Charlotte Brierley Investments of New Zealand is rethinking plans to float Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels, its UK subsidiary, after a recent upturn in business, particularly in London. BIL, which acquired Mount Charlotte in 1990, has said repeatedly that its eventual aim was to float the chain. However, with trading improving after a difficult few years, some in the New Zealand group believe it might be preferable to hold on to the chain and benefit from the upturn. While a flotation has not entirely been ruled out, BIL is also considering selling a slice of Mount Charlotte equity to a small group of investors. In 1991 BIL sold a 30 per cent stake in Mount Charlotte to two Singaporean government agencies. Mount Charlotte made a profit of Pounds 2.1m after tax in 1992, compared with Pounds 1.5m in 1991. While the chain has, along with the rest of the UK industry, suffered a fall in occupancy and rates during the recession, its London hotels are currently thought to be well over 90 per cent full. The hotel chain, the second biggest in the UK after Forte, is expected to phase out the Mount Charlotte hotel name in favour of its Thistle brand. The company, which operates 112 hotels in the UK, has said it wants over 60 per cent of its establishments to be marketed under the Thistle brand by the end of next year. It said it intends to turn Thistle into the UK's leading four-star hotel chain. Over the past two years, the company has upgraded eight Mount Charlotte properties to Thistles and will upgrade a further 10 over the next few months. The chain, which has no hotels outside the UK, is believed to be in no rush to acquire properties or management contracts in continental Europe. It believes that London will remain one of the world's most important hotel markets. The company has 24 hotels with nearly 7,000 rooms in London, making it the biggest operator in the capital.</p>

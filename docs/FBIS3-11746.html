Following political lines, members of the Haitian  Parliament openly oppose the arrival of the French ship. A group  of senators led by Bernard Sansaricq stands against the arrival  of the French ship.    On 23 March, demonstrators -- FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for  the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] militants and those of the  Capois La Mort, the same militants who thwarted the MINUHA  [United Nations Mission in Haiti] on 11 October 1993 -- camped  for two hours in front of the French Embassy in Port-au-Prince.  One day before the scheduled arrival of the ship bearing food  aid, tension seems to have moved up a notch. Rothschild Francois  reports:    [Begin recording] [Francois] A demonstration was held in  front of the French Embassy. Demonstrators were carrying  placards denouncing Paris' attitude in the Haitian crisis:  Democracy, Yes! France's food, No! [passage omitted].    Other reactions include that of Serge Gilles, president of  the Jean Xavier Foundation, who favors the arrival of the French  food aid. Gilles says, however, that the international  organizations must think in the future of purchasing those  products in Haiti in order not to change the Haitian  population's food habits.    [Gilles, in Creole] One can not turn up his nose at 50,000  meals, but I understand the people who have reservations.  However, I must be realistic because children are dying. There  is no food. It is not the kind of aid that we would choose to  receive, but we find it. Let us give it to the children, and let  us talk with the people so that they change their aid if they  give money. We do not need the money. They can set up an  organization which can buy rice, beans, and oil here. It will be  better for the Haitian people, for the Haitian nation.    The solution lies in lifting the embargo, in international  cooperation that must resume immediately, in the appointment of  a prime minister, in the installation of a government with an  emergency program. That is where the solution lies. Until we  agree on a solution so that the embargo is lifted and  international cooperation resumes rapidly, if we can distribute  the 50,000 meals, let us do so.    [Francois] The Senate office of Senator Sansaricq  categorically opposes the landing of the French humanitarian aid  ship. In a statement to Radio Metropole, Sen. Sansaricq took the  opportunity to criticize the French policy in Haiti. Sen.  Sansaricq announces that the Senate members will be present at  the Port-au-Prince harbor to prevent the landing of the French  ship.    [Sansaricq] It is unacceptable. The senators will be at the  Port-au-Prince harbor on 25 March, and we will take all  necessary measures to prevent the landing of this ship. It is an  insult to the nation. It is an insult to the Haitian people. It  is an insult to our intelligence that France, which has imposed  an embargo on us for 30 months, now buys food from Guadeloupe to  distribute in Haiti. Twenty thousand have died in Haiti. It is a  real affront. The Senate strongly stands against it, and we will  be there personally to prevent the landing of this ship. We will  hold Philippe Seltz personally responsible for any scratch  inflicted on a senator. We will be there with all the necessary  strength in order to oppose the landing of this ship.

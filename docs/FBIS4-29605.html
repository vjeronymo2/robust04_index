			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 17 Kyodo -- Former Japanese Prime  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Thursday advocated a wide alliance  among conservative, liberal and centrist forces to create a  stable ruling coalition.    Nakasone, who is on a tour of the United States, told  reporters that such an alliance would best suit the current  political situation.    ``If the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is like that, policy  (alliance) among new conservatives, liberals, and, if necessary,  centrist forces, may be appropriate,'' he said, referring to the  second-largest opposition SDP's departure from the ruling  coalition in April that left the first minority government in  decades.    His remarks were viewed by observers as an indication of  acceptance of a coalition with centrist forces such as Komeito  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- and even with some  SDP right-wingers.    Nakasone, a kingpin of the largest opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), is known as a staunch conservative and  has been leery of leftist socialists.    It is well known that Nakasone is seeking a coalition  between  the LDP and its splinter party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, as envisaged by Shinseito  strategist Ichiro Ozawa and the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former  foreign minister.    But his latest remarks appear to show he is tilting toward a  coalition which includes some liberal and centrist forces for at  least the current period of transition, according to observers.    Nakasone also said that political realignment will progress  in the coming months in line with the political stance of the  parties.</p>

Zhirinovskiy made the above statement today in an exclusive  interview to RTP's "Common House" program.    [Zhirinovskiy] "Eastern European leaders believe they will  receive supplementary aid just because they will become members  of NATO. They will get nothing from NATO. Instead, they will  polish the boots of German and American officers. That is what  the Polish, the Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks will get.  The Bulgarians will polish the boots of Turkish officers."    Zhirinovskiy also threatened the West with a third world war  if NATO opens its doors to former Solviet Union republics:    [Zhirinovskiy] "If you do not want war, do not let any  Russian neighbor in. These territories are vital to us, Russia.  The Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central  Asia. If you try to include these countries in NATO, you will  be responsible for the third world war, from which only Russia  will come out as a winner as it did in the second world war."</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS MODIFY FEE POLICY FOR LAWYERS DEFENDING THE INDIGENT;  </P> <P> TRIALS: ACTION IS DESIGNED TO LIMITS COSTS WHEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER GOES INTO THE  PRIVATE SECTOR AND DEFENDS AN INDIGENT CLIENT FOR MORE MONEY.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a package of staff recommendations  to help streamline costs of defending indigents in criminal cases, but made one  modification in an attempt to control the costs of outside lawyers.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley persuaded other supervisors to agree that anyone  leaving the county public defender's office who takes a case with him or her  into private practice should not be paid at a rate higher than the county pays  its contract attorneys.  </P> <P> "There have been occasions where the public defender who leaves the office  (ends up) getting paid at a cost which often exceeds that which would have been  (incurred) by the public defender's office," Riley said.  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Public Defender Carl C. Holmes later called the supervisors'  decision reasonable. But Holmes said he could recall only a few instances in  which that has happened. If a public defender leaves to go into private  practice, the indigent client has the right to ask the court to let him or her  remain on the case as a private attorney.  </P> <P> "When this has happened, the lawyers have agreed to stay on the case at the  county's rate, exactly as Supervisor Riley has called for," Holmes said. "What  the supervisors really are talking about is the Randy Kraft case."  </P> <P> Kraft, a 44-year-old computer consultant from Long Beach, was sentenced to  death last week for the murders of 16 young men in Orange County. Two of his  lawyers -- C. Thomas McDonald and William J. Kopeny -- left the public  defender's office specifically so they could accept appointments to represent  him.  </P> <P> McDonald, chief public defender at the time, had asked for a leave of absence.  When supervisors balked, he resigned. The supervisors suggested that McDonald  should take the case as a public defender, at his usual salary.  </P> <P> The total attorney fees in the Kraft case have been sealed by court order. But  two of his lawyers, McDonald and James G. Merwin, were paid $90 an hour for  in-court time. Kopeny was paid $50 an hour and refused to ask for a pay raise  the court had granted his colleagues.  </P> <P> Because the costs have been sealed, the county supervisors have been given no  report to indicate how much the Kraft case has cost the county so far.  </P> <P> But Holmes said the Kraft case is not comparable to the kind of situation  Riley's amendment seeks to prevent. The Kraft case, Holmes pointed out, had  never been assigned to the public defender's office. It had gone from private  attorney to court-appointed attorney when Kraft's family did not have enough  money to continue his defense. McDonald was recommended to the court by Merwin,  a longtime friend who was already on the case.  </P> <P> The package of recommendations from the County Administrative Office that was  approved Tuesday includes more stringent scrutiny of money paid to a contract  lawyer after the public defender declares a conflict of interest in handling  the case of an indigent defendant.  </P> <P> Another gives judges more input in setting standards for fees to those contract  cases. Another is designed to tighten controls in cases in which defendants  claim to be indigents, yet have some assets that could go toward the cost of  their case.  </P></p>

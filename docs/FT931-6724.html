			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets still playing it cool with Clinton: Wall Street THE WHOLE may usually be greater than the sum of the parts. But occasionally, the parts still steal the limelight. That was the case on Wall Street this week. Having spent much of the previous week focusing on the grand economic strategy and the implications which the Clinton plan may have for the speed at which the US pulls out of recession, the market switched its attention to the slightly more predictable effect on individual industries. For the likes of biotechnology, tobacco and luxury consumer goods stocks, this was not a happy scrutiny. Admittedly, the macro-picture was not forgotten altogether. On Tuesday, publication of the monthly Conference Board report on levels of consumer confidence sent stock prices tumbling across a number of sectors. The Conference Board calculated its index for February at 68.5, more than eight points lower than the level registered in January. To compound the gloom, its survey had been conducted two weeks before the Clinton package was announced to Congress. Even at this stage, it seemed, consumers were becoming increasingly wary about the recovery's strength. The stock market, seeing some of its worst fears confirmed, took the news fairly badly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by almost 20 points, although the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index showed a much smaller loss. Even in this instance, however, the declines were concentrated among mainline 'consumer stocks'. The three carmakers, for example, shed 4 to 6 per cent of their value, while many of the nation's largest retailers also posted significant declines. Thereafter, the remainder of the week's trading was erratic. Faced with a paucity of 'hard news' or fresh economic data, dealers and investors turned to a wave of rumours, and to 'micro' considerations of individual stocks or sectors, in an effort to stimulate business. No rumour proved more powerful than the whisper that President Clinton was about to cap credit card interest rates and, according to some sources, finance charges on other forms of consumer credit. The suggestion duly provoked a denial from the Treasury - but not before some credit cards stocks had lost, and then regained, about one-fifth of their market value. Tobacco stocks fell prey to the same type of treatment. Fears that the Clinton administration would tax tobacco more heavily in an effort to fund a health-care reform plan hung over the sector for most of the week. Philip Morris, for example, which had dived on the previous Friday, continued to slide early in the week. The stock then railled mid-week, before edging down again as the week's trading drew to a close. By Friday lunchtime, Philip Morris shares were trading at Dollars 66, only  1/2 away from its 52-week low. The story within some other sectors was a little more rational. For some time, drug companies have seen the new President's attacks on their pricing policies translate into substantial share price falls. This week, however, attention focused more heavily on the biotechnolgy stocks. Compounding the general uncertainty over health care reform implications, a couple of biotech companies released pessimistic announcements - thus accelarating the sector's general decline. Amgen, for example, warned that first quarter sales and profits would be significantly below Wall Street's expectations; Synergen revealed that a drug, designed to treat septic shock, had not performed up to expectations in clinical trials. The former's shares fell over Dollars 9, to around Dollars 37 on the news; the latter lost Dollars 28 5/8 , to Dollars 13 1/2 . Some investors may wonder when this speculation-driven trading will be replaced by a more solid trend. Few traders think that this is likely in the foreseeble future. The full implications of the Clinton package - in particular, the details of health care reform - will take months to unfold. Even then there are numerous political hurdles to surmount. Nevertheless, despite all the plunges and rallies, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved by a net 30-odd points since President Clinton first appeared on the nation's television screens explaining the broad outlines of his deficit reduction plan - scarcely the most momentous of movements. Meanwhile, the rate at which the economy was recovering at the end of 1992 remains debatable; on Friday, for example, the authorities released a revised estimate for fourth quarter economic growth suggesting that gross domestic product was growing at an annualised rate of 4.8 per cent, up from a previous estimate of 3.8 per cent. In short, uncertain about both the recent past and the immediate future, Wall Street is taking the obvious course. It is simply waiting to see.  ------------------------- Monday     3342.99  +20.81 Tuesday    3323.27  -19.72 Wednesday  3356.50  +33.23 Thursday   3365.14  +08.66 Friday     3370.81  +05.67  -------------------------</p>

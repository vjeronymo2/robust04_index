			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Globex system to be launched on June 25 GLOBEX, the after-hours electronic trading system for futures and options, is finally to be launched on June 25, it was announced in Tokyo yesterday. The system, jointly developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and Reuters Holdings, has been bedevilled by delays and teething problems over the past two years. Tests at 250 keystations were completed on March 27, and the system is ready for launch, Mr Leo Melamed, Globex chairman, said. Mr Melamed said he had a meeting with Mr Tadao Chino, the vice-minister at the Japanese Ministry of Finance, on Tuesday, who reconfirmed the ministry's approval for the system to operate in Japan. He said the ministry had previously given its blessing to Globex in 1990. He said that he hoped Globex, which would open with 250 keystations in Japan, would expand to 900 terminals within five years. Mr William Brodsky, CME president, said the Globex centre in Chicago would be expanded to operate as a help centre in every time zone.</p>

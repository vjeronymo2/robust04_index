			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / US seeds factory stormed in India FARMERS yesterday tore down the administrative block of the Cargill Seeds factory at Siravara in the southern Indian state of Karnataka to protest against the US multinational's operations in India, which it said deprived local farmers of their livelihood. Police arrested 50 activists of the powerful Karnataka Farmers' Association after they attacked the Cargill office building. Mr M D Nanjundaswamy, member of the Karnataka legislative assembly and president of the association, said similar attacks would be launched on multinationals trying to patent seeds and plants that Indians had used for centuries. The farmers plan to step up their campaign to protect the interests of small farmers who feel threatened by efforts to tighten patent laws in developing countries as part of a move to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Our targets will include WR Grace and Company of Florida, who have patented the Indian neem tree (used widely in herbal medicine and cosmetics), and Pioneer Seeds of the US, who are trying to deprive farmers of their livelihood,' said Mr Nanjundaswamy. Cargill South East Asia, a subsidiary of Cargill Inc, is also facing the wrath of salt farmers and environmentalists in the Kutch region in Gujarat on India's west coast after the government cleared the allotment of 15,000 acres of land near the Kandla port there to set up a salt manufacturing unit. Indian police yesterday arrested nearly 200 activists of the Bhartiya Janata party, the largest opposition party, averting an attempt to disrupt the first day of the Maharashtra legislative assembly's latest session.</p>

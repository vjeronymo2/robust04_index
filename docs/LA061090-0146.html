			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS MALIBU CITYHOOD;  </P> <P> WINNER OF 1 COUNCIL SEAT REMAINS UNDECIDED;  </P> <P> POLITICS: WRITE-IN AND ABSENTEE BALLOTS NOT YET COUNTED WILL DETERMINE IF  ZEITSOFF OR MERRICK IS THE VICTOR.  </P> <P> A contested seat on Malibu's future City Council remained in doubt last week,  and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County registrar's office said it may be  several more days before it is known whether slow-growth activist Missy  Zeitsoff or retired Judge John Merrick is the winner.  </P> <P> "It's miserable when you want to celebrate and can't," said Zeitsoff, the  apparent fifth-place finisher in last Tuesday's incorporation election in which  voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood and chose a five-member council.  </P> <P> Zeitsoff, the former secretary of the pro-cityhood Malibu Township Council, had  21 votes more than Merrick, with an unknown number of write-in and absentee  ballots yet to be counted.  </P> <P> Among the 30 contenders were two write-in candidates, including attorney Sam  Birenbaum, who spent about $10,000 on his campaign. Some observers estimate  that there may be between 100 and several hundred write-in and absentee ballots  that remain to be counted.  </P> <P> Such ballots are counted separately and by hand, causing the delay.  </P> <P> "We have no way at this point of segregating absentees and write-ins by  community and thus no real way of even knowing how many such ballots there may  be from Malibu," said Marcia Ventura, a spokeswoman for the registrar's office.  </P> <P> Despite trailing, Merrick found some humor in the situation.  </P> <P> "The joke around my house is that if I win, we're going to demand a recount,"  said the 71-year-old retired Municipal Court judge, whose wife, while  supportive, is known to have preferred that he not enter the race.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Malibu's incorporation, which cannot occur until after the election  results are certified in a few weeks, also remains clouded.  </P> <P> County officials have asked a state appeals court to delay the actual  incorporation date until next March, and a hearing on the matter has been set  for July 18. However, in setting the hearing last week, a three-judge panel in  Los Angeles left open the possibility of allowing incorporation to go forward  by late June or early July, pending written opinions from lawyers for the  county and cityhood supporters.  </P> <P> The county is seeking the delay in a bid to start work on a $43-million  regional sewer system in Malibu before a new city government has the chance to  block it.  </P> <P> A victory for Zeitsoff would represent a clean sweep of the council by  slow-growth activists, who are already celebrating a whopping 84% approval of  cityhood by Malibu voters.  </P> <P> The four confirmed winners include Walt Keller, the top vote-getter, and  Carolyn Van Horn, who were co-chairs of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation  before resigning to run for office. Larry Wan, the second-highest vote-getter,  was president of the Malibu Township Council, and Mike Caggiano has long been  associated with the group.  </P> <P> As a judge in the community for 22 years, Merrick, along with Keller, was  considered to be the most recognizable of the candidates and was widely  mentioned as a favorite prior to the election. He was the only candidate among  the top nine vote-getters who was not affiliated with either of the two  pro-cityhood groups.  </P> <P> Land-use attorney Paul Shoop, who far outspent other candidates, finished 10th,  and real estate broker Richard Idler came in a distant 12th in the balloting.  They, along with Merrick, were singled out in ads placed in Malibu's two weekly  newspapers by opponents who questioned their support of cityhood.  </P> <P> Although once opposed to cityhood, Merrick and Shoop campaigned in favor of it.  Idler was less enthusiastic about incorporation, expressing concern about the  adequacy of the city's projected $5-million budget, but said that since he was  convinced that voters desired cityhood, he wanted a role in Malibu's future.  </P> <P> The City Council outcome surprised even some cityhood boosters. They labeled  the incorporation vote as a mandate for preserving the community as a  semi-rural enclave, and proof that residents reject the county's blueprint for  widespread development that they had warned was a threat to Malibu's future.  </P> <P> "I think it's clear people voted for those they know will protect Malibu from  excessive development and rejected others that they felt wouldn't follow  through with that," Van Horn said.  </P> <P> Besides being co-chairwoman, with Keller, of the incorporation group for 2 1/2  years, Van Horn, a retired schoolteacher, is an environmental activist who is  associated with Save Our Coast, a Malibu-based environmental group.  </P> <P> Keller, a retired aerospace engineer who has a Ph.D. from UCLA, has been in the  vanguard of the cityhood movement for nearly 30 years.  </P> <P> Of the confirmed winners, he and Van Horn have been the most outspoken about  restricting new residential and commercial growth. They have suggested that an  existing land-use plan for the Malibu area may not be tough enough to deal with  future development.  </P> <P> Wan, a business executive with a Ph.D. in engineering from Yale, derived much  of his political strength from his 2 1/2 years as president of the 2,000-member  Malibu Township Council.  </P> <P> Although also an outspoken critic of the county's development policies for  Malibu, he has expressed concern that if a new city government engages in too  much downzoning, it may only entice the county to approve excessive development  just outside Malibu's boundaries.  </P> <P> Caggiano, 36, the council's youngest member, and another Malibu Township  Council representative, shares a similar view on development. A public-policy  analyst who works as a private consultant, Caggiano is a former analyst at the  RAND Corp. He has a Ph.D. from the RAND Graduate School.  </P> <P> As the two top vote-getters, Keller and Wan will serve four-year terms on the  council, with the other three winners facing reelection two years after they  take office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW MALIBU CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS  </P> <P> MIKE CAGGIANO  </P> <P> A former consultant at the RAND Corp., Caggiano is a public policy analyst who  works as a private consultant. He has a Ph.D. from the RAND Graduate School.  Affiliated with the Malibu Township Council, he lives in Big Rock Mesa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WALT KELLER  </P> <P> Often called the "father of cityhood" for his nearly 30-year involvement in the  cityhood cause, Keller was formerly co-chairman, with Carolyn Van Horn, of the  Malibu Committee for Incorporation. He is a retired aerospace engineer with a  Ph.D. from UCLA. He lives in Encinal Canyon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAROLYN VAN HORN  </P> <P> Along with Keller, she was co-chairwoman of Malibu Committee for Incorporation.  A retired schoolteacher, she has long been active in the community, and is  associated with Save Our Coast, a Malibu-based environmental group. She lives  on Point Dume.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LARRY WAN  </P> <P> President of the 2,000-member Malibu Township Council for 2 1/2 years, Wan is a  business executive who owns his own high-tech products manufacturing company.  An engineer by training, he has a Ph.D. from Yale. He is a resident of Carbon  Canyon.  </P></p>

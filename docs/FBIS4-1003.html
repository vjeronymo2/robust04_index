			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 18 April]    [Text] Each of the approximately 10,000 voting stations in  the country will be surrounded by an area with controlled  entrances and exits. This "inner perimeter" as it is known,  will be opened at 07h00 on each of April 27 and 28, and will  close at 19h00. Voters who have entered the inner perimeter  before the closing time on either day will be allowed to  continue to vote. Strict security measures will be applied at  all voting stations, and no member of the public will be allowed  into the inner perimeter if he or she is in possession a weapon  of any kind. Bags and/or parcels will be subject to search.    An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] official will be  on  hand to deal with any general inquiries, to ensure that voters  are in possession of the correct identity documents, and to help  the elderly or disabled to the front of the queue.    At the entrance to the voting station, a further two IEC  officials will ensure that the required documentation is ready,  and will direct each voter via an usher to the ultra-violet (UV)  scanning table, which is controlled by an IEC official. The  voter will be asked to place his or her hands, palms down, under  the blue UV light.    If an ink-mark is detected, the voter will be escorted to  the  presiding officer's table, where one of three IEC officials will  again check the voter's hands beneath a UV light, and make a  ruling on whether to allow the voter to proceed with voting, or  be escorted from the inner perimeter. If no ink-mark is  detected, the voter will be directed to the document-checking  table, where a relevant and valid identity document -- as set  out by the IEC -- will be requested and checked.    If the identity document presented by the voter does not  comply with the requirements, the voter will be taken to the  presiding officer's table, where a decision will be made on  whether or not the voter may continue to vote, or be escorted  from the inner perimeter.    If the document complies with the IEC requirements, it will  be market with an invisible ink and returned to the voter.  Temporary voter cards (TVC's) issued to voters for the purpose  of the election will be retained by the IEC official at the  document checking table at this stage.    The voter will then be directed to the ink-marking table,  where the back of the fingers of the voter's right hand  (including the fingers) will be marked with an invisible ink by  an official. If this should be impractical or impossible, the  voter will be taken to the presiding officer's table, where his  or her details will be taken down and kept together with reasons  for the ink-marking not being possible.    Voters will be given a paper towel or tissue with which to  wipe their ink-marked hand, and will be asked again to put the  hands under the UV light. If the ink-mark does not show up, the  marking procedure will be repeated.    When ink-marking is completed, the voter will be directed to  the national ballot paper issue table, which is controlled by  two IEC officials. The first official will tear a single  national ballot paper out of the ballot bjok and hand this to  the second official, who will fold it three times -- in half  from top to bottom, from right to left in one-third, and from  right to left in half again. The official voting station stamp  will then be placed on the paper, which will be handed to the  voter.    The voter will be asked whether he or she requires  assistance  in voting because of blindness, illiteracy or disability. If  so, this will be arranged by the officials at the presiding  officer's table.    If not, the voter will be ushered to the first available  voting booth, and left alone to make his or her mark on the  national ballot paper and folding it. On leaving the booth, the  voter will be taken to the national ballot box table, where an  IEC official will check the folded ballot paper -- without  infringing secrecy -- to ensure that it bears the correct voting  station stamp before the voter is allowed to place the paper in  the national ballot box.    The voter will then be asked if he or she would like to cast  a vote in the provincial ballot. If yes, he or she proceeds to  the provincial ballot paper issue table. If no, the voter will  be escorted to the voting station exit.    If the voter does want to vote in the provincial ballot, the  procedure is identical to that of the national ballot -- a  ballot paper is issued, folded, stamped, marked and placed in  the provincial ballot box.  Note: The presiding officer's table is staffed by officials who  are available to provide assistance and resolve discrepancies or  disputes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The government has made  the first decision to protect five North Koreans who sought  refuge in South Korea several months ago under the related law  which came into effect last Dec. 11, officials said Monday.    According to "the law to protect the North Korean  compatriots  who sought refuge in the South," the government should convene a  committee of officials from related ministries to decide whether  to assist North Koreans within 30 days of their request for  protection from the health and social affairs minister.    The committee, sponsored by the Health and Social Affairs  Ministry, recently decided to offer protection to four North  Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps including Kim  Kil-song, 31, and Kwon Ki-hae, 53, who fled North Korea through  a third country.    Under the law, the government will give each refuge seeker  14.7 million won (about 18,300 U.S. dollars) for resettlement  and 7 million won to rent a small apartment.    The decision is attracting attention because more North  Koreans have been seeking refuge in the South recently, the  officials said.</p>

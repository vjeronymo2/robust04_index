			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / EU in danger of losing out on Asian economic miracle The European Union risks losing out on the 'economic miracle' taking place in Asia unless it strengthens political ties and boosts investment in the region, according to a European Commission policy paper. The document agreed in Brussels yesterday calls for a radical rethink of EU strategy toward Asia, which it treats as a coherent economic region encompassing Japan, China, and East Asia. By the end of the century, the paper notes that 1bn Asians will have significant consumer spending power, with 400m having average disposable incomes at least as high as Europeans or Americans. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, drove home the increasing importance of Asia during last weekend's Group of Seven summit in Naples. By the year 2010, the G7's share of global output would fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, he predicted. The German presidency of the EU encouraged the Commission to produce a paper on Asia as a means of increasing awareness of the region's economic importance and making the Union more outward-looking. The paper lists several priorities for action: A wider political dialogue to extend the coverage of the UN conventional arms register and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. Deeper co-operation on controls of sensitive technology, and 'strengthening the policy of encouraging the improvement of human rights'. Raising Europe's profile in Asia, through more education visits and training programmes, cultural exchange and twinning cities: 'The EU needs to make a far greater effort to explain its policies.' says. Strengthening Europe's economic presence, by lobbying more forcefully for the removal of laws restricting trade and investment, as well as the discriminatory use of intellectual property rights, standards and testing. The paper also calls for more joint ventures between European and Asian companies; extending scientific co-operation, opening up 'European Business Councils' in China, Indochina and Pakistan; and following up the EU's 'market transition programme' in Vietnam with other moves to offer policy advice to former command economies now embarked on economic reform. The EU is now the second biggest market for exports from developing Asian countries after the US. It absorbed Ecu128bn (Pounds 101bn), or 27 per cent of their total exports, in 1993.</p>

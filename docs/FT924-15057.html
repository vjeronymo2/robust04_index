			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Russia's Aviastar looks to west for aircraft partners AVIASTAR, the large Russian aerospace manufacturer, is seeking to attract western partners in an attempt to become one of the world's three biggest commercial aircraft manufacturers. The Russian group yesterday announced it had appointed Price Waterhouse, the international accounting and management consulting firm, to help it sell a stake of up to 50 per cent in the company. Assistance is also being sought to develop a long-term strategic plan and to identify appropriate strategic alliances with other aircraft makers. Mr Viktor Mikhaylov, Aviastar's director-general, said yesterday the company wanted to establish itself as the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer after the US Boeing and the European Airbus consortium during the next 10 years. That would involve collaboration with western manufacturers and the sale of equity to western partners. Aviastar, which builds the Antonov AN124 cargo aircraft and the 200-seater Tupolev TU 204 twin engine airliner, was formed last November as a joint-stock company consisting of the former state-owned Ulyanovsk Aviation industrial complex on the Volga river about 600 miles east of Moscow. Mr Mikhaylov said the conversion of the group into a joint-stock company was expected to be completed by the middle of next year. Aviastar offered potential western partners in the US and Europe low labour costs and considerable aerospace manufacturing expertise, he added. The company employs about 36,000 people and the Ulyanovsk complex, in which about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) has been invested since 1974, is the most modern aviation facility in Russia, Price Waterhouse said. Aviastar has already started a series of collaborative ventures with western companies, including a joint venture with Heavylift Airlines based in Stansted in the UK to operate AN124 cargo aircraft in world markets. Mr Mikhaylov said Aviastar expected to sign an agreement with the European Airbus consortium next year to provide cargo air services for Airbus.</p>

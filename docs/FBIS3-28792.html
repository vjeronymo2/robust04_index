The Finance Ministry unveiled earlier Thursday a tightened  73.08 trillion yen draft budget for the year beginning April 1,  projecting a mere 1.0 percent growth but virtually shrinking  from the initial fiscal 1993 budget.    The ministry seeks to complete a government budget bill by  next Tuesday following the negotiations.    The officials said the negotiations will focus on public  works spending, for which 100 billion was reserved for possible  reinstatement. A total of 200 billion yen was set aside for  restoration in the whole budget.    The talks will also center on the defense and official  development assistance (ODA) budgets, the officials said.    The proposed defense budget was up a scant 0.8 percent to  mark the lowest growth in 34 years, while the ODA budget was up  4.0 percent, the lowest increase on record.</p>

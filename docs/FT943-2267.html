			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Singapore cashes in on ringgit turmoil Singapore's money market dealers are reaping the benefits of continuing fluctuations in exchange rates of neighbouring countries' currencies, particularly that of the Malaysian dollar, or ringgit. Dealers say that the daily ringgit trading volume in Singapore, both on the spot and forward markets, is now regularly more than USDollars 3bn - five times the level of a year ago. There has also been a great deal of activity in other south-east Asian currencies, particularly in the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah, mainly because of interest rate differentials between the two currencies and the US dollar. 'We estimate that trading in south-east Asian currencies - the so-called exotics - now accounts for between 15 and 20 per cent of daily money trading here,' says the head of one foreign bank's dealing operations in Singapore. 'Increasingly, the banks are looking to make good forex profits on the exotic currencies. Ringgit trading in Singapore has gone through the roof - on many days it's well ahead of London or Hong Kong.' The main cause of Singapore's sudden popularity as a ringgit trading centre was the introduction earlier this year of a series of measures by Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, aimed at curbing the inflow of speculative funds. At the end of 1993 Bank Negara bought in large quantities of US dollars to revalue its reserves and reduce year-end book losses caused by the bank's own multi-billion dollar speculation on the foreign exchange markets. In 1992 Bank Negara lost MDollars 9bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in foreign exchange dealings. Forex losses in 1993 were officially put at MDollars 5.7bn. The consequence of the move was that the ringgit fell sharply - from around MDollars 2.54 against the US dollar for most of 1993 to nearly MDollars 2.80 at one stage earlier this year. With such wild fluctuations, the world's speculators saw an opportunity and rushed in to buy the ringgit. Bank Negara, alarmed at the inflationary impact of large amounts of speculative funds washing into the country, then introduced its restrictions, which included imposing a negative interest rate on foreign-held ringgit accounts and banning sales of short-term money market paper to foreigners. Traders and investors wanting to hedge their ringgit investments had to move operations elsewhere. Singapore, due to its status as a financial centre and its location adjacent to Malaysia, was the natural choice. Bank Negara has recently lifted most of its restrictions on the inflow of funds and after a highly volatile period, the ringgit's value has returned to around the MDollars 2.55 mark against the US dollar. But ringgit trading in Singapore has continued to grow. 'It's a kind of inertia,' says one Singapore money dealer. 'Bank Negara's moves and the big fluctuations in ringgit values acted as a catalyst for interest in currency trading in this region - not just in the ringgit, but in the other currencies as well. Now the traders are here and enjoying it. They are not going to go away.' Singapore's growing importance as a ringgit trading centre has not pleased Malaysia. Forex dealers in Kuala Lumpur say ringgit trading volumes in Malaysia now average between USDollars 500 and USDollars 1bn per day - well below levels in Singapore. The Malaysian monetary authorities have always refused to entertain the idea of internationalising the country's currency. But Malaysia's own actions have resulted in the ringgit becoming one of the hottest items in the forex markets - and enhanced Singapore's position as a money trading centre.</p>

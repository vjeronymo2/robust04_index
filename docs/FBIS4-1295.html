			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament April 25 SAPA -- Police had encountered  logistical problems and a police officer made an error of  judgement during attempts to search the ANC's Shell House  headquarters following the fatal shooting of Zulu marchers, the  Minister of Law and Order, Mr Hernus Kriel, said on Monday [25  April].    Speaking during the debate on constitutional amendments, he  said the unsuccessful search of Shell House would form part of a  Goldstone Commission inquiry into the march and subsequent  shootings. "The principle remains that no one is above the law.  It is absolutely essential that we find out the truth as soon  as possible."    Mr Kriel expressed regret at Monday's series of bomb blasts  and said such incidents should never happen in a civilised  country. The police assisted by the army would do their best to  limit any escalation of violence during the election period.    "Reckless actions and omissions" by the ANC, IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] and the Conservative Party had created a climate  for violence in the country.    The ANC and IFP were involved in internecine violence which  had claimed thousands of lives. Their leaders had repeatedly  failed to meet to discuss their differences. The CP  [Conservative Party] had incited people to violence and CP  leader Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg had publicly declared his party  would use violent means if they did not get a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland]. Mr Kriel said several recent blasts had  been with dynamite, and asked where the dynamite came from.    The government had repeatedly warned the CP not to join  forces with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance  Movement -- AWB], but the CP did not have the courage to  distance itself from the AWB.</p>

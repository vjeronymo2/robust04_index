			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith in US airport deal WH Smith, the retailing and distribution group, has signed its biggest US airport deal so far, expected to add Dollars 25m to its current annual turnover of Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.3m) from its 93 US airport shops. The company has been awarded a contract to operate eight news and gift shops at Los Angeles International, the world's fourth largest airport. The contract is the largest news and gift concession in a US airport, representing about 40 per cent of all concessionary business at Los Angeles International, Smith beat competition from the existing incumbent, Duty Free Shoppers, and Allders International, the duty and tax free retailer. The Los Angeles contract follows recent awards of concessions at Denver, Atlanta and Louisville airports. It takes the number of US airports where Smith has outlets to 15, including Chicago, Orlando and Las Vegas. The biggest airport where it is not yet represented is Dallas-Fort Worth, but Smith says it will pitch for a contract there as soon as there is an opportunity. 'We have broken through the sound barrier in terms of getting ourselves established as a name in US airport retailing,' the company said. 'We now have critical mass.' Smith has been expanding in the US since 1985. In addition to airport shops, it has 270 hotel outlets as well as the 170-store music chain The Wall, and Waterstone's bookshops in Boston and Chicago. Other openings are planned. While most of its airport outlets are news stands and gift shops under the WH Smith name, it is keen to expand The Wall and Waterstone's formats into airports, and has already done so at Pittsburgh airport. With 60 more large US airports where it is not represented, and passenger volumes expected to double in the next 15 years, the company sees significant expansion opportunities. The business is lucrative, with sales densities of more than Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 660) a square foot last year. The company's ambitions are in line with forecasts by experts such as Professor Gary Davies of Manchester's International Centre for Retail Studies. He predicts that large travel termini, with their high customer densities, will become increasingly popular sites for retailers. Smith is also monitoring airport developments in east Asia with a view to opening retail outlets there.</p>

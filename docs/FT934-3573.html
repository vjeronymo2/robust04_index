			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Placing values Nelson Hurst at Pounds 63.3m Shares in Nelson Hurst, the insurance broker which is coming to market via a placing and intermediaries offer, were priced yesterday at 140p valuing the group, which specialises in professional indemnity in east Asia and Latin America, at Pounds 63.3m. Nelson Hurst was the subject of a management buy-out from Citicorp, its former owner, in May 1991 and the flotation is designed to give the group, which is raising Pounds 30.6m through the issue, greater financial flexibility. Of the 25.2m shares on offer, 17.9m are being placed firm with institutional investors by Charterhouse Bank, which has underwritten the issue. A further 7.37m shares have been placed subject to clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The group is forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 7.2m and pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 5.19m for the year to December 31. On the basis of a notional tax rate of 33 per cent, pro-forma forecast earnings per share for the current year are 10p, and the p/e at the issue price is 14. COMMENT son Hurst's offer price represents a modest discount to the market and other recent issues. This reflects concern over possible market indigestion rather than any uncertainty about the group's profit potential. Nelson Hurst is an international player with strengths in specialist product areas.</p>

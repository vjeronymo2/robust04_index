			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Packaging helps Porter Chadburn The completion of its staged withdrawal from consumer products and a sharply improved showing from packaging operations saw Porter Chadburn swing back into the black in the first half. Turnover from continuing operations in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 38.7m to Pounds 42.6m, for operating profits of Pounds 2.17m (losses of Pounds 62,000), including Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 1.08m) from packaging as the business benefited from legislative changes in the US requiring many customers to redesign their labels. With no exceptionals this time and a reduced interest burden, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.62m, against losses last time of Pounds 1.43m and a deficit of Pounds 17.2m for the full year. The disposal of the consumer products side - completed in June with the sale of the Leeda fishing tackle business - coupled with 'stringent' working capital controls, particularly in the US, helped cut bank borrowings from Pounds 9.1m at April 1 to Pounds 2.6m. Gearing dropped from 151 per cent to 59 per cent. Earnings per share were 1.42p (losses of 1.72p), but the interim dividend is again omitted.</p>

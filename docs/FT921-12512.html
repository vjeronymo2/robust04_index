			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / MoD man recalls fears about tubes for Iraq A MINISTRY of Defence scientist told MPs in a private session on Wednesday that he had been warned in June 1988 of fears that immense steel tubes ordered for Iraq might be intended for a missile project. His statement was published yesterday. The evidence on the Iraqi supergun programme from Mr Bill Weir, a ministry metallurgist, was given to the Commons trade and industry commitee. Mr Weir said he had been approached by the Department of Trade and Industry for advice, but was given insufficient evidence to decide whether the tubes were for a gun. He said he had telephoned Mr Rex Bayliss, managing director of Walter Somers, the Halesowen company asked to produce the smaller of two guns in the programme. Mr Bayliss had told of his concern that he had been asked to produce missile tubes, and six days later he said the tubes were 'probably for Iraq'. Mr Weir said he had also known that Space Research Corporation had designed the tubes and was involved in the design of guns.</p>

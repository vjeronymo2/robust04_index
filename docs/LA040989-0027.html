			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN EVERYONE'S OX IS GORED;  </P> <P> INTRUSIVE DRUG TESTS MAY MAKE CIVIL LIBERTIES POPULAR AGAIN  </P> <P> In recent years the American public and the U.S. Supreme Court have held the  Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures in low  esteem.  </P> <P> Neither body has cheered a doctrine that excludes important evidence from  criminal trials because of how the police found it. Politicians have made  careers attacking such "legal technicalities."  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the Supreme Court has issued a series of decisions cutting  back Fourth Amendment restrictions on searching persons and their belongings  for illegal drugs. Most significant of these may be the decision issued last  month permitting broad-scale drug-testing of certain U.S. Customs Service  employees. In the short run, this position marks another invasion of privacy  legitimated by the "war on drugs." The long-term impact may prove surprising,  however. It might make the Fourth Amendment popular again.  </P> <P> In the mid-18th Century, American merchants howled when English officials  claimed the authority to search homes and businesses without showing a judge  that they had good reason for the search. Their outrage became a rallying cry  for the Revolution and later inspired the Fourth Amendment.  </P> <P> Today, those who decry unreasonable searches and seizures are not prominent  merchants. Usually, they are drug dealers. The Burger and Rehnquist courts have  treated Fourth Amendment claims accordingly, finding ways to cut back the  amendment's reach and enforcement. Despite the complaints of civil  libertarians, no one seems to mind much. Most people are not drug dealers,  after all.  </P> <P> By contrast, broad-scale drug-testing will affect many law-abiding citizens.  </P> <P> In late March the court issued two drug-testing opinions. In the most  far-reaching and controversial of the two, the court held that the government  could require all Customs employees who apply for promotion, either to a  position involved in the "war on drugs" or one that involves carrying a  firearm, to take a drug test.  </P> <P> The court said that the government could require such employees to take a drug  test even if the government has no suspicion that the employee used drugs. And  the testing would not require a warrant or other judicial authorization.  </P> <P> The main importance of this decision, like many by the court, will be symbolic.  Although the Customs Service could show no direct link between drug usage and  corruption or malfeasance by its employees, and although only five employees  had tested positive out of 3,600 examined, both the government and the court  majority thought the interests in favor of testing were "compelling."  </P> <P> What was compelling was the symbolism. Those in government connected with the  "war on drugs" would serve as drug-free examples to the rest of the nation. If  these government employees could remain drug-free, so might the rest of us.  </P> <P> The ruling applies only to certain customs employees, but it has broader  ramifications. Its precedent will legitimate broad-scale drug-testing in many  governmental contexts.  </P> <P> It also may have an indirect impact on legal challenges to the many  drug-testing schemes set up by private employers and institutions. Although  these challenges will not depend on the Constitution because they are not  government-mandated, the court's treatment of the Fourth Amendment sets an  example of legal leniency. If forced testing does not violate the fundamental  law of the land, then perhaps lesser laws will not be violated either.  </P> <P> If mandatory drug-testing becomes more common, it will also become a more  public, and less judicial, issue. And here it is ordinary middle-class  Americans who face a major privacy invasion.  </P> <P> How would you feel if your employer required drug-testing? You would receive  notice of the testing requirement and make an appointment. At the appointed  time and place, after producing a photo ID, removing outer garments such as a  coat or jacket, and handing over belongings, you would be given the sample  bottle.  </P> <P> Then, you would have the option of urinating behind a partition or in a  bathroom stall. A monitor of the same sex would stand nearby to verify the  "normal sounds of urination." After receiving the sample, the monitor would  check it for normal color and temperature. Then it would go to a lab for  analysis. This is the procedure followed in the Customs case.  </P> <P> Whether drug-users or not, employees subject to such testing will feel the  threat of public consequences for private, consensual conduct, as well as the  threat of false positive test results. This is Big Brother in a big way.  </P> <P> Drug abuse has had devastating consequences in modern America. Politicians urge  us to declare war on drugs and to free government from legal restraints more  appropriate to peacetime. In its decision on the Customs Service drug-testing  program, the Supreme Court has enlisted in the war.  </P> <P> The only virtue of the decision is that it may reawaken the public to the  privacy protections of the Constitution. Americans may reconsider the nature of  their war when they discover that its battle cry is the sound of forced  urination.  </P></p>

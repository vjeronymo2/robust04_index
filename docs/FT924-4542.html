			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Bundestag to vote in favour of Maastricht: Treaty approval has sting in tail THE German Bundestag will today vote overwhelmingly for ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. Only a few individuals, and the former East German Communists, are expected to vote against. In spite of this show of solidarity, which many Germans hope will persuade the waverers in Denmark and Britain to drop their doubts over the treaty, there are several sharp stings in the tail of the German ratification process. The two houses of the German parliament, the directly elected Bundestag, and the Bundesrat representing the 16 federal Lander (states), have decided that they must reinforce their national democratic control over the process of European integration. They have also inserted a strongly-worded resolution insisting on their right to inspect the precise pre-conditions for European economic and monetary union (Emu) before the final phase of a single currency and a single European central bank comes into effect. They are also greatly increasing the direct involvement of the 16 Lander in the EC negotiating process, requiring close co-operation and respect for their views from the central government, and even the right to take the government's place in Brussels discussions. The co-operation must take place on all subjects for which the federal states have a domestic responsibility  -which clearly includes questions of the EC budget. Although the amendments, both to the German constitution and in the shape of amplifying legislation, are intended to enhance the process of European integration, many senior officials in the government, and President Richard von Weizsacker, the state president, have expressed the fear that they will make it more difficult. In Brussels and other EC capitals, the changes are also regarded with alarm, as likely to lead to far more complications in all negotiations with Germany, both on day-to-day initiatives and on substantial transfers of national sovereignty to a European union. All moves involving sovereignty will require a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament. Moreover, the European union must be as defined in the amended German constitution: committed to the principles of democracy and of a law-based, socially-oriented, federal state. For Germany that means a significant strengthening of the European parliament before any further integration will be possible. Full details of the laws and constitutional amendments, as approved by a special ratification committee of the Bundestag, were published yesterday. They will be put to the vote in the lower house today and in the Bundesrat on December 18. Mr Karl-Heinz Hornhues, deputy leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the Bundestag, said the parliament had made two key moves in an effort to reassure an increasingly hesitant German public opinion about the progress towards European union. The first is the insistence on a second debate on Emu - although he insists this does not amount to a British-style 'opt-out clause'. The second is a 'European union committee' in the parliament, which will require the government to consult it in detail before embarking on any negotiations in Brussels.

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Senate passes handgun bill as Republicans yield The Republican Party's filibuster against gun control broke down yesterday afternoon and the US Senate promptly passed the Brady bill, requiring a five-day waiting period before purchasers can take possession of handguns. The tortuous saga ended, as such congressional disputes often do, in a compromise. In return for getting a simple voice vote on the bill, the Democrat leadership allowed for additional consideration in the session starting in January of Republican modifications to it. Nevertheless the Senate action does mean that, with both houses now concurring, the measure can be sent to the White House for President Bill Clinton's signature. The Republican intention next year is to reduce the five-year life of the bill to four years, with the government retaining the option of renewal for an additional year. In effect Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, bowed to growing public heat for some kind of action on gun control in the face of the frightening escalation in violent crime. Senator George Mitchell, his Democratic counterpart, had threatened to call the Senate back into session next week if the filibuster were not broken. Most senators have already left town for the recess. Passage of the bill constitutes a notable victory after seven long years for Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary severely wounded and left partly paralysed in the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life in 1981. It also represents a rare defeat for the National Rifle Association, the leading lobby against gun control. However the limited nature of the bill, requiring that purchasers pass background checks before taking possession of their weapons, does not mean that the NRA has been stripped of its underpinnings. Further initiatives can be expected next year from the administration and others, providing a more serious test of the willingness of Congress to tackle the whole issue.</p>

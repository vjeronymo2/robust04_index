			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Delors scales down EC revenue plans THE EUROPEAN Commission moved to avert another damaging row within the Community yesterday by scaling back its plan to increase revenue by a third over five years, suggesting instead a smaller rise over seven years. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, made his more modest proposal in line with sharply downgraded EC growth projections. The new plan is designed to meet objections by the richer northern countries, while still satisfying the aspirations of the poorer countries - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - which had been promised a doubling of fiscal transfers under the original proposals. The Commission's move comes as the 12 face simultaneous crises on the Uruguay Round trade talks and ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. Member states' approval of the so-called Delors II package was being seen as a test of political will among the 12. A majority of the 12 foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday agreed that the new plan had a reasonable chance of being hammered into a deal at the Edinburgh summit next month. The main discordant reactions yesterday were towards a UK presidency draft conclusion for the summit, saying that midway through the period covered by the revised plan, 'economic and social cohesion . . . will increasingly depend on the application of sound economic policies, and decreasingly rely on structural transfers'. Mr Delors in effect put back on the table a refined version of the compromise he withdrew, amid some acrimony, at the Lisbon summit in June. The original Delors II package called for an increase in the EC budget from Ecu66.6bn now to Ecu 87.5bn (Pounds 70.7bn) in 1997, at today's prices. The new plan would raise the budget to Ecu80.2bn in 1997 - an increase of barely 21 per cent - and only Ecu86.2bn by 1999. The revised seven-year package would begin with two flat years, with EC spending adjusted downwards in line with increases in Community growth of 1.1 per cent this year, 1.4 per cent next year and an estimated 2.2 per cent in 1994. The original package assumed five years' growth at an average of 2.5 per cent. If the revised package is accepted, less will go to farm spending and nearly Ecu1bn will be switched from the proposed increase in research and development spending to keep the EC's 'cohesion' effort funded at this level.</p>

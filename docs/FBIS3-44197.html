The  average inflation rate was 9.7 percent -- the lowest since 1973  when it was 9.6 percent. Last year's rate was 4.2 percent lower  than 13.9 percent in 1992.    The average annual rates of change in the CPI [Consuer Price  Index] for the higher, middle and lower income groups were 10.2  percent, 9.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. In 1992 these  rates were 13.3 percent, 14.5 percent and 14.7 percent  respectively.    The average food inflation rate of 6.8 percent for 1993 was  18.6 percent lower than the corresponding rate of 25.3 percent  for 1992. This rate is the lowest since 1971 (3.9 percent).    The price index for housing showed a negative inflation rate  of -01 percent for 1993. This rate has shown a decreasing  tendency since 1989 and is the lowest since 1959 when the index  in this format was started, CSC said.    December's inflation rate was 9.5 percent -- 0.3 percent  higher than November's 9.2 percent. Contributing to this 0.3 per  cent increase were the decrease in the price index for housing  (-0.2 percent) and increases in the price indices for food (0.2  percent), transport (0.1 percent) and all other items (0.2  percent).    December's food inflation rate was 5.2 percent -- 1.3  percent  higher than November's 3.9 percent. Against this, the annual  increase in the price index for all items excluding food was  10.7 percent, "which indicates that the change in food prices,  notwithstanding the increase, still has a retarding effect on  the inflation rate," CSS said.    The monthly increase of 1.1 per cent in the food price index  was due to increases in the price indices for meat (2.8  percent), fruit and nuts (5.5 percent), fish and other seafood  (1.3 percent), coffee, tea and cocoa (0.8 percent) grain  products (0.7 percent), fats and oils (0.4 percent) and sugar  (0.3 percent).    "These increases were slightly counteracted by decreases in  the price indices for vegetables (-3.5 percent) and milk, cheese  and eggs (0.2 percent)," CSS said.    The monthly decrease in the housing index (-1.2 percent) was  due to the decrease in interest rates on mortgage bonds.    The fuel price decrease of December 17 was not taken into  account in the CPI for December. The direct effect of this would  be reflected in the inflation rate for January.    In the urban areas, the highest inflation rate of 12.2  percent for December was recorded in the OFS [Orange Free State]  goldfields, while the lowest rate of 8.3 percent occurred in the  Vaal Triangle.    The food price index for Pietermaritzburg showed the lowest  annual increase of 3.3 percent, while the highest of 7.8 percent  was shown in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area.    The inflation rate for pensioners was 10.1 percent -- 0.6  percent higher than december's official inflation rate. The  lowest annual rate of increase was recorded in the Port  Elizabeth/Uitenhage area, while the highest of 12.6 percent  occurred in Bloemfontein.    Food prices at chain stores showed an annual increase of 5.3  percent and a monthly increase of 1.0 percent, while those at  the other retailers showed an annual increase of 4.3 percent and  a monthly increase of 1.4 percent.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cross border M&amp;A deals DISPOSALS of various kinds provided last week's more interesting international corporate developments, writes Brian Bollen. The week saw two developments in the dismemberment of Polly Peck International, which collapsed almost two years ago. In the biggest new deal, the group's administrators agreed to sell PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce to a Mexican-led investor group for Dollars 499m (Pounds 261m). The administrators also received a bid for the company which owns the Sheraton Voyager Hotel in the Turkish resort of Antalya. The week's biggest non-core disposal was US business group Dun &amp; Bradstreet's sale of London-based Datastream International. The buyer, Virginia-based holding company Primark, is in the process of changing from a utility-based conglomerate to an information services group. In France, the sale of Isoroy continues Pinault's debt reduction programme and its efforts to refocus away from timber and into retailing. Eastern Europe continues to generate deals sporadically, despite the criticisms of some investment bankers that there is no money to be made there. Poland's stuttering privatisation programme took a step forward with the announcement by International Paper, the US forest products group, of its first venture in the region. The purchase of Kwidzyn Pulp and Paper marks a new phase in the company's international expansion after its domestic and European growth in the 1980s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR    TARGET            SECTOR     VALUE     COMMENT                                                (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- General Electric   Avis Leasing      Vehicle     500m  Deal completed Capital Corp (US)                    leasing Investor Group     Unit of Poly      Fresh       260m  Administrators (Mexico)           Peck (UK)         Produce           agree sale International      Kwidzyn Pulp      Paper        89m  Renewed Paper (US)         &amp; Paper (Poland)  manufacture       Intl expansion Northern Telecom   Matra             Telecoms     73m  EC commission (Canada)           Communications    equipment         approves                    (France) Polygram (Holland) Interscope (US)   Film         18m  Strategic                                      production        purchase Guinness (UK)      Union Cervecera   Brewing       8m  Outstanding                    (Spain)                             offer George Wimpey (UK) Severokamen       Quarrying     5m  Minimum 50%                    (Czech Republic)                    stake planned Glunz (Germany)    Isoroy (France)   Timber       n/a  Pinault debt                                                        cut sale Primark (US)       Datastream (UK)   Information 100m  Dun &amp; Bradstreet                                      services          disposal Dogus Holding      Unit of Poly      Hotels       n/a  Local Sheraton (Turkey)           Peck (UK)                           Voyager offer  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

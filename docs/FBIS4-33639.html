			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- Having assessed that the  lengthy meeting they held with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  had not yielded any concrete results, the country's four  agricultural organizations reported that the agricultural sector  has been placed "on a state of alert."    In a press communique released on 8 June, the organizations  asserted that their "leaders have voiced and endorsed the  producers' understandable impatience," and warned that "farmers  are running out of time in their quest for political solutions."    The Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), the Argentine Rural  Association (SRA), the Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA), and  Coninagro [Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative  Confederation] signed a document urging "the rural population to  keep alert on the latest developments in negotiations."    Despite the fact that following the five-hour meeting with  Cavallo the agricultural organizations' leaders seemed to be  more satisfied with the official promise to undertake an  in-depth study of the agricultural situation, as time went by  and meetings with delegates followed one another, agricultural  producers' representatives became convinced that those promises  were insufficient.    Thus, during the late hours of 7 June, Humberto Volando,  Manuel Cabanellas, Eduardo de Zavalia, and Leonidas Gassoni [the  presidents of FAA, CRA, SRA, and Coninagro respectively] were of  one mind about the need to be alert to the unfolding of  negotiations with the government. They moreover acknowledged  that they had left the meeting at the Economy Ministry  empty-handed.    Despite this the communique stresses that "a lengthy  analysis  of the questions raised" was made at the meeting, and that  "there was some significant agreement with regard to some  issues, while strides were made concerning others. Yet no  definite conclusions were reached. The minister committed  himself to continue to work on the subject and offer concrete  solutions."</p>

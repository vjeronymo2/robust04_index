			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JACINTO;  </P> <P> HEAT EXPOSURE CITED IN DEATHS OF 3 TEENS  </P> <P> Three San Jacinto teen-agers whose bodies were found in rugged terrain last  month in the San Bernardino National Forest died of heat exposure, the  Riverside County coroner's office has determined. The bodies of William  Strother, 17, Jeremy Warwick, 19, and Arthur Noriega, 19, were discovered  within a three-mile radius of where their truck became stuck on a dirt road in  the hills southeast of Hemet. Investigators said the bodies were found under  bushes, suggesting the trio had sought refuge from the searing summer heat.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Liu Baomin (0491 0202 3046) and reporter </F> Ma Kuijun (7456 7608 0689)]    [Text] Tianjin, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- Reporters learned from  an ongoing national conference on insurance for foreign  nationals, hosted in Tianjin by the People's Insurance Company  of China, that our country made rapid progress in promoting  foreign nationals' insurance last year. According to  statistics, the People's Insurance Company of China in 1993  earned $732 million, or 29.8 percent more than in 1992, from  insurance business catering to foreign nationals. It paid a  total of $356 million in settlement for losses and its loss  ratio was 48.76 percent. Twenty company branches which sell  life insurance in Tianjin, Beijing, and other localities each  reaped an average of over $10 million worth of insurance  premiums from insurance business catering to foreign nationals.  This business again grew in the first quarter of this year,  yielding tangible social and economic returns.    It is understood that since 1993, our country has made  greater progress in opening up to the outside world, in  importing technologies, in attracting business and investments,  and in expanding exports on the north and south of the Chang  Jiang. Never before has it come across such a scene of  prosperity in insurance business catering to foreign nationals.  The People's Insurance Company of China has promptly adjusted  its way of thinking to catering to market demand, operated  according to international market practices, and at the right  moment, set up business in aviation and space insurance, oil  exploitation insurance, insurance for the three types of partly  or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, short-term credit insurance  for commodity exports, seller's contract responsibility  insurance, and insurance on personal injury caused by accidents  on domestic flights.    At the same time, the company has actively explored overseas  markets, established the Hong Kong China Insurance (Group)  Limited Company and the London China Insurance Shareholding  Limited Company, and set up 71 overseas agencies in Luxembourg,  the United States, and other countries.</p>

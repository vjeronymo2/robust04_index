			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): Business in the privatised East - Trade / Linda Bilmes picks the best guides through the maze of political and economic changes LAST YEAR, when the FT in this Review published a guide to books and newsletters on Eastern Europe and the CIS, most readers were looking for basic information. Tania Konn, who runs the Central and East European Business Information Service (CEEBIS) at Glasgow University, says people used to ring up and ask 'Can you give me any information on Poland?.' Now, those seeking to keep abreast of developments have a much more complex task. Some 28 countries (including Slovakia, Croatia, etc.) are in the throes of economic reform. New laws and edicts are appearing constantly. Many westerners now have a direct stake in the fortunes of one or more companies in the region. According to Ms. Konn, still the best source of information in the UK: 'People today have very specific enquiries. They need information on a particular company or legal issue.' Perhaps the most crucial area is the process of privatisation, in which thousands of enterprises are being sold throughout Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe. 'Privatisation' includes the selling off of neighbourhood restaurants as well as the steel industry; selling land and housing as well as shares and vouchers. The success of privatisation in each country affects other crucial aspects of reform, such as labour market dynamics, international aid and IMF targets. Hence, almost every book and newsletter on the region deals with privatisation to some degree. Here is a guide to the most useful, up-to-date, and comprehensive sources. For general, recent information, East European Privatisation News is a monthly newsletter covering the privatisation efforts in Eastern Europe and the CIS. It is targeted toward western investors and advisers; thus it is focused on opportunities for investment and deals, recent acquisitions, consultancy contracts, etc. (EEPN, Pounds 250 pa. Tel: Oxford 608811). Another good source is the Eastern European Investment Magazine, a glossy monthly published in the US. It provides thorough coverage of western transactions (acquisitions, joint ventures, start-ups) in all 28 countries and reviews recent developments in privatisation. It also offers a database with detailed information on all transactions involving western partners and/or investors. (Dollars 580 pa. UK office: 081-998 9287). Finance East Europe offers bi-monthly updates related to finance and investment. It covers privatisation and restructuring, mergers and acquisitions and capital markets developments, and provides a layman's synopsis of legal changes affecting the above. (FT Business Information, Pounds 395 pa. 071-240 9391). A number of excellent publications devote considerable space to privatisation. These include the bi-weekly PlanEcon Business Reports whose recent issues have focused on privatisation in Poland and the Czech Republic, (PlanEcon Inc., Dollars 1600 pa. 081-545 6206); BNA's Eastern Europe Reporter, (BNA International Inc., London Dollars 850 pa, fortnightly); Central European (Euromoney, Pounds 240 pa, six a year. 0444-440-421); and Insight East European Business Report, published in Budapest, which provides a more European perspective on privatisation efforts. (Insight Publishing, Pounds 200 pa. 081-203 1883). New Markets Monthly is a snappy newsletter which for Pounds 135 pa has a 'bulletin board' listing recent privatisations, takeovers, and appointments of sectoral advisers (eg Morgan Grenfell for the Polish tobacco industry, and Kleinwort Benson for Polish ball bearings). Additionally, the various publications of the Economist Intelligence Unit (weekly newsletter Business Central Europe, and the quarterly book Doing Business with Eastern Europe) cover the major privatisation events in the region. Anyone wishing to follow the constantly changing legal aspects of ownership, share distribution, foreign investment, and so forth should subscribe to one of the legal newsletters, such as Butterworth's Central &amp; East European Law Bulletin (Butterworth's, London Pounds 210 pa, quarterly) or East European Business Law (FT Newsletters, Pounds 390 pa, monthly). There is also a series by Longman Law, Tax &amp; Finance entitled Legal Aspects of Doing Business in the Czech and Slovak Republics, also available for Hungary, Poland, and Russia (Longman Law, Pounds 75). Generalist publications can supply a flavour of what is happening, but to follow recent events in-depth it is necessary to monitor the privatisation process in each country. There is enormous variation; Poland and Hungary are advanced in their privatisation efforts, others such as Bulgaria are just about to embark upon the process. Fortunately, reliable country-specific sources do exist. For Russia, the essential handbook is The Russian Privatisation Manual, produced by the Russian Ministry of Privatisation (GKI), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the EC. It is roughly the English language version of the manual used by the GKI. Volume I deals with the nitty-gritty of privatisation in Russia: voucher schemes, share auctions, valuation and liquidation of assets, privatisation of enterprises, foreign advisers, foreign investment, and employees' rights. Volume II covers laws and regulations affecting ownership, leases, privatisation of land, etc. The books are easy to use, with coloured diagrams and flow charts. Published by Euromoney Books, Dollars 495, including three updates per year. 0752-695 745). Another guide, Privatisation of Russian State Companies &amp; the Potential Investment Opportunities (Trajan Consultants, London, Pounds 275) provides background and focuses on housing and shipping. For specific updates on privatisation activities in Russia the best source is News from Russia, a collection of nine newsletters, including bulletins on privatisation, legislation and Russian business news. It may be ordered by fax or electronically from A&amp;G Information Services, St. Petersburg, Russia Pounds 29 pa, 812-278-1812. Comersant, a weekly commercial newspaper published in English and Russian, reports on all the latest edicts and regulatory changes but offers limited analysis of the data. A number of CIS countries, most notably the Ukraine, have also begun privatisation programmes. Information is scattered in general newsletters, such as Ukrainian Business News Band Kiev Letter. The best way to find specific information is by contacting CEEBIS at Glasgow University. (CEEBIS. 041-339 8855, Data enquiry service Pounds 50/hour). For the East European countries, data is abundant. The PlanEcon Database on Privatized Czech and Slovak Enterprises provides information on 988 Czech and 503 Slovak enterprises. In Hungary, the State Property Agency has produced a Catalogue of the Shares in Transformed Hungarian State-Owned Enterprises Ready for Purchase, a publication called Privatisation Opportunities in Industry &amp; Trade. The agency also produces a newsletter with details of specific transactions. In Poland, where privatisation is well advanced, there are a number of publications which report on the current efforts, as well as the progress of newly-privatised firms. The weekly Warsaw Voice, provides lively, critical coverage of business issues, including privatisation. (Warsaw Voice, Pounds 94 pa). The Polish Commercial Counsellor's Office in London puts out a Guide for Business Activities in Poland, which focuses on opportunities for western investment in Polish firms. One of the best country-specific sources is Bulgarian - a fortnightly magazine called 168 Hours BBN. This lively publication covers all business news in Bulgaria but with particular emphasis on the new privatisation programme, opportunities for investment, legislation and details of how investment deals are being structured. (Bulgarian Business News, Subscription Dollars 364 pa. Sofia 44 34 77). Given the pace of developments, few reference books can provide truly up-to-date information for western investors. However, a number provide background and critique of privatisation in the region. These shed light on the different governments' objectives for privatisation, and how the transition from a planned to a market economy is being carried out. The Central European University (CEU), funded by George Soros, is putting out a series of CEU Privatization Reports addressing topics such as leasing, management contracts and privatisation of specific sectors. The first book is Privatization Process in Central Europe, by R. Frydman, A. Rapaczynski and J. Earle (Pounds 10 paperback), which explains the privatisation programmes and legal framework in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Other recent books of interest include: Eastern Promise: Privatisation Strategy for Post Communist Countries (P. Reynolds and P. Young, Adam Smith Institute, Pounds 65); Methods of Privatising Large Enterprises (OECD, FFr150); Privatisation in East Europe and the Former Soviet Union (C. Jones, FT Management Reports, Pounds 270); and Privatisation in Central &amp; Eastern Europe, which focuses on legal issues (P. Saracevic, Graham &amp; Trotman, Pounds 78). All four provide background into the privatisation process and how it is restructuring the economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet states. Businesses which require just up-to-the-minute information may wish to link with an electronic database. Business International, Reuters, IP Sharp Associates, the FT, and ICC International Business Research all offer specialist services for the region. The ICC database includes news affecting privatisation by country. Also useful is the Munich-based GBI (German Business Information), which covers East European company transactions in detail. There are several free sources of information, including the local Chambers of Commerce, the East European Trades Council, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and, increasingly, the business attaches in the embassies of East European/CIS countries. The DTI has telephone lines dealing with business enquiries for each country (071-215 5265 for CIS countries; 071-215 4735 for Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Poland; and 071-215 4812 for Romania, Albania, Slovenia, etc.) For most East European and former Soviet countries, privatisation has not been easy. Many governments are ambivalent toward the process; there is profound disagreement as to the speed and methods by which companies should be turned over to the market. The frequent changes in rules and implementation for privatisation are a reflection of the shifting political climates. Anyone wishing to anticipate developments in the region needs to watch the overall situation in a country as well as the detail of transactions.

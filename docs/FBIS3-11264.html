			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Many international news agencies have reported from  Washington that scores of influential political figures  participated on 17 March in a heated debate at the U.S. Congress  on the appropriateness of the United States' maintaining the  blockade against Cuba, an anachronism in the postwar era.    The law on free trade with Cuba, a proposal submitted by New  York Democratic Party Representative Charles Rangel, with the  support of most black and Hispanic congressmen, was the subject  that prompted fiery deliberations at a House of Representatives  Ways and Means subcommittee.    The Spanish television station Univision last night reported  that this subject prompted one of the most bitter debates with  conflicting arguments expressed by supporters and opponents of  the blockade.    It is time to put an end to the Cold War because 34 years of  blockade against Cuba have not yielded the expected results,  Rangel said, defending free trade among nations.    His stance was also supported by California Democratic Party  Representative Esteban Torres, who termed sanctions against  Havana as ineffective and anachronistic. The following  congressmen also supported this stance: Jose Serrano from New  York, Bernard Sanders from Vermont, and politicians such as  Reverend Jesse Jackson and other supporters of an end to the  blockade who were also present at the session at the Capitol.    Grouped on the opposite side were figures of the anti-Cuban  extreme right such as Robert Torricelli from New Jersey, Lincoln  Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida, and Jorge Mas  Canosa, head of the ultraconservative Cuban-American National  Foundation. Officials from the Department of State who also  support the continuation of the blockade were also present at  the 17 March session.</p>

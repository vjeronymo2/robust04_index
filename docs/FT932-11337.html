			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Fresh competition powers welcomed THE government's proposals to give the Office of Fair Trading tougher powers to tackle monopolistic and anti-competitive behaviour have been warmly welcomed by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. In his first public statement on abuse of market power since the government announced its preferred option for reform of the law last month, Sir Bryan said he particularly welcomed the proposal to allow the director-general to accept and enforce undertakings without carrying out a formal investigation. In the magazine, In Competition, he said that in contrast to his power to accept undertakings to allow mergers to go ahead without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, his power to accept non-statutory assurances on anti-competitive behaviour had proved ineffective. The extension of the 'fix it first' philosophy to anti-competitive behaviour combined with tougher investigatory powers for the body should considerably shorten the process of dealing with abuses of market power. Businesses could not be pressurised into giving undertakings and the lack of a full investigation might mean that other matters of concern were overlooked. But that would be a price worth paying for speeding up the whole process. Mr Christopher Bright, a partner with City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines and editor of In Competition, said Sir Bryan's statement was 'significant' because it showed 'a new attitude to the use of the current law'. The 1980 Competition Act 1980 had not worked partly because the office had been too cautious in enforcing it, he said.</p>

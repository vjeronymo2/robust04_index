			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Railtrack and RMT agree to restart talks Railtrack and the RMT transport union last night agreed to resume talks over the signalling dispute. The move came during the first 48-hour strike of signalling staff, which is due to continue until noon tomorrow. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, responded positively to an appeal made earlier yesterday by Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, which owns and maintains Britain's rail network. The two sides are expected to meet at the offices of the conciliation service Acas in the next few days. Their last such meeting ended in deadlock on July 12. Mr Horton told Mr Knapp in a letter that he was willing 'to negotiate further on the offer on the table'. He added: 'We remain available at any time to continue the process of negotiation on that basis.' 'We believe we have common ground,' said a Railtrack spokesman. 'All elements of our last offer are negotiable.' Last night Mr Knapp told Mr Horton: 'You are now apparently saying that you are willing to negotiate further on all aspects of the offer on the table.' He added: 'If you are saying - and I think you are - that you are ready and willing to return to the negotiating table without constraints and preconditions we are more than willing to resume talks.' Mr Knapp said he found Mr Horton's letter 'a welcome confirmation of your public stance' on being ready to negotiate. Earlier yesterday Mr Knapp said that 'if Mr Horton is now saying there are no 'no-go areas' and he is willing to negotiate freely then I am willing to test Railtrack's sincerity in the next two days'. Mr Knapp added: 'If they are genuinely seeking negotiations without excluding the issue of basic rates, we are ready to meet at any time.' Railtrack confirmed that it was willing to discuss basic pay rates. Mr Knapp also said that the union was ready to negotiate a restructuring package for the signalling grades through a joint working party. Yesterday Railtrack said up to 30 per cent of train services ran in the afternoon, despite the start of the RMT's first 48-hour stoppage, while 34 per cent of the network was open. But the company warned it might be hard to maintain that level of service with the problems of getting trains into position. The opening of signal boxes at Colchester in Essex and Three Bridges in Sussex meant that services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich and from London Victoria to Gatwick airport were possible for the first time during strike action. Red Star, the parcels service owned by British Rail but currently up for sale, said it was diverting packages from rail to road and air. Trying to bridge a gap, Page 7</p>

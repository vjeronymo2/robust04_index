			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Varity back to profit but rationalisation continues VARITY, the US diesel engine, farm and industrial equipment group, returned to profitability in the second quarter but will continue rationalisation because of the uncertain global economic climate. Mr Victor Rice, chairman, attributed the turnround to lower costs, better results from Massey Ferguson farm equipment, strength in Kelsey-Hayes, the car parks division, and foreign exchange gains. 'We are lowering costs in all our businesses and we'll get the benefit when demand improves.' For the three months to July 31, Varity, based in Buffalo, New York, earned Dollars 14.1m, or 37 cents a share, the first profitable period since the fourth quarter of 1990. A year earlier it posted a loss of Dollars 7.6m, or 49 cents a share. Sales were Dollars 891m in the latest quarter, against Dollars 830.5m. First-half profit was Dollars 11.7m, or 10 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 44.9m, or Dollars 2.16 a share, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 1.7bn, against Dollars 1.5bn. Massey gained from a weaker US dollar and increased market share in Britain, France and the US while Perkins, the UK diesel engine builder, saw lower operating income, although sales were higher in both periods. It was hit by Europe's slowdown. Kelsey-Hayes' sales and earnings rose about 7 per cent in the second quarter. First-half operating income was Dollars 64m on sales of Dollars 774m, against Dollars 47m on sales of Dollars 659m last time. It is a leader in anti-lock braking systems and recently won a Dollars 100m order from Opel, of Germany. 'We don't see any sign of recovery in Europe. Kelsey-Hayes will see only modest US car industry growth for the rest of the year.'</p>

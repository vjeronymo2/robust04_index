			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Sitting down to the opposition - Big seats are among incentives on offer to win airline passengers European and American airlines are lining up to win back long-haul passengers as the world emerges from recession. Virgin Atlantic Airways' launch of a 'Mid Class' ticket this week was the latest manoeuvre in an increasingly bitter marketing war. This is a critical moment for the industry. Airlines need to attract customers with low fares and then keep them with high standards of service and other incentives. But the airlines are far from agreed over how to do this and have taken different tacks at different times. Some set store by innovative service. Virgin provides limousines to take passengers to and from airports, beauty therapy and massages. Others, like Swissair, prefer to promote a more traditional image, highlighting the personal attention they give customers. Even passenger surveys disagree over what customers want. The US National Institute for Aviation Research at the University of Wichita, Kansas rates punctuality as the most important attribute. Next comes safety and baggage handling. Fares are some way behind. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said this week that the most important factor for business travellers it had questioned was a big aircraft seat. Ticket flexibility and fast check-in were next, with membership of a frequent flyer programme fourth and lack of crowds fifth. Harold Shenton, an economist at Avmark, the aviation consultancy, warns that the Kansas research is misleading. He says it is based on interviews with airlines' own experts combined with records of what passengers most complain about. The Iata survey, by contrast, resulted from direct questioning of passengers who had identified their journey purpose as 'business'. Neither improving punctuality nor fitting bigger seats to aircraft will be easy. Punctuality is often governed by airport congestion and is out of the hands of airline managements while bigger seats mean fewer people in an aircraft and possibly less revenue. The result could be higher fares. Airlines are already raising published tariffs on the busy north Atlantic routes, partly in anticipation of rising demand. They are attempting to boost slow sales now by heavily discounting some tickets. The logic is that discounts can be abandoned at short notice if business picks up, while published fares take longer to change. While passengers are still scarce, airlines have also renewed efforts to promote what the surveys identify as the most popular incentive: frequent flyer programmes which lead to free flights or upgrades. Limousines to the airport and free gifts are playing a smaller part in this year's promotions. Virgin's new Mid Class ticket reflects the changing mood, offering wider seats and special check-in desks. Virgin previously had economy class and 'upper' - where prices were roughly comparable with business class on other airlines. Now, anyone who pays for a non-discounted economy ticket will travel Mid Class. Virgin has much to gain. The rush to discount tickets, especially on the viciously competitive transatlantic market, has left Virgin with fewer than 4 per cent of its economy passengers paying the full fare. With Mid Class, it hopes to raise this to more than 10 per cent. Although Virgin's extra layer of economy class is, perhaps, unique, the strategy is straight out of the long-haul travel management textbook: cut prices for leisure travellers and improve service for business passengers. Others are doing the same thing. Canadian Airlines International is offering business class seats to passengers who pay full economy class fares. The strategy is risky. Instant upgrades and giving away free flights through frequent flyer programmes may cut revenues in an already tough environment. But airlines are prepared to do this because they believe recovery is on the horizon. After nearly two years of recession, the business is lean and fit and demand could catch up with supply. If it does, airlines will be quick to turn away from the heavy promotion of bigger seats and free flights.</p>

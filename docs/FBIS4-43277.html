			<p>BFN     [Text] Official sources stress that following Sunday's [12  June] elections for the European Parliament and the significant  drop in power of the two big parties, the issue of next April's  presidential election by the current Chamber of Deputies takes  on new dimensions.    First of all, the dramatic fall in PASOK's [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] electoral power, despite the attempt to  "depoliticize" Sunday's election results, has weakened Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou's position within the party.  Consequently, according to government sources, Papandreou will  contemplate running for the country's presidency.    Given the level of power of the political parties in the  Chamber of Deputies, the election for a new president would  require the cooperation of PASOK, which has 170 seats, and  Political Spring, which has 10 seats. However, this association  is not possible because if Political Spring Chairman Andonios  Samaras were to contribute to the extension of the current  government's term, it would diminish whatever hopes he has to  draw new support from the conservative faction's pool.    If the Political Spring does not make a clear decision or if  it demands Papandreou's positions before it makes it own  decisions, this is because Samaras wants to publicly deny his  assistance to Papandreou in order to increase his own support  within the electorate. By getting into a confrontation with  another "established" political leader, Samaras will conclude  the cycle of "conflicts" with the political leaders, following  his confrontation with President Konstandinos Karamanlis and  Konstandinos Mitsotakis, former prime minister and New Democracy  chairman.    KKE [Greek Communist Party] has said that it will not vote  Papandreou into the presidency, but has not ruled out the  possibility of supporting another candidate nominated by the  majority. However, KKE currently holds nine seats in the  Chamber of Deputies, and this does not solve the problem.    As a result, the issue is what will happen with the New  Democracy parliamentary group, whose leaders cannot cooperate  with PASOK on the presidential election.    Some circles claim that the significant decrease in New  Democracy's power in Sunday's elections will intensify the  confrontation within the party, which in turn will increase the  insecurity of some deputies who want to exhaust their four-year  term rather than have early elections because of the inability  to elect a president. The fact that the vote for president in  the Chamber of Deputies will again be a secret one, will  certainly help some deputies to vote for PASOK's candidate.    However, well-informed sources stress that, besides the fact  that the above scenario is offensive for the deputies of the  conservative faction, it will create huge problems for New  Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert and mainly for Mitsotakis  who will be blamed for this "unofficial rebellion."    It is wise for one to expect that the political leaders'  decisions regarding the presidential elections will begin after  the results of the municipal elections and the elections for the  second level local administrations, as it will be possible to  evaluate more solid trends of the electorate.</p>

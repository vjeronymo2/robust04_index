			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE DIES WHEN CAR CAREENS OFF FREEWAY  </P> <P> A car went out of control and rolled down a 70-foot freeway embankment south of  Palmdale Sunday night, killing a man and woman, the California Highway Patrol  reported Monday.  </P> <P> Authorities were unaware of the accident until Monday afternoon, when the  wreckage was sighted in thick brush east of the Antelope Valley Freeway near  the Pearblossom Highway off-ramp, officials said. The crash apparently occurred  at 8:54 p.m. Sunday -- the time and day on the dead driver's watch, which was  broken in the accident, Officer Ruben DeAvila said.  </P> <P> The names of the victims, both Lancaster residents, were withheld until  relatives could be notified. The driver, a man about 36 years old, and the  44-year-old female passenger apparently died instantly, DeAvila said.  </P> <P> Investigators determined that the driver drifted into the dirt-covered center  while headed north on the freeway and lost control, with the car rebounding  onto the freeway at a 45-degree angle. It went over the side of the freeway,  became airborne and flipped end-over-end upon landing, coming to rest on its  wheels, DeAvila said.  </P></p>

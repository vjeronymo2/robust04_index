I would like to draw your attention to  one inaccuracy: The Brand Library is a section of the Glendale Public Library,  not the Los Angeles public library system.  </P> <P> JOSEPH FUCHS  </P> <P> BRAND LIBRARY PRINCIPAL LIBRARIAN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P> <P> </P> <P> For the Record: Jean Bryant, director of the Ralph W. Miller Golf Library in  Industry Hills, is the widow of Bill Bryant, who was general manager of the  Industry Hills Recreation and Conference Center.  </P> <P>  -- The Editors  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as week ends on soft note Wall Street US stocks ended a volatile week on a soft note yesterday, as a skittish bond market held most share prices in check, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off 0.32 at 3,755.11, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.51 forward to 463.68. In the secondary markets, the Nasdaq composite edged 0.26 ahead to 742.43, while the American SE composite outperformed the other indices, rising 1.90 to 445.45, Trading activity was moderate. Only 278m shares were exchanged on the NYSE despite extra activity generated by the monthly expiration of options on stock index futures and individual stocks. The 'double witching' activity had a negligible impact on prices. Indeed, investors struggled to find any source of inspiration. There was no fresh economic news and the dollar, which had triggered declines in stocks and bonds the previous session, held fairly steady against other leading currencies. The absence of news appeared to give a measure of support to the Treasury market. But the benchmark 30-year government bond was showing losses for a third straight day, reinforcing a negative tone that emerged in the aftermath of Tuesday's move by the Federal Reserve to tighter money. Stocks opened lower and drifted a shade under their opening values for most of the morning. Just after midday, however, the leading indices nudged into positive ground, only to recede again later. The Dow industrial index would have fallen more sharply without another good performance by IBM, which gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 68 1/8 . A day earlier, Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings projection for the computer company, pushing its share price up to Dollars 66 7/8 . Yesterday that valuation led Mr David Wu, an analyst at SG Warburg, to lift his price target for the stock to at least Dollars 80 by mid-1985. But most cyclical issues drifted. Among the most nota ble movers, Deere dropped a further Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 7/8 while Navistar International, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 15 7/8 , continued to benefit from a positive earnings report. In the energy sector, Mobil stood out with a Dollars 1 gain to Dollars 81 5/8 while JP Morgan's Dollars 1 1/8 decline to Dollars 63 1/4 was the highlight in banking. The NYSE's most actively traded issue was 20th Century Industries. The insurance company dropped 22 per cent or Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 12 3/4 after a California court decided to allow a referendum designed to force a cut in premiums charged by companies in the state. Canada Toronto stocks ended little changed in moderate trading with the TSE-300 composite index rising just 2.64 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 4,187.08, for a gain on the week of about 12 points. Declines led advances 341 to 331 but volume fell to 47.43m shares from 57.02m. NOVA Corp. gained  1/4 to 13  1/4 . A Merrill Lynch analyst upgraded the company to medium-term 'above average' from 'neutral.' Royal Oak lost  1/8 to 5  1/2 , American Barrick added  1/4 to 30  7/8 and Lac edged up  1/8 to 13  7/8 . Mexico Mexican equities ended firmer in the last session before presidential elections scheduled for Sunday. The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 9.94 points higher just above the psychological 2,700 point-barrier at 2,708.18, a gain of 0.37 per cent. 'The market was very firm all day,' one trader said. 'Investors remained optimistic about the elections.' Venezuela Caracas stocks closed up sharply in brisk trading buoyed by the recent plunge in domestic interest rates, traders said. The independent Merinvest index rose 3.89 per cent to 144.10 on volume of 10m shares.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK'S PLANS FOR FIREWORKS DOUSED  </P> <P> County fire prevention officials have doused plans for weekly fireworks shows  at Raging Waters. Operators of the San Dimas aquatic theme park had hoped to  present the shows every Saturday night through Labor Day.  </P> <P> But Assistant Fire Chief Ron Jones said the dry brush and expensive homes  surrounding Raging Waters make it unfit for fireworks displays.  </P> <P> Officials granted the park a fireworks permit for the Fourth of July 4 and sent  a crew of fire prevention officers to monitor the show. Fire officers  eliminated high-altitude skyrockets and pyrotechnic experts shot the fireworks  away from the dry brush. Still, embers from the fireworks were found smoldering  in chaparral.  </P> <P> "We're lucky we didn't have a fire on the Fourth of July," Jones said. "It just  doesn't show good judgment to shoot fireworks off into dry brush. . . . The  people who live in that particular area were not too happy at the idea of  fireworks."  </P></p>

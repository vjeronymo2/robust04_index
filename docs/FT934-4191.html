			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Tales of Endeavour and imagination: Recreating Captain Cook's ship has tested the ingenuity of historians and craftsmen. Keith Wheatley meets the team CAPTAIN COOK'S bark HMS Endeavour had, like other ships of the period, a veritable conservatory across her stern. Cook, botanist Joseph Banks, and the other scientists of the 18th century's greatest expedition wanted maximum light in the great cabin. Recreating these windows became a test of will for a team of craftsmen and historians constructing a replica of the Endeavour. 'We initially put modern glass into the frames but it looked horrible. Much too clear,' explained Antonia Macarthur, a British-based naval researcher who has had the responsibility of recreating the ship's interiors. 'Eventually we tracked down a long-established London firm who could make 18th century glass, full of bubbles and imperfections.' But the quest for authenticity went far deeper than the glass in the windows. When the wreck of the Pandora, another 18th century vessel, was found and excavated off the coast of Queensland, divers discovered a sash weight from her great cabin. This has been used as a pattern by blacksmiths creating items for the Endeavour replica. 'No visitor to the ship will ever see those weights but to me, and everyone working on Endeavour, they signify the attention to detail that makes this replica so special,' said Macarthur. On December 9, the 500-tonne Endeavour goes down the slipway in Fremantle, Western Australia. Her building has taken twice as long as Cook's 1768-71 voyage which placed Australia and New Zealand firmly within the known world. Much of the time has been spent raising the Pounds 6.8m needed to fund the project. Of that, Pounds 500,000 came in a single donation from Garry Weston, chairman of Associated British Foods. But the requirements of historical accuracy have their own imperative. 'This will become the benchmark for the recreation of historical ships. This is a crucial vessel as she really was, not Hollywood's millionth rebuild of the Bounty. Everyone is bored stiff with that,' said Fred Walker, until recently chief naval architect at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, and responsible for hull and lines of Endeavour. 'Captain Cook would recognise her straight away if there were to be a miraculous reincarnation,' added Walker. Since the original Endeavour was a 500-ton collier, built as a workhorse to trade between the Yorkshire coalfields and London, no building plans exist. However, once she was commissioned into the Royal Navy a full set of measurements was taken at the dockyard and these still exist at the National Maritime Museum The only significant departure from the original construction is in the use of the native Australian wood jarrah for the hull. Jarrah is so hard that during the 19th century many London streets were paved with it. Endeavour was built of oak. Even if oak of the necessary massive sections were still available its cost would be astronomical. Fred Walker has recently provided budget estimates for a project similar to the Endeavour in Europe and gauges the cost of the timber alone at between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. Other details are painstakingly real. 'Hull timbers are fastened with wooden trenails. I've worked in shipyards and shipbuilding all my life but I'd never seen one driven until I came to the Endeavour project,' enthused Walker. There are other concessions to life at the close of the millennium. Twin diesel engines, a cabin equipped with modern satellite navigation equipment, and full 20th century life-saving equipment were essential if the Endeavour was to be insured and go to sea - as is the intention of her trustees. Once her masts have been stepped and sea trials completed off Western Australia, the little ship will sail to Sydney in the spring of next year, calling en route at major ports such as Adelaide and Melbourne. 'If you're not to be lumbered with an unusable hull you've got to be able to jump through the same international hoops as any other sail-training vessel,' explained Walker. Endeavour will be under the command of Captain Christopher Blake, a British skipper with a special Square Rig endorsement to his master's ticket. Blake is currently Master of Japan's first sail training vessel, the Kaisei. Although the Endeavour's permanent home is to be the Darling Harbour complex in Sydney, Europe's first glimpse of her outside the TV screen is likely to be the following year when she will sail to Britain, re-tracing Cook's homeward voyage. Before then, Macarthur must fill the interior with fabrics and furniture that Cook and his companions would have lived with. The Bond Street company of Harvey &amp; Sons is building and donating a 12ft long oak table for the great cabin. Joseph Banks took a bureau with him. Macarthur is working from records of the kind of furniture he chose for later homes, to extrapolate and decide what he might have taken on the expedition to the Antipodes. 'Banks writes about sleeping in a swinging cot. But how do you construct one? There are two paintings and a sketch extant but they are hardly drawings for a joiner. I think we'll have to build a few and try them out,' she laughed, clearly relishing a historical challenge that is far from dry. 'I'm convinced Mrs Cook would have given him something to take with him, possibly a piece of embroidery for the cabin bulkhead,' said Macarthur, with her own special contribution to the ship firmly in mind. 'My fellow historians will say it is fantasy but you have to use your imagination in something like this.'</p>

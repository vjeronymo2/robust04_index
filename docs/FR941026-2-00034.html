			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Secondary development in the watershed, in part spurred by the highway, would worsen water quality concerns. Historical studies and a recent planning study (I&hyph;190/Wachusett Reservoir Water Supply Protection Study, 1992) support the fact that the presence of interstate highways encourages development and induces growth. Highways provide the necessary access to areas where development has not occurred, as well as additional access to existing developed areas. The Pennichuck Corporation, which owns and operates the Pennichuck Water Supply, controls only 11% (approximately 1800 acres) of the entire Pennichuck Brook watershed. In fact, the Pennichuck Corporation has sold nearly 200 acres of watershed land in recent years and EPA anticipates continued development within the watershed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHCH could directly or indirectly adversely impact a number of groundwater resources, particularly in the communities of Hudson and Litchfield along the project corridor. The increased secondary and cumulative growth will be concentrated at or in the vicinity of the proposed interchanges, within sensitive water supply resource areas. Groundwater degradation is a nearly inevitable consequence of increased development, increased land use, and industrial development. Additionally, there is no assurance that new interchanges would not be constructed in the future along this proposed limited access highway, which would further increase developmental pressures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FEIS also concludes that any of the full or partial build alternatives will degrade or pose a contamination threat to surface water and groundwater resources as a result of stormwater runoff, the possibility of accidental spills, and short-term construction impacts. The FEIS presents these impacts to water supply resources as being essentially unavoidable and states that these potential adverse impacts should be minimized and mitigated, primarily through the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other structural means. However, the future responsibility of mitigating any adverse impacts to water supply resources from accelerated or enhanced associated development would be deferred to local zoning and planning boards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Project Need and Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is clearly a need to reduce or minimize traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area and the Central Business District (CBD) in particular. This is especially true at the Taylor's Falls Bridge, the only crossing of the Merrimack River in New Hampshire south of Manchester. Several primary routes converge on the bridge_Routes 111, 102, and 3A. However, no alternative, including the NHCH, will solve all the traffic difficulties; under all options traffic problems remain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests public comment on the effectiveness of various alternatives to reduce traffic problems in the Nashua area, including the NHCH. We also request comment on other alternatives or combinations of options which would cause considerably less environmental damage, including partial build options, mass transit, reducing existing traffic during rush hours, and improving or expanding existing local roads (see discussion below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA concurred with the project purpose as originally defined by the Corps: ``to provide a transportation improvement to assist east-west traffic movements and to reduce congestion on existing bridges and streets in and near the central business districts of Nashua and Hudson by adding new crossings of the Merrimack River.'' However, the EIS includes the additional ``goal'' of reducing traffic volumes for the CBD in the year 2010 to a level less than existing traffic levels, as specifically measured by the percent change in LOS F miles (explained below) from 1990 to 2010. Alternatives which did not meet this specific goal were eliminated as being ``impracticable.'' Because this test for practicability is constrained in space (central business district), time (compares two specific years of analysis) and measure (percentage of miles of level of service F), it artificially eliminated certain alternatives from further consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the basic project purpose, in keeping with the requirements of the Guidelines, would be: to reduce a large portion of the traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area (as defined in the EIS), with greater importance being given to the Central Business District. This basic project purpose would provide a sound basis to evaluate and judge the practicability of various options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Traffic engineers analyze traffic conditions and future projections using a number of different techniques, including the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Average daily traffic volume (ADT) for roadway segments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Level of Service (LOS)_for roadway segments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Level of Service (LOS)_for intersections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Free-Flow and Congested Vehicle Hours of Travel (VHT)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Typically highway departments use a peak-hour analysis of existing and projected conditions to determine the need for highway improvements. Existing and future ``Levels of Service'' are analyzed. LOS is a qualitative measure describing operational conditions assigned a letter A&hyph;F. LOS A and B represent relatively little traffic and LOS E and F represent heavy traffic conditions and vehicular delay for at least peak hours (prime commuting hours).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of these methods were used with Nashua to predict future traffic conditions (2010) in three separate locations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The central business district (CBD)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The F.E. Everett Turnpike (Turnpike)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

Using DOT data and models, the full build would remove LOS F <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; in the CBD (F <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; is worse than F), while, for example, if a partial build highway from Route 102 north to the Turnpike were constructed, 1.2 miles of LOS F <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; would remain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LATE FILERS' FOR AMNESTY CAMP OUT AT INS OFFICES  </P> <P> Hoping for a last chance to qualify under the federal amnesty program, hundreds  of undocumented aliens have been crowding local offices of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service, some camping out overnight only to be turned away  because of a shortage of staff to process all the cases.  </P> <P> Although the amnesty program officially ended in May, 1988, the new rush has  resulted from two lawsuits that cleared the way for an estimated 250,000 more  people to qualify for permanent residency.  </P> <P> The lawsuits, filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens and  Catholic Social Services, contended that the INS unfairly excluded people who  had left the country briefly since 1982. The 1986 Immigration Reform and  Naturalization Act granted amnesty to aliens who could prove they had been  living in this country continuously since 1982.  </P> <P> The lawsuits asked that amnesty be extended to people who left the country for  "brief, casual or innocent" periods since 1982 but maintained residency in the  United States.  </P> <P> The INS, which is fighting the suits, has been ordered to begin processing  applications of "late filers" under the new program, according to INS  officials. But because staffing level at agency offices were reduced when the  amnesty program ended, the new flood of applicants overburdened local staffs.  </P> <P> At the legalization office on Ritchey Street in Santa Ana, police were called  last Monday when a fistfight broke out among several people over who was first  in line. That same week, the crush of people waiting broke down one of the  front doors, according to a private security officer at the office and to  immigrant rights advocates.  </P> <P> Similar problems have occurred at the 10 legalization offices in the Los  Angeles, Ventura and Orange County areas, INS officials say. Crowds also have  been reported in recent weeks at legalization offices in Chicago, New York,  Miami, Tucson and Phoenix, immigrant advocacy groups say.  </P> <P> "I'm hearing about fistfights all over the country," said Peter Schey,  executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Dona Coultice, of the INS office in Laguna Niguel, said the crush is worse in  certain areas than in others.  </P> <P> "Frankly, the offices closer to downtown Los Angeles, and the one in San  Fernando, are the hardest hit," she said. "Huntington Park and Hollywood are  also feeling it, probably because of the large concentration of undocumenteds."  </P> <P> Nilesh Patel, a Los Angeles insurance salesman, camped out overnight with a  friend from India outside the Wilshire Boulevard INS office last week, waiting  for it to open. They arrived at 6 p.m. the day before to assure they would be  waited on, along with 30 or 40 other people.  </P> <P> "They only took the first 10 people in line, and we never got in," Patel said.  "My friend is just going to keep trying. It's first come, first served. I think  10 is too small a number."  </P></p>

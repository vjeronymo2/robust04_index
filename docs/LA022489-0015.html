			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> $27,000 RESTORATION GIFT;  </P> <P> CHARRED O'MELVENY PARK GETS A HAND  </P> <P> Restoration efforts at fire-ravaged O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills were  boosted Thursday by a $27,000 donation to rebuild fences and repair sprinkler  systems destroyed in December's Porter Ranch brush fire.  </P> <P> Warren Christopher, chairman of the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers,  presented the check to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley during a brief ceremony at  the 714-acre park, known before the fire for its pristine vegetation, chaparral  and grasslands.  </P> <P> "We were particularly saddened that the fire damaged so much," Christopher  said. "This park has a particular sentimental value to our firm."  </P> <P> Most of the land was donated to the city in 1973 for park use by the law firm's  late senior partner, John O'Melveny. The hilly park, which has more than 10  miles of trails, has become a popular hiking area.  </P> <P> The fire, which destroyed or damaged 40 homes and burned 3,200 acres, charred  the hillsides of O'Melveny Park, burning nearly all of the area's trees, shrubs  and wildflowers, and causing more than $300,000 in damage to park equipment.  </P> <P> An old red barn that the city had planned to renovate for use as a visitors  center was destroyed.  </P> <P> Although the city Recreation and Parks Department has applied for $310,000 in  state disaster funds to rebuild the barn and replace equipment, the law firm's  donation has allowed the city to purchase a truck and equipment to immediately  begin restoration work, said James Hadaway, department general manager.  </P> <P> Parks officials decided in late December to allow the ashen hillsides to  regenerate naturally and will not seed the park with ryegrass, which is not  native to Southern California.  </P> <P> Green vegetation already tinges some of the park's slopes. It will take up to  three years for chaparral to grow back, officials said. Park rangers said that  despite the charred trails, hikers have been visiting the park on weekends.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Thai Ambassador to Phnom Penh,  Sakthip Krairoek, yesterday called on Cambodia and the world at  large to recognize the suffering Thailand has had to face as a  result of conflicts inside Cambodia.    Sakthip said wide criticism had been leveled at Thailand for  its alleged support of the Khmer Rouge, but critics seemed to  ignore the fact that Thai people had been badly affected.    The envoy was referring to criticism by Cambodian prime  minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.    The Cambodian government recently appealed for financial  support to enable it to finally crush the Khmer Rouge, the  Maoist group under whose reign of terror more than 1 million  Cambodians died in the 1970s.    Thailand's responded to Cambodia's latest request for  international support by saying it would be wrong for other  countries to supply arms to either side in the long-running  Cambodian civil war.    The U.S., Australia and France are considering Cambodia's  request for assistance. However an informed source yesterday  said no written request had been sent to the governments of the  three countries.    Prince Ranariddh said Thailand's opposition to the request  is  tantamount to interference in Cambodia's internal affairs.    Sakthip said: "We are an immediate neighbor of Cambodia. The  continued fighting in Cambodia has seriously affected Thai  villagers along the border. Increasing the supply of weapons to  Cambodian troops would certainly increase the suffering of Thais.    "Does the world community know about the deaths of innocent  Thais and the damage caused to Thai property along the border  when the Cambodians are fighting. Other countries only seem to  be aware of the allegation that Thailand supports the Khmer  Rouge," he said.    Sakthip said that Thailand has every right to express the  opinion that the supply of more weapons to Phnom Penh would  prolong the military confrontation.    High-ranking Thai officials, including the military, have  voiced strong opposition to the request, saying the weapons  would be sold across the Thai border by the ill-disciplined  Cambodian government troops.    "Does Prince Ranariddh know about the Thai suffering. And if  he knows, does he care?" said Sakthip.    Despite Thailand lodging numerous complaints with the  Cambodian foreign ministry, Phnom Penh continued to ignore the  plight of Thai villagers.    "That's why Thailand resisted the Cambodians' plea for  arms,"  he said.</p>

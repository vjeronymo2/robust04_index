			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Default less likely with clearing house agreement Sir, While your Risk and Reward column of September 13 ('Divisions hazy in OTC derivatives clearing debate') was as usual both timely and informative, some flawed and spurious logic has apparently crept in. The article refers to the risks relating to bank deposit guarantee schemes. Similarly it suggests, in a clearing house agreement, 'low-rated banks could be given excessively large credit lines by other banks because they know they do not have to worry about credit'. This shows either a lack of understanding of how clearing houses work or naivety over how important credit risk is to clearing members. For the argument to make any sense one must assume that clearing houses and/or clearing member firms are unconcerned with the creditworthiness of their members and customers. This is highly unlikely, given that the raison d'etre of a clearing house is to centralise credit risk in one entity that intensely scrutinises and works to minimise the likelihood of counterparty defaults.

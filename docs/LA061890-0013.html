			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION SECRETARY CAVAZOS' CRITICISM OF LATINO PARENTS  </P> <P> Once again, Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos' is making statements that  Latino parents deserve much of the blame for their children's high dropout rate  and that they have lost their value for education ("Cavazos Reaffirms Stand in  Criticism of Latino Parents," Part B, June 5; "Parents' Role Stressed at Latino  Education Hearing," Part B, June 6).  </P> <P> How do scholars like Cavazos come to think that Latino culture and its people  don't value education? Does the scientific data support them? Are there studies  that would challenge this way of thinking?  </P> <P> The most recent empirical research on the topic of educational and occupational  goals reveals that when students of the same social class are compared, Latinos  have higher educational and occupational aspirations than whites.  </P> <P> These and other data seem to suggest that Latino parents send, and their  children come, to school with dreams that they will one day finish college and  enter a high-status occupation.  </P> <P> Why haven't these dreams been translated into higher educational and  occupational attainment? Are we starting from the correct assumption if we  state that all students attend schools of equal quality? If schools are not  equal, then should we focus on certain school characteristics and show how they  affect the achievement of Latino students?  </P> <P> A focus on schools might allow the researcher to analyze the relative impact of  segregated, overcrowded, and under-financed schools; school staffing,  curriculum, and tracking patterns; and teacher expectations and interaction  patterns.  </P> <P> The Times' editorial ("Are Latino Parents to Blame?" April 12) stated that,  "Cavazos' challenge is not just prodding resistant Latino parents, but  reluctant public officials (like his boss, President Bush) to ante up more  money for innovative efforts that help the learning process along." If Cavazos  and others don't take up your challenge and equalize educational opportunities  and structures, the conclusion is inevitable that they, not Latino parents and  students, are the ones who do not value education.  </P> <P> DANIEL G.

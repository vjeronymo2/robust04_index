			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVEN'S LEGACY  </P> <P> Regarding "Who Was Steven" (Sept. 22, by Paul Dean): An abduction by a stranger  by whom he was repeatedly sexually molested over a period of seven years robbed  him of his childhood innocence. A tragic motorcycle accident recently robbed  him of his life. Some people never get an even break in life. Steven Stayner  was definitely one of those people. Hopefully he has now found tranquility and  peace of mind. After the miserable life he has gone through, he certainly  deserves it.  </P> <P> KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN, Cypress  </P></p>

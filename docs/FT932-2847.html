			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Brewers angry at Customs statement THE ROW between Customs and Excise officials and the Brewers' Society broke out again yesterday over Customs' statements that the new system of beer duty introduced earlier this month would not penalise brewers but bring them 'a bonus of millions', Philip Rawstorne writes. Brewers protested two weeks ago that the system - under which duty is charged on the alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase the industry's tax burden by Pounds 64m a year. Bass, Courage, and Carlsberg-Tetley, the three leading brewers, announced reductions in the strength of a number of beer brands to ease the impact. Customs and Excise said that switching the duty charge from an earlier production stage would produce a one-off cashflow benefit to the industry of Pounds 200m. Mr Robin Simpson, the society's director, said the Customs statement was 'absolutely outrageous'. He added: 'The one-off benefit to brewers comes from paying duty a few weeks later. To suggest this offsets in any significant way an increase of 3 per cent in the industry's taxation bill is blatantly misleading.'</p>

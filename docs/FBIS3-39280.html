			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Michele Salvati, PDS economist, by </F> Vito Biello; place and date not given: "Rigor Is Sprouting Under  the Oak Tree"]    [Text] [Biello] Professor Salvati, what are the two or  three essential points of the government economic program of the  progressive area?    [Salvati] The first really essential point is the selection  of the persons to head the government, and the principal  ministers. Beyond all the statements of principle, it is much  more important to the potential voter to have an idea of the  team that will make the decisions. It makes a big difference,  and the message is immediate, to entrust reform of the  bureaucracy to Cassese instead of Gasperi, for example.    [Biello] Therefore, you believe it is useful to announce the  names of the prime minister and the team along with the program?    [Salvati] In a sense, the names of the principal ministers  are even more important than that of the prime minister.  Precisely because the things that need to be done for this  country involve primarily modernization and civility, and not  questions of right or left, the persons selected are decisive.  Everyone will say in their programs that the fundamental issue  is state administration, reform of government finances; everyone  will repeat a series of obvious key points.    [Biello] What distinguishes the progressive program from  that  of the moderates?    [Salvati] If I had to give a very general picture, I would  say that, compared with the center-right, the moderate left  should be more attentive to industrial growth and employment  than to financial rigor.    [Biello] Rigor and resources. How will a progressive  government operate?    [Salvati] The truth is that many of the measures that must  be  taken and on which a government of left-center should commit  itself have little to do with the macroeconomic side, for which  the road is rather obligatory. There can be some differences:  for example, I believe that a government of the left would be  less disposed to be the best pupil in the class in Europe, on  monetary and financial matters, and instead would defend more  strongly the interests of industry and workers in its own  country. However, the important differences are to be found at  the structural level, in the tax structure, government spending,  reform of government administration. Let us be clear about  rigor. The problem is the an eventual left-center policy runs  the risk of being too rigorous. Let me explain with an example:  did not a large part of all those votes for Fini in Rome come  from government employees angry with Cassese? Is that not rigor?  In effect, the policy of left-center recognizes on the one hand  that not much can be done at the macroeconomic level, on the  other hand it insists on measures of rationalization and  structural reform that could be unpopular.    [Biello] You are saying that only a government of the left  can carry out a policy of the right?    [Salvati] It is not a question of right or left. For  example,  if strong elements of equity and responsibility are introduced  into the government administration, a work of justice is  accomplished. This is almost a revolutionary decision for the  left. The Cassese plan is justice and only justice: it completes  equalization of working conditions in the public and the private  sectors. So that today a bit of justice goes arm in arm with  efficiency.    [Biello] And besides government administration?    [Salvati] There are situations that separate the two sides.  Situations of real social hardships, such as dismissals, for  example, about which the left cannot close its eyes and think  that they need not be assisted. There are also certain requests,  such as flexibility in lay offs, which certainly must be faced,  but in a detailed way. A different matter is the attack on  injustice, wherever it may be, at the fiscal level, the  bureaucracy, or high incomes. Today we have a profoundly unequal  distribution of income and the picture of industrial efficiency  is desolate. Therefore, supervisory institutions such as the  "Antitrust" or the Consob [Commission for the Supervision of  Companies and Stock Exchanges] must be greatly strengthened. If  there is to be rigor, it must be for everyone.    [Biello] Do you favor greater flexibility in the labor  market?    [Salvati] I do not question certain measures of flexibility.  For example, I would be in favor of encouraging "part-time"  work, which is substantially ignored in Italy. It would be  necessary to discuss others in detail, one by one.    [Biello] What do you think of the Confindustria decalogue?    [Salvati] I think it was an intelligent and timely political  move. Seven or eight of those requests show good sense. The  political significance however is: we will abstain from the  immediate political struggle and evaluate the facts. It is a  responsible and democratic position.    [Biello] But what would you respond to the specific points?    [Salvati] It would be necessary to go into it in detail. But  for the most part, we would agree.    [Biello] What are the names of the government team?    [Salvati] For certain ministries I would not go further than  those in the preceding government, partly to avoid problems. For  others, it would not be difficult to find names. The problem is  a different one, it is the creation of a new leadership class.    [Biello] And Ciampi?    [Salvati] He has been useful in this transitional phase.  This  has been an important government. What happened during this  period was amazing: the government, passing the budget bill, and  kept on its feet by the Lega and the PDS.    [Biello] But could this responsibility shown by the PDS have  been only tactical?    [Salvati] If being tactical means being responsible, fine. I  understand the perplexity of certain observers. However, I do  not share certain very skeptical statements by a person I  esteem, such as Andreotti. Some of his comments went too far: it  is true that, following the logic of the past, the PDS played  the game like all the others. But we are in a very different  situation now: watch what the PDS does and judge it on that  basis.</p>

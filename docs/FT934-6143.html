			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Model plan for a Northern Ireland assembly The chances of a new Northern Ireland assembly appeared to improve this week after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, approved ministerial efforts to broker a compromise on a form of devolved government for the province. As leader of the province's largest political party, with nine MPs available to bolster Mr John Major's slim Commons majority, in effect Mr Molyneaux has a veto over the government's proposals. At last year's abortive talks, a working party including all four constitutional parties agreed a blueprint for an 85-seat assembly with some legislative powers. It is this provisional model which provides the best pointer to how the new body might be structured. It is far from certain, however, that all party leaders would find it acceptable. The 85 assembly members would be elected under a system of proportional representation from the 17 Northern Ireland constituencies. Unionists would probably push for most legislative powers to be retained initially in London. But Mr Molyneaux accepts that even if the assembly began in effect as a regional council, its role would later be expanded if it functioned effectively. 'I have always said I am in favour of devolved government at as high a level as can be obtained without paying the price of unworkability.' The Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party has proposed that the assembly has a right to submit to parliament any proposal securing the support of 60 per cent of assembly members. There would continue to be a Northern Ireland secretary, but each of the Northern Ireland Office's departments would be answerable to an elected assembly member. There are now six departments, but they could be divided into smaller units. It is understood that agreement was reached for these departmental heads to double up as chairmen of the assembly's committees. A formula would be applied to try to ensure that the number of these positions held by each party was proportionate to its numerical strength in the assembly. The working party is also said to have agreed that a three-member 'panel' be set up, with its members elected in a similar way to the province's three MEPs. This panel could be given powers of adjudication over controversial matters. Under one possible mechanism, it would be brought into play if 30 per cent of assembly members so requested. Its role may include approving public appointments. In Mr Molyneaux's view, there is a 'fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, will be able to identify common ground enabling the parties to start the process of restoring accountable democracy for the province 'within a week or two'. He says he would back Mr Ancram if he secured agreement to the proposals outlined in the abortive talks. 'But if they find they cannot identify common ground at that level, they should move down the scale to the point where there is.'</p>

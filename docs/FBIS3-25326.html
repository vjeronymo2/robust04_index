			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The first 5,000 government and Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] troops joining the future  Mozambican army, particularly its infantry division, begin their  training in Dondo, Sofala Province, and in Manhica and Boane,  Maputo Province, on 21 February. The government has already  submitted the list of its 2,500 men to the British training  team. Renamo still has to submit the list of its 2,500 men, but  the organization says it will do so by 11 February.    This morning's session of the Joint Commission for the  Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces discussed  issues relating to the creation of the new Mozambican army --  namely, the type of organization, budget and logistics, and  compliance with the dates set for the training of troops. The  training of the 5,000 infantry soldiers will be given by  instructors trained in Nyanga, Zimbabwe. British specialists  will play an advisory role. [passage omitted]</p>

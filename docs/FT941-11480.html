			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / National party woos voters across racial divide: 'Forget apartheid' is gist of South African ruling party's election manifesto 'Apartheid - let's forget about it,' says Victor Gumbi, a black organiser for South Africa's ruling National party, the party which forced him to live in the black township of Soweto, denied him basic human rights and gave him third-class education and healthcare for decades, but nonetheless wants his vote in April's all-race elections. Yesterday, in the presence of 3,000 delegates including perhaps a third 'non-white', the new non-racial National party published an election manifesto which can be summarised in exactly the phrase chosen by Victor: forget apartheid. The party congress, held outside Johannesburg, was a surreal affair. National party politicians, uncertain how to communicate with their new black, brown and Indian supporters, borrowed the rhetorical tricks of the African National Congress to try to stir the moribund conference to life. The effort fell flat. The cries of 'Viva, President de Klerk, Viva' and 'Long live' stimulated a few uncomfortable whites to give the clenched-fist black power salute; but most delegates offered no more than muted applause. They seemed slightly bemused by the proceedings. Desperate to gain the black, coloured and Indian votes without which the party is doomed, the NP loaded its election list with 'non-white' candidates, many of them politicians who served in the tricameral parliament (which gave coloureds and Indians the vote, but excluded blacks), or people with little political experience. The list for the northern Transvaal region is overwhelmingly black, and in the crucial Pretoria-Johannesburg region the seventh position is held by a black man, Mr David Chuenyane, who chaired the congress. So why did Mr David Chuenyane join the National party, especially after decades in exile with the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress? 'I'm an opportunist,' he says with a candour rare among his white colleagues. 'I saw an opportunity in the NP and I said: 'The NP is stranded. They need somebody black'.' Anyway, he adds, there were no good positions going in the African National Congress. Now the NP is trying to sell itself as a party with experience of government (apparently oblivious to the charge that 40 years' experience implementing apartheid scarcely inspires confidence for the future). The party's manifesto solemnly promises to protect exactly those basic freedoms which National party governments abused on a regular basis for more than 40 years. Nobody would deny it is a tall order to sell a party with a history like that of the National party (Mr Tim Bell, of Thatcher election fame, is advising the NP in its efforts). But the black South Africans who decide in the end to vote NP will not mind about that: they will be voting to keep out the Xhosas, who are perceived to dominate the ANC; they will be registering a protest at political violence which some blame on the ANC; or they will betray a kind of inverted racism, bred by apartheid, which has left some older, traditional, blacks thinking only whites can govern. The size of this support base is impossible to measure, least of all by opinion polls conducted in an atmosphere of political violence, where respondents often say they are undecided rather than risk revealing their views. Opinion polls published yesterday indicated 25 per cent of the electorate is undecided; earlier polls showed only 1 per cent black support for the NP, although support among coloured and Indians is substantial. It seems a fair bet that President FW de Klerk's confidence is misplaced when he predicts that the NP will win the election outright; but however difficult his campaign, and however bitter the irony of his message, some black Africans will vote for him as the man who ended apartheid. It is an irony of history that his party should depend on the ones who suffered most under National party rule for its very survival in the new South Africa.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Sellafield workers face ban on voting in council Copeland Borough Council, the local authority responsible for planning decisions relating to British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield plant, has received legal advice that councillors who work for BNF should not vote on applications made by their employer. Until now Copeland councillors employed by BNF have been allowed to vote on its applications for permission for sometimes controversial developments at the west Cumbria nuclear-waste reprocessing site. But in response to a Copeland council request for legal guidance Mr Steven Cockman QC, a specialist in local government law, has advised that councillors should declare an interest and not vote on applications by their employer or their spouses' employer. If Labour-controlled Copeland implements this advice, it would change the balance of power on the key planning and services committee, where four of the seven Labour members are BNF employees. Their withdrawal when BNF applications were being considered would leave three Labour members, four Conservatives and one independent. Nine of Copeland's 53 councillors are Sellafield employees of BNF, the area's dominant employer. They include Labour and Conservative members. Several others are married to BNF employees. Legal guidance was sought during a council review of its standing orders. A decision on whether to implement the QC's advice will be taken following a debate at the next full council meeting next month. Some councillors are unhappy at the proposal, believing their workplace experience gives them useful knowledge to contribute to decisions. Under the Department of the Environment's national code, councillors should normally declare an interest and not vote when they have a pecuniary or other direct interest. But the department said it was up to councils how they interpreted this guidance.</p>

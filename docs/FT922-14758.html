			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax forms for free I AM a non-resident of the UK for tax purposes and receive income from UK government stocks. I have to make an exemption claim every two or three years. Previously I have obtained the relevant form through my bank, incurring charges. Where should I write to get the form sent straight to me? Write to the Inspector of Foreign Dividends, Lynwood Road, Thames Ditton, Surrey KT7 0DP, UK. If you do not know the reference number which has appeared on your past claim forms, give your full name and your previous address if you have moved since your last claim or questionnaire form was submitted; this will help to trace your file. It will also help if you make it clear whether you have claimed exemption from tax by virtue of (a) article 11 of the double taxation convention with Switzerland, or, (b) the terms of issue of the particular gilt-edged securities which you hold. A list of the holdings would also be helpful. We take it that they are registered in your own name - if not, you should give details of the registration of each holding. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

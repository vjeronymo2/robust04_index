			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F> Laurent Mauduit and Pascal Riche; place and date not given]    [Text] Edmond Alphandery has been campaigning for the  independence of the Bank of France for many years. As economy  minister, it is he who has guided the reform. He explained its  main outlines.    [LIBERATION] Why give the Bank of France its independence so  quickly?    [Alphandery] At first, there was a desire to improve the  monetary environment of the French economy: French interest  rates had hitherto incorporated a major risk premium because the  medium-term monetary strategy was not sufficiently readable.  However, one of the ways of reducing this risk premium --  costly for the economy, because it affects the interest rate  level -- is to guarantee the independence of the issuing  institution in the conduct of monetary policy so as to increase  the currency's credibility. Moreover, it is common knowledge  that the Beregovoy government considered this at the beginning  of 1993.    [LIBERATION] The promised independence of the Bank of France  is not the only factor that has contributed to the reduction of  this risk premium....    [Alphandery] No, but it has contributed to it. On 29 March,  on the eve of the parliamentary election, when we announced the  plan, the difference between French and German three-month  interest rates was 2.81 percent to France's detriment. It is  now only 0.38 percent. In the same period of time, the risk  premium has virtually disappeared for 10-year rates.    [LIBERATION] It must also be said that the controversies  within the majority on monetary policy have disappeared.    [Alphandery] It is true that we now enjoy a broad consensus.    [LIBERATION] Surely the reduction in rates is not the only  justification for the independence of the Bank of France?    [Alphandery] Naturally not. Several fundamental reasons  justify this reform. The first that comes to mind is the  implementation of the Treaty on European Union. However, the  idea for the independence of the Bank of France is an older one,  at least for the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and the RPR  [Rally for the Republic]. It comes from the unhappy memory of  the 1981 recovery: Then, the budget deficit was financed by  increasing the money supply. At the time, the independence of  the Bank of France could have played the role of safeguard.  That is why prominent figures like Balladur, Barre, Giscard  d'Estaing, and even Pasqua very quickly defended this reform in  turn.    [LIBERATION] And yet there was no need for France to move so  quickly...    [Alphandery] Perhaps not. But in addition to the reasons  already given, there is another, deeper reason: The eighties  were characterized throughout the world, including the formerly  socialist countries, by a speeding up of the decentralization of  decisionmaking. People realized that this is the best method of  managing modern economies. This is the meaning of the policies  pursued almost everywhere: privatizations, return to market  mechanisms, or even the independence of issuing institutions.  By this legislation, France has adopted a modern approach.    [LIBERATION] The modern approach to which you refer  nonetheless raises several essential political questions. What  happens to the pilot? The independence of monetary policy --  like privatization -- reduces the economy minister's powers.  What purpose will your successor serve?    [Alphandery] This question of the pilot is not limited to  France. We are not taking an untrodden path. We are not  implementing a reform which has no reference point in the world:  Where is the pilot in the United States, in Germany, in  Switzerland? Nobody asks that. The real question is the  distribution of powers between a central bank and the minister  in charge of the economy. Hitherto in France there was a close  association between the governor of the Bank of France and the  minister for the administration of monetary policy. But the  ultimate responsibility for that policy rested with the  government. Today, the ultimate responsibility for the  decisions to cut or increase interest rates will rest with the  Monetary Policy Council. But the bridges to the minister will  not be cut: Consultation and discussion will obviously be  maintained as is the case in the United States or in Germany.  And, moreover, dialogue means democracy.    [LIBERATION] Democracy can also mean conflict. A situation  of antagonism can be imagined.    [Alphandery] There may be differences of opinion and, in  that  case, each will shoulder the responsibilities stipulated by the  law.    You know, the Monetary Policy Council will not live in  secret  in rue de La Vrilliere: Independence does not mean  irresponsibility. There will be regular hearings at which the  governor will address the Parliamentary Finance Commissions,  there will be public reports, and press comment. The Bank of  France will be forced to take public positions on subjects which  go beyond monetary policy proper. It already does so, read for  instance the annual reports addressed to the president of the  republic. Monetary policy and economic policy cannot be  conducted in isolation.    [LIBERATION] The central bank will also have to have a  dialogue with the other European central banks within the  European Monetary Institute [EMI] which has just been  established in Frankfurt. Do you think that between now and the  creation of the single European currency, a concerted monetary  policy is possible within this institute?    [Alphandery] Consultation among the central banks existed  already within the Council of Governors. The EMI, which  replaces it, will go further, because it must think about what  form the future Central European Bank will take. The EMI must  prepare the third and final phase of the union process and  answer some fundamental questions: How to pursue a monetary  policy at European level, how to harmonize interventions on the  money markets among the various European central banks?    [LIBERATION] But do you think it is conceivable that under  EMI auspices concerted monetary policy decisions will be made: a  cut in rates, for instance?    [Alphandery] It is not expected at all, because the central  banks are independent until the start of the third phase. The  EMI must not replace the central banks. Consultation has never  meant joint decision.    [LIBERATION] What philosophy governed the choice of members  of the Monetary Policy Council?    [Alphandery] We tried to form a credible council at national  and international level: The people chosen had to have real  influence. The other concern was to guarantee that the various  council members had pursued different careers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Supporting the Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three commenters supporting the interim rule expressed concern over Customs ability to combat transshipment resulting in an unlawful entry of textiles and textile products, and were of the opinion that the interim rule, as written, would serve as a useful deterrent to such unlawful practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Opposing the Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the eight commenters opposing the interim rule or seeking to limit its application, three claimed that the interim rule unfairly discriminated against textile importers by holding such importers to a higher standard of care than that required of parties importing other merchandise. Two of these three commenters indicated that it was illogical for Customs to consider the act of transshipment an aggravating factor when, in fact, the act of transshipment constitutes the violation in question or, at least, an element of the violation. Put another way, these two commenters were of the opinion that aggravating factors cannot constitute the violation in question. Otherwise, according to one of these commenters, undervaluation logically would have to be an aggravating factor in cases involving understatement of value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two other commenters stated that the interim rule should be limited in its application to those instances where the importer had actual knowledge of the improper transshipment of the textile products at issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the remaining three commenters fully opposed to the interim rule, they objected on the basis that the rule constituted the imposition of unfair additional penalties and that mitigation in such cases would become meaningless. These commenters felt that existing guidelines were adequate and that the interim rule was not in keeping with the spirit of the recently enacted Customs Modernization Act. One of these commenters also expressed concern that the rule would permit Customs to raise the assessed penalty in cases involving transshipment. Finally, one of the commenters indicated that rules such as the interim rule have forced the closure of his apparel importing company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Customs Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs acknowledges the concerns expressed by those commenters opposed to the interim rule on the basis that the rule discriminates against textile importers, but the importing community and domestic industry must, in Customs opinion, acknowledge the dilemma faced by the agency, namely, balancing the interests of the importer against the explosion of illegal transshipments to the United States. Aside from the obvious negative impact such shipments can have on domestic industry, illegally transshipped goods deceive U.S. consumers regarding the country of origin of imported merchandise, as well as distort the application of bilateral agreements with our trading partners. When faced with similar situations, Customs has had to take enforcement actions which focus on specific commodities or types of merchandise. In effect, the interim rule provides a warning to textile importers about the threat of illegal transshipment and suggests that such importers take extra pre-importation measures to ensure the accuracy of the country of origin of the products in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to some commenters' views, it is clear that these textile transshipments do not,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> per se, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  constitute a violation of section 1592. Such transshipments may, or may not, result in false statements concerning the country of origin on entry documents, or goods being falsely marked with an incorrect country of origin. Consequently, a violation occurs at the time when the transshipped textile goods arrive for entry in the United States and are falsely marked, or the entry documents contain culpable, material false statements, omissions or acts. In other words, with respect to the circumstances under discussion, the act of textile transshipment does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of section 1592.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to those commenters who recommended implementation of the rule provided that it only apply to those instances where the importer has actual knowledge of the improper transshipment, Customs notes that application of this aggravating factor would first require that Customs establish a violation of section 1592. If the importer is an innocent party to the transaction, then that importer will not be considered culpable, and therefore, cannot be charged with a violation of section 1592.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Customs also would like to clear up what appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the meaning of the term ``aggravating factor'' and the practical impact of the presence of an aggravating factor in a penalty situation. First, as indicated above, aggravating factors alone do not constitute a violation of section 1592. Second, contrary to some commenters' belief, the presence of an aggravating factor does not increase or decrease the asserted level of culpability set forth in Customs section 1592 prepenalty and/or penalty notices. For example, in the case of an importer's material grossly negligent false statement of origin on an entry document, Customs does not increase the asserted level of culpability to fraud because the goods were transshipped. Rather, in arriving at the administrative disposition in a penalty action, Customs treats the presence of an aggravating factor (designated as such in the Customs guidelines) as an offset to the presence of a mitigating factor. It should also be noted that because the interim rule involves Customs penalty guidelines and such guidelines are neither statutory nor regulatory, per se, certain circumstances may warrant deviation from the ordinary application of the guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Speaking yesterday [7 May] at a seminar on  mainland-related economic and trade policy and cross-strait  transportation sponsored by the [words indistinct] Junior  Chamber in Taichung City, Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the  Mainland Affairs Council under the Executive Yuan, said: As  part of our plans to build Taiwan into a business center in the  Asia-Pacific region, we do not exclude the possibility of  establishing direct transportation links with Mainland China.  However, we should not end up turning Shanghai into a business  center following the establishment of such links. Now is not  the time to foster wide-ranging transportation links.    Huang Kun-hui said: Direct cross-strait transportation can  indeed reduce the cost and time of shipping containers.  However, since our country and Communist China are in a state  of hostility, the unconditional establishment of such links will  amount to an acknowledgement that any direct routes thus  established are domestic routes in Communist China. This will  make it difficult to clarify to other nations that our country  is not a province of China. Also, direct transportation  services will affect our country's alert status.</p>

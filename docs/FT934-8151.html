			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / IBM offshoot with a future to look after: In Hampshire, no one thinks they are prolonging the death agonies of a hopeless case UNDER THE bonnet of Aston Martin's new DB7 sports car, which enters production in April next year, is evidence of IBM Havant's determination to prove that it can make its own way in the world. The electronic engine management system, key to the car's performance, has been designed by Zytek Automotive but it will be manufactured in volumes of up to 700 a year by the Hampshire-based manufacturing and development division of International Business Machines - the world's largest computer maker. The manufacturing deal is one of about a dozen that Havant has struck in the past six months with customers outside IBM and which seem likely to guarantee Havant's survival, with the jobs of the 1,500 people it employs. Havant was earlier this year redesignated as an 'industrial business centre', owned by IBM but controlled by local management and with its own profit and loss responsibility. It was one of four European plants that the troubled computer giant had deemed 'surplus to requirements' and which had to make a satisfactory profit on their own or face closure. IBM has been losing money heavily in the past two years, hit globally by recession and price wars in the computer business. It has been restructuring on a grand scale. In retrospect it seems the threat to Havant was more apparent than real. The facility's main role is the manufacture of hard disk drives and controllers for IBM's small computer systems. This year it will make nearly 1m hard disk drives for IBM. Next year, with volumes boosted by a contract from the US disk drive manufacturer Western Digital, the total is likely to be 2m. For some components Havant is IBM's only source worldwide. This year, for example, it will turn out more than 1m flexible electronic circuits, essential technical wizardry for tiny, portable electronic gadgets. It will also make about 4,000 memory sub-systems for IBM's mid-range computers. Its senior executives see themselves managing a vigorous business rather than prolonging the death agonies of a hopeless case. Mr Ken Wilkie, chief executive, was in charge of logistical support for IBM UK's manufacturing operations while Ms Catherine Marsden, head of marketing, worked directly with Mr Nick Temple, IBM UK chief executive, on his plans to restructure the British subsidiary. This year, Mr Wilkie said, turnover would amount to about Pounds 500,000, of which 15 per cent would be derived from work undertaken for companies outside IBM. Havant has established its own business brand - 'Xyratex' - to distinguish its engineering work for outside customers. Offerings will include design, manufacturing and full support services including logistics, quality assurance and laboratory facilities. A key selling point, Mr Wilkie believes, is its ability to control the product manufacturing process from design and development to delivery and service. The Xyratex name was created by the style consultancy Interbrand. There is a lighter side to Xyratex's work. Among its creations is the 'Note Station', a system it developed for the Music Writer company, which prints on demand the complete score of a musical work - transposing it into any key the customer wants along the way. It also makes Winners All, a gambling machine.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Brussels warns Bonn on beef Germany was warned yesterday by the European Commission that it would be breaking European law if it tried to ban British beef because of fears about bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The agriculture commissioner wrote to Bonn warning against unilateral action on Friday when the German parliament is due to vote on the subject. The EU is considering scientific evidence and may draw up new rules on the import of British beef. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture secretary, welcomed the move. 'It certainly vindicates our stance and it vindicates my view that the Germans would end up in court  - and now they know it officially,' she said in a television interview. EU scientists yesterday resumed talks on the best way of countering the threat of mad cow disease.</p>

What is your relationship with the Ansar  al-Sunnah group?    Bin-Ladin: Our relationship with the Ansar  al-Sunnah group is like our relationship with the other Islamic  groups -- a close, cordial, and good relationship based on  brotherhood in God. It is Muslims' duty toward their Muslim  brothers.    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: Did you have any dealings with  the Afghan groups?    Bin-Ladin: We harbor no hostility toward anyone  or any Afghan groups. Our relationship with the Afghan  mojahedin began in 1399 Hijra (1979), namely when we went to  Lahore, Pakistan, and worked with the Islamic group in Pakistan  to support the mojahedin against the communist invasion.    We have focused on helping the brothers in Afghanistan since  1985. We opened camps to train young men to fight the Soviet  invasion. We cooperated with everyone to help Muslims to defend  themselves and their religion, especially as the enemies of  Islam want Muslims to remain weak and subservient.    Our work in Afghanistan, which caused some people to insult  us, was devoted to fighting the communist invasion and raising  the banner that reads "There is no other god but God."    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: In your view, who is  responsible for that attack?    Bin-Ladin: There are external quarters at which a  finger of accusation could be pointed. They are the quarters  spitefully hostile to Islam. They do not accept the natural  right of Muslims to defend themselves.    Our position in Afghanistan caused some of Islam's enemies  to  try to obstruct our cooperation with Muslims. The world tends  to prefer to overlook the oppression and persecution in Bosnia  and occupied Palestine and then hasten to accuse Muslims of  terrorism if they defend themselves. It wants to keep Muslims  weak and incapable of defending themselves.    We also know that there are contacts among diplomats, all  designed to curb our movement and stop our contacts with our  brothers. But we say that cooperation in piety is continuing  among Muslims.    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: What is the nature of your  relationship with Saudi Arabia?    Bin-Ladin: There is a disagreement because of  their rejection of our cooperation with the Islamic awakening,  support of Muslim issues, and opposition to their restrictions  on the call [al-da'wah] and the preachers.    I am accused of supporting fundamentalism, even though  everyone knows that this stems from our eagerness to raise the  banner that reads "There is no other god but God" and support  the Afghan mojahedin camps to fight oppression and communist  aggression. I believe that all Muslims adopted this position;  or that is what we believe was the case.    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: And with Egypt?    Bin-Ladin: The Egyptian press says that Usamah  Bin-Ladin supports fundamentalism. We know that there are  domestic problems in Egypt because of the state's violence  against Islamists. Obviously there are bound to be reactions to  this government policy.    Like many other Muslim young men, some Islamists in Egypt  gained military experience in the Afghan mojahedin camps. These  conditions forced some to take such positions in their countries  to defend their religion and themselves.    The Egyptians are trying to indicate that I have something  to  do with the reactions taking place in their country. And they  accuse me of posing a threat to them.    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: And with Yemen?    Bin-Ladin: What I said about Egypt I say about  Yemen, which I believe is one of the best Arab and Muslim  countries in terms of adherence to traditions and the faith.  Nevertheless, its citizens have been subjected to murder and  religious persecution. So it is natural for reactions to take  place, even if some of Yemen's sons do train in Afghan camps.    The accusation that we support terrorism is a hostile,  imperialist method designed to suppress Muslims' determination  and paralyze their movement toward one another and toward their  religion and faith. [passage omitted]    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI: What is the nature of your  presence in Sudan?    Bin-Ladin: I visited Sudan for the first time in  1983, where I acquainted myself with its agricultural  capabilities and investment opportunities. Four years ago we  came here to cooperate and work in the areas of road  construction and agriculture. I inherited this type of work  from my father, may God have mercy on him. [passage omitted]</p>

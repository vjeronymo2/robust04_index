			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Lunch with the FT: The billionaire grocer - Michael Thompson-Noel raises the subject of money with David Sainsbury One of the richest people in Britain is sitting opposite me and has just started his main course: piccatas of veal with courgettes, tomatoes and olives. The British, he says, do not appreciate veal sufficiently. For his starter, my billionaire guest had chicken and goat's cheese mousse. And in a little while - no pudding - he will drink a single cup of filter coffee before saying goodbye and going to look for his driver. We are enjoying our chat, although I have not yet raised the subject of money. I have held myself back - anxious, I suppose, to demonstrate sensitivity for someone whose wealth is so ginormous that the noughts on the end of it swirl round and round our heads. This is David Sainsbury, 53, chairman and chief executive of J. Sainsbury, Britain's leading grocery chain. In the 1994 edition of The Sunday Times survey of Britain's richest residents, he and other family members were said to be worth a combined Pounds 2.7bn - less than Gad and Hans Rausing, the TetraPak brothers (Pounds 5.2bn), or Queen Elizabeth II (Pounds 5bn), but comfortably ahead of John and Peter Moores (Pounds 1.7bn), John Paul Getty II (Pounds 1.65bn), Garfield Weston (Pounds 1.6bn) and the Duke of Westminster (Pounds 1.5bn). I have no idea how accurate these estimates are; nor does The Sunday Times. And I am not about to ask David Sainsbury if he knows, because I am sure he doesn't. But the subject must be broached, even if obliquely, in the middle of the piccatas. 'Is it true,' I ask, 'that you personally own 18 per cent of Sainsbury's shares?' In spite of the recent stock market shake-out, Sainsbury's is still capitalised at a squeak under Pounds 7bn. 'I think,' he says quietly, 'that it's 17 per cent.' 'Are you aware of your wealth - of how much money there is behind you and around you?' He does not mind the question. I have realised, already, that David Sainsbury, for all his modesty and thoughtfulness, is a master of directness. Nothing seems to throw him. It is clear, moreover, that he has come here to talk. He speaks lucidly and treats all questions with indulgence: a five-star interviewee, though he would be surprised to be told so. He has neatly-cropped hair and lightly-framed spectacles, and has been described, quite accurately, as resembling an Israeli general in mufti. 'The enjoyable thing to do with wealth,' he says, 'is to achieve change. Awareness of wealth depends on how you are brought up. In those days' - his childhood - 'Sainsbury's wasn't a public company, so there weren't any shares. Anyway, my parents taught me that if you had money, you used it for good purposes. There was never any question about your not working. I am sure that my upbringing is the reason why I enjoy using my money in constructive ways.' He joined the family firm in 1963 and held a succession of posts, including that of finance director for 17 years to 1990. Then he became deputy chairman and took over as chairman from his cousin, Lord Sainsbury, late in 1992. When he became chairman, he told the FT: 'Food retailing is a very dynamic and a very competitive business. It is a market of changing fortunes. We are leaders now and it is absolutely my intention to have a bigger lead when I cease to be chairman. But we will only do so by changing our business. I am certain we will be a very different business in 10 years' time.' He lives modestly and is not at all interested in the trappings of wealth. In January 1993 he donated Pounds 200m worth of Sainsbury's shares to his philanthropic vehicle, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, a grant-making trust which he established and has funded since 1967. The donation was easily the biggest of its kind in living memory. The trust's activities include technical education, African development programmes, economic and business research, support for disadvantaged children, health care and plant science. We met at the Kensington Place restaurant in Notting Hill, west London. It is bright, noisy, hip and crucial - renowned for serving a mixture of modern brasserie food and more classical dishes cooked with immense flair. You can have a set three-course lunch for Pounds 13.50: probably the best-value lunch in town. The Sainsbury's chairman told me that he used to be a regular at Kensington Place a couple of years ago. 'Then I stopped, and then I started again, about a month ago, and remembered how much I enjoyed it.' If he had not been born a Sainsbury, what would he have become? 'Well,' he said, 'I studied history first, at Cambridge, and then psychology, and there was a time when I thought I'd do research in psychology: brain studies, perception, that sort of thing. Then I decided that I'd make a much better businessman. But science, especially cognitive neuro-science, has become so remarkably interesting . . .' 'You're not religious?' 'No.' 'So you're not worried about looking for the soul?' 'No. But that is not to say that human consciousness is not still totally mysterious. And there is still, for me, a distinction to be drawn between human consciousness and computer intelligence.' After a few years' work for the family firm, he studied for an MBA at Columbia University, New York, and then threw himself once more into high-powered grocery retailing. 'The great attraction of business - particularly of retailing - is that there is a very clear relationship between what you do and the end product. It's very hands-on. You get instant feed-back. With politics, in contrast, it is very unclear what actually results from what you do. 'I get real pleasure from visiting our stores. I could also get real pleasure from running a factory.' 'A factory? Really? I detest them.' 'It's the challenge of integrating people and product flows so as to achieve something worthwhile that fascinates me.' I said: 'Could I go out there this afternoon' - I pointed to the high street  -'and lay down the foundations of a retail chain that would eventually grow as large as your great-grandfather's business has become today? Could I do that?' 'Yes,' said the billionaire grocer, 'though you couldn't just launch a chain of supermarkets. People seldom realise how complicated our business has become. That is its challenge: to bring an enormous range of products from all over the world into a specific place and to sell them so as to meet predicted demand at a particular price. 'For example, we are bringing in skate from the US. Americans don't like skate. They throw it in the harbour. But we are using new-technology packs that enable us to bring this skate into Britain.' Does he like food? 'Yes. It has always been a passion for the whole family. You should only work in businesses where you have great regard for the product. Play-back is essential. I was finance director for all those years, yet you can only get so far on the figures or, indeed, on market research.' 'Do you cook?' 'Only bachelor cooking.' 'I was surprised,' I said, 'at Sainsbury's recent contretemps with Coca-Cola caused by your selling a look-alike own-label cola that Coke claimed resembled, in the appearance of its packaging, its own product far too closely. One thinks of Sainsbury's as excessively well behaved. Why did you get into such a scrape?' The billionaire did not flinch. He said: 'Fifty-five per cent of our (packaged grocery) sales are own-label. We have always been in the business of finding better-value products than the branded ones. For the first time, a cola has been found that is as good as Coca-Cola. This is a new situation for Coke. The issue of the tin is, frankly, rather irrelevant.' 'But what about your behaviour? Suppose someone came along and helped themselves to a bit of Sainsbury's glamour, or Sainsbury's expertise - something established over a great many years - and stuck it on to their product. Would you be happy?' 'They've done that,' said the chairman. 'Sainsbury's own-label wine products, for example, have been copied by other people. In the end, the consumer will decide. Instead of taking a year for everyone to try our cola, it's taken about two weeks. 'The affair was portrayed as branded product versus own-label. But if you look just at the branded sector for a moment, you will see that there are things that designers do all around the world, in terms of packaging. 'One of their design conventions is that red is the colour people associate with cola tins, so it is hardly surprising that our cola tin resembled Coke's. 'Anyway,' he said happily, draining his coffee, 'our cola is selling unbelievably well.' He smiled. And then he stood - leaving me to reflect that billionaire-style grocery must be an amusing thing to be in.</p>

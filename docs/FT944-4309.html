			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Britain's Labour party says No to 'no veto' Britain's Labour party left its calling card on the doorstep of the European summit yesterday. It was a pointed reminder that if the time should come when it is Britain's official EU representative, it will bring with it a firm resolve to maintain the right (as the former Mrs Margaret Thatcher would have it) to say 'No, no, no'. The occasion was a pre-summit sub-summit called to allow leaders of European socialist and social democrat parties to draft their would-be agenda for the future of Europe, and wave farewell to Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors. In the absence of Mr Tony Blair, Labour's deputy, Mr John Prescott was left to shepherd through a key amendment - in defence of the notorious right of veto - to the meeting's final declaration. Someone, it seemed, had sneaked in a cheeky paragraph proclaiming: 'We say 'No' to any individual state having a right to veto further development of the Union.' 'This', Labour protested, 'is a major addition to the text which has not been in any previous text or raised in previous discussions and which the Labour party is unable to accept.' The clause accordingly disappeared from the final version. France's Socialists, represented by Mr Henri Emmanueli, had less luck with their attempt to commit the movement to a policy of waiting until the end of the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the reform of EU institutions before even thinking about enlargement. Just as Mr Emmanueli echoed the official French line, so Mr Rudolf Scharping, Germany's Social Democrat leader, echoed that of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will preside over the summit today. Mr Scharping warned of 'negative consequences' should Germany's central and eastern European neighbours be told to forget about entry negotiations for two or three years. Mr Delors ducked. 'It is really a question of linguistics,' he ventured. But it was also a question of coping with enlarging EU membership from 12 to 15, 16 or even 27. What was important, he stressed, was to be clear about what sort of 'marriage contracts' were needed or practicable.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Cardin sets up shop in three cities Pierre Cardin, the French fashion designer and head of a diversified retail marketing group, yesterday launched a chain of shops in India, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. Mr Cardin is following Benetton of Italy, France's Lacoste and other fashion companies which have entered the Indian market in the past year, following the liberalisation of foreign trade and investment. The French designer will take a 26 per cent stake in a joint venture with Indian partners. The initial investment is Rs16.5m (Pounds 354,000) which will pay for a design studio, workshops and three shops in Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. If the venture goes well, the partners plan to open more stores and raise their investment to Rs250m. Mr Cardin also sees India as a potential supply source for his joint venture and franchised outlets in other countries. Speaking at a news conference, he said: 'I am sure India will be another Paris of Asia since its textiles and jewellery are so good.' Mr Cardin's executives said India would be a particularly good source for cotton and silk clothing. The first exports would go in small quantities to Russia, but retailers in all the 120 countries in which Pierre Cardin goods are marketed would also be free to come and place orders. Mr Cardin, who is 72 years old and opened his fashion house in 1950, said he had no plans to retire. After India he was intending to visit two other countries still waiting for their first Pierre Cardin investments - Vietnam and Cuba.</p>

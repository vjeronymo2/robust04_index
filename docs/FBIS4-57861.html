			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "O ESTADO Column" by Cristiana Lobo] </F>   [Text] On 24 May, Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Cesar  Flores informed President Itamar Franco of the result of an  international bid for the implementation of Sivam, the Amazon  Region Surveillance System. This has been the largest bid ever  held in Brazil, with companies from 10 countries participating.  The project costs amount to $1.1 billion and will be implemented  over eight years.    The winners of the tender are a U.S. consortium led by  Raytheon and a French consortium led by the state-owned Thomson  and Alcatel companies. A German consortium led by Dasa was  selected as "an alternate." The loser was a consortium formed  by Unisys and IBM, the two largest U.S. computer companies.</p>

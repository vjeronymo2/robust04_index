			<p>BFN     [Text] The survival of the federation of Bosnians and  Croats will directly depend on their ability to resist Serb  aggression, and in that context Croatia supports the lifting of  the arms embargo, the Croatian Embassy [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]  said in a statement. Talks aimed at reaching peace and finding  a negotiated solution to the crisis still remain the best  option, which Croatia resolutely supports. But the way in which  the Serb side is abusing the peace process shows that diplomatic  efforts must be backed in the future by a credible threat of  force. This is why Croatia supports the UN secretary general's  initiative that the response to the militant Serb policy should,  as the last resort, be NATO air strikes, the statement says.</p>

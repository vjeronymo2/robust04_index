			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Greece declares categorically that it will not  disavow its sovereign rights in the Aegean. The Greek position  was outlined by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has  returned from Istanbul. On the possibility of a  Papandreou-Ciller meeting, Athens will discuss it only if a good  climate is created in the two countries' relations. Our  correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Karzis] Greece has the right to defend  its  sovereign rights. This is Athens' reply to the interventions by  partners and allies in Greek-Turkish relations. A  Papandreou-Ciller meeting is possible only if there is enough  improvement in the bilateral climate. Mr. Papoulias was  categorical when he commented today on the statement made by  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday.    [Papoulias] I will repeat what I have told Mr. Christopher.  Of course, what Mr. Christopher said I will convey to the prime  minister. This is natural. However, regarding my response to  Mr. Christopher -- first, that it is a matter of Greek-Turkish  relations; second, if Turkish aircraft did not violate our  airspace the problem would not exist; and third, I added that it  is Greece's sovereign right to defend its national sovereign  rights.    [Karzis] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also called  for  a detente in the Greek-Turkish crisis but he avoided taking  sides. [passage omitted]    [Karzis] However, the Papoulias-Cetin meeting yesterday  seems  to be creating a prerequisite for detente.    [Papoulias] As I also said yesterday, this would be  desirable  so long as a different climate is created;, we also agreed with  Mr. Cetin that the tone of the rhetoric should be lowered, that  we must try to developed a different climate in the  Greek-Turkish relations. Of course, the culmination of this  course would be a possible Ciller-Papandreou meeting.    [Karzis] The foreign minister was also clear about Greece's  position on the Bosporus straits [Istanbul Bogazi] as Turkey is  trying to create obstacles in the free passage of ships. Mr.  Papoulias said: Greece insists on the principle of free  navigation in the straits. [end recording]    The Greek foreign minister arrived in Ioannina a short time  ago where he discussed in more detail his contacts in Istanbul.  Our correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Papoulias] Greek-Turkish relations need a  different climate that would lead us to more stable relations  with Turkey.    [Kirousis] Upon his return to Ioannina from Istanbul this  evening, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed the hope  that Greek-Turkish relations would enter a more stable climate.  The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Patriarchate's  security in Turkey.    [Papoulias] The meetings I had were a very good opportunity  to raise the Patriarchate issue. These meetings were very  important, and I asked all my interlocutors to do what is proper  for the Patriarchate's security.    [Unidentified correspondent] What about the Cyprus issue?    [Papoulias] I think that my most important statement in  Istanbul was that of the confidence-building measures having  died because of Rauf Denktas' behavior as well as because of  Ankara's tolerance.    [Kirousis] Referring to his meeting in Turkey with his  Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi, Mr. Papoulias stressed that  Albania's policy with regard to European integration is  neglecting respect for human rights and international rules of  behavior. Mr. Papoulias said: Greece wants good relations with  Albania but the neighboring country should also have the same  intentions.    [Papoulias] I repeated to Mr. Serreqi once again that our  desire is to have good relations with Albania. However, it  depends on the Albanian Government's behavior, on respect for  the rights of the Greek minority, and on the abandoning of a  fruitless and provocative policy which has been followed until  now with regard to the Greek minority in Albania.

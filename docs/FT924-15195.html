			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Suburban bell-wether rings political change: Floating voters in a pivotal blue-collar area near Detroit are abandoning George Bush this year It is a balmy afternoon in Detroit, Michigan, just a month before the US presidential election. In the parking lot of the suburban Eastgate shopping mall Mr Sante Cervini, a local resident, is pouring scorn on Republican President George Bush. 'Would you want another 12 years of disaster?' the retired auto company technician asks. 'I don't know Bill Clinton, but the young man can't do worse than this lot.' Mr Cervini is just one of 250m Americans, but he belongs to a group with great political significance - he is a floating voter in Macomb County, a swathe of suburbia to the north of Detroit which has become a political bellwether. Mr Cervini voted for the Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 elections and Mr Bush in 1988. But this time he is backing the Democrats and Mr Clinton. Opinion polls and random interviews in shopping malls indicate that many residents of Macomb are thinking like Mr Cervini. The bell-wether, in short, may be sounding Mr Bush's political demise. That said, the electorate has been volatile this year and much could change between now and November 3. The populist Mr Ross Perot is back in the race, and there are three presidential candidates' television debates to be held. Yet in Macomb, voting intentions seem to have been firming up over the past few weeks and may now be hard to shift. The county's importance is twofold. First, it usually reflects the voting patterns of Michigan - one of several mid-western industrial states which are expected to prove the most crucial battlefield of this year's campaign. It is no coincidence that Mr Bush and Mr Clinton have each visited the state eight times already. Second, Macomb is prime habitat for one of the most closely observed of American political species, the so-called 'Reagan Democrats'. The phrase describes those blue-collar and lower-middle-class white voters from traditional Democrat families who began deserting to Republican presidential candidates in the 1970s - around the time many were also moving up in the world, from homes in the inner cities to more affluent suburbs. America's white suburbs - those leafy havens of neat lawns, Neighbourhood Watch and Little League baseball - are increasingly important in presidential campaigns. Between 1968 and 1988 the percentage of the ballot cast in such areas grew from 35.6 per cent to 48.3 per cent. In the 1980s, the stream of defections from the Democratic party and its liberal candidates turned into a flood - hence the phrase 'Reagan Democrats'. Confusingly, however, the breed has generally remained loyal to the Democratic party in local, state and US congressional elections. Macomb County, which began to be seen as a bellwether in the 1980s, mirrors these trends. While the Democratic party still dominates local politics, its presidential candidate has not carried the area since Hubert Humphrey in 1968. In 1960 Macomb gave one of the strongest suburban margins in the nation to Mr John Kennedy but in 1988 it cast 65 per cent of its vote for Mr Bush. So what makes the Macomb voter tick? The county's inhabitants are overwhelmingly white (97 per cent), of modest means (average family income Dollars 40,000), of mixed European background and very conservative. Their overriding concerns have long been crime, jobs and property taxes. Two other factors have shaped the area's politics. One is its high dependence, in common with the rest of Detroit, on the Big Three automobile companies, which have their headquarters in the city. Many residents are members of the United Auto Workers union. The other factor is its proximity to the crime-ridden black ghettoes of Detroit's inner city. So concerned was the Democratic party by the erosion of its base here in the mid-1980s that it commissioned a now- celebrated study which found Macomb inhabitants were virulently anti-black, and tended to view the progressive, pro-minority policies of the Democratic party as a betrayal of its blue-collar white members. It was against this background - and economic expansion - that Mr Reagan and Mr Bush won votes in the area. Mr Reagan, in particular, was seen as a charismatic leader of modest origins who did not pander to minority groups. Law and order and 'welfare scroungers' - a code-word by suburban whites for unemployed blacks - are still emotive issues in Macomb. But this year they have been eclipsed by the poor state of the US economy. 'People get politically excited on two issues - when you mess with their kids and their pocketbooks - and this is a pocketbook election,' says Mr Leo Lalonde, chairman of the Macomb County Democratic party. Detroit has particular reason for anxiety. Recession has hurt the auto industry badly and General Motors, the biggest of the Big Three, is in the throes of a huge factory closure programme. Macomb has not been hit directly by this, but the impending demise of a plant west of Detroit has made the community edgy. These fears have been intensified by the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada which President Bush negotiated last summer. The UAW claims this will encourage an exodus of motor industry jobs south of the border. Mr Clinton has now endorsed the pact, albeit with significant qualifications, which is bound to disappoint some Macomb voters. While Mr Bush's main difficulty in Macomb is the state of the economy, he also has an image problem. At a time of hardship, his patrician background jars with many constituents, some of whom also criticise him for policy U-turns. 'Bush just doesn't seem to be focused,' says 71-year-old Mrs Babetta Becker, a lifelong Republican who will vote for Clinton. 'I don't like him,' she says of the Democrat, 'but we need a change.' Mr Clinton, then, seems to be picking up many floating voters in Macomb because he is not Mr Bush, rather than for any positive qualities of his own. It was Mr Perot who very successfully played the not-Bush role in the early summer, before he quit the presidential race. But having re-entered the contest last week, he now seems to have lost a lot of his credibility. 'He's just a hot flash,' says Mr Cervini. The election may yet prove close, but one recent poll (taken before Mr Perot's re-entry) put Mr Clinton a solid 12 points ahead in Michigan as a whole, while a Democratic survey in Macomb put him 15 points in front there. Whatever the result, many Reagan Democrats in Macomb are preparing to vote for Mr Clinton. But this does not necessarily mean they are coming home to the party for good, or that the political pendulum has begun a once-a-generation swing back to the left. 'The floating voters will stay floating voters,' says Mr Carl Marlinga, Macomb's prosecuting attorney, an elected Democrat. 'Reagan made them independent and I don't think Clinton will bring them back - unless he has a very good four years as president.'</p>

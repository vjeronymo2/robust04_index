In  the meeting Mr. Benavides, the EU representative, was also  present.    "We welcome you in Athens with a sincere friendship,"  Papoulias, the Greek foreign minister, said at the beginning of  the meeting which lasted two hours. Mr. Papoulias briefly  mentioned the main points of the EU Presidency for the first six  months of the 1994, emphasizing the special attention paid to  the eastern and central European countries which are now in the  transition period. The EU intends to strengthen the political  and economical relations with those countries, and also the EU  especially regards as important the security in the region and  promoting a political solution of the crises in former  Yugoslavia.    Taking the floor, Mr. Benevedis said the fact that 74 per  cent of the total assistance for Albania comes from the EU and  its member countries shows the level of our relations. "We will  consider the Albania's request for improving the mechanisms and  the ways of the implementing the PHARE [Economic and  Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, Mr.  Benevedis said.    Mr. Papoulias said the EU has seen the political  developments  in Albania. "We regard as very positive the fast achievements  of the economic reform and the constitutional Law for Human  Rights. I am informed that the law on education will pass very  soon in parliament. We welcome this step. During my visit in  Albania, you (addressing to Minister Serreqi) and the President  Berisha assured me that the Greek minority in Albania will be  treated according to the international norms. I want to add  that any reference to the "minority zones" in the law will not  be in conformity with the norms.    Minister Serreqi said we regret that for the second time the  Greek parliamentary members has disinformed the European  Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of  Europe. They have prejudiced a normal penal case giving to it a  political aspect.    In regard with the economic relations with the EU, Mr.  Serreqi mentioned the main fields of cooperation. Our desire,  Mr. Serreqi said, is that the EU extend the cooperation with the  three seas, the Adriatic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Aegean Sea  which are very important for all the countries.    Speaking of the political reforms in Albania, Minister  Serreqi said the democratic forces have made important steps  toward the establishing and consolidating a pluralist democracy,  a legal state and a full respect for the human rights.    As important parts of the reforms in Albania Mr. Serreqi  mentioned the new orientation of the Albanian foreign policy  which broke the fatal isolation, the establishing and developing  the market economy, the wide privatization process, the army  restructuring and taking it under the civilian control and the  deep reform in the state administration. Regarding the law on  education, Mr. Serreqi said it will soon pass to the parliament  and the Greek minority will be treated in conformity with the  international norms.    Concerning the Yugoslav crises, the both sides repeated  their  known approaches expressed recently in the Vienna consultations.  The Greek side said that the NATO decision for air strikes will  bring about nothing positive for stopping the war and even it  will cause another conflict in Kosova or in another state.    The Albanian Foreign Minister Serreqi presented a wide  expose  of the Albanian approach toward the crises in region, stressing  the special position of Albania not only for the fact that  Albania is a bordering country with the country of the crises  but also because the Albanians in Kosova, who make up the half  of the Albanian nation, are cruelly being maltreated. Mr.  Serreqi said Albania is in favour of the NATO ultimatum which  not only would establish the authority of the international  community but also because the Yugoslav crises has created a  dangerous situation which should be avoided.    "We are suffering because of the sanctions but we insist  that  the sanctions should continue until the situation in Kosova will  be improved. Kosova should be under the international presence  to make possible the starting of the dialogue whose basis must  be the charter of the 1974 Constitution. The present tragic  situation showed that the dividing of Bosnia was not a proper  option to stopping the war. The option doesn't offer peace not  for Bosnian nor for the countries in the region. The  international community should find a proper and acceptable  solution for all the sides.    After the meeting, the Albanian and Greek foreign ministers  held a press conference.</p>

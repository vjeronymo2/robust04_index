			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wrong advice by tax office My tax office says the expiry of an unexercised traded option is not allowed to be counted as a capital loss. But LTOM's Book of Traded Options implies clearly that, for tax purposes, a capital loss arises on the date of expiry of the option. Could you clarify this? Your local tax office is talking nonsense. The rules for traded options changed more than 13 years ago, in section 84 of the Finance Act 1980. The present law, as re-enacted in section 144(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, says: 'The abandonment of . . . a traded option . . . shall constitute the disposal of an asset (namely of the option).' For the benefit of other people who may believe what taxmen tell them, you should write to the District Inspector (marking both your letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District Inspector') asking him to draw section 144(4) of the TCGA to the attention of the officer who misinformed you. On the expiry day, you had an allowable loss equal to the cost of the option indexed from the month of purchase to the expiry month. This is also true for London Stock Exchange traditional options. Because of Budget changes, there will be no indexation relief for options expiring after November 29. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

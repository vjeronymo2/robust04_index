			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trade row looms over US dolphin-friendly tuna policy THE US appears set on a collision course with Japan and the European Community over its restrictions on tuna imports. A San Francisco federal court called this week for strict enforcement of a ban on the import of tuna caught using methods that inflict heavy casualties on associated dolphin, a ruling that will highlight the controversy over whether the US has the right to interfere with trade in this way and sharpen the conflict between trade and environmental priorities. It is also bound to fuel the fierce opposition of US environmental groups to proposed reforms in world trade being negotiated in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The US Department of Commerce, which is trapped between US law that insists on the ban and a ruling by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that outlaws it, has asked for a stay of the court ruling. An initial ban in February last year included both primary exporters of tuna to the US - mainly Mexico, Venezuela and Vanuatu - and a list of 27 other countries which buy tuna and resell it to the US. Mexican tuna fishermen, unlike their US counterparts, fish in the eastern tropical Pacific, where for unknown reasons, schools of yellowfish tuna swim below dolphin herds. US tuna boats fish near New Guinea, where dolphins stay apart from the predominantly albacore and skipjack tuna. The Earth Island Institute, which has been responsible for pressing the issue into US courts, claims that the Mexican tuna boats killed about 50,000 dolphins this year. US officials say 15,000 is nearer the truth. The institute brought the latest action because enforcement of the ban on secondary countries, who are accused of 'laundering dolphin-unsafe tuna', has been lax. The San Francisco federal court has given these countries until Friday to provide certificates proving they were not re-exporting Mexican or Venezuelan tuna. Prominent among the new targets are Japan, Italy, Spain and France. The ban is anyway outlawed by a Gatt panel ruling following a complaint from Mexico to the Geneva-based international trade body. Mexico's argument that the US action was an unfair obstacle to trade was upheld by the Gatt - not out of a callous unconcern for the plight of dolphins, but because of the 'extraterritorial' nature of the action: Gatt said the US 'may not restrict imports of a product merely because it originates in a country with environmental policies different from its own'. The ruling inflamed a wide range of environmental groups in the US, who saw the action as symptomatic of an inherent conflict between the demands of free trade and a country's right to enforce strict environmental standards. Environmental lobbyists are also becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospect of hard-won protection being undermined by the decisions of what they see as anonymous trade officials in Geneva who are not answerable to any elected body. These concerns have led a coalition of 28 US environmental groups being formed to call for the rejection of the Uruguay round of proposed world trade reforms. A fiercely-contested draft agreement was released in late December after six years of tortuous negotiation. An irony as the tuna war erupts afresh is that Mexico, which launched the initial protest against US action, has dropped actions against its northern neighbour, and has acted to change its fishing methods to reduce the danger to dolphins. The Mexican government is anxious to seal a free trade agreement with the US and Canada, and was unwilling to see this row undermine the prospects of success. Gatt negotiations, Page 3</p>

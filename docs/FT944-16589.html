			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Stock market anticipates Kohl victory Growing confidence among investors that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government would be re-elected on Sunday helped the German stock market to make further gains yesterday after earlier concern that the coalition might lose the vote. The DAX index of leading stocks in Frankfurt added a further 2.3 per cent, or 46.3 points, to reach 2,071 points after a rise of 3.3 per cent (64.2 points) on Monday. Also contributing to the continued upturn was the stronger performance in the bond market. Despite the positive German stock market showing, however, some economists still feel Mr Kohl could have an uphill struggle to win this weekend's general election. 'I think his chances are slightly better than 50-50,' said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS Global Research. This morning, he added, stock market opinion was probably tilting to a 55 per cent probability of a victory for Mr Kohl, whose Christian Democratic (CDU) governs with the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Democrats (FDP); the latter have done badly in recent state elections. Now, he thought, market opinion in favour of a Kohl success had probably strengthened to 60 per cent. In its latest monthly German report, UBS said: 'The chance of a swing to the left is worrying investors and contributing to a high liquidity preference.' Recent opinion polls suggesting the governing coalition was likely to win an outright victory, with the FDP staying in parliament, have helped market sentiment. So has confidence about the economic recovery and receding inflation, despite yesterday's news that west German inflation in September had stuck at 3 per cent instead of easing to an annual 2.9 per cent as provisionally stated. Agreeing that the government was likely to be re-elected, Mr Ulrich Notges, economist at Trinkaus Capital management, wrote in a pre-election report that markets had been too blase about the outcome and then swung to over-pessimism. 'Only since the start of September do opinion polls show that the coalition has a proper chance of being re-elected.' A novel opinion survey set up with the help of the Nobel economic prize winner, Professor Reinhard Selten, says Mr Kohl will win, Wirtschaftswoche magazine reported, Reuter reports from Bonn. The economic weekly said its Election Bourse survey, which has 500 real traders dealing in fictitious stocks linked to the political parties, said Mr Kohl's coalition would win a tiny majority of seats with 48.6 per cent of the vote. The survey, for which Prof Selten of Bonn University was an adviser, had traders buying and selling each party's stocks according to what they expect the final result to be. Their figures show the combined opposition getting 47.5 per cent and thus failing to reach an anti-Kohl majority. The Social Democrats would get 35 per cent, the Greens 8.2 per cent and the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism 4.3 per cent. 'An election market follows quite different principles from normal opinion polling,' Wirtschaftswoche quoted Prof Selten as saying. 'How the participants will vote is not decisive, but rather which result they expect.'</p>

The newspaper "AL-BA'ATH," mouthpiece of the ruling party,  called today on the U.S., a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace  process, to play its supposed role for achieving the objectives  of this process.    The paper argued that the U.S. is capable of putting  pressure  on Israel to commit itself to adhering to the peace process in  both words and deeds.    The Arab parties involved in the peace talks include Syria,  Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians.    According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital,  Christopher's coming tour of the region is intended to hold  preliminary talks with the parties involved in the Middle East  peace process to remove the obstacles to the resumption of the  peace negotiations and set a date for such resumption.    Arab political sources in Damascus maintain that Christopher  is likely to make some progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track  of the peace negotiations, which will enable him to focus on  pushing the peace process forward.    Yet the sources hold that Christopher's task of persuading  the Arab parties, particularly Syria, to resume the Washington  talks would not be an easy job because Syria adheres to its  consistent stand. Syria insists that peace can be achieved only  on the basis of a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories and the full restoration of the Palestinian  people's rights, especially their rights to repatriation,  self-determination and the establishment of an independent state.    The sources add that Syria adheres to the peace-for-land  principle and condemns Israel's intransigent stand which  consists in its insistence on considering the security  arrangements to be made in the Golan Heights without showing  willingness to withdraw completely from there.</p>

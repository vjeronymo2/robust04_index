			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Julius Caesar' to make Handel weep On the Chestertonian grounds that a thing worth doing is worth doing badly, the first-ever Scottish Opera production of Giulio Cesare in Egitto can be welcomed. There are no other grounds for doing so. Handel, a theatre composer of supreme genius whose greatest works now enrich the basic repertory of all serious opera houses, is here taken back to the caveman age of the 20th-century Handel revival - the age when those operas were deemed to need 'help' of some form or other. In this Julius Caesar the score is cut (bad enough) and its three-act structure broken into two long, misshapen acts (worse), in patches re-scored and re-ordered (worse still), and (worst of all) conducted with an ignorance of the basic niceties of 18th-century style that must make even the most tolerant Handelian weep with rage and despair. The staging is mounted in comic-strip style, with an utter lack of wit in the early scenes and lack of emotional depth in the later, but absolutely no lack of late-20th-century opera-production cliches (stepped stage, poster-bright costume colours, evening dress, bra and petticoat, shoe and glove fetishism, cartoon front-cloths, and so on). I cannot actually prove that it all adds up to the single worst Handel opera production ever given by a leading British company, but after sitting through Wednesday's opening night at the Glasgow Theatre Royal I am strongly moved to insist that it must be. It is the dead mass of boredom to which the opera is unvaryingly reduced - all three hours and 20 minutes of it (much of it taken up with silent pauses for face-pulling or prancing about) - that one minds so furiously. When silliness of staging (hopelessly old-fashioned for all its modish gestures) meets invertebracy in the musical direction, a lethal operatic brew is cooked up. Julius Caesar characters delivered in the language of Viz or John Glashan cartoons are bad enough; Julius Caesar arias rendered lifeless by a conductor's rhythmic drag and plod, with occasional further slowings-down in mid-course, provide the coup de grace. This horror is the work of the German producer Willy Decker (from Cologne), the Glasgow designer John Macfarlane, and the Swiss conductor Samuel Bachli, and is a co-production with the theatres of Ludwigshafen and Montpellier. For its taste-level, approach to the late-20th-century re-imagining of Handelian opera seria dramaturgy, and above all level of musical command, the adjective provincial might have been coined. No good points? Well, the voice parts are all given at correct pitch (countertenors sing Caesar, Ptolemy and Nirenus, and a female mezzo Sextus). The cast is potentially a fine one, which makes the musical and dramatic waste of it that much harder to bear: Michael Chance in the title role (lacking the big virtuoso guns for the florid music but innately musical, eloquent and supple in phrasing), Joan Rodgers as Cleopatra (her exquisite timbre clouded by production idiocies and tempo misjudgments), Anne Mason (Cornelia), Eirian James (firm-toned as Sextus), Christopher Robson (prone to self-caricature as Ptolemy), Gidon Saks (Achillas) and Timothy Wilson (Nirenus). Brian Trowell's graceful English translation is welcome. In sum, however, this is an achievement to place beside Covent Garden's recent Huguenots and Scottish Opera's own 1985 Weber Oberon: all three instances of works requiring some form of 'period' sympathy in the mounting, and productions of the most shamingly unsympathetic and inartistic kind. In repertory at Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until October 29, then on tour in Aberdeen, Newcastle and Edinburgh</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The enlarged standing committee meeting of the  Liaoning Provincial Party Committee was held in Shenyang on 7  May. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  first reported on the changes of principal leaders of the  provincial government. Yue Qifeng, former deputy secretary of  the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and vice governor of  Liaoning Province and currently secretary of the Heilongjiang  Provincial Party Committee, made an impromptu speech.    At the meeting, Wen Shizhen, deputy secretary of the  Liaoning  Provincial Party Committee and vice governor of the province,  made an overall arrangement for the current economic work. He  said: At the moment, we should pay attention to the following  tasks: First, the entire society should show concern and all  the people in the province should participate in the endeavor of  invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.  The present situation in the province's large and medium-sized  enterprises is grim. The task in the second quarter is to  reverse the situation of suffering losses. The range of  deficits in the second quarter should be reduced to 14 percent.  The provincial government will adopt measures to help  enterprises reverse their deficits and resolve major problems  that hamper industrial production. [passage indistinct]  Second, we should pay attention to agriculture in an effort to  promote the all-around development of the rural economy. At  present, we should ensure the fulfillment of two objectives: to  keep grain output at (?15 million) tonnes or more and to keep  the per capita income at about 1,300 yuan. [passage omitted]    Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  stressed three tasks at the meeting. He said: First, we should  change ideas and deepen reform. Specifically speaking, we  should appropriately handle the relations in five aspects,  namely, the relations between cities and the countryside, the  relations between industry and agriculture, the relations  between large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and  township and town enterprises, the relations between the  state-owned economy and the non-state-owned economy, and the  relations between high and new technology and traditional  industries. Second, we should seek unity of understanding,  strengthen leadership, and make concerted efforts to safeguard  social order. Third, we should pay attention to party building,  oppose corruption and encourage integrity and honesty, and  change the style of work.</p>

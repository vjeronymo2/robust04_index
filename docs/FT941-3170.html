			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: UK employment and recovery One aspect of the much-discussed new flexibility of the UK labour market is that the jobs figures have become a more useful indicator of general economic trends than they used to be  - but still not on the basis of a single month's figures. Merchants of short-term tidings have made much of the 'bad news' of a rise in unemployment in January and now of the 'good news' of a fall in February. But those who have the patience to take a slightly longer view will see that unemployment has been on a falling trend for a full year and has recently been declining by an average of 24,000 a month. The vacancy figures provide some independent corroboration of a tightening in the labour market, having risen from 120,000 vacancies in February 1993 to 141,000 last month. Surprise was expressed last year at the fall in unemployment so early in the recovery because in the past it has lagged well behind the general economy. In the previous upswing of the early 1980s the unemployment trend did not turn until nearly four years into the recovery phase. This time unemployment has shown a decisive and unexpected early improvement and has done so against the trend in other European countries, where it has relentlessly deteriorated against a background of international concern reflected in the Detroit ministerial meeting. Moreover, the present recovery, at least on the published figures, has been only moderate. The most frequently cited headline figures, based on overall gross domestic product, flatter what has occurred. Real UK GDP, excluding the highly volatile North Sea sector, is estimated to have risen by only 2.2 per cent in the year to the final quarter of 1993. This is no more than the estimated trend rise in output. The independent Employment Policy Institute has suggested two special factors behind the unemployment drop. One is that far fewer young people are coming on to the labour market, partly for demographic reasons and partly because more young people are staying on in education. The other is that employers may have over-reacted to the trauma of Black Wednesday 1992, when the UK left the exchange rate mechanism, and proceeded to sack workers whom they afterwards needed. A recall of workers sacked in a panic is once-for-all and cannot provide the basis of a sustained decline in unemployment. But, as unemployment continues to fall, other possibilities need to be investigated. The most optimistic is that output has been rising faster than estimated. The most pessismistic is that the growth of output per head has now slowed greatly. Productivity estimates for the whole economy for the last quarter of 1993 will not be available until today week. But the latest batch of Department of Employment (DE) statistics did contain up-to-date estimates of manufacturing productivity increases, which suggest that they had fallen back from the very high rate of well over 5 per cent early in the recovery to 2.9 per cent, which is not quite adequate to meet international competitors. The return to slightly rising unit costs in manufacturing is due more to the productivity deceleration than to the very small bounce back in earnings from autumn lows, attributed by the DE to bonuses and overtime. As the productivity deceleration mainly affects the estimates from October last year, it may still be an aberration. Can the the British unemployment figures be used to suggest that in the UK at least output is growing above trend and faster than the GDP estimates suggest? Interpretation is tricky. If the unemployment fall is due mainly to fewer people registering for benefit, and effectively leaving the labour force, it is not a sign of recovery. We have, therefore, to look at estimates for employment; and these come with a lag and at three-monthly intervals. The DE regular series shows total employment rising by nearly 0.3 per cent in 1993, mainly as a result of the growth in self-employment. The Labour Force Survey (LFS)  - which is preferred by critical commentators  - shows a similar trend in the year to last autumn. But before concluding that slack is being taken up, we must reckon with another much-discusssed complication, the rise of part-time employment, defined as work for 30 hours or less a week. The trend to part-time working is long-standing; and it is, of course, absurd to exclude part-timers from the computation. The question is whether the rise in the number of part-timers has more or less than offset the fall in the number of full-timers. In other words, has the total number of hours worked in the British economy increased or shrunk? The LFS estimates that, in the year to last autumn, the number of full-time workers fell by 177,000 and part-time workers rose by 223,000, including the self-employed. This suggests that the total number of working hours continues to decline very slightly. But in the last three months of the period the fall in full-time employment slowed, and the increase in part-timers accelerated. Confusingly, however, the DE series cast doubt on whether the improvement was sustained in the final months of the year. As the decline in average hours worked per employee has levelled off, the safest conclusion is the total number of hours worked in the economy has been more or less stable in recent months. Thus if we are looking at the trend of output in relation to capacity, the labour market estimates give a neutral impression, and surveys of manufacturing capacity suggest that the capacity gap has been narrowing sharply. Averaging the two, we get the impression that output is rising at a good bit above the sustainable rate. This is exactly what ought to happen at the present stage of the business cycle, although the government has got there at least as much by luck as by judgment. The only argument for a stimulus is that the economy might slow down as tax rises take effect. The size of these rises has been hyped up in the City  - which is always sensitive to a lead from the Labour party. A straw poll in the Goldman Sachs research department showed a belief that household taxes would rise by Pounds 10-Pounds 12 per week from April, against an estimate of a good deal less than Pounds 5 by in-house economists. The only flicker in the recovery so far is that retail sales volume has increased by 'only' 2.7 per cent in the year up to the last three months, against 3.3 per cent in the three months to January. Also, consumer confidence surveys have shifted downwards, but only to where they were in autumn. Otherwise, car sales, house prices and construction orders are moving firmly upwards; and the 1993-94 Budget deficit is likely to be below expectations thanks to a more buoyant recovery. It would be unfair to see signs of increasing inflation yet. Producer price rises have been less than expected. But it is probably true that, in the language of City analysts, 'the best inflation news is already behind us'. The fall in wage settlements has grounded, if no worse; and commodity prices, whether measured in sterling or a currency basket, have started to rise. In addition, room should surely be left for some rise in exports when the European economy recovers. Although many economists are still covering themselves by saying that the risks to their forecasts are on the downward side, I would now say they are at least symmetrical. And on interest rates, they are on the upside. Whether or not the chancellor finds the chance to lop off a 1/4 percentage point in the present 5 1/4 per cent base rate, by the second half of the year the trend must surely be upwards; the question can only be by how much and when.</p>

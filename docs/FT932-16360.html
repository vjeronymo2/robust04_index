			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: L and M rises 10% to Pounds 23m LONDON and Manchester, the life assurance group, yesterday announced a 10 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.4m, slightly ahead of analysts' predictions. Net insurance earnings were up 22 per cent at Pounds 19.3m, but the weak state of the residential property market inflicted losses on the group's mortgage and residential estate agency subsidiaries. A recommended final dividend of 9.6p makes a 14.25p (13.572p) total. Earnings per share emerged at 14.3p (12.87p). After tax of Pounds 6.29m (Pounds 5.75m) and minorities net profits emerged at Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 15.4m before extraordinary items). Profits of the life business included a proportion of the transfer made last year of the assumed long term rate of return on the shareholders' share of the life fund assets. L and M took the opportunity that this transfer presented to make heavy cuts in the annual or reversionary bonuses it guarantees to policyholders. This increases the company's strength, and allows greater investment flexibility, but reduces guaranteed returns for policyholders. The group's estate agency incurred a net loss of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.8m), and the number of houses sold fell from 5,900 to 5,200. Its mortgage business, hit by the same problems, made a trading loss of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 266,000 profit), having incurred bad debt provisions of Pounds 9.4m. Mr John Thomson, chairman, said the economic climate had badly affected these non-insurance businesses, but added: 'There is now clear evidence that these businesses are moving out of recession and the prospects for 1993 look promising.'</p>

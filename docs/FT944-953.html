			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Talk of imminent market raid boosts equities - Market Report There were strong rumours circulating late yesterday that Trafalgar House was about to launch a market raid to buy up to 10 per cent of Northern Electric stock. Trafalgar announced a Pounds 1.2bn bid for Northern last week. The Trafalgar rumour was only one factor boosting the UK market. Stock market analysts refused to rule out a FT-SE 100 level of 3,100 before the end of the year as Wall Street's bullish response to news from the US that the Federal Reserve is leaving short-term interest rates unchanged for the near future helped drive UK equities into a better position yesterday. At the close of a surprisingly busy trading session the FT-SE 100 Index was 12.3 higher at 3,070.4. The market's second liners, however, were much more subdued, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index only 2.9 firmer at 3,466.6. The upsurge on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average was up over 40 points some two hours after London closed, took traders in the UK by surprise. 'It was always felt in London that the Federal Reserve would not move on rates until it had examined very closely all the economic details from the fourth quarter,' said an economist at one of the leading UK banks. He said a minor reaction on Wall Street had been expected after the Fed news emerged. The Dow Jones closed the previous night down over 21 points although selling pressure was said to have been light. One reason put forward by dealers to explain the strong performance by London share prices, apart from Wall Street's influence, was the unusually heavy level of customer business for a trading session so close to Christmas. Dealers pointed out that the business driving the market forward was entirely in the cash market: 'Turnover in the future was the quietest for many months,' said one derivatives specialist. 'There is still some very big business going on in the market and it is not just programme trading, it's genuine investment activity and it's very encouraging,' said a senior marketmaker. London has been driven ahead strongly in recent sessions by takeover activity, notably Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric and the agreed bid for Portals by De La Rue. Talk in the market over the past couple of weeks has centred on the potential for an upsurge of takeover activity in the first quarter of the New Year. Turnover yesterday reached 584.9m by 5pm, with non-FT-SE stocks accounting for 65 per cent of the total. Customer business on Tuesday was an encouraging Pounds 1.3bn. The eventual outcome of the day was a sharp reversal of early trends in the market. The FT-SE 100 had opened lower, down over eight points, unsettled by news of a price war in UK buildings insurance. Little selling pressure developed across the wider market, however, and a better tone quickly became evident, especially in the property sector. Sentiment was also given a big fillip by another sharp rise in Glaxo shares as the market continued to react to news that the US authorities had extended the US patent on the UK drug company's anti-ulcer drug Zantac for a further two years. The 100 index moved into plus territory within an hour of the opening and thereafter improved to post a 10-point rise in mid-morning before turning off again during the early afternoon. With Wall Street embarking on its strong rise in the late afternoon, the FT-SE 100 eventually closed at the day's best. The Halifax Building Society's move to cut building insurance premiums by 20 per cent was seen as the first attempt by the building societies to head off a move into buildings insurance by Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Brooke's Opera 'A VISIT backstage in the Royal Opera House is like stepping back into the 19th century. The glamour of the Victorian style enjoyed by the audiences is transformed into congestion, dust and overloaded facilities behind the scenes.' So wrote the Priestley report in its financial scrutiny of the ROH, published in 1984. Priestley recommended better financial management, better planning and the furtherance of a long-term development plan. Almost a decade later, not much has changed. The Opera House is still in deficit - to the tune of about Pounds 3m: the redevelopment plan remains a will-o'-the-wisp; and it is unclear to anyone what will happen next, not least whether the government will come to the rescue. Last week the ROH released summaries of two reports on its future. One was by the accountants Price Waterhouse and recommended - yet again - better management. The other was commissioned by the Arts Council and undertaken by Baroness Warnock. The most striking fact in what is known of her report is that she recommended that the development plan in its most ambitious form should be abandoned. The Opera House has reacted in characteristic fashion by accepting the need for greater efficiency, yet sticking to the development plan which, it hopes, will be met by a mixture of private and public money. The sum mentioned is sometimes as high as Pounds 250m. This is a profoundly unsatisfactory situation, likely to lead to nothing but the prolongation of uncertainty. The time has come, therefore, for someone to take the lead at the highest level. That can only mean the central government. There is now a new national heritage secretary in Mr Peter Brooke. He has the opportunity to devote his first few weeks in office to sorting out the mess. Mr Brooke should say that the government will repair the deficit, but that the grandiose development plan should be ditched. He should insist that good intentions about better management and budgeting are put into practice, offer to put up some of the money - perhaps Pounds 15m - for the internal modernisation of the house as recommended by Lady Warnock and tell the ROH to go ahead as soon as practicable. It is sometimes said that even internal redevelopment will take more than a year. Sceptics should remember one of the lessons of the Falklands war. In emergency, it turned out to take about a tenth of the time to refurbish a ship that it did in normal circumstances. That is the sort of approach required for the crisis at Covent Garden.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: Weakness on the R&amp;D front - Economics Notebook We live in an age of breathtaking technological change. Yet recent statistics point to a surprising weakness in research and development by businesses in the industrialised world. The newly-published annual review* of industrial policy in the 25 developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports a 'remarkable decline' in industrial R&amp;D growth rates in recent years. In 1992, the latest year for up-to-date statistics in most countries, business sector R&amp;D actually fell in real terms in Japan, France, Germany, Spain and Britain. In the US, spending rose by 2.5 per cent in 1992 and continued to grow at a modest 1.5 per cent in 1993. But these increases followed a drop of nearly 6 per cent in US business sector R&amp;D in 1991 and smaller falls in the two preceding years. Admittedly, the early 1990s saw recession or severe economic slowdown in the OECD countries. But, according to the Paris-based organisation, the recent real decline of business sector R&amp;D was unprecedented in the last 20 years. In the mid-1970s, R&amp;D continued to grow, although slowly, at a time of recession and falling investment. In the early to mid-1980s, business sector R&amp;D was effectively decoupled from output and physical investment in most leading economies and grew more strongly than production. The reason for this, according to the OECD, was 'the shift to more knowledge intensive production'. The good news now is that R&amp;D spending is increasing in the OECD countries that emerged first from recession. The organisation believes R&amp;D, having reached higher levels in the late 1980s, will in future track the business cycle more closely and that the recent real declines will prove to be temporary. But having made these points, the OECD does not delve deeper into the apparent increased cyclicality of R&amp;D. This is a pity because the OECD's 1993 annual review of industrial policy observed that 'expenditure on physical investment and on research and development in the business enterprise sector plays a crucial role in determining the relative competitiveness of countries in the medium and the long term.' Of course, R&amp;D is not the be-all and end-all of economic progress. Dubious past UK achievements such as the Concorde supersonic airliner and the advanced gas cooled reactor are reminders that R&amp;D has to be geared to the demands of the market. Production is also important: the most successful research business will run into trouble if it fails to turn its inventions quickly into marketable products. Structural changes, such as the decline of defence spending in the US, UK and other leading arms producers, are doubtless depressing figures of business sector R&amp;D. But the apparent tendency of R&amp;D spending to match rather than buck the business cycle may be telling us something about the changing nature of capitalism in the industrialised countries. This in turn raises questions about how best these countries can maintain competitiveness in the face of competition from more dynamic industrialising nations in Asia and elsewhere. As another OECD study**** makes clear, R&amp;D differs from most other investment activities in that the investor often enjoys only limited direct benefit from the investment even where patent protection is available. 'Spillovers are high and social returns often greatly exceed private returns, probably by as much as 30 to 50 per cent', it says. Put another way, R&amp;D may not produce the sure returns that modern hard-nosed businesses require. The recent downturn in business R&amp;D in countries such as the US and UK coincided not only with recession but also with increased pressure to boost rates of return and shareholder value in companies. The accompanying chart shows how business enterprise R&amp;D has declined as a percentage of gross domestic product in five of the biggest industrialised countries. Perhaps significantly, the decline set in first in the US and UK, the two countries where individualism and capitalism enjoyed their strongest revival in the 1980s. Only Japan, Sweden and Switzerland among OECD members have R&amp;D to GDP ratios above 2 per cent. The US and UK have also been in the lead in reducing numbers of R&amp;D researchers, scientists and engineers in the business enterprise sector. 'The decline is particularly pronounced in the UK where the number of researchers, scientists and engineers in the business sector declined considerably for four years in a row', the OECD writes. Could it be that the forces which have given us heavy lay-offs for many, and telephone-figure salaries for a few, may also be limiting business R&amp;D in some of the leading OECD countries? Meanwhile, countries outside the OECD are investing heavily in R&amp;D. South Korea's economic plan provides for an increase in R&amp;D expenditure to between 3 and 4 per cent of gross national product by 1998 against 2 per cent in 1991. Singapore's national technological plan aims to bring R&amp;D up to 2 per cent of GDP next year. The coming years will show which course bring greater overall prosperity. But there must be some risk that a reluctance to invest in R&amp;D will accelerate the relative decline of the OECD's industrialised nations. *Industrial Policy in OECD Countries, Annual Review 1994 ****See 'Medium-term determinants of OECD productivity', by A Steven Englander and Andrew Gurney, in OECD Economic Studies No 22, Spring 1994.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reports its first-quarter results on Thursday in the crucial run-up to the flotation of Zeneca, its bioscience subsidiary. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 180m compared with about Pounds 211m for the same period last year. They will be looking at the extent of the impact of the slowdown in continental Europe, particularly in fibres, as well as the upturn in films polyurethanes and acrylics in the US. As for Zeneca, the rate of decline in US sales of Tenormin following the expiry of its patents will also studied. So, too, will the impact of the reform of the EC's common agricultural policy on European agrochemicals. Sears, the UK retail group that includes the Selfridges department store and a large slice of the UK's shoe shops, is generally forecast to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 97m to Pounds 100m tomorrow before exceptional items of about Pounds 73m. That would represent an improvement on last year's pre-exceptional Pounds 96.3m, although some forecasts are as low as Pounds 90m. The exceptional costs this year include about Pounds 32m for rationalising the footwear operations of British Shoe Corporation, other restructuring and redundancy costs, and a write-off for the sale of the Galliford housebuilding division. Tarmac is expected to announce pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 355m when it announces its 1992 results tomorrow. The company is widely expected to adopt the FRS 3 accounting standard which means that provisions of more than Pounds 300m will be taken above the line. The final dividend of 5.5p is expected to be maintained. The market will want to know what progress the company's disposal programme is making, particularly the planned sale of its waste disposal business. Analysts will also want to hear from Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, about progress the group is making in the recently renascent UK housing market.

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Colombian emergency over electricity crisis THE Colombian government yesterday declared a state of economic and social emergency to allow it to take urgent measures to counter an electricity crisis, agencies report from Bogota. The decree, signed by President Cesar Gaviria and his cabinet, said the emergency would take effect immediately and last until midnight on Monday. It lets the government issue decrees to counter an energy crisis without seeking Congressional approval. This is Colombia's first economic emergency, provided for under a new constitution enacted last year. The government has been imposing power cuts of up to nine hours a day in Colombian homes because a severe drought has sharply reduced the generating capacity of hydroelectric plants, which provide most of the country's electricity. Media estimates have power rationing costing the Colombian economy about Dollars 33m (Pounds 18.7m) a week. Local news reports say the government will use the emergency to issue bonds worth up to Dollars 250m, to be used to restructure the electricity sector and install new generating capacity. The official aim is to install 400,000 kw of new capacity by the end of the year.</p>

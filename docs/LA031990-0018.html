			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHIRER'S BOOK  </P> <P> In The Times' review of William L. Shirer's volume of memoirs (View, Jan. 17)  and in a subsequent feature interview (Feb. 4), the author is guilty of  rewriting the history of his departure from CBS News while maligning his  friend, Edward R. Murrow.  </P> <P> Shirer says he was relieved of his program of news analysis because views he  voiced were thought to be too liberal and displeasing to his sponsor and that  Murrow, then vice president of news and public affairs for the network, refused  to defend him to CBS management. Shirer told his interviewer that he was unable  to obtain work elsewhere in broadcasting because of a reputation as a leftist  and was thus an early victim of McCarthyism.  </P> <P> The fact that his departure from CBS predated the rise to power of the  red-hunting senator from Wisconsin disposes of Shirer's claim to martyrdom  quite aside from his innocence of being tainted by red-oriented commentary.  It's largely forgotten now but in those days CBS News did not include  commentary in its policy requirements. News analysis, as it was called, forbade  the expression of opinion by its news broadcasters.  </P> <P> Shirer's version of his break with the company portrays Murrow as a sellout  heavy who did the corporation's dirty work in ridding it of an alleged  fellow-traveler. The truth is something else.  </P> <P> Like many of those reporters who were launched on broadcasting careers by the  outbreak of World War II, Shirer was a print journalist who had to accommodate  to the requirements of telling his story to a microphone. His broadcasting  skills, voice quality and delivery, which always were marginal, had made him  dull beyond survival once the high drama of what he was reporting or analyzing  was scaled down by peace-time subject matter.  </P> <P> In my own role at CBS in those years I had to listen to an unending stream of  complaints from the sales department about the declining quality of the ratings  in Shirer's time period.  </P> <P> So it is sad beyond expression that he's never been able to believe that he  found no takers after CBS -- not because of his views, but because he could no  longer command a broadcast audience large enough for the requirements of  broadcast commerce. That's bitter medicine for anyone -- and Shirer was not the  first nor the last to swallow it. But to build an ego-sustaining version of  what happened at the expense of seeking to throw discredit on the reputation of  as old and close a friend as Murrow was to Shirer is sadder still.  </P> <P> Your book reviewer appeared to think that Shirer had disclosed the feet of clay  which underpinned Murrow's reputation, which he described as "mythic" among  broadcast news people. Murrow's reputation needs no burnishing; it was and  remains well-founded in his integrity and loyalty to those who worked for and  with him.  </P> <P> Shirer's misfortune was far more serious in our commercial society than being  thought a "lefty." He had become unmarketable. A number of others in his craft  subsequently discovered to be politically tainted were saved or rehabilitated.  Those whose commercial value was ended were not.  </P> <P> J.F. BECK  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Interior Minister General Andre Pitra Petroff,  general commander of the Angolan Police, reaffirmed at a news  conference yesterday that the results of all inquiries ordered  by the Angolan Police General Command will be made public once  investigations into the various police departments are over.  During the course of the news conference, Interior Minister  Petroff admitted the possibility of irregularities in certain  departments, notably the Traffic Department, where there are  indications that briberies may have been accepted.    The Angolan Police general commander also made it clear on  that occasion that there is no inquiry under way concerning the  activities of Police Commissar Gaspar da Silva, until recently  Angolan Police commander for Luanda Province, but, rather,  against the police command in that province. Interior Minister  Petroff gave the reasons:    [Begin Petroff recording] Reports we have been getting since  the first stage of [words indistinct] searches we carried out in  the homes of some [word indistinct] we found weapons of war such  as Makarov and other pistols, as well as submachine guns. Now,  everyone knew that Ango-Segu [privately owned security company]  had a mini-army, but we also found some weapons in the [words  indistinct] so we ordered an inquiry to establish how those  weapons had come into the possession of those [word indistinct]  that is the principal reason why we ordered an inquiry against  the Luanda Province Police Command.

In truth, however, I must  say that Ango-Segu was helped by the Angolan Police General  Command [words indistinct] Ango-Segu was an enterprise whose  initial aims were to [words indistinct] assure safety for  certain enterprises dealing in the buying and selling of  diamonds [words indistinct] with knowledge of the law on  liberalization of diamond buying and selling. Ango-Segu Company  was created to protect those (?interests). [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

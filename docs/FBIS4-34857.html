			<p>BFN     [Text] Several Western Army units are conducting the second  exercise of the first half of 1994. The exercise is called:  Moncada II 94-1.    Division General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, chief of the  Western  Army, and other high-level officials, witnessed aspects of the  cooperation among units. The main briefing was given by  Brigadier Gen. Manuel Lastres, with the participation of several  members of the General Staff and commanding officers. The  exercise also includes the participation of a command and  control post of the provincial unified antiair system. This  exercise includes tactical firing exercises by tank units in  which artillery units, as well as small infantry units, will  participate.    The tactical scenario is this: A unit located in a combat  training range is put on air alert status following an enemy  landing on the southern coast and is ordered to send two tank  platoons forward to ward off the attack.    Moments before the beginning of the exercise, Colonel Nelson  [not further identified] presented the distinguished service  medal to First Lieutenant Luis Enrique Aguirre, an artillery  unit commander, for successfully completing diverse missions.    These training exercises continue to be carried out with  quality and a minimum of resources thanks to the implementation  of diverse initiatives. On 24 June, the Western Army will  conduct naval and air maneuvers.</p>

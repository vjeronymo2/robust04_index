			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "Croatia Is Carrying Out Large-Scale Reforms"] </F>   [Text] Crans Montana -- Croatia presented itself in the  plenary session of the economic meeting "Forum Universale" on  Saturday [18 June]. Nikica Valentic, the prime minister, and  Mate Granic and Borislav Skegro, the deputy prime ministers,  addressed the issue of Croatia's economic development, its  economic stabilization program, and the political situation in  the country, especially the reintegration of occupied  territories into Croatia.    At the beginning of his contribution Valentic pointed out  that the reintegration of occupied territories into the Croatian  legal system was a condition for the achievement of peace in  both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and throughout the region.  He added that the Croatian Government had started working on an  ambitious program of economic reforms although 25 percent of its  territory was occupied.    Valentic mentioned that the GNP in Croatia was 25 billion  German marks [DM] -- DM5,000 per capita, which meant that  Croatia was a medium-industrialized country.    Valentic said the average income in Croatia amounted to  DM450  and that it should reach DM500 by the end of 1994. He said that  this meant that Croatia was one of the leading countries among  those that have left behind real socialism. He claimed that  these were the elements for a "standby" arrangement with the  International Monetary Fund that would be signed in September  1994.    He claimed that two-thirds of GNP was being exported and  that  Croatia would have a DM2 billion surplus in the balance of  payments this year.    He said that exports would rise 17 percent and that hard  currency reserves already amounted to $1.6 billion with the  likelihood of reaching $2.3 billion by the end of the year since  it was expected that the tourist season would be good.    Valentic further discussed the second stage in the  implementation of the stabilization program and especially  referred to the revitalization of the shipbuilding industry and  reorganization of banks. He mentioned that foreigners had been  increasingly investing in Croatia adding that an agreement on a  $128 million loan would be signed with the World Bank in  Washington on 23 June.    Mr. Mate Granic addressed the problem of UN Protection Zones  and pointed out that the Croatian Government supported a  peaceful integration of occupied territories into its legal  system. He mentioned the implementation of Washington  agreements, the federation of Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the confederation between Croatia and the  Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina. He expressed the hope that  Croatia would become a member of the European Council by the end  of the year.    Borislav Skegro referred to the implementation of the  stabilization program, pointing out that the inflation rate  dropped to 4 percent per year. He said that the production had  not been reduced and supported an intense liberalization of the  market and quick privatization.    After their presentations Valentic, Granic and Skegro  answered questions asked by participants.    The Croatian prime minister prepared a dinner for the  participants on Saturday evening. The "Forum Universale"  meeting will end on Sunday [19 June].</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Treuhand to offload Mibrag coal operations Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, will today sign an agreement with investors from the US and the UK to sell the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag) coal business, Reuter reports from Berlin. The agency said Mibrag would be acquired by a consortium including PowerGen, Morrison-Knudsen and NRG Energy. The consortium signed an agreement in principle in September to buy the coal company which owns one of Germany's largest brown coal mines. The Treuhand said it would announce further details about the sale today. In September, the Treuhand said the consortium would pay DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) for Mibrag. The companies had pledged to invest up to DM1.4bn in Mibrag and employ 2,000 workers. Mibrag is based in Bitterfeld. Employing 9,000 workers, it is one of the largest companies on the Treuhand books. The Treuhand had expected the deal, which has been the subject of negotiations lasting more than a year, to be completed by November. The Treuhand said it expected the mines to produce between 15m and 20m tonnes of coal a year.</p>

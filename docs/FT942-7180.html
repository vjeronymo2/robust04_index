			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kumagai Gumi hit by investment decline Kumagai Gumi, the internationally ambitious Japanese property developer and construction company, yesterday reported a 20.56 per cent decline in taxable profits and forecast worse to come. Taxable profits, which have been hit by an unprecedented long decline in capital investment by Kumagai Gumi's Japanese industrial customers, fell to Y23.56bn (Dollars 224.38m) in the year to March, from Y29.65bn in the previous year. Net profits fell even more steeply, after a higher-than-forecast Y33.56bn extraordinary loss on the cost of pulling out of poorly performing projects in Europe and Asia and the reorganisation of its south-east Asian businesses. This brought net earnings down by 88 per cent over the year to Y1.09bn, or Y1.6 per share, from Y13.29 per share in the previous year. As a result Kumagai Gumi was obliged to slash its dividend from Y9 to Y3 per share. Directors, consequently, have given up their bonuses. The result highlights the twin problem faced by several leading Japanese contractors, faced with a weak home market and losses on overseas developments undertaken during the fast growth in asset prices of the late 1980s. Kumagai Gumi's formerly dwindling stock of new orders recovered slightly over the year, by 1.7 per cent to Y865.5bn. This was entirely due to a 10 per cent rise in public sector orders, responding to the government's public spending packages. Civil engineering contracts from the private sector dipped, the group said. Sales fell by 21.9 per cent to Y842bn, due to a sharp decline in orders for office property and industry buildings and are expected to decline again this year, to Y840bn. All this indicates that pre-tax profits will fall by 36.3 per cent to Y15bn in the current year, it warned. Moreover, the group plans to sell another Y50bn of overseas holdings, reducing the total to Y440bn, on which it expects to book a Y23bn extraordinary loss. Accordingly, net earnings in the current year to next March are forecast to fall by 8 per cent to Y1bn. Of last year's Y33.56bn extraordinary loss, Y10.7bn comes from the sale of Thames Exchange in London, to Scottish Amicable, a UK insurance and investment group. Another Y6bn was due to the sale of a stake in a Frankfurt property developer.</p>

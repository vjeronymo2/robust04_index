			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Takashi Kawada] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 19 May -- Kim Tae-ho (age 35), former staff  member of a DPRK (North Korean) uranium refinery plant who  defected to the ROK on 7 May, gave an interview to YOMIURI  SHIMBUN on 19 May. In the interview, Kim testified that North  Korea's nuclear weapon development is "under way with active  financial support from the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] second  economic committee, which is under the direct control of Kim  Il-song and Kim Chong-il, and, in 1988, North Korea succeeded in  extracting 12 kg of plutonium."    Kim also disclosed that WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho (in  charge of economic affairs, concurrently member of the WPK  Politburo) is the top official in charge of the nuclear  development project. North Korea's nuclear development has been  hidden by a veil of mystery, and this is the first time that the  organizational structure of the project is revealed.    In North Korea, Kim Tae-ho used to work at the Nuclear  Energy  Ministry's Namchon Chemical Plant in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae  Province. The uranium refined at the plant is sent to a  reprocessing plant in Yongbyon, and becomes fuel for nuclear  reactors. In the plant, Kim worked as the leader of a working  group, but he is quite well informed of various stories because  he used to meet frequently with trade houses officials who  supply foreign currencies to the plant.    While North Korea's nuclear development project is believed  to be managed by the Nuclear Energy Ministry, it is actually  under direct control of the WPK second economic committee, Kim  said. The committee is reportedly serving as the supreme  supervising organization of military and nuclear industries of  the nation, and the committee's Fifth General Machinery Industry  Bureau is in charge of the nuclear development project. All  nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon are administrated by the  bureau, which is commanded by WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho under  direct instructions from Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.    When asked about achievements of the nuclear development  project, Kim Tae-ho said several of his friends working as  nuclear researchers told him that "North Korea first succeeded  in producing plutonium from spent fuel in the 5-megawatt nuclear  reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 1988." At that time, Kim  Il-song and his son were reportedly so happy that they went down  to the Yongbyon plant to give color television sets to all  researchers and engineers. Kim added: "They extracted 12 kg of  plutonium, and this amount was sufficient to produce two nuclear  bombs. Taking into account North Korea's technology level, they  may not yet have the bombs, but I believe the bombs are very  near completion."    Moreover, Kim revealed a military coup was attempted early  last year to overthrow Kim Il-song and his son. The coup  attempt was reportedly led by Vice Marshal Kim Pong-yul and  several generals who studied in the former Soviet Union. Dozens  of military officials involved were all captured after their  coup plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director  Yi Pong-won. Kim said he had heard the story from one of his  friends -- a nephew of Yi Pong-won.    Kim noted: "North Korea declared a war preparation condition  in March 1993. This was not only to cope with international  pressures on the nation's nuclear development project, but also  to respond to the shocking coup attempt."</p>

Initial information indicates that Cheik Sahnun  received a message about the dialogue between the Army and the  FIS and ways of participating in the transitional phase.    In that context, sources have told AL-HAYAH that the FIS  leaders who have not been released yet, namely Abdelkader Omar,  Noureddine Cheghara, and Abdelkader Hachani, have been moved to  the military hospital in Ain El Neja [as transliterated] "for  important medical tests before their release." They added that  the release would be completed before 'Id al-Fitr. [passage  omitted]</p>

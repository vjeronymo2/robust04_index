			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Management: You pays your money . . . - Performance-related pay has taken root in British industry over the last decade. But the programmes have critics among bosses and employees Personnel managers in the private sector love it. Their public sector colleagues are learning to live with it. Employees in both sectors are attracted to the idea, but often dislike the practice. During the last decade, individual performance-related pay has taken root in British service and manufacturing companies. The government's determination to press ahead with its Citizen's Charter, and its stress on improving public services, means such systems will be rapidly extended throughout the public sector. However public sector employers, and private sector personnel chiefs thinking about PRP schemes, will need to tread warily. Recent studies show that such schemes are sometimes clumsily introduced with harmful consequences for staff morale. Nor have supporters of performance-related pay been able to convince sceptics that it has a direct effect on efficiency or productivity. Some personnel managers who have introduced it admit privately that schemes can be expensive and they are uncertain whether they motivate people. Sir Douglas Smith, chairman of Acas, the conciliation service, has detected a cooling of private sector enthusiasm in the last year. 'Some employers are questioning whether the rush to performance pay was too fashionable. They are asking how objective you can be in setting standards in many occupations and companies. When it becomes too subjective, doubts begin to arise in people's minds.' Nonetheless, there is little evidence of schemes being withdrawn. That says a considerable amount about how robust they are, given their widespread adoption by British industry. According to a recent survey by the National Economic Development Office and the Institute of Personnel Management*, 47 per cent of private sector companies have PRP schemes for all non-manual grades and a further 21 per cent were using it for some non-manuals. PRP is not just a phenomenon of the last decade; about a third of the schemes surveyed by Nedo and the IPM were more than 10 years old. But the Thatcher years' emphasis on the individual, the work ethic and industrial efficiency saw their strongest growth. Among the attractions of PRP is that, properly administered, it can be fairer than systems which reward employees merely for long service and do not discriminate between the good and bad. Many employers also introduce PRP as one of a series of measures to change the culture in the workplace. Other changes include improved communication systems, profit sharing and company health schemes, all designed to to make individuals associate themselves more closely with their employers. Not surprisingly, trade unions remain suspicious - and sometimes with good reason - that the real motive for introducing PRP is to diminish their power. Ian Kessler and John Purcell**, working from Templeton College, Oxford, studied nine PRP schemes and found that in at least three cases, management was consciously trying to weaken union power, even though pay was not the only weapon employed. Richard Rosser, general secretary of the TSSA white collar rail union, has no doubt that British Rail aimed to weaken his organisation when it brought in performance-related pay in 1988 for employees earning between Pounds 13,000 and Pounds 30,000 and derecognised the union for pay bargaining purposes. If union leaders are almost universally disparaging about PRP, their members are often prepared to be more accommodating. A survey of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation by the London School of Economics last year found that 57 per cent agreed with the theory of PRP . The problem was the operation of the scheme, which was introduced in the late 1980s. Some 80 per cent of respondents said PRP had not improved the quality or quantity of their work. Nor had it made them work harder. One clue to their reasoning might be given in one of the responses of reporting officers, a third of whom thought favouritism was used in assessments. More than half said PRP demotivated the staff. According to Vicky Wright, of Hay Management Consultants, mismatches between theory and practice are common in the private sector if insufficient thought is given to introducing them. She cites one insurance company where 92 per cent of employees believed in the concept of PRP but 82 per cent disliked the current scheme. What steps, then, should employers take to guard against alienation and potential failure? INTEGRATION Most consultants say the best schemes are introduced in conjunction with other human resource management techniques and in the context of a performance management system. Organisations with PMS generally have a shared vision of objectives, conduct formal reviews of progress towards targets and evaluate the effectiveness of the process. That, in turn, requires commitment from top management, both to the scheme and to training for the personnel beneath them who will put any scheme into operation and attempt to ensure it is fair. MONEY Care should be taken with how money is allocated. The Treasury believes that one reason why the Inland Revenue's scheme attracted internal criticism was that payments were restricted only to the highest performers. Under the new system, currently under negotiation at the Inland Revenue, and other government departments, every civil servant is likely to have at least some of his or her pay influenced by performance. The Treasury has also abandoned a quota systems used in some of the early, more rudimentary, PRP schemes in the civil service. It believes quotas caused resentment because civil servants could achieve targets only to find they were rejected for a performance award because too many colleagues had also achieved their targets. Theoretically PRP schemes should be self-financing and most personnel managers believe they are. Nonetheless, companies should be aware that in the first year or so, they may incur extra costs in consultancy fees, training, communication and, in some cases, buying the support of employees for the scheme against union opposition. TEAM WORK Companies introducing PRP also want, as part of another fashionable trend, to encourage employees to work in teams. The two concepts sometimes clash with one another because PRP can, if employers are not careful, encourage employees to compete with one another. They need not. Grand Metropolitan, for example, encourages its business units to identify team objectives 'where appropriate' in assessing performance pay for managers. Discrimination Personal assessments inevitably raise questions about objectivity and there are particular dangers in discriminating between the sexes. The Equal Opportunities Commission says that even the most objective systems of performance pay and appraisal are likely to apply more readily to jobs performed by men than women. Organisations guilty of discrimination risk not only alienating their female workforce but also leaving themselves open to a challenge under European legislation. * Incentive Pay, M Cannell and S wood, Institute of Personnel Management and National Economic Development Office, IPM House, Camp Road, Wimbledon, London, SW19 4UX. **Performance-Related Pay, Ian Kessler and John Purcell, Volume 2, Number 3, Spring 1992, Human Resource Management Journal, Industrial Relations Services, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      TEN TIPS ON HOW TO MANAGE A PERFORMANCE RELATED PAY SCHEME  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Make sure:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  The CEO and senior management are fully committed to scheme 2  It is introduced in top down manner 3  Competitive base salary structure is maintained 4  There is a valid job evaluation system 5  It is a well designed, accurate and trusted appraisal system 6  There is a comprehensive and effective communication strategy 7  Pace of introduction is appropriate to organisational culture 8  There is systematic and regular training for managers in    performance review and feedback 9  A monitoring and evaluation process is in place 10 There is regular research on scheme effectiveness and administration  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Club Med warns profits forecast will not be met CLUB Mediterranee, the leading French holiday and leisure group, yesterday warned that it may not be able to meet its profit forecast for 1992 because of an unexpectedly steep fall in profits from its US subsidiary. Earlier this summer, Mr Gilbert Trigano, chairman of Club Med, predicted that the group would bounce back into the black with net profits of around FFr240m (Dollars 44.44m) for the year ending October, after a FFr17m loss last year. However, Club Med Inc, the US company which is 72 per cent owned by the French group, yesterday announced a 21 per cent fall in net profits from Dollars 27.8m to Dollars 21.9m on stable sales of Dollars 105m for the first nine months of 1992. The US business, which owns 25 holiday villages and a cruise ship, made a loss in the third quarter of the year. It has been hit by higher transport costs and retail price inflation, but also by the impact of the dollar's decline against the franc. Club Med said in Paris yesterday that the problems of the US company meant that it would not meet its own FFr240m profit forecast this year. However, it stressed that it would still be profitable. The group earlier this month reported a return to profits for the first half with a credit of FFr20.3m compared with a net loss of FFr87.5m a year earlier.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.A.: "Radio, TV, MTI: Special Legal Provisions"] </F>   [Text] The government has promulgated three decrees  regarding the implementation of the public employee law. As  published in MAGYAR KOZLONY, the decrees contain special  provisions to be applied at the Hungarian Radio, the Hungarian  Television, and the Hungarian Telegraphic Agency [MTI].    With respect to public employees of Hungarian Radio, the  decree states among other things that fixed-term employment  relationships established for the purpose of substitution may  exceed the five-year period. At the same time, appointments to  higher-level management positions and assignments involving  leadership positions may be made for a period up to five years.    Insofar as rules of work performance are concerned, the  decrees state that additional legal relationships for the  performance of work are inconsistent with the legal relationship  of public employees if such legal relationship violates or  threatens the objectivity and impartiality of information  broadcast by Hungarian Radio. (According to experts questioned  in this regard, this provision rules out the possibility of, for  example, an employee of the Radio acting as the spokesman for  one or another political party -- editor.) A public employee of  the radio must not establish additional legal relationships for  the performance of work with other employers except if such  relationship does not violate or endanger the appropriate  business interests of the Hungarian Radio.    The government decrees take effect on 30 March.</p>

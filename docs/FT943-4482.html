			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lehman Brothers cuts another 300 jobs Lehman Brothers, which started paring jobs even before it was spun off from American Express earlier this year, is trimming another 300 positions, a Wall Street source said, Reuter reports from New York. Analysts think it is likely the cuts at Lehman will be followed by redundancies at other large Wall Street firms if business does not pick up soon. A Lehman official said employment totalled 9,300 at the beginning of 1994, and fell to 8,950 by the end of June. It was at a peak of 9,400 in 1993. The source said the new cuts were 'across the board', affecting everyone from managing directors down, and were due to worsening conditions in the securities industry. They affect only US operations and not employment abroad, where market conditions are in 'growth stages', the source said. Mr Perrin Long, analyst at First of Michigan Corp, noted that New York Stock Exchange member firms reported losses totalling Dollars 404m after tax in the second quarter of 1994, compared with a Dollars 1.5bn profit a year ago. It was the largest quarterly deficit for the industry since a Dollars 1.7bn loss after tax in the fourth quarter of 1987.</p>

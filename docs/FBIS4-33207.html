			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jun (NA) -- "Boys, the formula  returns." With an expansive smile and this remark, which may be  an indication, President Carlos Menem on 1 June received the  photographers and cameramen that recorded the meeting he had  with Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde at  Government House.    Flanked by [Presidency] Secretary General Eduardo Bauza and  Buenos Aires Province Deputy Governor Rafael "Balito" Roma,  Menem and Duhalde waited standing up in the presidential office  for the cameras and television crews to enter.    As though he wanted to demonstrate that his spats with  Duhalde are pure fantasy, Menem was openly at ease and was even  heard to talk with the governor about Argentina's win over  Israel [in a 31 May soccer match].    With a conspirator's smile, Menem then faced photographers  and cameramen, to whom he said: "Boys, the formula once again,"  referring to the possibility of repeating the two-man [ticket]  that led the Justicialist Party to victory on 14 May 1989.    Duhalde could do no less than smile at the quip made by  Menem, who, behind the scenes, once again began to pull the  governor's leg regarding the size of his head: "He always  overshadows me."</p>

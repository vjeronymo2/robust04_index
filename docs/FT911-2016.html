			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Recovery from Queensway debacle buoys Silentnight SHARES IN Silentnight Holdings jumped by more than 20 per cent after the UK's largest manufacturer of beds surprised the market with the strength of its recovery from a disastrous distribution link with Lowndes Queensway. The group reported a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 7.39m to Pounds 11.52m, in the year to February 2. Turnover was 5 per cent down at Pounds 151.8m (Pounds 159.27m), because of the sale of the upholstery division, but sales of the ongoing business were 5 per cent higher at Pounds 133m (Pounds 127.3m). Earnings per share increased to 16.71p (10.79p). An increased final dividend of 4.75p (2.75p) gives a total for the year of 7p (5p). Silentnight lost several millions in the deal with Lowndes Queensway, the furniture and carpet retailer which collapsed last summer. However, the bed group had ceased supplying Lowndes Queensway months before and said it had incurred no bad debts as a result of the crash. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said the results 'were achieved in a year which saw many companies in our sector falter as a result of the recession in the UK economy. Indeed we believe we have increased our market share at the expense of less financially sound competitors.' Silentnight Beds did not fully recover volume lost because of severing the Lowndes Queensway connection, but profits were increased by restructuring the business and concentrating on higher margin products. The most spectacular performance came from the cabinet furniture division, which increased sales by 31 per cent to Pounds 26.42m following investment in more sophisticated plant. The increased strength of the pound also reduced the results of the group's international division, which saw sales fall 5 per cent to Pounds 20.19m. The United Arab Emirates subsidiary had a difficult year, because of the Gulf war, but remained profitable. COMMENT The 28p jump in Silentnight's shares to 153p impressed analysts, although they were also irritated that they had swallowed the new management's very downbeat line on profits prospects. These figures show Silentnight has bounced back from the Lowndes Queensway debacle and increased margins on relatively flat sales - no small achievement in the present recession. It also seems to have discovered a lucrative niche in English-style cabinets. Even though it will invest Pounds 4m in the cabinet division out of total capital expenditure of Pounds 10m in the current year, the company will still not spend all its current cash pile of Pounds 13m. Forecast earnings of at least Pounds 12.5m put it on a prospective multiple of just over 8. Having risen from 80p in January, the shares may now take a rest, but they still do not seem overvalued and look a sound long-term hold. They are are also underpinned at that level by a prospective yield of 7 per cent. Observer, Page 22</p>

Greyfriars is acquiring IAF for Pounds 21.7m, through the issue of 65.7m new shares at 33p. The company will raise a further Pounds 6m through a placement of 9.8m shares and a rights issue of 8.4m new shares at 33p. Shareholders are offered one new share for every existing share and/or warrant. English Trust, which took effective control of Greyfriars last September, will see its 31 per cent shareholding substantially diluted. It said it viewed the proposals as positive and would retain its stake. IAF was formed in 1987 as a joint venture between Tiphook, thetransportation group and Mr David Massie. Tiphook sold out in 1991. It is forecast to make static profits before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 2.5m in the year to June 1994. It had net assets of Pounds 3.9m at December 31. At the 33p placement price Greyfriars will have a capitalisation of Pounds 30m and its name will be changed to IAF Group. Mr Massie will become executive chairman.</p>

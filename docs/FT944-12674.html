			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Japan's TV ratings row worsens A row in Japan over television audience ratings is set to intensify with the launch today by Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US research group, of an automated system which measures individual viewing. Although Japan has the world's second largest television advertising market, marketing techniques used by advertising agencies and corporate advertisers are said to be unsophisticated compared to other developed markets, as television ratings have been based on viewing households rather than individuals. Nielsen's plan, announced in August, has met strong opposition from the country's large television networks and leading advertising agencies, which own shares in Video Research, a television ratings company which has held a virtual monopoly of the business. Some networks, including Nippon Television Network, are threatening to end existing contracts with Nielsen which supplement Video Research's data, unless the ratings group backs off from its plan. Advertisers and foreign advertising agencies, on the other hand, are supporting Nielsen's move. They have been frustrated by the lack of market research and feel the changes, which will give them timely data on the age and gender group of programme viewers, are long overdue. Bates Japan, part of the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising group, became the first advertising agency to subscribe to the Nielsen service being offered from today. 'We simply owe it to our clients to give them the most accurate information available about their media investment,' said Mr Kim Walker, president of Bates Japan.</p>

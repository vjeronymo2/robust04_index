			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Two letters sent by the president of the Republic to  the National Assembly yesterday afternoon led to violent  protests among the deputies of the various parties because the  Executive Branch threatened to "take actions" if the deputies  continue to discuss fiscal legislation.    The first letter reached the National Assembly at noon and  in  it, President Chamorro stated she would not sign -- approve --  the law on tax exemptions on school supplies and medicine for  humans approved by the Assembly in mid-February, although she  said she would not veto it either. "To sign such a bill would  be a violation of the Constitution and the mechanism to pass  fiscal legislation which had already been institutionalized,"  the president said. She added the Executive Branch has the  exclusive power to legislate on fiscal matters according to  Article 150 of the Constitution. The president also added that  "she is analyzing the measures that need to be implemented to  compensate for the loss in the collection of taxes."    The letter was described as "impertinent and disrespectful"  by the members of the Legislative Branch. The Board of  Directors, in response, decided to enact the law that same week.  The UNO deputies said they supported the Board's decision to  order the publication of the aforementioned law.    The storm caused by the first letter had not died out when  Frank Duarte, the secretary of the Board of Directors, read the  second letter, this time against the law on public bids for  fishing licenses. In the letter, the president states that by  means of presidential decree "she has decided to create a  National Fishing and Aquaculture Commission," thereby  overstepping the bounds of the commission created for this  purpose by the Law on Fishing Bids or Law 165.    Many of the deputies considered this to be a "deep crisis"  and an "open confrontation" with the Executive Branch.  Meanwhile presidency sources downplayed the confrontation by  pointing out that there is no such "crisis" between both  branches of government. Others, however, described it as the  president's "maneuver" prior to the arrival of the IMF  delegation.  <H5>  Assembly Will Determine Ways To Respond </H5>   "Antonio Lacayo is trying to sell the IMF the idea that the  National Assembly is to blame for not complying with the  guidelines proposed by the IMF," some deputies said. More than  20 deputies spoke rejecting the contents of the letters sent by  President Chamorro. "It is a provocation and an attempt to make  us take measures by insulting our intelligence," according to  Danilo Aguirre, a Sandinist National Liberation Front deputy.  <H5>  Rosales Blames Delaney </H5>   Aguirre proposed the creation of a special commission that  would be in charge of suggesting to the Board of Directors a  series of measures that could be taken in view of the  "provocation" by the Executive Branch. Roberto Urroz from the  Nicaraguan Democratic Movement and Omar Cabezas from the FSLN  proposed accelerating the constitutional reform process as a  response to "the Executive Branch's disrespect." According to  Deputy Cabezas, the measures announced by the president in her  second letter are aimed at protecting the "fishing czars."    Finally the deputies unanimously decided not to get ahead of  themselves and appointed a special commission made up of the  members of the Board of Directors of the Economic and Legal  Affairs Commission to draft a proposal with the measures that  could be taken.    Labor Minister Francisco Rosales, who observed the debates  and the deputies' reactions closely, said both jokingly and  seriously that "these are the crazy acts of Deputy Presidency  Minister Tomas Delaney. Rosales said that Delaney "should have  resorted to the Supreme Court" so that the Judicial Branch could  determine if it is in the National Assembly's power to legislate  fiscal matters.    Presidency sources said that President Chamorro, who  traveled  to Chile yesterday, had drafted two more letters that would be  sent to the National Assembly today.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Attention! They Are Going To Dump </F> Toxic Waste Into the Mediterranean"]    [Text] Trailers loaded earlier with 90 tons of chemical  waste from Incirlik Air Base have arrived at Mersin port. The  waste, which is in barrels inside containers, was loaded on the  Panamanian-registered 1731 ton Eurotrader. The ship belongs to  Lionel Maksume, a ship owner in Antakya.    The appeal of the environmentalists in Mersin to the  governor  of Adana remained unanswered. The governor replied by merely  saying: "I have no authority to open the consignment." Governor  of Adana said: "It can be opened only with special permission  from the General Staff. Special protective clothing is  necessary. I cannot open it because we do not have such  clothing."    The need for special clothing indicates that the waste is a  radioactive material. That is, it is nuclear waste. According  to covertly obtained information by environmentalists, the  customs declaration describes the ship's cargo as "toxic waste."  The barrels are placed inside containers on which there are no  markings.    Officials say that the 90 tons of waste belongs to Incirlik  Base and that it is being sent to Britain for destruction.  However, the experts say that such a large amount of waste  cannot belong to Incirlik alone and most probably it was flown  into Incirlik from the United States. A police car and two U.S.  teams escorted the 90 tons of waste from Incirlik to Mersin.    The Eurotrader will leave Mersin on Monday with its toxic  cargo for Izmir. Officials say that the ship will take on cargo  in Izmir and then leave for Britain. However, the  environmentalists in Mersin say: "They will dump the  poison-filled barrels into the Mediterranean somewhere between  Mersin and Izmir. They are now trying out the Mersin route  because the Black Sea route was exposed and a new shipping  accident occurred in the Istanbul straits."    Environmentalist are saying: "Apart from its numerous  dreadful roles, it now appears that Incirlik Base was also being  used for such dirty work. This ship must be tracked, the  dumping of the poison into Mediterranean must be prevented, and  the public must be awakened to this fact."</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / European car output falls 3.4% EUROPEAN car production fell by 3.4 per cent last year to 12.66m, the second successive annual decline, according to figures released by Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based automotive analysts. Output declined despite virtually unchanged new car sales in west Europe at 13.49m, largely due to falling exports by European car makers to overseas markets. European car sales declined substantially in both the US and Japanese markets last year. At the same time additional overseas car makers, chiefly from Asia, are beginning to gain a small market share in some European car markets, increasing competition for the domestic producers. West Europe is becoming a significant market for Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean car makers, while Proton, the Malaysian car producer, is establishing a firm presence in the UK. European car makers dominate the small market for imported cars in Japan, but imported car sales fell last year in Japan by 11.1 per cent to 197,184. At the same time European car sales in the US declined by 26 per cent to 338,985, and two European car makers Peugeot of France and Rover of the UK were forced to pull out of the US car market altogether. West European car production peaked in 1989 at 13.28m but has been pulled down in the last two years chiefly due to lower output in Italy and in France. (The AID figures report 'net' production and exclude double counting in cases where the same car is included in the national production statistics of two countries. This occurs because of parts or kits being produced in one country, but the car being assembled in another). According to AID, car output in Italy fell by 12.9 per cent last year to 1.63m, as the Fiat group's declining fortunes relegated it to an unaccustomed fourth place in the west European car production league with a share of 12.9 per cent. Among the big six volume car makers in Europe only the Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi and SEAT, and Renault of France achieved higher output last year. The VW group accounted for 19.3 per cent of west European car production, ahead of the Peugeot group of France which includes Citroen, with 14.5 per cent and General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) of the US which includes Saab with 13.3 per cent. BMW, the German prestige car maker which has recently announced plans to build its first car plant in the US, increased its output last year by 7.2 per cent to 536,003. It has raised production for 17 years in succession with output rising more than three-fold from 184,681 in 1974. By contrast Volvo of Sweden was hit hard last year with output plunging by 26.1 per cent to only 273,465. Several specialist European producers also suffered substantial declines, with Porsche output dropping by 34.9 per cent to only 20,95 - output peaked in 1985 at 54,458 - while Jaguar production dropped by 45.2 per cent and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars output fell by 50.5 per cent. Volkswagen's Golf/Jetta range remained at the top of the European production league despite a 15 per cent drop last year due to the change-over to a new model generation. The Ford Escort/Orion moved into second place with a 25.5 per cent jump in output as it enjoyed its first full production year after the launch of a new Escort range in the autumn of 1990.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      WEST EUROPEAN CAR PRODUCTION*  -------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURER             1991  % share       1990    % share   % chg  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Total              12,662,425   100.0  13,110,217     100.0     -3.4 Volkswagen**        2,440,740    19.3   2,397,488      18.3     +1.8 Peugeot**           1,835,987    14.5   1,977,885      15.1     -7.2 General Motors**    1,684,578    13.3   1,717,816      13.1     -1.9 Fiat**              1,631,631    12.9   1,872,960      14.3    -12.9 Ford**              1,590,294    12.6   1,603,742      12.2     -0.8 Renault             1,546,637    12.2   1,513,651      11.5     +2.2 Mercedes-Benz         575,547     4.5     574,191       4.4     +0.2 BMW                   536,003     4.2     499,823       3.8     +7.2 Rover                 395,624     3.1     464,612       3.5    -14.8 Volvo                 273,465     2.2     369,840       2.8    -26.1 Nissan                124,666     1.0      76,190       0.6    +63.6 Porsche                20,952     0.2      32,162       0.2    -34.9 Others                  6,301     0.0       9,857       0.1    -36.1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTRY                  1991  % share       1990    % share   % chg  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany             4,659,480    36.8   4,660,657      35.5     -0.0 France              3,187,634    25.2   3,294,815      25.1     -3.3 Italy               1,632,904    12.9   1,874,672      14.3    -12.9 Spain               1,426,168    11.3   1,331,973      10.2     +7.1 UK                  1,148,917     9.1   1,179,063       9.0     -2.6 Sweden                269,431     2.1     335,853       2.6    -19.8 Belgium               253,491     2.0     311,841       2.4    -18.7 Netherlands            84,400     0.7     121,343       0.9    -30.4  -------------------------------------------------------------------- MODEL                    1991  % share       1990    % share   % chg  -------------------------------------------------------------------- VW Golf/Jetta/Vento   826,802     6.5     972,269       7.4    -15.0 Ford Escort/Orion     634,266     5.0     505,336       3.9    +25.5 Ford Fiesta           624,025     4.9     618,506       4.7     +0.9 Opel/Vauxhall Astra   559,063     4.4     658,542       5.0    -15.1 Renault Clio          543,905     4.3     250,699       1.9   +117.0 Fiat Uno              524,458     4.1     594,195       4.5    -11.7 Peugeot 205           481,765     3.8     562,354       4.3    -14.3 OpelVectra/Cavalier   469,219     3.7     450,581       3.4     +4.1 Renault R19           406,085     3.2     397,919       3.0     +2.1 VW Passat             398,429     3.2     358,981       2.7    +11.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excludes double-counting, which largely affects Belgium, UK and Spain. **Volkswagen includes Audi and SEAT, Peugeot includes Citroen, GM (Opel/Vauxhall) includes Saab, Fiat includes Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Ferrari, Ford includes Jaguar.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data.  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

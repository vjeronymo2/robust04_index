			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: AEG links with UK in rail deal ANGLO-German partners AEG and Taylor Woodrow International have won a DM735m (Pounds 290m) contract for a light railway system in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. AEG said yesterday its share amounted to DM320m and comprised orders for the entire electrical system, signalling, telecommunications, ticket-issuing and workshop equipment, and 34 units of rolling stock. Taylor Woodrow, the construction company in charge of the project, will lay tracks and build stations for the 12km project. On completion, expected in late 1996, the system will have a maximum passenger capacity of 35,000 an hour in each direction. The contract represents a further advance for AEG's rail systems division, one of the fastest growing units in the Daimler-Benz subsidiary. AEG is due shortly to make its first direct investment in Chinese railways, in a joint venture to make carriages for the Shanghai metro. The company made its first move in Chinese railways in charge of an all-German consortium which set up and equipped the first stretch of the Shanghai system.</p>

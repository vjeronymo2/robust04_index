			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>   [Excerpts] If the promotion to colonel of Tomas Cassella --  the intelligence and counterintelligence agent who first  protected and then abducted Eugenio Berrios, a former Chilean  Dina [National Intelligence Directorate] agent -- put the six  legislators who approved his promotion in an awkward position,  the details of the blackmail case that almost scuttled his  promotion are producing more embarrassment to judges and  financial authorities.    The misappropriation of accounting information stored in a  computer and the lieutenant colonel's persuasive techniques to  further increase his income will not be able to compete with the  notorious history concealed behind his blackmail. For Cassella,  the misappropriated information was worth $500,000. This was  his fair price for not disclosing the deposits made by  foreigners and the foreign transfers very secretly managed by a  banking house through two "covert" companies that, in typical  Argentine fashion, acted as "financial caves" for unholy deals.    The blackmail report, filed in a fit of rage by one of the  people managing the "covert finance companies," upset the  Central Bank authorities who had done nothing despite ewvidence  of large-scale money laundering that had been discovered after a  Social Security Bank [BPS] inspection.    Cassella struck a successful deal. The money launderers'  blackmail was based on the two "covert" companies' requirement  for secrecy. Cassella figured "it is not a crime to steal from  a thief." Thus far, he has been able to escape court action  and, furthermore, be promoted in his professional career.  [passage omitted]    A more careful review revealed that the two "covert"  companies, Relmon, Inc. and Urafix, Inc., were actually part of  an economic team. In a nutshell, they were linked to a banking  house established in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Recently,  this banking house has been attempting, unsuccessfully, to  obtain a banking license. Behind Relmon and Urafix appeared  Exprinter International Corporation [preceding three words in  English], the main concern grouping the Exprinter Banking House  and the Exprinter Tourism company in Uruguay and linked to the  Bunge y Born group and the Deutsche Bank in Argentina.  Therefore, the inspectors collected evidence on the existence  of "financial caves," a reality that "everyone" but the Central  Bank "is aware of." [passage omitted]    A typical Uruguayan solution, at least for this Uruguayan  fiscal haven, was implemented. The BPS debt was accepted  without a word, to prevent the closing of the banking house and  the affiliate companies. The criminal report was withdrawn by  the injured people and the judge expressed reasonable doubt on  the method to be pursued in this strange case. On 16 March  alone, the judge sent the dossier to the prosecutor. The judge,  however, sent it to the wrong prosecutor's office. Therefore,  court proceedings began last week to determine the actions to be  taken on the blackmail report, as this is a crime that is being  officially (that is, beyond the injured people's will)  investigated when the injured people strongly recant.    After this stormy summer season ended, Lt. Col. Cassella was  promoted to colonel. It was not reported if he finally managed  to collect the $500,000, but his representatives claim they  reached a "settlement between the parties."    The measures taken by the Central Bank, which is supposed to  control financial activities, also were not reported. The BPS  inspection and the blackmail episode exposed the money  laundering operations in Relmon and Urafix. The money launderers  will consider that Montevideo no longer represents a safe center  because the "controls" that the state does not implement  actually are implemented by the personal initiative of gangs of  blackmailers dressed in uniform. It is no longer possible to  trust anything.</p>

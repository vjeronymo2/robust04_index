			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The mood set last week in terms of a toiling market and enthusiastic buying by company directors has continued. An increase in selling, however, may be explained in part by the desire of directors to dispose of - or, at least, lighten their exposure to - their company's shares before the market weakens their price as a part of its overall mark-down. Bluebird Toys is a company where the directors appear to be behaving in anticipation of the market. The share price has outperformed the market by 200 per cent over the past 12 months. Torquil Norman, the chairman, has taken the opportunity afforded by the pre-closed period to sell 305,000 shares at 201p. His residual holding accounts for almost 7 per cent of the company, and his statement at the time final results were announced was resolutely up-beat. In much the same vein, selling by David MacDonald, non-executive director of distillers group MacDonald Martin, follows a period of outperformance by the shares. His holding of 'A' shares has been considerably reduced, but he still holds more than 900,000 'B' shares. TGI makes small loud-speakers for cars, as well as marketing other consumer electronic products. The revival of fortunes for the car industry has led to a knock-on improvement at TGI, and four directors bought some of their own stock during the week at 76.5p a share. While the total transaction was not large, directors' buying in the past has been spot-on in terms of timing. Thus, the present activity would seem to be particularly noteworthy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                 Sector       Shares     Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Amersham Intl.

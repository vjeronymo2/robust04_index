			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Loss of CDollars 57.8m at Dominion Textiles A RESTRUCTURED Dominion Textile is showing continuing recovery at the operating level, but special charges brought a final net loss of CDollars 57.8m (USDollars 48.8m) or CDollars 1.71 a share in the fourth-quarter ended June 30. This compared with a loss of CDollars 70.3m or CDollars 2.14 a share a year earlier. Operating profit before the special items was CDollars 33.7m against CDollars 7.5m a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 383m, up 7 per cent. For all fiscal 1992, operating profit was CDollars 86m against a loss of CDollars 15m a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.4bn, up 8 per cent. After the special items net loss was CDollars 75m or CDollars 2.31 a share against a loss of CDollars 129m or CDollars 4.07 a share in fiscal 1991. Mr Charles Hantho, president, said deteriorating conditions in some non-strategic businesses required the special provisions. 'Now we are looking forward to return to profitability on an annual basis.' For the latest year denim sales rose 33 per cent and yarn 19 per cent, while prices improved and raw material costs declined.</p>

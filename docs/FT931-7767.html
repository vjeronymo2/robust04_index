			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Code for junk mail is agreed THE Direct Marketing Assoc-iation moved yesterday to give greater credibility to the direct marketing business - worth an estimated Pounds 9bn last year - by announcing the industry's first code of practice aimed at self-regulation. Association members will be required before sending unsolicited material to consult a register of those who do not wish to receive any. At present there is no such requirement, and it is left to recipients of junk mail to stem the flow. The move was welcomed by the Mailing Preference Service, the independent body which keeps the register. The service is supported by Royal Mail, direct marketing trade associations and the Consumers' Association as a lobby against junk mail. The association has about 500 members including advertisers, advertising agencies and database practitioners. There are many companies outside the association - the precise number is unknown - involved in direct marketing, and their activities will not be regulated by the code. The code deals with a wide range of promotional techniques including incentives, gifts, prize draws and competitions. The code, to be introduced on March 31, sets out standards of conduct and best practice to be used in any complaints from the public or in disputes between association members. Code available from Direct Marketing Association, Haymarket House, 1 Oxenden Street, London SW1Y 4EE. Pounds 5 to non-members.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz 6 April, TASS -- "The Russian  president's decree on extending the state of emergency had a  positive response among the North Ossetian population on the  whole, since there is a threat of another conflict now," North  Ossetian Vice-Premier Georgiy Kozayev told ITAR-TASS here on  Wednesday.    "Therefore, the extension of the state of emergency in some  areas by another two months is a necessary measure. Russian  peace keepers are the main guarantor of security in the conflict  zone," he added.    Kozayev noted that the North Ossetian leadership is very  concerned over the safety of machine operators engaged in spring  sowing: Several cases were registered when tractor drivers were  blown up by mines.    The temporary administration and the republican Interior  Ministry came forward with an initiative to station mobile  patrols in localities, which now exercise control over spring  sowing in areas bordering Ingushetia.    According to Kozayev, the key issue for the republican  leadership is the comprehensive solution of the problem of  refugees as well as their housing. He said that a residential  area out of prefabricated houses mushroomed in the village of  Zavodsky in a Vladikavkaz suburb.    It will house refugee families from the Prigorodnyy district  (it is divided between North Ossetia and Ingushetia), Georgia,  the Chechen Republic and Tajikistan. The list of future  residents was determined by a commission of the industrial  district administration together with the republican migration  service.    The migration service now works on the lists of refugees to  be housed in the Mozdok, Sovetskiy and Leninskiy districts of  the Republic.</p>

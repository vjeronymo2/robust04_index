			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Securities markets in a post-inflation world Gloomy minds think alike. By one of those coincidences which make you wonder if your great thoughts are not simply something you overheard, I had just started drafting this column when I received a circular from Mr Nicholas Carn of Draycott Partners saying pretty much what I was planning to say. Or at least the central thought is the same: inflation should now be discussed in the past tense. Draycott is a Boston firm, so Mr Carn dates the turning point from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the autumn of 1989. British investors are likely to remember our own steep rise in interest rates of about the same time, Japanese the arrival of Mr Yasushi Mieno as governor of the Bank of Japan, and continental Europeans, perhaps, the more recent rise in German rates. However you trace it, the central banks outside Europe decided some time in the late 1980s that they had had enough of what the Japanese so vividly call the bubble economy, and pricked it. In Europe the fiscal and wage explosions in Germany and Italy provoked the same response. The result, according to the consensus of the investment community, is that world inflation is now converging towards 3 per cent. Not, however, according to Mr Carn, or to me; the disinflation is more likely to be dangerous overkill. A glance at the US economy, where the monetary overkill has largely (but not entirely) been reversed, should be enough to set off some warning signals; there is still barely a sign of revival, to the despair of President George Bush and his advisers, who are openly campaigning against the Fed. The British authorities are now showing some signs of awareness and worry; a debt-ridden economy does not seem to respond to interest rate cuts. Yet in Germany and Japan, whose economies are rapidly sliding into recession, the central banks still talk as if they had plenty of time to ease later. We shall see. It is the old central bank story of first watching the wrong indicators, and then doing too much, too late. Through the 1980s they targeted consumer price inflation, and were complacent about asset price inflation; they ignored the fact that there were already powerful forces checking inflation in productive industry - new technology, improved man management, lower demand for raw materials in a service economy, and better stock control. So the over-expansion of money was mainly seen in asset markets - 'a speculative vortex that ultimately sucked in everything from paintings to toy cars,' as Mr Carn reminds us. The past tense, as any dealer can confirm. This is the point which the current equity bulls, who like to argue that low inflation is good for equities, have missed. The restraint in unit costs did help margins, and will continue to do so; but the bull market itself, and the growth of credit-financed demand which it supported, was not the result of deflation, but of continued financial inflation. It was in fact the last gasp of the great inflation which started in the early 1970s. Now we have monetary disinflation, while the technological disinflation is still gathering force; and looking some way ahead, we have growing competition not only from the emerging Asian and Latin American economies, but from the well-educated low-wage economies of the former Communist world as well. The combined competitive squeeze on UK industry is producing a result which has never been observed before - a sharp rise in productivity even as output is falling. In the US, goods price inflation virtually stopped about a year ago. Meanwhile, the expansion of the service economy, which was a by-product of the asset boom, is in sharp reverse - not just in financial and property-dealing services, but now in the US in retailing too. Retail employment there is falling sharply, almost for the first time in peacetime living memory, or at any rate since the 1930s. Spending growth is virtually all in low-cost warehouse-type operations. Like the British retail revolution a century ago, this will maintain living standards, but at the cost of a sluggish economy. We can expect to see the same trends in Europe and even Japan. Against this sluggish, highly-competitive background, the debt work-out which is the main business of the English-speaking and Japanese economies is bound to be a protracted affair; and the fall in inflation makes it steadily more difficult. Mr Carn draws a dramatic conclusion: 'The cyclical downturn ushers in an environment that few of us can remember; money has always been a temporary refuge - now it is the thing to have.' That seems to me premature: it recalls an era when prices were persistently falling, so that all 'real' assets were wasting assets. But it could happen. What current American experience does suggest is that the blow to financial confidence of the current wave of failures, kept in place by the huge over-supply in commercial property, has already created the situation Keynes described, where easier credit is pushing on a string. It might be almost impossible for the central banks to start inflation off again even if they wished, and the hope of stable values is just that - a hope. Prices could start falling. The best ground for hope is that we have learned one lesson from the 1930s: the danger of a banking collapse, with a huge destruction of wealth and income, has been checked (though in the US it was a near thing). But in Europe we have also unlearned one lesson. The ridiculous rules for fiscal policy agreed at Maastricht - ridiculous because they do not trust financial markets to discriminate between different borrowers - will greatly hamper any government wanting to re-stimulate growth through budgetary action. The investment implications of this prospect should hardly need spelling out, except that they cut across the conventional wisdom of recent decades. We face sluggish growth at best, and continued cost pressures, so that equity investment will have to be highly selective - the most efficient manufacturers and retailers, and companies with a defensible monopoly position. Meanwhile, in Europe, we will initially face an artificially restricted supply of trustworthy bonds. So buy bonds.</p>

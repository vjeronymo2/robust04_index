Fedorov, deputy of the State Duma and </F> chief of the subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of  the Central Bank of Russia, by N. Zhelnorova, under the rubric  "After the Scandal"; place and date not given: "Who Stole Our  Wages?"]    [Text] Former Minister of Finance of Russia B.  Fedorov answered questions put by N. Zhelnorova. Currently, B.  Fedorov is a deputy of the State Duma and chief of the  subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of the Central  Bank of Russia.    [Zhelnorova] Boris Grigoryevich, many people cannot stand  the  sight of you because you deliberately delayed the payment of  wages in order to ensure an "artificial" reduction in inflation.    [Fedorov] This is a lie, an attempt to cover up their  inability to manage the economy. The government made decisions  to spend funds that were not envisioned in the budget and,  consequently, were illegal. Most decisions were made contrary to  the Ministry of Finance.    [Zhelnorova] Why was it happening?    [Fedorov] Because our bosses on high believed that it was  enough to write on a piece of paper "the Ministry of Finance  shall procure" in order for it to definitely "procure" the  funds. In no country can an official spend even $100 as he sees  fit. Everybody knows from his everyday life that he must live  within his means. If you have 100 rubles [R] in your wallet, you  may spend more only if you obtain credit. Meanwhile, trillions  of rubles are spent in our country without detailed  calculations. The government believes that it may spend as much  as it wants, and since nobody will extend normal credit to it,  it will simply print more money. However, plucking more money  out of thin air does not mean that more goods have appeared. If  A. Zaveryukha's wife begins to spend money based, in a way, on  twice the amount of his salary, he will soon remind her that he  has only one salary, after all. However, he acts in the exact  opposite way as far as the country is concerned.    We pursued our financial policy in 1993 based on the target  of credit outlays that had been approved by the government.  However, it was also exceeded by a great deal. Enormous  unexpected expenditures arose--for the elections and the  referendum, repairing the White House, and so on.    [Zhelnorova] You have come down hard on your opponents (or  adversaries) because they want to extend credit to the agrarian  sector. However, it was indeed not fair: to promise the peasants  to pay for grain, and later not to pay, just like petty  swindlers.    [Fedorov] Believe me, nowhere in the world does the state  procure grain! Our rural "barons" first pushed through an  enormous state order for grain without regard for the financial  potential of the state (in July 1993, under pressure from  Zaveryukha and Starodubtsev, our prime minister approved the  procurement price for grain at the world level, although there  was no money). Later, the "barons" began to demand that the  "debts" be paid back. Hence the busting of the budget and the  ridiculous position of both the prime minister and the minister  of finance. However, the "agricultural barons" are now demanding  state orders for 1994 once again! Wages in sectors financed from  the budget are indexed similarly. Indexation announcements are  always backdated, although it is patently clear that there is no  money and a delay of one to three months is a virtual certainty.  So, a pay rate agreement with the coal miners has just been  signed. The absurdity of such agreements has been discussed many  times. Wages are not paid; subsidies are illegally spent for  purposes other than those envisioned. To cover up mismanagement,  the bosses are now forced to print additional money, thus  stimulating inflation. Ultimately we will pay for such  irresponsibility out of our own pockets. Financial discipline,  which means living within our means, as well as responsibility  and control--this is the reform we need more than anything.    [Zhelnorova] Do you sympathize with the prime minister, who  has given up a strong minister of finance?    [Fedorov] Chernomyrdin's current task is to play into the  hands of the Agrarians and the Communists, to squeeze  "youngsters" out of the government, and to begin doing  everything his way. However, he does not understand that the  economy cannot be made to work by administrative methods.  Indeed, I agree that Chernomyrdin and his new team are good  managers, but within the framework of a large enterprise. But  Russia is not a Gazprom. In this instance, one must know about  and understand the connection between the exchange rate,  inflation, and the growth of production.    [Zhelnorova] Some people from your team maintain that  everything in Russia will explode three months from now.    [Fedorov] I think it will not be three months but rather  six.  There are economic laws that are impossible to circumvent.    However, I do not intend to foretell a collapse; this is  pointless, all the more so because we do not yet know what kind  of policy there will be. For now I do not consider myself in  opposition to the government. It is another matter to have  apprehensions (90 percent) about the government opting for  another path which is worse for Russia.    Of course, if we analyze the composition of the government,  there are few genuine reformers there, except for Chubays (and  then it is not clear how long he will hold on). Shokhin is a  turncoat, a person who likes sitting down with the prime  minister for hours. He will make it to the position of minister  of defense. I brought in Dubinin, who has now been appointed  acting minister of finance. However, I am not sure whether he  can stand up to the wave of pressure being brought to bear on  him. (My uniqueness was found in the fact that I could tell  anyone to "get lost," while some people, such as Lobov, could  not get through to me on the phone at all. I was not inclined to  allow the compromises which Gaydar continuously allowed to  occur.)    [Zhelnorova] Once again, your departure was associated with  a  scandal. How did it happen--viewing the event from the inside?    [Fedorov] When Chernomyrdin saw through our subterfuge and  ruses associated with conducting financial stabilization (the  Ministry of Finance alone fought everybody), I understood that  the time for compromises was over, that is, they would cross the  critical line after which you lose respect for yourself. This is  why I decided to quit. I do not want to be a commander without  an army. Having become accustomed to my quite extensive role in  the financial policy pursued, I could not allow someone to order  finances about while Fedorov was alive (as minister).    [Zhelnorova] What would you advise the president to do? What  are your "three cards?"    [Fedorov] First: Always adhere to the same course. Second:  Put together a homogeneous government. Third: Think about  succession of power.</p>

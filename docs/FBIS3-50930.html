			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] "Army News," an official publication of the  Paraguayan Army, says that engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, the  president of the Republic and commander in chief of the Armed  Forces, is following orders from Armed Forces generals over the  appointment of Cavalry officers.    The December issue of "Army News" carries a report  elaborating on the latest changes in the military field. Beside  mentioning [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo in most  articles, the publication reports that Wasmosy received  instructions over some appointments in the Cavalry divisions.    The publication notes that the president and commander in  chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces appointed the new 3d  Cavalry Division chief of staff, "on the orders" of the Army,  which is headed by Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, the Army commander.    The text is as follows: "Engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, in  his  capacity as commander in chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces,  appointed DEM [General Staff School graduate] Colonel Enrique  Montiel G. as chief of staff of the 3d Cavalry Division on the  orders of General Rodrigo Diaz Delmas, the 1st Army Corps  Commander, through orders issued by Gen. Lino Oviedo, the  Paraguayan Army commander ..." A facsimile of this report,  which appears on page 7 of the December issue of "Army News," is  published on this page.    In the aforementioned publication's center page, Gen. Oviedo  is quoted as saying he will build "one school per year to save  Paraguay from poverty." The publication did not specify,  however, with what funds he will build schools. There is a  picture of the general awarding medals to high school graduates  in the interior of the country.</p>

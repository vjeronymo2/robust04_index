			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Rao brings Congress party into line THE STRIKING fact to emerge from the landmark Congress party convention being held in the Hindu pilgrim town of Tirupati is the dominance the prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has now established over his party. Widely regarded as an aged, interim leader when he took over last June, this plenary session of the Congress is demonstrating that he faces no internal challenges to his authority. 'The net result (of this meeting) is that the prime minister will be stronger,' said one minister yesterday. The government is thus expected to move more rapidly in implementing controversial reforms to restructure the state-owned banking system and towards providing industry with more leeway in declaring redundancies. Ministers and senior party officials claimed that one reason for the apparent slowdown in the pace of reforms since the February budget was the fear of provoking a grassroots backlash at the current Congress session. These fears resulted in a catch-all economic resolution being put before the All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting that embraced all points of view in the party from socialism and central planning to pro-market policies. But party officials said yesterday that the resolution should be regarded as a mandate for change. 'The significance of the resolution is its endorsement of the new policies,' said Mr V N Gadgil, a party spokesman heading the drafting committee on economic policy. 'The prime minister's position will also be strengthened.' The party has also endorsed the government's stand against signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty saying it was biased against countries that did not have atomic weapons. The Congress party favoured a 'non-discriminatory nuclear non-proliferation treaty', but did not spell that out. The convention has given Mr Rao his first opportunity to face the massed Congress ranks as prime minister. In choosing to hold the meeting in his own southern state of Andhra Pradesh, Mr Rao's aim was to demonstrate that he was boss and that the south now counts for more in Congress counsels. As a leader, he fails to excite the crowds as the Gandhi family knew how to. By the rowdy standards of Congress occasions this has been a low-key affair, with delegates paying little attention to the debates. But with his quiet, elder statesman style, Mr Rao impressively demonstrated his authority when he intervened to quell minor disturbances in the hall yesterday. He has restored the party's self confidence after the demoralisation that followed both Rajiv Gandhi's assassination and the loss in the June election of their traditional bastion of power in the Hindi-speaking north. Mr Rao is seen to have steered the party through the pitfalls of recent months - from the collapse of international confidence in India's economic management to the threat of separatist movements on its borders. His hesitant, scholarly approach does not arouse enthusiasm within the party. But as one delegate put it yesterday: 'He is mildly liked by all and few criticise him.' The issue that has most agitated delegates is the holding of elections for the 21-man committee that runs the party. As the new party president, Mr Rao wants to allow competition for places for the first in 20 years. The elections mark the difference of style with Rajiv Gandhi and his mother Indira, who themselves appointed the committee.</p>

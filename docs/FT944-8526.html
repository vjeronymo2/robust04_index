			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Fox goes for birdie: Murdoch's challenge to the golfing establishment Rupert Murdoch is no stranger to upsetting establishments, as Britain's tabloid-tormented royal family knows to its cost. But this week it emerged that the Australian media magnate's Fox Broadcasting plans to co-sponsor a Dollars 25m World 'Tour' for top golf professionals. This marks as colourful and audacious an attack on entrenched sporting interests as he has yet launched. Supported by one of the world's top players, Greg Norman - called the 'Great White Shark' for his flowing blond hair - Fox proposes to stage eight tournaments (five in North America, one in Britain, one in Spain, one in Japan) with top prizes of Dollars 600,000 per event and a Dollars 1m bonus to the overall annual winner. The development has sent shock waves through the game's governing bodies - notably the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St Andrews and the long-established Professional Golfers Associations (PGA) - and stirred dire mutterings that the prestige of the Open championship and other events could be damaged. It is also likely to focus the spotlight on the controversial figure of Mark McCormack, whose IMG group effectively controls, through management contract, a third of the players targeted by the new Tour. And for Murdoch's Fox television empire, which outbid CBS for the rights to the NFC's American football package earlier this year, it could further boost its ambition to become the fourth US network and wrest valuable sports properties from its rivals. In some respects Murdoch's move is reminiscent of Kerry Packer's 1977 swoop on international cricket, which led to the famous Packer circus - of floodlit games in pyjamas and all that - and transformed the shape and character of the sport. Then, as now, the story leaked out (after a party thrown by England cricket captain Tony Greig). Then, as now, the underlying business issue was an Australian's ambition to exploit TV rights on an international scale. It is possible that professional golf will not be the same again, but in other respects the Packer analogy is flawed. Unlike their cricketing couterparts of 17 years ago, top golfers such as Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer and Colin Montgomerie are fantastically well paid - even if some of the professional journeymen who make up the numbers at tournaments and consistently end up among the also-rans live in caravans or hire bed and breakfast rooms. The stars whom Murdoch is courting have no obvious need of his shilling. Another difference is that Tony Greig, Packer's unofficial recruiting sergeant, had most of the world's top cricketers signed up before news of their defection hit the streets. This time, plenty of names are being cited on the rumour mill but Norman apart, none has yet come out publicly. This is not to say that a Murdoch circus is not in the making. The five 'Tour' bodies that administer the professional game around the world have been remarkably successful in riding the golf boom of the last 20 years. The European Tour's prize money has gone up from Pounds 500,000 in 1975 to Pounds 28m today. But the dissatisfaction of some top players goes beyond Faldo's recent criticism of the condition of some European courses, before he headed off to play more in the US. The issue for most of them - as articulated by Norman this week at his Shark Shootout tournament in California - is not so much the money as a desire to play each other more often. Trudging round international tour events, other than the so-called 'majors', partnering a tournament no-hoper, is the good club amateur's equivalent of playing with a 36 handicapper. The scheme also makes commercial sense to Fox, since the fans are mainly interested in what is happening to the handful of players who routinely show up on the leader board. Many of the 30-40 stars that Fox now hopes to cherry pick anyway believe that the vast majority of unsung and unknown professional players have been riding on their coat-tails. The PGA Tours in Europe and the US - which represent all players and claim a wider responsibility for the 'orderly progress' of golf - are both constitutionally and philosophically unable to satisfy their wishes. Battle lines are being drawn, with both PGA Tours vowing to protect their jurisdictions against Fox incursions. But even the PGAs' 'conflicting events rule' - which gives the authorities a say over which events contracted players can enter - will count for little if Murdoch woos enough names. IMG could be pivotal. The group's worldwide golf operations co-ordinator and senior executive vice-president, Alastair Johnston, said from New York last night that IMG had 'been approached by Fox in an exploratory capacity'. He said each client would be counselled and each would have a different perspective, 'but I can tell you now that the draft contracts submitted by the organisers are entirely unacceptable. We couldn't approve them. 'We are not going to be bought,' he said.</p>

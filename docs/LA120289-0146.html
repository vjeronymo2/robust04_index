			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> William Keating -- A story in Wednesday's Business section incorrectly reported  that William Keating, a former director of American Continental, parent of  scandal-ridden Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, has been charged with fraud and  conspiracy in the Lincoln case. But The Times was correct in reporting that  Keating, now president of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, has been charged, as  part of a federal civil lawsuit, with breaching his fiduciary duties as a  director of American Continental.  </P></p>

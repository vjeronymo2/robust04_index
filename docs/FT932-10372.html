			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: Brilliant, but flawed - The life of George Brown TIRED AND EMOTIONAL: THE LIFE OF LORD GEORGE BROWN by Peter Paterson Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20, 308 pages THERE WILL never be another George Brown; the system won't allow it. Today, a boy from working class London would no longer leave school at 15, work his way up through the trade movement, become deputy prime minister and foreign secretary with a lasting record of achievement. He might go to university (something that would have turned George Brown into a different man); he would be less likely to go into union politics and he might not even consider joining the Labour Party. One of the problems of the current party is that many of its old aims - like greater equality of opportunity - have been partially accomplished. George Brown was special in another way, too. He was not the only working class boy to make it almost to the top. Ernest Bevin had done it before him. But Brown was a man who, despite his successes, continued to harbour resentments. As Peter Paterson puts it in this new biography: 'He carried enormous chips on both shoulders,' mostly against intellectuals and the class system as he saw it. At the same time, he was a 'character'. He got continually into scrapes. Everyone knew who he was; no-one would have thought he was anything but British - the very initials are almost a symbol. One of his very first acts as a young minister was to have the Tower of London opened to the public on Sundays. Politics became duller when he resigned for the last time. He also had great imagination. He was pro-European from a very early age: much more so than any of his contemporaries in the Labour Party - or among the Tories, for that matter. In that sense he was a forerunner of Edward Heath. He had an intuitive understanding of the Middle East which was rare among British politicians. He did not share his party's prevalent belief in Israeli supremacy: hence his negotiation of United Nations Resolution 242 when he became foreign secretary - it has remained the basis for Middle East peace talks. Even his National Plan, when he ran the department of economic affairs, still arouses nostalgia. If only the Wilson government had devalued soon after it came to power in 1964, perhaps it would have been more viable. Paterson's book reads less sympathetically than is perhaps intended. 'Tired and emotional' became the words associated with George Brown, and indeed with a particular form of behaviour in anyone, ever after. The author does not spare the warts. Whereas a foreign office man would tell you that 'the trouble with old George is that he only needs one glass of sherry for it to go to his head', Paterson makes it clear that there was a heavy drinking problem throughout. He also shows that Brown could be intolerable to his wife, Sophie, whom he finally left for his secretary. There were excuses, to be sure. Brown needed money, especially when on the back benches. For a time he received payments from the Mirror Group, until it came out as a scandal. The sums were small and recent events in European socialist parties suggest that we should be tolerant to a man who was simply trying to make ends meet. Emphasising the troubles, however, can lead to understating the achievements and the popular appeal. How hard Brown was to understand can be illustrated by two statements. 'He is not only superficial and lightweight intellectually; he is not only vain and vulgar; he is not only drunken; he is also a little cad'. Then again: 'I found George the most attractive member of cabinet, certainly the most gifted, certainly the most imaginative, possessing a mind which has a sense for the evidence buried in the documents or in a speech and which can smell it out.' Both statements come from the same man, Richard Crossman, who went on to identify the same problem as Paterson: namely chips. Aneurin Bevan had many of the same positive qualities, but without Brown's detestation of intellectuals. It would be interesting to learn more about how and why. It is also not quite explained how a politician who Paterson claims scarcely read a single book turned out to be so ahead of his fellows on foreign policy. The book has some lapses. It is hard to excuse the repeated use of Willi for Willy Brandt. The man Brown appointed to the embassy in Bonn was Roger not Robert Jackling. And Paterson must have a starry-eyed view of the home civil service since he describes the foreign office as 'the stuffiest, most conservative, and traditionally minded department of state.' At least the foreign office is not insular; neither, despite all his character lapses, was George Brown. 'Brilliant, but flawed' might be a better title.</p>

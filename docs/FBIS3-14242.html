			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Council of Ministers following an </F> emergency session in B'abda Palace on 23 March; read by  Information Minister Michel Samahah--live or recorded]    [Text] Lebanon has emerged from the painful war and its  various effects and covered a long distance along the road  toward reviving its society with its democratic institutions,  its administrative and security apparatuses, its production  sectors, and its infrastructure. Lebanon determinedly and  courageously shoulders the responsibility of resisting and  standing fast against the unrestrained Israeli aggression  against its land and people. And Lebanon was preparing for  national and regional developments, relying in this on its  national harmony and full coordination with its Arab brothers,  when a scheme feeding off the Israeli source emerged in the  homeland to target the country's unity, freedom, and immunity.  Some of those offended by the restoration of social peace did  not hesitate to get involved in that scheme to realize the  enemy's objectives as well as the suspicious ends that started  to appear in the form of calls for self-enforced security and  for reviewing the state's unity.    What happened at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  Mikha'il  and before that along the al-Balamant road and the central  headquarters of the Lebanese Phalangist Party, in addition to  the explosive charges that were placed in cultural and  educational centers, the assaults on men of religion and  religious places, the desecration of graves, the printing and  publishing of leaflets that instigate sectarian strife, and the  spreading of rumors that incite, all constitute irrefutable  evidence that the most sacred foundations of Lebanon's existence  are being targeted.    Against all this, the Council of Ministers would like to  affirm the following:    1. Lebanon will not take a bystander's position on these  developments. Since the criminal intentions were uncovered and  the terrorist operations emerged, Lebanon has been determined to  abort attempts that target its stability and seek to harm its  peace and reconstruction march;    2. The Council of Ministers highly appreciates the efforts  and sacrifices made by the security forces, including the Army  and the internal, public, and state security forces. These  efforts have led to uncovering the dimensions of the conspiracy,  exposing its planners, and arresting its perpetrators. The  Council reaffirms its earlier decisions to entrust the Lebanese  Army with the task of deploying over all the Lebanese  territories to protect the homeland's unity, the sovereignty of  the law, and the society's safety;    3. The Council of Ministers has adopted a set of measures to  protect the country, maintain its domestic security, and deter  the conspirators regardless of their affiliations. It will not  tolerate the view of self-enforced security or the establishment  of individual security cantons anywhere in Lebanon;    4. The Council of Ministers calls on the mass media to deal  with things responsibly and to continue to contribute to the  peace march within the framework of the laws that will be  referred to the esteemed Chamber of Deputies to organize  audiovisual media and protect public freedoms;    5. The Council of Ministers turns to the international  community and the sponsors of the peace conference to draw their  attention to the seriousness of the terrorist actions Israel is  undertaking against the unity of our homeland and the safety of  our people in an attempt to strike at Lebanon's peace and  regional peace chances at the same time.    The Cabinet confirms that Lebanon, which regained the unity  of its institutions and impregnability, and, which valiantly  resisted the Israeli aggression, will allow no one to strike at  its achievements. The state, which is committed to the  constitutional principles and institutions and to the democratic  parliamentary system, will continue to relentlessly safeguard  and defend everyone's security, freedoms, and rights.    Accordingly, the Cabinet has issued a group of resolutions  led by Decree No. 4908. President of the Republic, in  accordance with the Constitution and the Associations Law issued  on 3 August 1909 and its amendments, particularly Article III,  and in accordance with (?Notification) No. 178AD dated 10  September 1991 granted on establishing the association called  the Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut, and in accordance with the  Interior Minister's proposal and following the approval of the  Council of Ministers on 23 March 1994, the following is decreed:    Article I: Notification No. 178AD dated 10 September 1991  issued for the establishment of the association called the  Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut is withdrawn. The association  is hereby dissolved.    Article II: This decree shall be published, conveyed when  necessary, and will go into force when issued.    The Cabinet has also adopted a group of measures. Article II  of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 August 1991 defined the crimes  covered by the Amnesty Law. These include some crimes committed  against the state's internal security, political crimes, or  so-called general or local political crimes. They also include  some crimes stipulated in the Military Penal Law, crimes of  possessing and carrying any kind of weapon, and crimes of  abduction and confiscation of freedom. The legislator aimed at  that time to lay to rest a tragic past that almost wrecked the  country and its system. But the legislator cautioned that the  criminals who benefited from the amnesty should not return to  their habits and should not commit crimes such as those that  were included in the amnesty.    So the last paragraph of Article II of the law has  stipulated  the following:    Crimes of an excessive and repeated nature or crimes  perpetrated after this law is issued [words indistinct].    Article 317 of the Penal Law stipulates that every action,  piece of writing, or speech that aims to incite religious or  racist discords or to instigate disputes among the various sects  and among the nation's members should be punished.    Since the country, after 28 March 1991 [as heard], and  especially very recently, has been the scene of more crimes  against the state's internal security--crimes formerly covered  by the general amnesty--or crimes of a similar nature including  car bombings, bombings of worshippers, the placing of explosive  devices in densely populated areas, including schools, and acts  seeking to undermine the state's public order and security,  weaken national unity, harm the country's basic interests, and  provoke sedition;    Since some audio and visual media continue to go to extreme  lengths to broadcast news and commentaries likely to provoke  sectarian fanaticisms;    Since the Weapons and Ammunition Law issued on 12 June 1959  specified a maximum three-year prison sentence for the  unlicensed possession and transport of military weapons;    And since this penalty is not considered a sufficient  deterrent in the current circumstances and conditions,    The Cabinet has decided the following:    First, the justice minister is requested to draw the  attention of the concerned judicial authorities to the  aforementioned legal penalties, particularly the last paragraph  of Article II of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 March 1991 [as  heard] and the second paragraph of Article IV of the same law,  and to instruct these authorities when necessary to resume the  prosecution of crimes that are no longer covered by the amnesty  and those crimes that were perpetrated after 26 March 1991 [as  heard]--the crimes that caused the forfeiture of the said  amnesty.    Second, as of midnight on 23 March, all visual and audio  media, except Tele-Liban and Lebanese radio [Beirut Radio  Lebanon], are banned from broadcasting news and programs that  are directly or indirectly political until the Audiovisual Media  Law is passed and goes into force.    Tuesday 29 March 1994 has been set as a date for an  extraordinary Cabinet session to make a final decision on the  Audiovisual Media Bill.    Any media station that does not abide by this decision will  be prevented from further broadcasting and immediately closed.    The Internal Security Forces, assisted by the Army, are  instructed to implement this decision against violators.    Third, the justice minister, the minister of national  defense, and other concerned ministers are requested to submit  the necessary bills to enact stiffer penalties on the  aforementioned crimes to the point where they become a real  deterrent. This will be done to deter those who wish to exploit  the country's atmosphere of liberty.    The information minister conveyed to the Cabinet a  recommendation by the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee  during its discussion of a bill increasing the capital of the  Tele-Liban Company. The recommendation urges the state to own  all the shares of this company. The prime minister, who is the  proprietor of the private sector's share in this company, showed  responsiveness to this recommendation. The Cabinet consequently  decided that the state should buy the private sector's share in  this company and instructed the information and finance  ministers to carry out the necessary legal measures for this  purpose.</p>

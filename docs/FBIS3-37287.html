			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "Why Have We Been </F> Disarmed?"]    [Text] It is sad but true: Ukraine is giving up its  nuclear weapons -- the same kind of weapons that other countries  seek to obtain by all legitimate and illegitimate means, and  that countries which already have them do not want to let slip  from their hands. Ukraine is giving them up voluntarily. And to  whom? To Russia -- a state that trod Ukraine down for 300  years, and which is currently putting forward territorial claims  against us; a state from which direct threats are addressed  against us, and in which the rapid advancement of chauvinistic  forces is plain for all to see.    Perhaps we are handing over our nuclear weapons because they  have lost their value? Not at all. Their value remains  colossal. Moreover, they serve as the only sure protection  against aggression from any state. No wonder that certain  countries -- Israel, Pakistan, India, and others -- have either  already acquired them, or are very close to developing them.  The material and financial value of nuclear weapons is also  astronomically high. Their enormous value is beyond question.    So why is Ukraine voluntarily giving up this enormous  treasure that is so desired by others? Perhaps because we love  peace more than all other nations of the world? Or maybe we do  not realize what we have really obtained by the will of God?    Neither. Everything is much more prosaic. It is simply that  other states, primarily Russia and the United States, are  forcing us to hand over our nuclear weapons. They are forcing  us by threats, moral and economic pressure, and other means.  Ukraine is not giving up its nuclear weapons voluntarily but  under duress. One should be deeply aware of this truth, which  is shameful for us Ukrainians.    From the dense demagogy of the president, who is trying to  portray Ukraine's defeat in the issue of nuclear weapons almost  as a victory, we could single out one argument that is being  repeated with many variations: Ukraine is unable to keep its  nuclear weapons because it does not have enough strength to  withstand the pressure from Russia, the United States, and other  countries. It does not have the strength because the Ukrainian  people are not united, the economy is in shambles, our  scientific potential is poorly organized, and because it has not  found allies on the international arena.    It is really hard for Ukraine to resist the external  pressure  in this situation. Who has reduced Ukraine to such a condition?    Are we to believe that the complex circumstances in which  Ukraine finds itself are the objective reasons why it is  impossible to preserve our nuclear weapons? "Ukraine cannot  keep its nuclear weapons because this is objectively  impossible!" -- the media keep telling us. Is that really true?    It is only half the truth. Ukraine really cannot preserve  its nuclear weapons -- not because of objective reasons,  however, but because of subjective ones. This does not mean  that it is totally impossible, but that President Kravchuk and  his team are unable to do it. The current Ukrainian leadership  is unable to cope with the numerous problems facing the state,  and it frequently surrenders in the face of those difficulties.  The problem is not the nuclear weapons themselves, but the  ability to conduct a clear and consistent foreign policy, unify  the Ukrainian people, speed up economic reforms, mobilize the  country's scientific potential, and find strong and reliable  allies abroad. How is it possible to speak about a state  without these aspects?    Having something of colossal value such as nuclear weapons,  one could use them as a powerful lever to solve all economic and  political problems. Had Ukraine decided to proclaim unilateral  nuclear disarmament, it would have obtained concessions and  guarantees from Russia, the United States, and other countries,  which would have put it among the leading countries of Europe.  Still, what is possible for the strong is impossible for the  weak, such as our leadership.</p>

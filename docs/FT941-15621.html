			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Venezuela takes action over bank Venezuela's financial authorities yesterday decided to suspend Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest commercial bank in terms of assets, from the national bank clearing system, said Mr Jose Bouza, president of the Venezuelan Banking Council. Banco Latino's cheques will thus not be accepted for clearing as of today, although Mr Bouza said no decision had been made on government intervention in the bank. Banco Latino, whose shares trade on the Caracas Stock Exchange, is the centrepiece of a group that includes other large financial and leasing institutions. Mr Bouza said the bank had been the victim of reports of financial difficulties which had prompted depositors to withdraw large amounts. Venezuela's economy suffered a 1 per cent contraction in GDP last year and there is concern that the recession will have a big impact on weaker commercial banks.</p>

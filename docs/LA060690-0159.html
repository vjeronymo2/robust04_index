			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ODD TRIO AT DODGER GAME  </P> <P> There was an interesting threesome at Tuesday night's Dodgers-Atlanta Braves  game in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Jane Fonda sat in a front-row seat behind the Braves' dugout and on one side of  her was her boyfriend Ted Turner, the Cable News Network mogul who also owns  the Braves. On Fonda's other side was none other than her estranged husband,  Tom Hayden, the California state assemblyman. Hayden didn't let Turner's status  as the Braves' owner keep him from wearing a Dodgers jacket and cap.  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Sales of cars decline in Japan Japan's economy showed signs of continuing weakness last month, with sales of new vehicles down 4.8 per cent from a year earlier, while seasonally-adjusted unemployment rose from 2.0 to to 2.1 per cent during March, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. However, Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said the government did not plan additional measures to stimulate the economy with the risk of rekindling inflation. Consumer prices in Tokyo rose 2.9 per cent in April from a year earlier, compared to a 2.1 per cent increase in March.</p>

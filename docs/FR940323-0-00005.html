			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 9, 1993, the Agency published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 64669) an interim final rule increasing the fees for Federal meat grading and certification services. On January 13, 1994, the Agency published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 1890) a correction to make the interim rule effective on December 9, 1993. This rule was implemented on an interim basis without prior proposal because increased revenues were needed to cover the increased cost of providing service. The interim rule was published with request for comments as a means of providing full public participation in the rulemaking process. Comments were requested by February 7, 1994. During the 60-day comment period the Agency received no letters responsive to the interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the foregoing considerations, the Agency will increase the base hourly rate for commitment applicants for voluntary Federal meat grading and acceptance services from $35.20 to $36.60. A commitment applicant is a user of the service who agrees, by commitment or agreement memorandum, to the use of meat grading and acceptance services for 8 consecutive hours per day, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding legal holidays. The base hourly rate for noncommitment applicants for voluntary Federal meat grading and acceptance services will increase from $37.60 to $39.00, and will be charged to applicants who utilize the service for 8 hours or less per day, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., excluding legal holidays. The premium hourly rate for all applicants will be increased from $43.20 to $44.60, and will be charged to users of the service for the hours worked in excess of 8 hours per day between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., and for hours worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., Monday through Friday, and for any time worked on Saturday and Sunday, except on legal holidays. The holiday rate for all applicants will be increased from $70.40 to $73.20, and will be charged to users of the service for all hours worked on legal holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is hereby found that good cause exists for not delaying the effective action until 30 days after publication of this final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Therefore, this final rule will be effective on March 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 54  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Food grades and standards, Food labeling, Meat and meat products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 54 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 54_MEATS, PREPARED MEATS, AND MEAT PRODUCTS (GRADING, CERTIFICATION, AND STANDARDS)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

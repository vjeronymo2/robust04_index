			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DR. CALIGARI' AN IMAGINATIVE, HILARIOUS SATIRE  </P> <P> The consistently outrageous and imaginative "Dr. Caligari," the Nuart's new  Friday midnight show, would have us believe that the evil director of the  insane asylum in the classic "Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has a granddaughter who  wants to take up where he left off 70 years ago.  </P> <P> It's an instance of not having broken the mold -- i.e., granddaughter like  grandfather -- but times have changed. The current Dr. Caligari (Madeleine  Reynal) presides over her asylum (by a toxic waste dump) like a mad dominatrix,  and her victims/patients are all caught up in extravagant, crazed indulgences  in sex and drugs.  </P> <P> This Dr. Caligari is of course not interested in curing anyone, but in  replicating her grandfather's experiments with the hypothalamus, that part of  the brain that controls the primal urges. Her goal is to "interface" her own  hypothalamus with that of her grandfather, whose brain she has preserved,  apparently hoping to emerge as some sort of indomitable super-woman.  </P> <P> Director-designer Stephen Sayadian and his co-writer, Jerry Stahl, whose last  midnight-circuit hit was "Cafe Flesh," have created a darkly hilarious satire  of contemporary aberrations and the gobbledygook we use to describe them. As a  spoof, "Dr. Caligari" is remarkably well-sustained, and laced with amusing  lines and observations. Says Dr. Caligari, in a reflective mood: "Funny thing  about desire. If it's not crude it's not pure."  </P> <P> What really counts the most is the film's terrific stylized look, which is  bargain-basement surreal created by a striking use of miniature and minimalist  settings (generally constructed against a black backdrop). The film's nightmare  fantasy mood is heightened by Mitchell Froom's ominous humming, thrumming  score.  </P> <P> As deliberately outre a cult movie for those with far-out tastes as "Dr.  Caligari" (Times-rated Mature) is, it is also the work of true visionaries with  too much of a sense of humor to be pretentious.  </P> <P> 'DR. CALIGARI'  </P> <P> A Steiner Films presentation of a Joseph F. Robertson production. Executive  producer Gerald M. Steiner. Director Stephen Sayadian. Screenplay Jerry Stahl,  Sayadian.

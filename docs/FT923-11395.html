			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia 31% ahead BANK of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, yesterday reported near 31 per cent growth in first-half net earnings. Profit, struck after transfers to unpublished inner reserves, was HKDollars 162.7m (USDollars 21m) compared with HKDollars 124.4m a year earlier, and broadly in line with market expectations. The bank published no other figures relevant to its business. The directors declared an interim dividend of 27.5 cents a share, up 31 per cent from the equivalent of 21 cents paid at the same time last year. Bank of East Asia, controlled by Hong Kong's Li family, is traditionally the first of the colony's listed banks to report its earnings. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank are expected to publish half-year results in a month's time. All banks are expected to report greatly improved earnings. Hong Kong is one of the most profitable centres for commercial and personal lending. Gross interest margins are about 5 percentage points. Deposit rates are being kept artificially low to support the Hong Kong dollar's fixed rate against the US dollar, while lending rates are set abnormally high to put pressure on the colony's overheated property market. Mr David K. P. Li, the bank's chief executive, said economic growth in Hong Kong had accelerated in the first half of this year. The sustained boom in the property market had resulted in stable growth in mortgage lending business, he said. Steady growth in domestic demand was expected. Mr Li added that it was expected that the current year's results would compare satisfactorily with those of last year. During the period, two of the bank's representative offices in China - in Guangzhou (Canton) and Zhuhai - had received approval to convert to branches.</p>

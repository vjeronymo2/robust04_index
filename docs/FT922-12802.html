			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Express Dairy sites to close Northern Foods is to close the Express Dairy operations at Morden, south London, by November, and the dairy at Cricklewood, north London, by next April with the loss of about 400 jobs. The closures are part of a modernisation and rationalisation programme for the London operations of Express Dairy, acquired from Grand Metropolitan in February. There will be a Pounds 9m investment at the Express Dairy site in Ruislip, west London, where a new facility will produce milk in non-returnable containers for multiple retailers and a new bottling line, creating about 50 jobs by the middle of next year.</p>

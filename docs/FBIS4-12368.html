			<p>BFN     [Text] Asyut, Upper Egypt, 4 Apr (MENA)--Three terrorists  were killed today in a clash with security forces and citizens  in Asyut. The clash took place on the al-Ma'abidah Island in  Markaz Manfalut, Asyut Governorate.    Several citizens clashed with three people, strangers to the  island, who had weapons hidden under their clothes. When the  three noticed that the citizens were in pursuit, they opened  fire on them. A crowd gathered and chased them, preventing their  escape. One of the three terrorists was wounded [as received]  in an exchange of fire with citizens carrying licensed weapons.  The citizens apprehended the other two terrorists to hand them  over to the security forces who arrived on the island. When the  two realized the security forces were approaching, they tried to  escape, prompting the policemen to shoot them. They died  instantly. The terrorists were found in possession of an  automatic rifle and a pistol. The pistol belonged to a  noncommissioned police officer who was assassinated last year.  The Manfalut prosecutor started an investigation into the  incident.</p>

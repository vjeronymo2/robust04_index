			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo steps up attack on hostile predator Lasmo yesterday fired its second volley in the war against hostile predator Enterprise Oil by accusing the rival explorer of having lost its way in the 1990s. Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, urged shareholders in the second letter in less than a week to reject Enterprise's Pounds 1.4bn paper offer. He claimed Enterprise's management was 'hiding behind the success of its predecessors'. Proven and probable reserves had fallen by 42m barrels of oil equivalent in the 1990s, while almost Pounds 500m had been spent on exploration, appraisal and acquisitions. Finding costs had also risen since 1990 from 43p per barrel to 213p. Enterprise was spending more to find less oil, Lasmo argues. 'In 1993, Enterprise spent Pounds 67m to drill 2.6 net wells. Finding costs have soared,' the company said.</p>

An  External Affairs Ministry spokesman said that India is committed  to strengthening the institutions relevant to the upholding of  human rights in India.    Commenting on a reported letter from the U.S. President, Mr.  Bill Clinton, to one Dr. Ghulam Ali Fai of New York, the  spokesman said that India trusts that when Mr. Clinton referred  to respect for human rights, it was in the context of gross  violation of human rights by militants and terrorists, aided and  abetted from outside India.</p>

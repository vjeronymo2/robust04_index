			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Deng Xiaoping's daughter is suing a printing  factory in Shandong province after it pirated thousands of  copies of her biography of the patriarch, mainland sources say.  Deng Rong is demanding 70,000 renminbi [RMB] (HK$61,600) from  the Yantai Printing Factory in a suit filed in the city's middle  courts last month. The Yantai factory is understood to have  hired a lawyer to defend itself against the charges, raising the  possibility that Deng Rong herself might appear before the court  at a hearing this month. "The Yantai factory is not going to  admit to the charge. But it's hard to say now whether she will  go," a source said.    Deng Rong -- the youngest of Deng Xiaoping's three daughters  and perhaps his closest confidante -- felt Shandong authorities  had been too soft on the factory. The Shandong Press and  Publications Bureau fined the factory only RMB 20,000 earlier  this year after it admitted printing 30,000 illegal copies of  the popular book. Private investigators hired by Deng Rong later  discovered that more than 100,000 copies had been run off. "Mao  Mao [her pet name] felt it was useless to rely on the Shandong  authorities because this factory is part of their system," a  source said. "We suggested she delay the suit and allow  administrative measures to take effect but she insisted on going  ahead right away."    My Father, Deng Xiaoping has been the target of  book pirates ever since it hit the shelves in China last  September. Pirate editions may outnumber the 900,000 officially  issued copies by as much as 10 times, sources said. Another  state printing factory, in Wuhan, admitted to pirating 10,000  copies, although the books were confiscated before being sold.  Other printing factories in Guangxi and Shaanxi were under  investigation by the State Copyright Administration (SCA) on  special orders from Deng Rong, the sources said. Those pirated  in Guangxi were of such low quality that it was difficult to  read, which Deng Rong believed lowered the book to the level of  underground trash novels, the sources said.    She hoped the Yantai case, where a decision was expected by  the end of this month, would serve as a warning to other pirate  printers. She also wanted the problem to be solved before her  second volume of the biography -- covering the patriarch's life  since 1976 -- appears in a few years. Juicy details about the  elder Deng's role in crushing the Tiananmen Square protests of  1989, as well as other political storms since the Cultural  Revolution, would make even richer pickings for book pirates,  especially if he had died by the time the volume came out, the  sources said.    SCA sources have confirmed that copyright violations will  soon be made a criminal offence subject to jail terms of up to  seven years. As reported earlier in EASTERN EXPRESS, Beijing  leaders promised to pass the criminal legislation after Deng  Rong flew into a rage over rampant piracy of the biography prior  to a trip to Japan in February. A special National People's  Congress Standing Committee will be held in May to pass the  legislation. When asked about the piracy problem during the  recent meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing,  Deng Rong grimaced and replied: "Of course, I'm not happy about  it."</p>

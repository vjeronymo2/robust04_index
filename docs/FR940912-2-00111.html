There are known differences in the patterns of metabolism of the chemicals with the ortho-isomer undergoing a unique series of host and gut microflora-mediated reactions leading to an intermediate with high capacity to bind to hepatic DNA and induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. In extensive NTP prechronic studies, the comparative toxicity of the nitrotoluene isomers was determined. An unexpected finding was the presence of chemically induced mesothelioma in male rats receiving o-nitrotoluene. Studies to elucidate the possible role of gut microflora in the mesothelioma response demonstrated that microflora metabolism was not necessary for the mesothelioma response. To further understand the carcinogenic potential of these chemicals and to relate this information to the extensive existing knowledge of their metabolism, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are planned with all three isomers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 12. o-Nitrotoluene (CAS No. 88&hyph;72&hyph;2)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies planned for o-nitrotoluene are outlined in the plans for m-nitrotoluene described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 13. p-Nitrotoluene (CAS No. 99&hyph;99&hyph;0)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies planned for p-nitrotoluene are outlined in the plans for m-nitrotoluene described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 14. m-Cresol (CAS No. 108&hyph;39&hyph;4)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cresols are monomethyl derivatives of phenol, and are found as constituents of coal tar, in various industrial solvents and resins, and in some essential oils. Cresols are on the list of Hazardous Air Pollutants in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and on the Superfund Priority List of Hazardous Substances. There are no adequate published chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of the cresols and this was identified as a research need by an International Programme for Chemical Safety working group in mid- 1994. The NTP has performed comparative 13-week toxicity studies in rats and mice by the dosed feed route. The isomers were found to exhibit generally similar patterns of toxicities, with the o-isomer being somewhat less toxic than m- or p-cresol. Comparative chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice are planned for the cresols. The studies will follow standard designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 15. o-Cresol (CAS No. 95&hyph;48&hyph;7)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies planned for o-cresol are outlined in the plans for m-cresol described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 16. p-Cresol (CAS No. 106&hyph;44&hyph;5)_2-year studies via dosed-feed in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The studies planned for p-cresol are outlined in the plans for m-cresol described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical 17. 2,4-Decadienal (CAS No. 25152&hyph;84&hyph;5)_13-week and 2-year studies via oral gavage in B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2,4-Decadienal is one of the class of dienaldehydes that occur naturally in a variety of foods. They occur as byproducts of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids. Ingested lipid oxidation products and oxidized fats have been reported to cause damage to the liver and kidneys, increased cellular proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract, and other non-specific tissue injury. Certain alpha, beta unsaturated lipids, including 2,4-decadienal and 2,4-hexadienal are known to react with DNA, and several researchers have suggested a possible link between lipid peroxidation products in the diet and human cancer. 2,4-Decadienal will be studied in prechronic and chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

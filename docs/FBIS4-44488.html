			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Yan (3769 1750): "Rising Trend of </F> Heilongjiang Peasant Burdens Starting To Fall"]    [Text] We find the burdens assumed by Heilongjiang's  peasants per capita are beginning to come down, after we had  tackled the data this past year and straightened them out in a  comprehensive way. According to an investigative survey of the  province's 28 towns/counties and 224 villages, the total burden  assumed by the province's peasants in 1993 averaged 81.64 yuan  per capita, 17.95 yuan less per capita than last year, a drop of  18 percentage points. The reasons for this drop are due chiefly  to the following:    1) A drop in the tax load. In 1993, the taxes paid by  Heilongjiang's peasants averaged 29.31 yuan per capita, 1.82  yuan less than the 31.13 yuan per capita for the year before, a  drop of 5.8 percentage points. Included in this is the  agriculture tax of 26.36 yuan per capita, which also showed a  drop of 1.3 percentage points over the year before.    2) A drop in collective retention. In 1993, Heilongjiang's  peasants paid a retention fee of 28.75 yuan per capita, 4.90  yuan less than the 33.82 yuan per capita for the year before, a  drop of 14.5 percentage points.    3) A drop in the overall planning fee. In 1933, the overall  planning fee assumed by Heilongjiang's peasants was 13.98 yuan  per capita, 0.92 yuan less that 14.90 yuan per capita for the  year before. Of this figure, 8.05 yuan per capita was earmarked  for public and welfare benefits such as education, family  planning, elderly pensions etc., 0.17 yuan less than that for  the year before.    4) A 55.12 percent drop in the apportionment fee. In 1993,  Heilongjiang's peasants paid 8.86 yuan per capita in  apportionment fines, a reduction of 0.88 yuan per capita over  last year's 9.74 yuan, a drop of 55.1 percentage points. Of  this, an arbitrary apportionment fee of 0.63 yuan designated for  peasant services dropped 43.2 percentage points over that  allowed last year.    While a common effort by Heilongjiang's government at all  levels to control the excessive tax burden assumed by its  peasants obtained certain results, the responsibility faced by  the government at all levels is still awesome. According to  incomplete statistics, the provincial rural collective financial  strength is still quite weak, with a per capita debt of 53,000  yuan, and carrying loans [tai kuan 2127 2949] of 37,000 yuan per  capita. This situation will necessarily slow down the drop in  peasant burdens, and poses the hidden danger of increasing  peasant burdens.</p>

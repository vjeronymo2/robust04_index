			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir,  commander in chief of the Armed Forces, admitted the Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise [Hondutel] transferred 36 million  lempiras to the Armed Forces. He said the money was used to pay  soldiers and other personnel's salaries. He explained that when  Callejas took office, soldiers had 1.5 lempiras a day to use for  food, adding that "Callejas left us with 2.5 to three lempiras  to use for food." He said the increases had been made with  insufficient funds in the defense budget. Then the National  Congress authorized the Treasury Ministry to transfer the  Hondutel funds.  <H5>  Other Transfers </H5>   Although he gave no names, Gen. Discua insisted the Hondutel  funds were transferred to other government agencies to  supplement end-of-the-year budget shortages. He added that the  transfer was approved by the Legislative Branch as a round  figure. The officer explained that the military institution is  not interested in purchasing Hondutel because it cannot do so  with its budget. Nevertheless, he recognized that he could  invest his earnings in the corporation, just as the Military  Procurement Institute would, if it ever has the funds to do so.  <H5>  Misunderstanding </H5>   Gen. Discua believes there is a misunderstanding regarding  this transfer, "which is casting doubt on the military  institution." He believes Manuel Zelaya, director of the  Honduran Social Investment Fund, "was caught off guard with an  unfounded report." He said: "I think Mr. Zelaya was somewhat  misinformed and did not go to the Treasury Ministry or the  National Congress." He then affirmed there is no fault in this  transaction as everything was carried out through the Treasury  Ministry.    He indicated the disclosed reports have two purposes: one,  to  gain political notoriety, and two, to highlight the  privatization of Hondutel. He said: "We should speak clearly  about this issue and not deceive the Hondutel employees or the  union. This process is directed at privatization and we must say  so clearly."</p>

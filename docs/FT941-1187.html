			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Yorkshire miners move union assets The Yorkshire area of the National Union of Mineworkers has voted overwhelmingly to transfer its assets to the national union in Sheffield. The 88 per cent vote in favour of the transfer of undertakings secures the union's immediate future and underlines the strength of Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency. Yorkshire has about three-quarters of the union's membership of about 8,000.</p>

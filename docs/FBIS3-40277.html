			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Biserka Matic: "Federal Budget Becomes Important </F> Topic Before Adoption of New Economic Program: Olympic Athletes  More Expensive Than Some Ministries"]    [Text] The preliminary federal budget for the first  quarter valorized from 210,600,000,000 to 179,061,000,000,000  dinars; fighting inflation through indexing; key expenditures  for the Armed Forces, but large sums also go to many less  important items.    Ever since the Federal Assembly was placed in the position  of  outsider, with its functions assumed by the federal government,  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia too has ceased to be financed  according to the Law on the Federal Budget; instead, that  financing has been provisional or based on decrees or decisions.  At the end of last year, when the government, acting on its own  and without the parliament, adopted one of last year's numerous  rebalancings of the federal budget, Belgrade attorney Milenko  Radic brought suit before the Yugoslav and Serbian  Constitutional Court in an effort to prove that the government  was acting in conflict with the Constitution and with the law.    Naturally, no one paid the least bit of attention to this  attorney's objections, nor to the criticism voiced by many party  leaders who were alarmed that the Federal Assembly was  increasingly being held back and marginalized societally and  legislatively. On the contrary, the government in the meantime  (in early January) issued a decree on the provisional financing  of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] "for the period from  January to March 1994," and in the first paragraph it washed its  hands, so to speak, of all potential objections and criticism.  "Until enactment of the Law on the Federal Budget for 1994, by  31 March 1994 at the latest, the authorities of the FRY shall be  financed in accordance with the Law on the Federal Budget for  1993, with a real amount established by this decree." This is  the first paragraph, which "covers" the federal government  before the FRY Constitution. The Constitution states that laws  are enacted by the assembly, while decrees and decisions come  from the federal government.    In the case of the federal budget, legal experts from the  Palace of the Federation in Novi Beograd will repeat that here  too it is simply a matter of indexing. Being added to the  established price of a certain good are only the costs of  inflation, hyperinflation, or mega-inflation, depending on the  pace at which prices are rising.    In the first quarter, the authorities of the FRY will be  financed by a sum of 210,660,000,000 dinars, according to  SLUZBENI LIST No. 2 of 10 January. In case anyone is concerned  that this is too little and that it will be additionally and  excessively devalued by further inflation, it must be said that  the federal government has also considered that possibility. The  very day after the enactment of the decree on the provisional  financing of the FRY, a decision was adopted to valorize the  funds for financing the FRY and was published in SLUZBENI LIST  (No. 3) of 11 January. Here it now says that the funds  (established by the decree) for the first quarter are valorized  and "established" as 179,061,000,000,000 dinars, "based on the  estimated growth in retail prices."  <H5>  Each According to Merit </H5>   Thus, the decision became older than the decree, so that it  is no longer possible to speak of the 210,066,000,000 dinars,  but rather of the sum established by the decision. We have  verified that the government has enacted no new decrees and  decisions in the meantime, so that the one published in SLUZBENI  LIST on 11 January is still in force.    According to the decision, everything is in order on the  revenue side: 111,018,500,000,000 dinars will be secured from  base revenues, 53,720,000,000,000 dinars from long-term National  Bank of Yugoslavia loans, and 14,322,500,000,000 from bonds. It  is also calculated that in the first quarter 35.7 trillion will  be collected from the excise tax, 52.19 trillion from revenue  stamps (for the first time this sum is greater than the excise  tax, which indicates that the population faces paying enormous  stamp duty), 15.3 trillion from customs, and another 254 billion  from administrative fees.    The key items on the expenditure side are outlay for the  Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (135.137 trillion dinars), the  operation of federal agencies (20.502 trillion), disabled  veteran benefits (14.056 trillion), and supplemental funds for  the territories under UN protection (1.7 trillion dinars).    During the first quarter, the Federal Assembly will cost  847.5 billion dinars (independent of possibility that it may not  convene during that period), the general secretariat of the FRY  president 110 billion, the Federal Court 74, the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office 27, the Federal Constitutional Court 53.5,  the Federal Public Legal Office 14.9, the Federal Council for  Violations (!?) 53.3, and the general secretariat of the federal  government 803 billion dinars.  <H5>  Concern for Olympic Matches </H5>   We assume that every federal ministry has been  well-assessed.  In fact, mention is made in several places of certain funding  for "intervention in the economy" (as in the case of the  Secretariat for Legislation, where the amount is as much as  5.987 trillion dinars) or for "maintenance and procurement of  equipment and other basic resources of federal agencies and  organizations" (in the case of the Ministry of Justice, where  the amount is 544 billion dinars). All institutions are present,  from computer science to patents and the institute for measures  and precious metals, as well as all inspectorates and the Office  for the Performance of Specialized-Technical Work for the Needs  of Federal Agencies (a total of 2.05 trillion dinars).    According to the decision, the budget provides 90 billion  for  bank rehabilitation (it does not say which ones--whether, for  example, Dafiment Bank is included) and another 877 billion for  settlement of part of the obligation for deposited  foreign-exchange savings. The largest part of the 126 billion  provided for the Ministry of Sports will go to "funding for the  program of the sports leagues of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav  Olympic Committee [JOK]."    In the decree on provisional financing, 135 million out of  the 149.2 million earmarked for the aforementioned ministry is  provided for (as attorney Radic says) "Bakocevic's Olympic  Committee," or a little less than what is provided for the  entire Ministry of Agriculture, and twice as much as for the  Archives of Yugoslavia, the Federal Market Inspectorate, the  Ministry for Trade, or the Ministry for Science, Technology, and  Development. In short, if one is cynical one must note that the  government has perhaps allocated little for these purposes based  on the successes achieved by the JOK in clearing the way for our  athletes to participate in the Olympic Games.    Nowhere, neither in the decree nor in the decision, is there  any mention of youth or veterans organizations, but they can  indeed be found under individual ministries or as "other needs."  For example, financing of the operation of organizations and  associations for veterans and the disabled is mentioned in the  item linked with the Ministry of Health, while additional  funding for practically the same purpose is found under "other  needs." It is true that the federal government did not exactly  have to give special consideration to the budget items, nor to  whether some of the old expenditures were sandwiched--the budget  was not the subject of parliamentary debate. Far from the  deputies' eyes, the government was able to provide for and  finance whatever it wanted, because for now no one is being held  accountable for this, or for anything else.</p>

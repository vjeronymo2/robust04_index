			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> PARKING RATES TO GO UP  </P> <P> Parking-meter rates will double in parts of the business district starting July  1, from 50 cents to $1 an hour, to catch up with nearby cities' rates and help  solve a parking-operation cash-flow problem.  </P> <P> New monthly parking fees will range from $40 to $120. This compares to a  $45-to-$145-range in Westwood and West Los Angeles and $60 to $220 in Century  City, officials said.  </P> <P> Director of Finance Administration Donald J. Oblander has also suggested  several other options for the City Council to consider, including modification  of the two-hour free parking program and the formation of parking assessment  districts.  </P> <P> "The parking enterprise has had an operating deficit for five or six years,"  Oblander said after the meeting. He expects the city to reach or surpass  break-even points within three years with the changes.  </P> <P> The parking fee increases were part of a comprehensive ordinance passed by the  City Council on Tuesday to adjust fees for water, waste water, building  permits, business licenses and other items.  </P></p>

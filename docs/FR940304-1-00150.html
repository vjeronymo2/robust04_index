			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of the standard levels analyzed, level 6 will save the most energy per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to electric, this level has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative overall energy savings (^0.02 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all mobile home furnaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be condensing furnaces with full modulation. At nearly triple the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase price to consumers, this level produces negative life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings compared to the base case of $154 and has a payback of 13.0 years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is more than half of the average product lifetime. The level also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 70 percent and has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative net present value of $8.9 billion, as well as increasing all three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental atmospheric emissions studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 5. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save the most energy of any of the mobile home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnace trial standard levels, 0.11 quad, but the savings here are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced by fuel switching. This level produces the highest life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings compared to the base case of $239 and has a payback of 7.6 years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is slightly more than one third of the average product lifetime.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the level reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity by over 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent and has a negative net present value of $4.6 billion, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing all three atmospheric emissions studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for mobile home furnaces outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three next most stringent standard levels, 4, 3, and 2, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to have energy savings ranging from .03 to .05 quad, but the savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> here are also reduced by fuel switching. These levels also produce life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost savings compared to the base case ranging from $108 to $210 with payback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranging from 7.5 to 3.0 years and have little or no impact on manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return on equity. However, these levels all have negative net present values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranging from negative $1.39 billion to negative $.175 billion, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing one or more of the three atmospheric emissions studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4, 3 and 2 for mobile home furnaces outweigh their benefits, and rejects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home furnaces with standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that standard level 1 for mobile home furnaces saves a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be small but significant energy savings at this level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.02 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switching. In addition, the standard could have a slight positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by as much as 1,000 tons each by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 1 million tons over the forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technology that is necessary to meet this standard, improved fan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor efficiency, is presently available. The Department finds the level to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 0.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of approximately $102. Additionally, the standard is expected to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;essentially no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.3 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the two competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Kitchen Ranges and Ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range of standard levels for kitchen ranges and ovens. Table 4&hyph;9 presents the five efficiency levels that had been selected for analysis for the eight classes of kitchen ranges and ovens. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

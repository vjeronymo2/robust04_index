			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Broadband network already available to all Sir, The development of a national broadband infrastructure, as highlighted by your editorial ('Phone rules', August 23) and by both John Harper (Personal View, 'Riding tandem along UK superhighway', August 12) and Jonathan Solomon (Letters, August 22), is one of the most important strategic economic challenges facing the UK - and it is a challenge now being met in full by the British cable industry. The need to create a shared national infrastructure has been examined a number of times over the past 10 years - including the debate prior to the granting of the first cable licences in 1984, the discussions surrounding the 1991 Duopoly Review and most recently by the Trade and Industry Select Committee. All of these discussions have concluded that the best way to bring the benefits of improved service and cost-effective competition to the local loop is by granting individual local broadband franchises which any company, including BT or Mercury, can own and operate. This is bringing real choice and enhanced service to residential and business users and leading to the development of the world's most advanced, fibre-rich networks, giving Britain a real competitive advantage. A change to the regulatory framework will threaten the Pounds 10bn privately financed investment being made by cable operators, which is delivering the broadband revolution to UK consumers. If BT, or other national telephone companies, want to benefit from this revolution, the rules are clear. BT is not banned from the delivery of broadband or broadcast services, but to provide them it must use the existing licensing process and franchise system, on the same basis as other operators. We must remember that the 'superhighway' is not one wire stretching from John O'Groats to Land's End, but rather a network of networks. The cable companies are building their infrastructure parallel to existing BT facilities; operators interconnect with BT and Mercury for trunk connections and between themselves on a regional basis, and we will no doubt reach agreements with other new network operators such as Energis. In Europe, single network, state-owned telecom companies are not delivering broadband services to their customers - they have no real incentive to do so. In the UK the diversity of telecommunications service to the end user is creating the competitive environment needed for truly successful infrastructure development. It is this that will lead to the development of applications and services needed to ensure that the full potential of these new networks is realised.

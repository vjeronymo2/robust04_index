			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: GROUP IS DETERMINED TO SPREAD THE NOTION THAT ADS  SHOULD SELL IDEAS  </P> <P> The actor who appears on the TV screen looks relatively normal. Except for one  thing. Atop his shoulders, in the spot where his head would normally be, sits a  TV set.  </P> <P> "Tubehead" -- as he is called -- spends the entire 15-second commercial trying  to yank the TV set off his head. At the very end of the commercial, this  message flashes on the screen: Can you switch off?  </P> <P> Don't expect to see this ad on American television any time soon. But one major  Canadian network has agreed to run it. Behind this commercial -- which is  scheduled to be filmed this week in Vancouver -- are two Canadian documentary  film makers who are also environmental activists. They say they are fed up with  the ads on commercial TV. And they have decided to take on not only North  America's major TV networks -- but advertisers, too.  </P> <P> "We're going to redefine the advertising industry," said Kalle Lasn, co-founder  of the Media Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Vancouver that says  commercials on television should sell fewer products and more progressive  ideas.  </P> <P> At the very least, the organization says, if huge paper companies can run ads  about how many millions of trees they are growing, there should also be room  for groups like theirs to purchase air time on network TV about the sensitive  ecological environments that these same paper companies are destroying.  </P> <P> "Our point is to break the trance that people get into when they are watching  TV," said Lasn, 47, a documentary film maker who at one time worked as a  researcher for an advertising agency in Japan, compiling research for such  clients as Coca-Cola and General Foods. "We're all consuming like crazy people  during a time of ecological crisis. We will offer anti-consumption messages in  the middle of all those other messages that keep telling people to buy things."  </P> <P> How to pay for the production and air time of these "alternative" TV ads? Well,  last month the group printed its first issue of a quarterly magazine that it  has appropriately named Adbusters. It hopes to get enough subscribers -- and  contributors -- to fund a number of anti-consumption ads. In the meantime,  Adbusters has received some financial backing from several environmental  groups, including the Sierra Club and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee.  </P> <P> "I never saw the film 'Ghostbusters,' " admitted Bill Schmalz, the co-publisher  of Adbusters who thought up its name. "But I think the name is quite catchy."  Schmalz, 49, has never worked for an ad agency, but has filmed several short  movies that focus on the outdoors.  </P> <P> The first issue of Adbusters, which was printed last month, includes articles  on subliminal advertising, how advertisers attract the attention of children  and even an article on how to make and air your own TV commercial for under  $2,000.  </P> <P> The organization does have some support from American advertising experts. Two  mid-level West Coast advertising executives -- who have asked not to be named  -- are quietly acting as consultants. And George Gerbner, dean emeritus at  Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has also  spoken out for Adbusters.  </P> <P> "The networks discourage anything but mainstream advertising, and that is too  limiting," said Gerbner. "There is a long history of the networks refusing to  accept certain ads because they are afraid it could cost them their major  advertisers."  </P> <P> Perhaps nothing better symbolizes the types of advertising that Adbusters  supports than a print ad that appears on the inside of the front cover of its  first issue. The "ad" is a parody of a former Winston cigarette campaign. In  it, an attractive woman is holding a pack of cigarettes while she stands in the  sort of natural setting typical of tobacco advertising.  </P> <P> But the headline on the ad is a shocker: "If it wasn't for cigarettes, I  wouldn't have cancer." The ad was included in a book of parody ads called "A  Tale of Advertising in America," published in 1976 by Terry Shukle, an Ann  Arbor, Mich.-based free-lance photographer.  </P> <P> "The trick is to create an ad that is humorous enough to attract attention but  that doesn't offend the very people you're trying to reach," said Shukle. "But  I wonder if people can handle ads like this. There seems to be so many  restrictions these days, that if you stick your nose out, you're liable to get  it whacked."  </P> <P> Indeed, Adbusters has already had its nose whacked by the Canadian Broadcasting  Network, which has rejected the "Tubehead" ad based on rough illustrations that  it was sent. But Canada's second largest network, Canadian Television Network,  has agreed to run it.  </P> <P> Soon, Adbusters will be trying to get the ad aired on the major TV stations in  Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. But the prospects look dim. Executives at  the three major networks say the ad sounds too controversial for them.  </P> <P> "Showing that ad would be like shooting ourselves in the foot," said Harvey  Dzodin, vice president of commercial clearance at ABC television in New York.  "Make that, shooting ourselves in the tube."  </P> <P> Dzodin said that ABC doesn't accept any "issue" ads. He said the network  believes that such issues should only be covered in news programs or talk  shows. "Maybe they should call Sam Donaldson and see if they can get on his  show," said Dzodin.  </P> <P> "Let me ask you this," posed Rick Gitter, vice president of advertising  standards at NBC, which wouldn't accept the ad. "Would the Los Angeles Times  run an ad that suggested people use your newspaper for kindling?"  </P> <P> Although an executive at CBS declined to specifically comment on the "Tubehead"  ad, he said CBS does have a policy about those ads it won't accept. "We would  not broadcast a commercial that denigrated television," said Matthew Margo,  vice president of program practices at CBS. "We also don't broadcast  commercials that take controversial positions on important topics. If we did,  companies with the finances at hand could control the national agenda."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the folks at Adbusters say that's a lot of bunk.  </P> <P> "The networks have been using that argument for years," said Lasn. "The people  with the money are controlling the national agenda right now. We think we can  counteract them with this $5,000 ad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arco's New Product Fuels Big Ad Purchase  </P> <P> While Arco may be helping to clear the air with a less polluting gasoline, it  is also about to flood the air with plenty of ads promoting it.  </P> <P> In fact, Arco has made one of the largest media buys in Southern California  history. And during the month of September it will spend nearly $5 million to  air four TV advertisements -- and another $2 million on various radio and print  ads.  </P> <P> These ads will promote Arco's new unleaded gasoline, called EC-1, which will  replace leaded gasoline at its Southern California stations on Sept. 1. The new  gasoline, for pre-1975 cars and pre-1980 trucks, would eliminate 20% of  emissions if all vehicles without catalytic converters in the area switched  from leaded gas, according to Arco.  </P> <P> During the month of September, the average TV viewer in Southern California  will see the Arco commercials "between 60 and 70 times," estimates Robert  Kresser, chairman of the Los Angeles ad agency that created the commercials,  Kresser/Craig. He said 99.9% of the Southland's TV viewers will see the ads,  which all feature actor James Earl Jones as narrator.  </P> <P> But will viewers be turned off by the flood of Arco ads? "I hope not," said  Kresser. "That's why we made four of them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clippers Give Up Seats for Perimeter Ad Space  </P> <P> Last winter, the folks at Great Western Bank saw to it that the Los Angeles  Lakers stopped playing basketball at the Forum and started playing at the newly  named Great Western Forum.  </P> <P> Now, the Clippers are about to cash in too. No, the Great Western Sports Arena  is not in the offing. But the Clippers have given up an undetermined number of  court-side seats for the sake of advertising.  </P> <P> Adtime, a company based in Spain that sells modular ad displays at stadiums  throughout Europe, has struck a deal with the Clippers to sell ad space around  the court's perimeter. The ads will appear on sheets of rotating plastic vinyl,  and advertisers will pay only for the time that their ads are in the eye of the  television cameras.  </P> <P> "It's very clean signage," insisted Andy Roeser, executive vice president of  the Los Angeles Clippers. "It won't in any way reduce your ability to watch the  game."  </P> <P> An executive from the U.S. marketing arm of Adtime said the Lakers weren't  interested in the signs. It apparently would have required the elimination of  some court-side seats at the Forum. "They can sell those seats for $300  apiece," said Tom Valdiserri, senior account executive at Chicago-based Frankel  &amp; Co. "It wouldn't make sense. What are they going to do, relocate Jack  Nicholson for an ad?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shoe Firm Gears Up for Large Campaign  </P> <P> L.A. Gear has put its advertising budget in gear.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles footwear company says it plans to double its annual ad budget  in 1990 to $50 million. What's more, L.A. Gear ads will appear on national  network TV next year for the first time ever, said Sandy Saemann, the company's  senior vice president. Although the ads are created in-house, Vitt Media, a  large media buying company, has been hired to purchase the media time.  </P> <P> But L.A. Gear may have been caught a bit off balance in the lucrative  back-to-school season. The company has created just one new commercial for the  period -- an ad promoting its "Brats" line of women's shoes. It will also  continue to air an award-winning, year-old ad that features former Lakers  center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar meeting a fan in the locker room.  </P></p>

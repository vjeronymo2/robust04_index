			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / US-EC tariff talks grind to halt TALKS between the US and the European Community on lowering tariffs for industrial goods have ground to a halt, and no further negotiations are planned before next Tuesday's meeting of senior trade diplomats in the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks. Earlier this month, the two sides agreed to work for a tariff deal by January 15 that could pave the way for an early overall Uruguay round accord. But 'the ingredients for a deal aren't there', an EC official said yesterday. The future of the six-year-old round, already more than two years behind schedule, now depends on the attitude of the Clinton administration, which takes over on January 20. Trade officials in Geneva say that, until a new trade team is up and running in Washington, the negotiations cannot move forward on any of the important issues outstanding. Both sides are blaming each other for the lack of progress in the tariff talks which foundered on the trade-off between cuts in high US duties on textiles and the reduction or elimination of EC tariffs in a broad range of sectors including non-ferrous metals, wood and electronics. Community officials said yesterday the US had still not made a detailed offer on textiles. American negotiators say the EC tariff offer contains 'very significant gaps in coverage'. Despite the stand-off over tariffs, negotiators in the 108-nation round yesterday continued to try to whittle down obstacles to a Uruguay round agreement on fair trade rules before Tuesday's meeting. Officials said several ad hoc technical groups had been set up on specific areas of disagreement. These include changes to the draft rules package being pressed by the US concerning environmental and consumer standards for food and other products, and stronger protection for pharmaceutical patents and the US entertainment industry.</p>

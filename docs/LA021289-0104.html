			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY BACKS MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM; NO RULING YET ON '56 REVOLT  </P> <P> Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said Saturday that the party's leadership  has endorsed a multi-party system but will continue to reassess a key chapter  in Hungary's history -- the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.  </P> <P> The Central Committee, split between hard-liners and reformers, ended a special  two-day session aimed primarily at assessing the emotionally and politically  significant revolt.  </P> <P> Grosz, who has said previously that a multi-party system in Hungary is likely  next year, told Hungarian Radio that "the party has taken a stand that it  accepts, takes note of and endorses a multi-party system."  </P> <P> But the length and secrecy of the meeting indicated that the party was split  over plans to share power with other parties, as well as over a host of other  reforms.  </P> <P> Fifteen of the alternative political movements founded in recent months  announced Monday that they will not enter a coalition government with the  Communists, as some Communist Party reformers desire, unless the party revises  its view of 1956.  </P> <P> Earlier, party spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian Radio that the "various  platforms" within the 108-member Central Committee "sought unity on the  fundamental issues," indicating a split.  </P> <P> The Central Committee meeting was called after Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay  shocked Hungarians in January by terming the 1956 revolt a "popular uprising."  It had been referred to for more than three decades as a counterrevolution.  </P> <P> The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary.  About 20,000 Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell the uprising on Nov. 4 and  replaced the government.  </P> <P> When he referred to the revolt as a popular uprising on Jan. 28, Pozsgay said  his reassessment was based on the report of a party commission investigating  four decades of communist rule in Hungary.  </P> <P> The report has not been published, but Grosz said it will be. He also said  Pozsgay's comments were "too hasty."  </P></p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (25): Markets and the message RELATIONSHIP MARKETING by Regis McKenna Century Business Pounds 20, 241 pages REGIS McKENNA is a leprechaun among California-based management gurus. Spritely but not mischievous, his writing has an iconoclastic quality that never descends into the dull, prescriptive grooves that deaden so many management texts. Relationship Marketing, however, is a management text but disguised as a series of anecdotes about Silicon Valley and the growth of the personal computer business. Much of it is about Apple Computer, for which McKenna has worked as a consultant. He was involved in the launch of the revolutionary Apple Macintosh personal computer which introduced windows, icons and mice to the world. The burden of his argument - that successful marketing depends on building enduring relationships with customers - is finding ready acceptance in the computer business and in other fast changing industries where a company's position in the market place can change overnight. 'Standard approaches to positioning don't work in the new customer-centered environment of the 1990s,' McKenna writes. 'A company that is Number 1 today has no guarantee of being Number 1 tomorrow. New technologies can turn a seemingly solid position into a fragile one almost overnight. No amount of advertising can prevent that from happening'. McKenna is hard on advertising, which he argues serves no useful purpose and is becoming obsolescent. The proliferation of advertising messages has already resulted in overkill where consumers are unable to distinguish one product from another - 40 per cent of those asked identified EverReady's ever-marching rabbit as an advert for Duracell. 'The new marketing requires a feed-back loop', Mckenna argues. 'It is this element that is missing from the monologue of advertising but that is built into the dialogue of marketing. The feedback loop, connecting company and customer, is central to the operating definition of a truly market-driven company: a company that adapts in a timely way to the changing needs of the customer.' Apple is McKenna's model. The Macintosh, at its birth, was innovative but underpowered and inflexible (and had a black and white screen). But it was easy to use and had a user group prepared to advise the manufacturer on improvements: 'It was this feedback loop that brought about change in the Mac, which ultimately became an open, adaptable and colourful computer. And it was changing the Mac that saved it.' Relationship Marketing is also a plea for the enlightened use of IT to facilitate dialogue between customer and vendor. In particular McKenna sees great potential in 'experiential marketing' or 'try before you buy'. McKenna concludes by arguing that in the next century the marketing and sales professions will be held in the same esteem as the science and engineering professions today. It is hard to understand why that should have much appeal in the UK. Perhaps things are different in California.</p>

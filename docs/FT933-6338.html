			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Heineken's bottle recall reaches parts of the Canary Islands HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewer, yesterday added the Canary Islands to a list of eight export markets where it is recalling beer bottles, but it removed Prince Edward Island in Canada, saying the suspect bottles had not been shipped to Canada. The brewer announced on Thursday night that it was recalling more than 3m of its famous green beer bottles from a small number of export markets, including Britain, because of fears that a fault in the neck of the bottles could cause small glass chips to fall into the beer. Other affected countries are Austria, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel and Sweden. Heineken, which exports to 150 countries, said the 3m bottles were part of a 17m batch of potentially flawed 33cl bottles produced by Dutch bottle maker Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, majority-owned by the French food group BSN. Most of the 17m bottles were stopped before they left the brewery or reached export markets, but Heineken wants the return of 3m bottles, some of which may have already been bought by customers. Bottles shipped to other markets, including the US, where Heineken is the leading imported beer and is sold in 35cl bottles, were not affected. The Dutch brewer said it held the bottle maker responsible for the problem and would seek damages to cover the costs of the recall operation. A Heineken spokeswoman said the extent of the damages claim was not yet known: 'Our priority now is warning consumers in the countries to which the beer was shipped.' Heineken said tests showed that the problem of glass slivers could arise in roughly 1 per cent of the bottles produced in the batch of 17m bottles over the past two weeks. If glass slivers were ingested, only 1 to 2 per cent of beer drinkers would develop stomach problems, Heineken said, basing its estimate on medical advice which it had received. Heineken's shares dropped by 3 per cent when trading began in Amsterdam yesterday but closed slightly higher.</p>

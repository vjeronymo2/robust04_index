			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Industrial production falls 5.1 per cent in Italy Italy's industrial production fell 5.1 per cent during February compared with the same month in 1992, writes Robert Graham. Figures released yesterday by Istat, the national statistics institute, showed production fell 7.7 per cent during the first two months of 1993 against the same period last year when there were two extra working days. The worst affected sectors continued to be engineering and transport, followed by textiles and clothing. The only area where production did not decline was foodstuffs. Despite lower production, Confindustria, the industrialists' association, believes the first modest signs of an export-led recovery are beginning to appear.</p>

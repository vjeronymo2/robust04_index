			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOLITARY SUCCESS;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT CARSON YOUTH HONORED FOR HARD WORK, GOOD DEEDS  </P> <P> Randy Leiker is busy.  </P> <P> He's on the phone, trying to arrange his schedule to squeeze in two meetings  that fall at the same time on the same day.  </P> <P> This is not unusual for him; at age 18, Randy Leiker has been juggling  responsibilities for years.  </P> <P> A senior at Banning High School in Wilmington, Leiker maintains a 3.5 grade  average. Last year he was co-editor of the Banning newspaper. This year he puts  his energies into a peer counseling program that he helped establish at  Banning. The peer counselors -- Leiker is one of 14 -- guide other young people  who are having trouble in school. And in a separate program, he also counsels  students who are college bound.  </P> <P> He has done all of this while living on his own, supporting himself by working  after school as a sales representative at the Target store in Carson.  </P> <P> And he has done so in obscurity until recently, when he was brought to the  attention of the Horatio Alger Assn., a national nonprofit group that honors  those who have achieved success through hard work.  </P> <P> This year, the association selected Banning High School as one of 30 schools  across the country whose students would be eligible to compete for a $5,000  college scholarship. Leiker won. He was honored at an awards ceremony last  month. He plans to go to Cal State San Diego in the fall.  </P> <P> "He is a perfect example of a young kid who said if anybody's going to do it,  I'm going to have to do it myself," said Banning Principal Augustine Herrera  Jr.  </P> <P> Said Patricia Brown, director of Educational Development for the Horatio Alger  Assn.: "We're looking for someone who's overcome adversity in life."  </P> <P> Leiker himself is far more matter-of-fact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learning to Cope  </P> <P> "I've gotten used to my situation," he said Thursday at Banning's college  counseling center. He adds that no matter how serious the problem -- whether  it's a grade on an English test or being on your own at age 16 -- "90% of the  battle is just coping with your situation."  </P> <P> Leiker's situation is this: His father and mother split up when he was a baby.  Neither could care for him. For the first 10 years of his life, he lived in  various places, moving from Southern California to Texas to Tennessee to  Mexico, living with various friends and relatives, including a grandmother he  admires greatly.  </P> <P> Then, when he was 10, his mother took custody of him and moved to Carson. Six  years later, she and her husband moved to the Palmdale area.  </P> <P> Randy told them he would not go. He had only two more years of high school, and  for the first time in his life, he had stayed in one place long enough to make  some friends. He told his mother and stepfather he would fight them in court  rather than move.  </P> <P> "My mother, at first, she was opposed to it, really opposed to it. But I told  her that I had spent most of my life on my own anyway . . . By 10 years old, I  could cook for myself. I knew how to clean and I could iron."  </P> <P> Leiker lived with an uncle for a time, then shared an apartment in Long Beach.  Last week he moved back to Carson, where he boards at the home of some friends.  </P> <P> Those who know Leiker agree that his maturity is startling, that he hungers for  success and that he is adept at mediating disputes and helping others solve  their problems. He exudes an inner peace, a sense of calm that many adults  never achieve.  </P> <P> He attributes this in part to his grandmother, who taught him to "think things  through in a calm, rational manner." He also credits the National Conference of  Christians and Jews, whose workshops he attended at youth leadership camp. He  spent time discovering who he is and what he believes.  </P> <P> He says he finds it difficult to trust people and is not big on showing  emotion. Part of him says he should work harder at developing ties to his  family, and yet he hasn't done it. Sometimes, he said, he is "sarcastic to the  point where it makes you want to get rid of me." He acknowledges that he has  demonstrated the qualities valued by the Horatio Alger Assn. -- "not by choice,  but by circumstance."  </P> <P> He describes himself as a conservative person with liberal beliefs. He thinks  the creation story is myth. "I believe in the idea of gaseous matter being  condensed by starlight." But he does believe in God. "I figure that somebody  had to start this whole process." A Catholic, he says he finds the church  oppressive, yet he wears a gold cross around his neck.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nickname: 'Mastermind'  </P> <P> "Randy is remarkably mature and insightful about life itself," said Glen  Poling, programs director for the local branch of the Conference of Christians  and Jews. "For some reason, Randy seems like he's an older person in a young  person's body."  </P> <P> Said Banning's dean of students, Barbara Evans, who established the peer  counseling program with Leiker: ". . .I gave him the nickname 'Mastermind.' He  hated that nickname, but I think more and more he thinks about it, and it has  made an impression on his life. He has accepted more and more the fact that he  is a mastermind."  </P> <P> For a teen-ager, however, this can be a heavy burden to bear.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids do feel intimidated by him," says Leiker's girlfriend, Ana  Hernandez, also a Banning senior. "He's gotten used to that. He's a very mature  person, and kids do look up to him."  </P> <P> Hernandez credits Leiker with encouraging her to apply to college -- she will  attend Cal State Long Beach in the fall -- even when her own parents were  pressing her to stay home and get a job. She said she knows that Leiker has had  a difficult life and she wishes he would spend as much time on himself as he  does on others.  </P> <P> Leiker, meanwhile, seems not to want to dwell on his past. He said he has  survived "by not thinking of everything at once. I just try to deal with one  thing at a time."  </P></p>

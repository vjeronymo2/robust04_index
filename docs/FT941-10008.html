			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Journo-porn misses story If the succession of British political scandals bewilders you and perhaps makes you nauseous, clutch two simple handrails. One: no general election need be held before April 1997. The Conservatives may have overstayed their welcome, but they are not about to depart. Two: as in the US, political discourse has become muddied by an obsession with private behaviour. The word 'morality', which should mean an awareness of the difference between right and wrong in all spheres of life, is treated as if it applies only to the realm of the senses. Let us take these statements in reverse order. Senses first. Look around. In developed democracies the sale of titillation is more than merely a by-product of prosperity. It is of the essence in a free-market, individualistic, open society in which religious observance has declined and traditional social structures have begun to wither away. Life is longer than ever. There is not always enough to do. Time is filled by contemplating a bewilderingly copious selection of temptations. The growing mountain of goods and services must be sold retail, a task that is most easily accomplished by appealing to the supposed desires, or the easily stimulated imaginations, of jaded consumers. We need not linger long over the endless list of examples. Just let us say Haagen-Dasz ice-cream, fast cars graced by fast women, holidays for romance, Jaffas for warm sunshine. Those should suffice. There is, however, one significant and relatively recent addition, comprising an entire category of products. Entertainment, which is a highly profitable sub-sector of the increasingly dominant information industry, constantly massages our subconscious minds with images that Freud would not have had the audacity to conceive, and Kraft-Ebing might not have believed. We see the results on film, in videos and on TV. We may wring our hands, but we keep our eyes and ears wide open. We await with nervous eagerness the advent of unified electronic devices, virtual reality, armchair shopping, love on a microchip. We cannot be surprised if in such circumstances a section of the media has replicated the Roman circus, with real victims. On both sides of the Atlantic, writers and broadcasters manufacture and peddle cruel and salacious gossip about individual politicians. Some of it is even true. Relevant or not, it is the stuff of commerce, at least in Britain and the US. The precise configuration varies, but titillation is a hot seller everywhere in the west. In most continental European countries tittle-tattle about government ministers may not sell as well as stories about stars of sport or showbusiness. French or German late-night TV amazes British visitors who are unprepared for it. In the US the trade in political gossip has changed, for the worse. Nothing was said in public about President John Kennedy's behaviour during his lifetime; today everything is surmised about President Bill Clinton's private life. Perhaps it has something to do with feminism. In Britain the victims of journo-porn are well-known: Diana, Charles, Parkinson, Mellor, Caithness, Norris, Milligan. Each is a special case. For every name there is a self-interested, puffed-up 'justification'. What all have in common is that someone's reputation has become the stuff of a lucrative trade. Maligning it has sold newspapers, enlarged TV audiences. The peculiarly British elements of this traffic in tortured souls need not detain us. The point is that none of it should have anything to do with politics. Links between private behaviour and public competence or acceptability are indeed made, often by a gullible public, but that is everyone's loss. Things that really matter are subjected to an excess of reticence, not its absence. This week the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler has appeared before the Scott inquiry into the sale of armament-manufacturing equipment to Iraq. One question before Lord Justice Scott is whether ministers misled Parliament about the sales; another challenges the issuance by ministers of 'public interest immunity certificates'. To use Sir Robin's definition, these 'put in the hands of the court the decision whether the information covered by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence'. Withholding the information might have led to the unjust imprisonment of the defendants in the Matrix Churchill trial. The straightforward approach would be to confess that there has been hocus-pocus, and to defend it on the ground that selling arms is not a business that would be successful if managed by nuns. Sir Robin issued a statement castigating the press for what he believed to be wild allegations based on what has been said at the inquiry; in particular to the depiction of immunity certificates as 'gagging orders'. What would you call them? So far as can be told, Sir Robin is a decent official. He is, however, running a system whose decency is no longer self-evident. As I understand it, he is a proponent of the civil service doctrine that, where needs dictate, only part of the truth about a particular matter need be told. This thesis is not new. It long predates the present cabinet secretary. British officials are not only economical with the truth; they are positively parsimonious. They rarely lie, perhaps never. Instead, most of them instinctively avoid complete candour. Lord Justice Scott has been invited to tell us whether in the Matrix Churchill case they played this ancient game according to its indefinable rules. With luck, he will tell us whether the game should be played at all. His report could have more effect on the Conservatives' fortunes than the latest surge of scandal-mongering. Comparisons are made with the last days of Harold Macmillan's government, when the Conservatives were rotting on the vine. The principal victim was John Profumo, who lied to the House of Commons. He resigned in June 1963; the election followed in October 1964. Labour won, by a whisker. If history repeated itself in, say, June or July 1995, the Tories would probably lose. Barring a rush of blood to the prime minister's head, or an unprecedented rash of by-elections resulting in the loss of the government's majority, there is little chance of a contest before 1996. This week's character assassination should mean nothing now; it will certainly mean nothing then.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The National Police Agency  (NPA) placed all policemen nationwide on indefinite alert Monday  and adopted an emergency footing in connection with the  uneasiness over the North Korean nuclear issue.    In a cable message addressed to all police throughout the  country, the NPA instructed them to go on an emergency footing  as "North Korea's provocation threat has become higher than at  any other time before with the imminent U.N. sanctions against  North Korea and heightening tensions between South and North  Korea."    The police immediately began tightening all national  checkpoints as well as air and sea ports to guard against  infiltration by "impure elements" such as spies. At the same  time, they have established tripartite cooperative operations  involving civilians, the military and police while heightening  vigilance at major government facilities and buildings and  foreign diplomatic missions, including the U.S. Embassy.    At the same time, the police placed their five-minute  stand-by and mobile troops on alert for action at any time and  reinforced protection for important national figures.  *</p>

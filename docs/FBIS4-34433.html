			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Chiapas  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, upon assuming responsibility for  the peace process, today called upon the armed group in this  southeastern Mexican state to resume the dialogue. It is  "imperative" the negotiations resume. No one should pass up a  new peace opportunity because otherwise the war will be long and  painful," Lopez Moreno said in an appeal to the armed group,  which made its emergence last 1 January in Chiapas.    On Thursday, the governor was appointed by President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari as the new person in charge of the peace  efforts, hours after Manuel Camacho Solis resigned as the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. "The doors  are open to dialogue.... the solution exists among us," Lopez  Moreno stated in this capital, located 1,050 km southeast of  Mexico City, in an appeal to the Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN].    On Sunday, the armed group called Camacho Solis' response,  made during the nine-day dialogue that ended 1 March in San  Cristobal de las Casas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City, to  their demands as insufficient. The San Cristobal dialogue,  which occurred under a virtual truce that began 12 January when  Salinas de Gortari ordered a unilateral cease-fire, has ended,  the group said, reiterating that it maintains the desire to seek  a peaceful solution to the conflict.    The armed group, which launched the movement to obtain  justice for the Chiapas Indians, "has unquestionable social  roots," Lopez Moreno said in his first statements as the new  director of the peace efforts. The governor invited San  Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who served as a liaison in the  past dialogue, to resume his task and said that "his experience  and his moral integrity are indispensable in this new stage."    Lopez Moreno read the text of the statement before Hector  Hernandez Llamas, the executive spokesman for the peace efforts  in Chiapas, who was instructed on Friday by President Salinas to  work closely with the governor in this endeavor.    Camacho Solis resigned on Friday alleging that purported  criticism by Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party, was "a sort of criticism" of  his work, which was later denied by the candidate.</p>

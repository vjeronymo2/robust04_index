			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / US, N Korea 'progress' on nuclear arms The US and North Korea are reported to have made substantial progress in negotiations to defuse tension over the latter's nuclear weapons programme. Reflecting a sense of guarded optimism evident in Washington, a State Department spokesman said the US had 'moved closer' to achieving its goal of opening the North's nuclear facilities to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. He added that progress had also been made on the question of promoting a dialogue between the two Koreas on nuclear matters. The North Korean state news agency quoted a foreign ministry official in Pyongyang as having said the facilities would be made available for limited inspection shortly, with full access under negotiation. The official, who called fruit of the latest negotiations a 'breakthrough', also said the US was willing to end its annual joint military exercises with South Korea, known as Team Spirit, as the North has long demanded, and to improve diplomatic relations. The US has been seeking a resolution on several diplomatic fronts, including the most recent round of negotiations at the United Nations in New York and through the intercession of other Asian nations, including China and Russia, which were once North Korea's principal patrons. Concern has risen most recently in the wake of a leaked US Central Intelligence Agency report believed to have concluded that the North may already have built one or two nuclear bombs. White House and State Department officials have refused to confirm or deny this report. This week, a senior member of the administration said: 'The basic fact is that we don't know for sure' whether North Korea had built a bomb or had the ability to deliver it. In their diplomacy, US officials have resolutely refused to call the North Korean issue a 'crisis', while conceding it is 'urgent'. This has prompted some criticism in Washington by those who believe the US should be taking a firmer line with the North.</p>

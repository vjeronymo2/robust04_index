			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>   [Text] Militerm Technologies, an Israeli firm representing  the Russian firm Sub-Inform-Sputnik, received from the latter  air photographs taken by Russian satellites. There are no  restrictions on the photographs which were obtained for a  relatively low price. The up-to-date and high-resolution  photographs were taken by intelligence satellites used by  Russia, mainly for military purposes.    To promote sales, Militerm Technologies received from the  Russians photographs of targets in Arab countries such as Iran,  Iraq, Kuwait, etc. As far as is known, the Russian firm also  owns similar photographs of locations in Israel and is in  contact with Arab elements.    The Russian firm sells photographs taken by two types of  satellites outfitted with high-resolution analog cameras: one  satellite has a TK-350 topographic camera with a resolution of  10 meters and a maximum range of 200 x 300 km. The second  satellite is equipped with a precision KVR-1000 camera which  takes photographs with a resolution of only 2 meters and has a  range of 40 x 40 km.    The price tag for a photograph ranges from $1,250 for a  printed photograph to $10,000 for a negative of a higher quality  three- dimensional air photograph. Enclosed with the  photographs are full information about the date the photograph  was taken and the cloud cover over the area at the time.    It should be noted that the KVR-1000 satellite can take  target photographs with a resolution of 25 centimeters, which is  the precision required by military intelligence satellites.  However, the Russians decided to downgrade the quality of the  photographs for sale in the open market, and are at this point  selling photographs with a resolution of 2 meters. Photography  experts argue that this level of resolution enables excellent  identification of military targets and locations. Militerm  Technologies believes that within a few months it will be able  to sell photographs with a resolution better than 2 meters.</p>

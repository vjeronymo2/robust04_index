			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: WAYNE WILLIAMSON;  </P> <P> SELLING TO A GROWING MARKET;  </P> <P> HISPANIC AND BLACK BUSINESSMEN TARGET ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> After 5 sleepy years, the Black Business Alliance of Orange County has come  alive, increasing membership from a stagnant 50 to nearly 225, and completing  the county's first private business incubator for black small business, the  Center for Business Excellence in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The center is a privately funded 2-story, 3,300-square-foot office complex in  Santa Ana where small businesses can rent office space and share a central  reception area, conference room, meeting room, kitchenette and off-street  parking. Rents range from $195 to $525 monthly.  </P> <P> Wayne Williamson, a 45-year-old commercial real estate specialist, heads up the  changing organization. While other minority business communities are able to  grow as Orange County's minority population grows, the black business community  has no such luxury.  </P> <P> As Williamson points out, "There's no real 'black business' to go after or  target in Orange County." His organization is dedicated to helping its members  reach the mainstream, because they have no alternative if they are going to  thrive here.  </P> <P> Williamson has a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Southern  California. He recently discussed small business and minority business trends  with Times staff writer Maria L. La Ganga.  </P> <P> Q. The Black Business Alliance of Orange County has been around for about 5  years, but it has taken until 1989 for the group to really accomplish much.  Why?  </P> <P> Williamson: It's been, not really dormant, just service-oriented at a different  level. Until now, it involved itself in different community activities, a lot  of programs geared toward making it easier for a minority business person to  get started. Workshops, seminars. We still do a lot of that.  </P> <P> Q. The organization just opened its Center for Business Excellence. What was  the thinking behind that?  </P> <P> A. After a million workshops and seminars and meetings, I guess it was  discovered that there were two basic things that interfered with a lot of  minority businesses getting into the mainstream. One was housing. A lot of  minority businesses had problems getting adequate housing for their businesses.  I guess this is when this concept came together.  </P> <P> Q. When did you start raising money to open this center?  </P> <P> A. Probably back in September, through January. Surprisingly, we raised close  to $250,000 from our membership solely. That's an average of $1,000 apiece. We  found out that there are a lot of black business people out here that are  really doing very well and are just quietly hidden away in the woodwork all  over the county.  </P> <P> Q. What are you offering in your new center that black businesses can't get  elsewhere?  </P> <P> A. A camaraderie that can't be found somewhere else. Basically, the center is  for those who are now working in their garages, out of post office boxes, out  of their briefcases, out of cars. It's a step up on the way to getting into a  real professional office environment.  </P> <P> Q. The center has been around for about a month, but it's only one-third full.  Why have you filled only 10 of the 30 office spaces you have to offer?  </P> <P> A. For any small business person getting started, this is a big transition to  step into an environment where you really need to make more of a commitment to  being there, to paying rent. So we're seeing some reluctance at first. For  someone who's working out of a briefcase and doing OK, it's a great big step to  go to your own office.  </P> <P> Q. What businesses have moved into the center so far?  </P> <P> A. Engineering firms, management consulting firms, a janitorial service, a ham  operator's school, we've got a secretarial service and the Tri-County Bulletin,  which is the only black newspaper servicing the Orange County area. There are  10 who have signed leases and about 10 or 12 that have put down deposits. We  should be filled up in about a month.  </P> <P> Q. One of the problems most small businesses have is financing at the  beginning. What is your organization doing to address that issue?  </P> <P> A. That's the second major problem we found, after getting adequate housing for  a business. We are definitely going to provide funding and financing. We've  been so successful with raising the funds for our facility here that right now  it looks like we might be able to do (it) through the membership. Some of the  businesses are a little bit more profitable. We'd try pooling funds.  </P> <P> Q. Like Korean kyes, the fund pools whereby all the members put in, say, $1,000  a month, and each member gets to take it out once and invest it in his  business?  </P> <P> A. Well, not exactly that but something similar. Maybe not taking turns taking  it out, probably just making it available to those who need it most. Those with  ideas and business plans and desire but no ability to get the funds from a  regular institution. There's not enough money to go around. Qualifying is a  problem for a lot of entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Q. Is there a black owned-and-operated bank in Orange County?  </P> <P> A. No. There is no black bank here. There is in L.A. But there will be a black  bank in Orange County. We're working on it right now. We're looking at sometime  in 1990. But then, you don't really have a black anything in Orange County. You  don't have a black residential neighborhood, a black business district, there's  no black anything.  </P> <P> Q. What is Orange County like for a minority business to do business in?  </P> <P> A. I don't know about a minority business per se. Orange County is great for  businesses in general and most of the businesses that are here are thriving and  doing real well. I really haven't found a great big difference between  so-called minority business and any other small business. We just happen to be  black, geared toward black minority businesses. I'm sure that the problems are  the same with any minority business.  </P> <P> Q. Do minority businesses find that they do best when they operate in an area  where there is a large foundation of the population or special interest group  which they represent?  </P> <P> A. No, not necessarily. Not unless they cater to that group of people. With any  business, you want to have your target market and you want to work it. And it  may be the same ethnic group, or it may be a market that's very, very  different. In Orange County, it's pretty hard to target a black group. Where  are they? I haven't found them.  </P> <P> Q. Orange County's black population in recent years has been dropping. In 1980,  it was 1.3% of the county. In 1985 it was down to 1%. Does that make it more  difficult to do business here?  </P> <P> A. No, but it makes it different from the way other minority business  communities do business. That 1% is pretty scattered. It's not like the black  community you'd find in other cities in the United States. You can't be geared  toward doing business with other blacks. You've got to deal with the open  market. You have to be out there in the mainstream, which is pretty much what  all small businesses are doing. You've got a large Hispanic population here, so  I imagine that a lot of them are just working with Hispanics. With almost  anybody else, especially in Santa Ana or anywhere near it, you have to deal  with whoever is out there. And I guess that's what's going on with us.  </P> <P> Q. Is there any specific line of business that a majority of your members are  in? Manufacturing, service industries?  </P> <P> A. No. We do whatever you could do to make money. We've got a lot of black  entrepreneurs who transferred into Orange County with Xerox or Hughes or TRW  and are setting up their own engineering and computer firms. A lot of that is  going on right now. They're in a market where they've always dealt with the  mainstream in their corporate employment. Now they're making a change. In the  past, it was basically black-oriented businesses. There were a lot of barber  shops, beauty salons, black restaurants. That's gone. Now you've got  professionals.  </P> <P> Q. Is that where most of the Black Business Alliance's growth is coming from?  </P> <P> A. Yes. They transferred in and they like Orange County. They don't like  climbing the corporate ladder, and they want to do their own thing their own  way. Santa Ana is really booming and really fruitful. This is a great place to  get started with a new business.  </P> <P> Q. What's the best thing about being a black business owner in Orange County?  </P> <P> A. There's opportunity in Orange County that I don't believe you'd find too  many other places, just with the general economy doing as well as it is.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Borisov: "Only 5 Percent in Stock"] </F>   [Text] The withdrawal of the Baltic Fleet from Latvia and  Estonia continues. According to Admiral Yegorov, commander of  the Baltic Fleet, 95 percent of the military hardware had been  withdrawn as of mid-March.    The Baltic Fleet commander clarified that military hardware  from Liepai will be withdrawn by 1 May of this year. Similar  work is being carried out in Tallinn where the remaining  artillery ammunition in the depots is outdated. However, the  situation becomes more complicated because Tallinn harbor is  covered with ice and shipments must be carried out by railroad.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAMB'S SWEETENED 'CAROL' GOES WITH DINNER  </P> <P> The least memorable part of "Dickens, Dining &amp; Song," the newest Lamb's  Players Theatre Christmas offering, is, alas, the Dickens.  </P> <P> In part, that criticism is a tribute to the dining and song -- both of which  are very fine indeed, thanks to an impressive chef, Paul Vida, and the six  spirited and sweet-voiced madrigal singers who serenade the diners throughout  the three-hour event.  </P> <P> But it also reflects the skimpy 50-minute adaptation of "A Christmas Carol,"  which is thrown in like a dessert after a 90-minute dinner of awesome roast  beef and turkey in the Great Hall of St. Paul's Cathedral at 5th and Nutmeg.  </P> <P> Lamb's resident playwright, Kerry Meads, originally adapted the timeless story  for four actors to tour schools and churches. The result is more impressive for  its cleverness in condensing the story than it is for sending home the heart of  Dickens' tale about a man desperately in need of reclamation and how the  characters in the poverty-stricken world around him may live or die on the  basis of the changes he does or does not make.  </P> <P> Paul Maley plays Ebenezer Scrooge and Sharon Maley (Maley's real-life wife),  Eric Briner and Lori Merril play the other roles. But many of the most  emotionally wrenching parts are left to the imagination: the Ghosts of  Christmas Past, Present and Future who come to haunt Ebenezer; Jacob Marley,  come back from the dead to warn his old friend of the doom that awaits him if  he doesn't change his stingy ways; frail, innocent Tiny Tim perched on the  shoulders of his father, Ebenezer's poor clerk, Bob Cratchit.  </P> <P> This has the unmistakable sense of a show played more for children than adults.  Not only are the frightening ghosts gone, but the iciness at the heart of old  Scrooge is softened into eccentric grumpiness. Bob Cratchit and his family  don't really seem to be starving. This is a comfortable looking company that  tells the story with fine, dramatic expression, but they don't make you feel  the want, the pain and, most importantly, the stakes involved in the  alterations Scrooge needs to make in himself and in his world.  </P> <P> Dickens' message has been sweetened and simplified. Instead of the story  Dickens wrote to rail against hard-hearted businessmen going about their  business in the wake of general misery, this becomes a story about a man who  would get along with others better if he would just loosen up and smile.  </P> <P> But the story goes down easily with dinner and all the trimmings: hearty  stuffing, mashed potatoes, carrots, Yorkshire pudding, served by beautifully  costumed food servers and passed around the tables family-style. And the dinner  and dessert buffet (after the play) goes down well in the beautifully decorated  Great Hall, with twinkling lights in the trees on either side of the stage and  in the green boughs wrapped around the wooden beams.  </P> <P> What Lamb's has attempted and largely succeeded in doing is to create a  prosperous, idealized version of a 19th-Century Victorian feast and  celebration. Norman Rockwell might have sketched a picture much like this.  </P> <P> The madrigals are lovely, and the music curls seductively around the hall,  almost palpably softening the expressions on the faces of the 250 people seated  at the handsomely set and decorated tables. The message is to enjoy, to relax.  If you want a challenging "Carol," check out the San Diego Repertory Theatre  production.  </P> <P> But if you want to sit back and meet some pleasant table mates in an atmosphere  that exudes comfort and goodwill, this is the place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "DICKENS, DINING &amp; SONG"  </P> <P> By Charles Dickens.

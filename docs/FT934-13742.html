			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: EIT matches benchmark with 7% net assets rise EDINBURGH Investment Trust yesterday announced a 3.5 per cent increase in its interim dividend from 2.85p to 2.95p. Net asset value at the end of September was 322.5p, against 300.8p six months earlier, a rise of 7.2 per cent, compared with an advance of 7 per cent in the FT-A All-Share Index. EIT, the second largest investment trust in the UK, said the increased dividend reflected income from its large gilts portfolio. In addition there was strong dividend growth from its equity holdings, helped by the accelerated payment of UK dividends by many companies for tax reasons. Net revenue for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 17m (Pounds 13.4m) for earnings per share up 26 per cent to 5.77p (4.57p). However, Dunedin Fund Managers, the trust's manager, said the rate of increase was unlikely to be sustained over the full year, although earnings were expected to be ahead of last year's total of 9.25p. EIT had 88.3 per cent of its equity holdings invested in the UK at the end of the half year, compared with 88.8 per cent six months earlier. Over the half year it cut its exposure to US stocks from 5.2 per cent to 4 per cent, believing the recovery in US corporate profits was still uncertain. The funds were reinvested in Japan and the rest of the Pacific Rim. At the end of the six months EIT had 2.9 per cent (2.7 per cent) of its equity portfolio in continental Europe, 3.5 per cent (2.5 per cent) in Japan and 1.3 per cent (0.8 per cent) in the rest of the Pacific basin. Gross revenue rose to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.8m), helped by investment income ahead at Pounds 29.7m (Pounds 20.9m). That was partly offset by a fall in interest on deposits to Pounds 503,000 (Pounds 3.7m).</p>

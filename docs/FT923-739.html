			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Life outside the premier league: Britain's prospects in a two-speed Europe We must build a United States of Europe. Only in this way will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.' That was the vision of Winston Churchill, expounded in September 1946 in a celebrated speech in Zurich. He made clear at the end of the address that, whatever this European union might be, Britain itself would not take part. It would remain grandly on the flank, along with the US and the Soviet Union, among the 'friends and sponsors of the new Europe'. This week, the UK is once again facing up to the prospect that European integration could forge ahead without British participation. This time, however, if Germany and France went forward with political and monetary union among a small 'hard core', Britain's outside position would be a great deal more uncomfortable than that envisaged by Churchill. Instead of sharing the 'joys and hopes' of the champions, Britain could well be toiling in the second division - a somewhat shabby, soft-currency cousin ploughing a low productivity furrow ever further away from the EC centre. Britain's economic output per head has already fallen by about 20 per cent compared with the 12-nation EC average during the last 30 years. Now the long, slow decline looks likely to continue. Is this view a caricature? Not according to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, one of the few UK companies in this sector successfully to have steamed through the shocks of the recession. 'We'd better get started pretty damn quick. Otherwise we'll be a third-world nation next to a first-rate European economy.' Mr Garrick calls on the government to use the current phase of policy reappraisal to give more support to manufacturing industry - not through 'interference' but through practical measures such as help in export credits or research and development. 'If we keep on like this we will not be in the slow lane of Europe. We'll be stationary - on the east European fringes.' Mr Garrick says his company managed to 'compete with the Germans' with sterling pegged at the former central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95. Although Weir has been given a competitive boost by sterling's devaluation, Mr Garrick believes UK inflation could, before long, be 'out of step' with inflation rates in the rest of Europe. Almost inevitably, British people will become poorer compared with the French and the Germans, Mr Garrick says. 'Successful economies see their currencies becoming worth more, not less. And they sit at the top of the pile in terms of spending power.' A slightly less gloomy view comes from Mr Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge University, who has given consistently accurate forecasts of the depth of the recession. Although Mr Godley says he remains very pessimistic about the outlook for real recovery, he believes sterling's devaluation will put Britain in the fast lane of European growth in the next few years. This is because 'the whole of Europe is locked into depression' as a result of the strictures of the exchange rate mechanism. 'We are clearly better off than we were a fortnight ago. One of the lunacies of the last year or two was when people said that a devaluation would lead to higher interest rates. That was absolutely wrong.' Consumers, house-owners and anyone involved in small business will benefit, Mr Godley predicts. Lower interest rates 'will stop a lot of suicides. A large number of people were in real trouble. And it will lower unemployment. This will tend to make Britain a happier place.' Longer term, there are clearly worries about whether British consumers and industrialists will profit if the UK remains outside the mainstream of Europe. Mr Graham Mather, head of the European Policy Forum, a pro-European think-tank, sees some appeal in Britain's position as a cheap and relatively unregulated manufacturing base serving the European core. 'Making Britain the Hong Kong of Europe could be a viable strategy. I can imagine Lord Young (the former industry secretary) selling it, seizing on the idea of 'free port Britain'. But somehow I don't sense the mood that our business leaders want to do this.' However powerful a formal European currency bloc might eventually become, employees in British banks and financial services could benefit if Britain remains outside. After sterling's ignominious withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, the City's idea that London could play host to the European central bank is no more than a pipe dream. But, says Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Finance in London, 'there would be a competitive advantage in trading the money and instruments of the core group without being subject to the same restrictions'. Two parts of the economy which stand to prosper if sterling remains on the 'soft' monetary periphery are tourism and retailing. Mr Michael Herbert, chief executive of the Tussauds group - part of the Pearson concern which publishes the FT - expects increased numbers of foreign visitors to the group's tourist attractions. He reacts strongly to the notion that Britain is set to become a sort of a weak-currency tourist supermarket. 'Tourism tends to be regarded as a poor sort of industry, when in fact it's one of Britain's most thriving sectors.' British Aerospace used to be the biggest employer in the area around Kingston-upon-Thames, he says, whereas now it is the group's Chessington World of Adventures theme park. 'I don't see swapping heavy industry for service industry is a bad thing.' The Harrods department store also sees a silver lining in the monetary fall-out. 'Harrods has always been integrated with Europe,' says Mr Michael Cole, Harrods' main press spokesman. The store's 700 tills at present accept only sterling and dollars. 'But if the customers want us to take D-Marks, we will take them.' With 15 per cent of Harrods' merchandise bought from France, and 11 per cent from Italy, Chianti is likely to fall in price relative to Bordeaux, he says  -and there are even prospects for cheaper pasta in the food hall. Harrods' sales on Thursday were up 15 per cent compared with the same day last year. About 60 per cent of Harrods' clientele come from the 'tiara triangle' within three miles of the store. But 10 per cent are from overseas visitors. 'The public was stunned by what happened last week. But then it collected itself and decided that it (the fall of sterling) was not such a bad thing.' From what used to be the country's industrial heartland in north-west England, the Bishop of Manchester, as might be expected, has his eyes on loftier matters than the price of pasta. He said yesterday he welcomed anything - including a devaluation - which would improve the lot of 'devastated' local manufacturers. But he added: 'It seems incredible that European leaders can't get closer together.' British 'pride' was to blame for the government's failure to accept an earlier devaluation of sterling: 'It was clear that we were overvalued.' As for Britain's prospective European relegation, the bishop said: 'It is not inevitable. It needs imaginative leadership to keep Europe united, to keep the European movement going forward, and to maintain Britain at the heart of it, like John Major says.' After the events of the last 10 days, if Mr Major is to stop Britain's slow decent towards second class Euro-citizenship, he will need intervention considerably exceeding that furnished by the Bundesbank. A divine spark may be the prime minister's best hope.</p>

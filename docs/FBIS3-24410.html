			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Drozd: "The Head of the CSCE Delegation </F> Maintains That the Kazakhstan Elections `Did Not Conform to  International Standards'"]    [Text] A news conference of the international experts who  followed the progress of the parliamentary elections in  Kazakhstan was held on 8 March.    Representatives of highly influential international  organizations--the CSCE, which sent members of parliament from  various countries, and also the International Election Systems  Foundation--an organization tracking election systems  worldwide--had come to the republic specially. Having expressed  gratitude for the invitation to observe the elections, Jaan van  Hauvelingen thereupon declared: "The elections far from conform  to the international standards accepted in the CSCE. The purpose  of elections in pluralist free societies, that of the people  being afforded an opportunity to determine their future, was not  achieved. Our delegation was made up of nine persons  representing France, Sweden, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,  Lithuania, Germany, Turkey, Greece, and the Netherlands, and  also the central machinery of the CSCE directly, and this is our  unanimous opinion. In the course of the trip we have had an  opportunity to meet both officials and leaders of public  organizations, and to visit election precincts in Almaty,  Kapchagay, Issyk, and several other places of the capital  oblast. Six of our teams visited and had an opportunity to  observe the election process at 50 polling stations."    Mr. Hauvelingen went on to dwell in detail on the actual  reasons that made for the unsuccessful elections. He cited as  the first of them the candidates' and, most important, the  electorate's insufficient time for truly aware voting. "The  system of registration of the candidates is very complex, and  the district commissions excluded from the slates candidates,  and the Ministry of Justice, political parties and grassroots  movements, arbitrarily, frequently pursuing ends incompatible  with fair elections," the CSCE representative observed. "The  official slate constitutes 20 percent of the corps of deputies.  So high a percentage of appointees, not elected persons, is a  most flagrant breach of the principles on the basis of which the  CSCE functions." He also emphasized that this runs counter to  Kazakhstan's commitments, which the country assumed when it  acceded to the Paris Charter and the Helsinki Act. The  observers' particular criticism was evoked by the fact that one  person would sometimes vote for several, not even presenting his  papers, what is more. At some stations at which the foreign  members of parliament were present, the number of such "dead  souls" amounted to 35 percent. The existence of two electoral  rolls (one at the station, the other in the district election  committee) also left open the possibility of manipulation. Even  the foreigners' fleeting acquaintance with our elections enabled  them to uncover two instances of the portable ballot boxes being  taken to the voters' homes, where they were forced to vote.    Nor was the campaign fair beyond reproach, in the words of  the overseas experts. The dubious disqualification of many  candidates was reflected in their assessments. The public was  inadequately informed about the elections and the candidates and  their programs. Election polls revealed the electorate's  misunderstanding of the voting system. In the city of Kapchagay,  which one team of observers visited, there were 13 open stations  and three closed ones--at military facilities. Some 5,000  persons--20 percent of the electorate--voted at the closed ones,  but there was not a single observer or representative of the  candidate present there.    The system of distribution of ballots elicited the experts'  particular objections. In many instances, there were more than  were necessary, and there was no proper count and destruction of  the surplus ballots. The ballot boxes were not guarded at some  stations. The portable boxes were located in an unmonitored  room, and the observers were unable, try as they might, to  establish strict control here.    The leader of the CSCE delegation observed also: "In all  likelihood, the press was unable to publish material or to  criticize violations in the course of preparation of the  elections. Intimidation of independent journalists by the local  authorities occurred in some instances. This was manifested  particularly obviously in Almaty and Karaganda." Summing up what  he had said, Mr. Hauvelingen confirmed once again that all this  prevents the elections in Kazakhstan being deemed sufficiently  democratic. More than 10 points of the Election Charter were  violated.    He distinguished as positive aspects the very aspiration of  Kazakhstan to free elections and also the openness of officials  in the leadership of the country and the Central Electoral  Commission, who are capable of dialogue and of making revisions  to the election system.    Representatives of the International Election Systems  Foundation declared that they would not venture to defend the  elections in court. The voice of the citizens of Kazakhstan  simply was not, in their opinion, heard in full. Amat Radevegan  and Linda Enborg subscribed fully to the assessments made by the  CSCE parliamentary delegation. At the same time, they presented  their own opinions also: They criticized the Election Code,  which has obvious shortcomings, and also the practice of its  application. All those whom the foundation's representatives met  in the republic--political parties, observers, and  officials--agreed with this, incidentally. The diktat of the  local district commissions was observed in the course of the  elections. The Central Electoral Commission was severely limited  also in its opportunities for intervening in the process of  registration of the candidates and monitoring the local  commissions. Thus, 135 election standards, matching the number  of electoral commissions, had taken shape in Kazakhstan. A  necessary solution for the future, according to Madame Enborg,  could be coordination vertically, with full responsibility being  entrusted to the Central Electoral Commission.    Many violations were connected, as representatives of the  foundation observed, with the fact that commissions, attempting  to ensure the necessary 50 percent turnout, permitted one family  member to vote for all. But there were stations and commissions  that performed their duty impeccably. The present elections were  for all that, therefore, a step toward democracy.    Such harsh evaluations by the international observers could  not have failed to have given rise to journalists' questions.  The first was as follows: "....Do you not think that the  president should cancel these elections?" Responding, Mr.  Hauvelingen said that he hoped that Kazakhstan, as a member of  the CSCE, would heed the delegation's opinion and take account  of its observations, making the appropriate changes for the next  elections.    Responding to a question as to who should be held  responsible  for the unfair elections, the leader of the delegation said that  this was for the people of Kazakhstan and the new parliament,  not the foreign observers' mission, to decide.    The foreigners' evasiveness as regards specific conclusions  which might follow as a result of what had been said is  perfectly understandable. But it is clear even now that  Kazakhstan will once again get a parliament which it will be  hard to call one that is legitimate and that truly expresses the  will of the citizens of the republic.</p>

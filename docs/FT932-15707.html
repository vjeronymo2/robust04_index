			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Thomson TV unit reduces loss to FFr1.77bn THOMSON Consumer Electronics yesterday confirmed that last year it cut its net loss to FFr1.77bn (Dollars 328m) from FFr2.47bn in 1991, chiefly due to cost and stock cutting. The state-owned company, for which television sets account for more than half of its business, said it suffered an operating loss of FFr330m last year, against the FFr228m recorded in 1991. Turnover was static at FFr30.55bn. TCE, which has a heavy debt burden to shoulder, said yesterday that 'after stemming the deterioration of results in 1992', it hoped to continue the improvement this year. TCE said it increased its share of the US television market by two percentage points and of the US video-recorder market by four percentage points, ranking first in both sectors. It added that it maintained its market share in Europe in spite of a tough economic climate. Thomson, the state holding company which controls TCE and Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics company, also reported a net loss, of FFr544m for 1992, against a FFr702m loss in the previous year. Earlier this month, Thomson-CSF unveiled a drop in net profits to FFr1.5bn for last year, compared with FFr2.34bn in 1991.</p>

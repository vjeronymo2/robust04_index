			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Greenspan warns US rates will rise Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday served notice that short-term US interest rates will be raised - but he gave no indication of when the Fed would begin to tighten policy or by how much. 'Short-term rates are currently abnormally low in real terms. At some point, absent an unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will need to move them to a more neutral stance,' he told members of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Mr Greenspan gave some of his most upbeat congressional testimony since assuming the Fed chairmanship in 1987. He said the economic recovery, although still uneven, was firmly established. With business investment rising strongly and inflationary pressures apparently still subdued, the long-term economic outlook was the best he had seen in two or three decades. He spoke after the release of figures showing strong gains in personal income and consumption in December. His remarks boosted Wall Street and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 32.93 at 3,978.36 - a third consecutive all-time high. He said Fed governors and regional presidents would this week discuss 'the appropriate time to move to a somewhat less accommodative level of short-term interest rates'. The question was 'how long we can continue monetary accommodation without sowing the seeds of another bout of inflationary instability, accompanied by steeply rising long-term rates'. 'We don't see any need for rising interest rates,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary. Clarifying earlier remarks by President Bill Clinton, she said the president saw no evidence of rising inflation and so no reason for higher rates. The betting among Wall Street economists is that the Fed will raise rates, now 3 per cent, by  1/4 - 1/2 point in March or April. Mr Greenspan warned that the Fed would have to move before inflationary pressures had surfaced. 'By the time inflation pressures are evident, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed, and only harsh monetary therapy can restore the financial stability necessary to sustain growth.' But he also said that he saw few signs yet of nascent problems. Core consumer prices had risen 3.1 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1992 and 1993, the lowest reading since the early 1970s.

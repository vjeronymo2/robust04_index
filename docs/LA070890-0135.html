			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOES PETE WILSON HAVE A HEART?  </P> <P> I can tell that Pete Wilson does have a heart ("RoboPol," by Ronald Brownstein,  May 13). I doubt I'd vote for him, because any Democrat is bound to address my  concerns -- education, medical care for the needy, controlled growth, et cetera  -- better than any Republican. Still, I admire him for the seemingly  incorruptible stubborn conscience he votes with.  </P> <P> MARILYN SEFF  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The signing of the  Chinese-Kazakh border agreement in Almaty on Tuesday "has no  effect" on future talks between the joint delegation from  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan, and China about  the western part of the former Soviet-Chinese border, a  high-ranking diplomat taking part in these talks told the  ITAR-TASS correspondent today. According to him, "everything is  going well at the moment" and Kazakhstan's representatives will  obviously continue to take part in the work of the joint  delegation, since some work on the demarcation of the border  still lies ahead.    Russia, the diplomat said, has "absolutely no problems" on  the 55 kilometer western section of its border with China.</p>

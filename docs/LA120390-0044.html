			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> CONTINUUM SAMPLES SOVIET MODERNISM  </P> <P> The Stalinist period excepted, social realism was not the necessary end of all  Soviet art. Modernist and avant-garde impulses flourished in unlikely places,  certainly beyond the pale of official art but not exactly underground either.  </P> <P> Friday evening, the Continuum ensemble from New York offered a sampler of  Soviet musical modernism -- though nothing by anyone under 55 -- at the  Schoenberg Institute on the USC campus.  </P> <P> First came a set from the 1920s, beginning with piano character pieces by  Nicolai Roslavets and Alexander Mosolov, nervously played by Cheryl Seltzer. At  this point, the unexceptional pieces -- diluted Scriabin and Schoenberg -- have  more historical than purely musical interest.  </P> <P> Mosolov's "Three Scenes from Childhood" proved much more striking in pictorial  invention, and were sung by mezzo Ellen Lang with pouting charm and humor.  </P> <P> Names such as Alfred Schnittke are now becoming familiar to us, and his  shatteringly original Second Violin Sonata -- fierce abstract bangs and  chitters exploding from tense silences -- has been heard in this hall before.  Violinist Mia Wu and pianist Joel Sachs delivered it this time with scary zeal.  </P> <P> Leonid Hrabovsky's recent "Kogda" was a Continuum commission, and provides  expressive work for the group -- Lang, Wu, Seltzer and clarinetist Nathan  Williams, conducted by Sachs. The settings of nine poems by Velimir Khlebnikov  are acutely sensitive to the ironies and imagery of the texts, though the  playing into the piano in the introduction completely failed in its effects.  </P> <P> Part of that may have been due to the acoustical environment, filled with  extracurricular noises that suggested to attendant wits many variants on the  title of Edison Denisov's "Pain and Silence." Lang projected the wry, haunted  gloom of that song cycle with austerity and authority, fluently supported by  the ensemble.  </P> <P> Williams demonstrated remarkably pure sound throughout and comprehensive  resources in his firmly pointed account of Elena Firsova's wild Berio-esque  solo Sonata. He also combined with Wu and Sachs in a dry reading of Galina  Ustvolskaya's Trio, two movements of an odd sort of linear proto-minimalism  followed by an emphatic neo-Baroque finale.

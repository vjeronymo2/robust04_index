			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BOWL GAMES;  </P> <P> ROSE BOWL;  </P> <P> SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC  </P> <P> Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the  Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it.  </P> <P> It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has  happened in the past.  </P> <P> Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start  chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the  Rose Bowl game.  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching  closet.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game,  considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl  game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the  sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame.  </P> <P> That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC  football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in  college football against Michigan.  </P> <P> USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that  defeat is little more than a memory.  </P> <P> So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come  out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation  because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said.  </P> <P> As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship  contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami  by a total of 3 points.  </P> <P> Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game,  inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for  the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them  all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl.  Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight.  </P> <P> In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest --  Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in  recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games.  </P> <P> Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching  start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the  late 1960s and early 1970s.  </P> <P> They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching  philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler.  </P> <P> Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses,  Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today.  </P> <P> Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor  and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8  fumbles the entire season.  </P> <P> With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the  Trojans haven't been error-prone.  </P> <P> Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his  entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an  average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns.  </P> <P> By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The  Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and  fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry.  </P> <P> "Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're  better at it than any team we've played."  </P> <P> However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games  considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense,  allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game.  </P> <P> USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards  passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan.  </P> <P> Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features  one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner.  </P> <P> However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the  Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even  matchup.  </P> <P> Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone  in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota.  </P> <P> Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to  Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing  61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns.  </P> <P> It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and  isn't expected to play.  </P> <P> The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very,  very fast and he can beat you single-handedly."  </P> <P> Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't  be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic.  </P> <P> The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their  coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's  arrival here.  </P> <P> As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any  other active college coach, dismisses it by saying:  </P> <P> "If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The  thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful  in bowls.  </P> <P> "If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd  probably be too cocky and have too big an ego."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rose Bowl Notes  </P> <P> Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. .  . . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's  most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky  Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of  Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to  Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster  if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with  injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one  game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback.  </P> <P> USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that  Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on  the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record  with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is  averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7  inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end,  set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and  career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris  Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67  receptions on a run-oriented team.  </P> <P> T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl  record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl  record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to  do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio  State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark  Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we  were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan  won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is  ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points  a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3  overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost  only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Drew Scientific placing gives Pounds 25.2m valuation SHARES IN Drew Scientific, maker of diagnostic medical equipment, have been placed at 105p, valuing the company, which will begin trading next Monday, at Pounds 25.2m. Close Brothers placed 6.99m shares - 29.1 per cent of the shares now in issue - raising Pounds 3.4m net for the company and Pounds 3.08m for existing shareholders. Directors and their related interests hold 47.7 per cent of the enlarged capital after the issue. Drew's main product is the Glycomat, which uses consumable micro-column liquid chromatography packs in the management and control of diabetes, one of the world's most common diseases. The company says the technology could be adopted to help tests for kidney failure and to screen cancer. Drew is not making a profits forecast. However, based on current production of about 40 machines a month, and the sales of the high margin consumables packs, some brokers say that at 105p, Drew is on a prospective earnings multiple of about 17.</p>

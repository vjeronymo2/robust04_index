			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATTER OF GIDEON BIBLES  </P> <P> Re "For Atheists, There's No Room at the Inn for Bibles" by Jesse Katz, Feb.  28: You don't have to be a religious fanatic to recognize the proposed movement  of the Freethought Today people in trying to ban Bibles from hotels as  profoundly manipulative and absurd.  </P> <P> If they don't want to read it, that's fine. Who cares? But their proposal to  ban it puts them in a class with the Ayatollah. Any validity they may have had  is totally compromised by this dumb action.  </P> <P> JOHN DEGATINA  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

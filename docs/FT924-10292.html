			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Nothing free Sir, I fail to see (Observer, 'Short changed', October 29) why a tradesman should expect to get change from a bank, free of charge, when he does not bank there. Banks have no statutory duty to give change to all and sundry - and a cashier's time is money. I agree the fruiterer should have been told of the charge beforehand.

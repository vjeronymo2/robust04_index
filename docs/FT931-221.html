			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Housing scheme exceeds target MORE THAN 18,000 homes have been bought by housing associations using the Pounds 577m allocated in the Autumn Statement for the housing market package, according to the Housing Corporation which distributed the funds. The money, which had to be spent by today, helped enable associations to exceed the government's target for the package by 2,000 homes. The proportion of homes bought from lenders which had repossessed them was just 7 per cent of the total. Almost half the homes were bought from builders and developers, with 44 per cent bought from householders and others.</p>

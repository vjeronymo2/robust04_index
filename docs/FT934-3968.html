			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: French farm union chief cool over deal The essential element of France's demands was still missing from the latest farm trade agreement by US and European negotiators in Brussels, Mr Luc Guyau, president of FNSEA, France's largest farm union, said last night. He called on the French government to remain vigilant. and said there was no reason for it to approve any deal on agriculture, 'because it is still not excluded that there will be no agreement'. Mr Guyau expressed particular concern at the apparent absence of any restraint on imports to Europe of US corn gluten feed, which was increasingly displacing European-grown cereals in animal feed. The French farm union leader also said he was anxious that the terms of a deal between the US and the European Union might be made worse by other countries in the final round of negotiating in Geneva.</p>

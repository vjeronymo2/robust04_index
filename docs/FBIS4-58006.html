			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 27 May (DPA) -- Today, Constantino  Matos Villanueva, Dominican Republic Armed Forces secretary,  ordered that the 5,000 Dominican soldiers on the border be  replaced to guarantee the effectiveness of the total embargo  against Haiti. The replacement was made in response to reports  by international organizations and the U.S. media that Dominican  soldiers were profiting from the contraband of fuel and other  Haiti-bound merchandise from Dominican territory.    In addition, Matos Villanueva revealed that 30 UN observers  will come to the country soon to work alongside Dominican troops  and verify compliance with the embargo. He explained these  observers, many of whom are soldiers, will work in civilian  clothes and several of them will man helicopters, speedboats,  and other logistical equipment that will be used to prevent the  smuggling of fuel and food. Matos Villanueva said the United  Nations will supply this U.S.-made equipment. This will be done  because the Dominican Navy does not have enough ships to patrol  the Dominican coasts that border Haiti.    These measures, Matos Villanueva added, were suggested by  Alexander Martinovic, political official of the UN Security  Council Sanction Committee, who visited the Dominican Republic  early this week at the head of an observers mission.    Meanwhile, Matos Villanueva concluded that the border has  remained sealed off for the past three days and the movement of  persons or vehicles between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is  not allowed.</p>

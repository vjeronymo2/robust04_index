			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Tiny portrait on an epic scale: The latest book on Lonrho's chief reveals the full range of his virtues and vices A REBEL TYCOON By Tom Bower Heinemann, Pounds 16.99, pp659 Whatever else may be said about Tom Bower's new book on Tiny Rowland of Lonrho, it is not - pace Mr Rowland - dull. How could it be, given the nature of the man in question? The individual who has been the driving force behind this sprawling international conglomerate admittedly has his fair share of standard entrepreneurial characteristics: the giant ego, mercurial temperament, preference for malleable courtiers and vindictiveness towards those who cross or fail him. But in Rowland's case the virtues and vices are on a colossal scale. And then, of course, there is his love affair with Africa. There are few less promising territories for large-scale Western entrepreneurship than sub-Saharan black Africa. With a total GNP that ranks no greater than one of the smaller European economies, the region has resolutely failed to take off economically. Yet Tiny Rowland made this difficult continent his stamping ground and forged close relationships with numerous black African leaders. As Tom Bower underlines, in his exhaustively researched account, Rowland has benefited handsomely from his courtship of the Africans. Indeed, his great achievement after thirty odd-years has been to extract an enormous amount of cash for himself from a company which has suffered from severe constraints on the remittance of profits and many of whose assets in black Africa have been difficult to realise. The rewards have come via a frequently over-generous dividend policy, a regal pay package and, finally, the sale of part of his share stake to the mysterious German entrepreneur Dieter Bock. But despite cashing in a majority of his chips, he has retained a position as joint managing director and chief executive alongside Bock, and thus, for the moment, his jet-setting life style and entree to all those black African heads of state. There was a time, after the great boardroom battle over governance issues in the early 1970s - the revolt of Sir Basil Smallpeice and the 'Straight Eight' directors - when the small shareholders who flocked to Tiny's banner would take anything on trust. But when the irrepressible tycoon, now past 75, surveyed his flock at Lonrho's last annual general meeting there were signs of growing impatience. And not before time. For all Rowland's tireless activity, Lonrho's earnings record has been patchy and the dividend has had to be cut in the midst of a cash crisis. Worse, Rowland sold his shares to Bock at a premium over the market price, leaving others in the lurch. Bock, meantime, remains an unknown quantity to be taken on Tiny's say so, as he comes closer to taking his conge. But thus it ever was with Lonrho. Rowland's style has always been that of the 19th century buccaneer and it will never be trimmed to suit the requirements of best accountancy practice or the finer points of the Cadbury Report. There has long been ample evidence, for those who contemplated entrusting their money to his stewardship, of the warts-and-all nature of the investment. Also of the hit-and-miss nature of Tiny's management style. Spectacular successes, for example, in mining in Africa or in vehicle distribution in Europe have been matched by equally spectacular failures such as the decline of the loss-making Observer and the attempt to develop the Wankel rotary engine, where the rights were recently sold for a nominal sum. Nor is there anything new about cash crises. Lonrho's history has been punctuated with them, just as it has been by critical government reports and official hostility. The amazing thing is that a company whose finances have often appeared to have been held together by string should have survived so long and paid out so much in dividends. Bower's account may not cast much light on where Lonrho goes from here, or on the background and intentions of Mr Bock. His description of the protracted battle with Mohamed Fayed for control of Harrods - the noisiest case in corporate history of the pot calling the kettle black - is comprehensive without adding greatly to what is already known. But there are plenty of nuggets scattered throughout the book. And it raises serious questions about the extent of the benefits to black Africa of Lonrho's activities. While the company has promoted valuable projects across Africa, Bower puts a plausible case that the Africans failed to benefit as they should have done because of the venality of such men as Dr Hastings Banda of Malawi and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia who dispensed monopoly rights to Lonrho. And he alleges instances of bribery of high-ranking Africans out of an account called 'General Expenses' at Lonrho's Cheapside headquarters. It is, admittedly, a moot point whether Africans would have been better off if moral scruples had prevented trade or investment in countries where economic power has been concentrated in the hands of a single, repressive ruler like Dr Banda. And certainly throughout the Lonrho saga the British government has been wedded to realpolitik on such issues, whether dealing with trade sanctions against Rhodesia or the specific problem of bribes. Bower recounts that when DTI inspectors investigating Lonrho in the 1970s consulted the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office about such payments, they were asked to draw a discreet veil over the subject to prevent damage to British interests. Rowland might well argue that he has constantly been attacked for doing what countless others have done. But then, from his expressions of sympathy for the Nazis while at school in Hampshire to his outbursts against Edward Heath and the then Mrs Thatcher during the Fayed imbroglio, he has never hesitated to make things needlessly difficult for himself. But he does at least have a talent to amuse. This week's three-sentence press release on the publication of Bower's book, baldly headed 'Statement by Tiny Rowland', declared: 'I very much regret that a boring and unrecognisable account of my life should have been published today entitled 'A Rebel Tycoon'. None of the interesting bits are in. I know many people, but, thank God, not the author.' It is a characteristic gem, but not one which should deter any potential reader of the book.</p>

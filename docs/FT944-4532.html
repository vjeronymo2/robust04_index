			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: France toes line on shipyard aid France has dropped its long-standing opposition to a new international ban on direct aid to shipbuilding. This follows preliminary agreement with Brussels enabling Paris to continue to give its shipyards roughly the same aid in the form of indirect subsidies. Mr Jose Rossi, the French industry minister, confirmed yesterday that France was ready to join its EU partners in ratifying the direct subsidy ban, negotiated with key non-European shipbuilding countries in the forum of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) last summer. Mr Rossi said France's approval still depended on modifications within the OECD accord. But government officials said these modifications had already been negotiated with Commission officials, and were contained in a letter sent by Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, to the EU executive. This letter sets out France's intent to use the OECD accord's loopholes allowing indirect aid to help French yards with research, development and training to the tune of FFr2.6bn (Dollars 480m) in 1996-98. The letter also reserves France's right to come up with other aid proposals. This enabled one senior government official to claim yesterday that the aid would in fact amount to FFr1bn a year for the three-year period. The Commission is due to examine the French aid plan next Tuesday.</p>

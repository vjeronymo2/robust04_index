They based their pessimistic view on the  complexity of an emerging power struggle within the DP.    Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek does not appear to be firm in his  leadership these days. In addition, the DP appears to be split,  apparent even to outsiders.    The struggle for the party leadership was triggered by Yi's  announcement early last month that he will run in the 1997  presidential election. Yi's declaration immediately brought a  bellicose response from his political rivals who think Yi is not  a man of real presidential timber. "The public approval rate for  the DP has stood at just 18 percent," said a DP lawmaker.  "Unless the party makes a drastic change in its leadership, the  transfer of power to the DP will be impossible," he said.    Yi currently chairs the party's top decision-making body,  the  Supreme Council, that consists of nine senior lawmakers. But his  leadership is described as shaky. He obtained slightly more than  50 percent of the vote in March last year when he was elected  party chairman. Furthermore, just 31 of the DP's 97 lawmakers  belong to the faction led by Yi. Another group of 43 lawmakers,  which had been led by former DP leader Kim Tae-chung, is  considered friendly to Yi but has not clearly come out in  support of him. And as many as 55 lawmakers, including those  who have dual factional membership, are members of the  anti-mainstream group led by Reps. Kim Sang-hyon, Chong  Tae-chol, Kim Won-ki, and Yi Pu-yong.    Chairman Yi has acted like a presidential candidate since  his  formal announcement that he will run for the presidency last  month, exposing himself to criticism. Experts interpreted Yi's  plan to meet with North Korean President Kim Il-song in  Pyongyang as part of his efforts to realize his presidential  ambitions. Almost all his public activities seem to be aimed at  boosting his political and popular image. Yi has expanded his  private political organization, called the Unification Research  Center, by establishing local chapters across the nation. He met  with prominent business and religious leaders, including  Cardinal Stephen Kim So-hwan, environmental scholars and people  from almost all sectors of society. The DP leader also visited  market places, farming villages, police stations and homes for  the underprivileged in a bid to take a first-hand look at the  lives of ordinary people.    Meanwhile, Yi's extraordinarily visible behavior has begun  to  stimulate his opponents and rivals to work out countermeasures.  A group of 20 reform-minded DP lawmakers held an emergency  meeting Jan. 28-29 and called for a change in the party  leadership. Saying that Chairman Yi is too weak for the DP's  presidential bid, they demanded that the party's national  convention be held ahead of schedule during this year. The  national convention, in which the party chairman will be  elected, is scheduled for May next year.    Rep. Yi Pu-yong said at the meeting that he will run for the  party chairmanship, if 80 percent of his group members support  his candidacy. Reps. Kim Sang-hyon and Chong Tae-chol, who were  defeated by Chairman Yi in the party leadership race last year,  came out firmly in support of the reform-minded lawmakers'  demand. Kim and Chong also made their own efforts to widen their  political influence in the opposition camp.    Kim recently visited Japan and the Philippines along with  his  supporters and has made many contacts with other factional  leaders in order to form a united front against Chairman Yi. In  May, Kim and Chong plan to visit China, where they will meet  with political leaders in Beijing and hold seminars.    "The DP needs a new face. The incumbent chairman is clearly  unqualified to compete in the presidential race," said a  lawmaker who belongs to the Kim Sang-hyon faction. Yi's camp  reacted to the views of his opponents by insisting that it is  impossible to find a clear alternative to Yi's chairmanship.    Though their is obviously some tendency to break away from  the influence of Kim Tae-chung in the DP, both mainstream and  anti-mainstream factions are striving to secure Kim's support in  the race for the party leadership. Since his inauguration as  party chairman last year, Yi has made desperate efforts to fill  the political vacuum left by Kim's retirement from politics in  December 1992. Yi ha sought closer ties with the 43-member DP  faction formerly led by Kim. The chairman has also made efforts  to merge with splinter opposition parties to broaden his  political base. Yi's political status has somewhat improved  thanks to his efforts so far but he has yet to overcome the  widespread skepticism over his ability as party leader as well  as his calibre as a presidential candidate.</p>

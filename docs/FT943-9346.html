			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures recovered in late trading to finish on a firm note after following bonds lower amid uncertainty over the outlook for US interest rates, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,175 but was quickly followed by active selling as dealers followed the movements in the bond markets. The contract fell to a day's low of 3,155 in the late morning before steadying over the lunchtime period as a recovery began in other markets. In the second half of the session, a firm opening on Wall Street and a strengthening US dollar which was reacting to comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, attracted buyers back to September and it continued to claw back some of the earlier loss. It ended at 3,174, unchanged on the day but at an 8-point premium to cash. Turnover reached 9,384 lots. Volume in the traded options was heavy, at 52,555 contracts, as the August stock options expired. Lasmo, a subject of expiry, led the way among the stock options as some 8,599 lots were dealt, with the August 154 calls the busiest series. It was followed by Tesco at 3,148 contracts and Hanson at 2,986, both with series that ceased trading yesterday. The FT-SE 100 option traded 15,941 lots.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shaoping (0719 1421 1627)] </F>   [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- At a special  session on China's economy of the annual World Economic Forum on  29 January, Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State Council's Foreign  Affairs Office, said: China sincerely hopes to increase  cooperation with other countries and welcomes entrepreneurs from  those countries to compete in its markets.    Qi Huaiyuan also noted: China hopes to resume its status as  a GATT signatory at the earliest possible date. The solution of  this problem will further promote the development of trade and  economic cooperation between China and other countries on the  basis of equality and mutual benefit, as well as strengthen the  multilateral trade system.    The annual World Economic Forum, which opened in Davos on 27  January, brought together 1,200 government leaders,  entrepreneurs, bankers, and economists from various countries.  Participants exchanged views on various economic topics.  China's vibrant economy was one of the topics of interest to  the participants.    Qi Huaiyuan also briefed participants on China's economy and  reform at the special session on China's economy. He said:  Over the past 15 years, China has greatly promoted the  development of its productive forces as it has gradually  implemented reform and opened wider to the outside world. Its  gross national product [GNP] increased 12.8 percent in 1992,  while the increase in 1993 was approximately 13 percent. He  said emphatically: The Chinese Government has not stubbornly  pursued double-digit, high rates of growth. Using complete  projections, it has initially decided to maintain this year's  GNP growth rate at 9 percent.    He pointed out: The goal of the Chinese Government is to  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth [chi xu  kuai su jian kang zeng zhang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 1073  7022] in order to quadruple 1980's GNP by the turn of the  century, and to help its people attain a fairly comfortable  standard of living. The Chinese Government and people are fully  confident of realizing this goal.    Speaking on foreign trade, Qi Huaiyuan said: Over the past  15 years, China's foreign trade has consistently grown faster  than its GNP, resulting in increasingly closer ties between  China's economy and those of other parts of the world. China's  total export and import volume rose from $20.64 billion in 1978  to $195.72 billion in 1993, and it ranked 11th in the world in  1992. China is no longer a huge potential market but rather a  rapidly expanding market that has actually come into existence.    Qi Huaiyuan said: China is now in a period in which the old  economic system is shifting to a new one, and the two systems  are overlapping each other. Some deficiencies under the old  system persist, while a new system has yet to take shape; this  is the deep-seated cause of problems in China's economic  operations. We must further deepen reform if we want to  fundamentally solve this critical problem hindering China's  economic development. In 1994, we will introduce a set of new  major reform measures covering many important areas:  state-owned enterprises, banking, finance, taxation, foreign  trade, foreign exchange, and investment. The Chinese Government  will ensure that each and every one of these reform measures  will remain within the bounds of national strength and the  people's means.    On foreign investment, Qi Huaiyuan pointed out: An important  part of China's opening policy is to encourage foreigners to  invest in China. By the end of October 1993, China had approved  altogether 158,000 foreign-funded investment projects, with  foreign capital actually invested in those projects totaling  $51.7 billion.    He said: China is prepared to open its markets further; it  also plans to allow foreign enterprises to join in the operation  of those sectors from which foreigners were banned previously,  such as power stations, railways, airports, and expressways. As  reform of the economic system deepens, China's investment  environment will improve.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: US retail sales continue to rise an extension of the trend late last year and further evidence the economy is pulling out of recession. Retailers claimed promotions, such as heavy price-discounting, were less noticeable than in the same month of previous years, which should boost retailers' profits. Mr Joseph Antonini, head of K mart, the large discount store chain reported: 'Record sales and profits in December, as well as high sell-through of seasonal and apparel merchandise during the Christmas season, resulted in fewer clearance sales at mark-down price this January.' Mr William Howell, chairman of J. C. Penney, the Texas-based retailer, said: "During the month, we virtually sold out of winter merchandise, and early spring apparel sales posted good gains. 'Promotional activity was considerably below the level of last year,' he added Sales growth was spread across the retail sector. Wal-Mart the largest stores group in sales terms which and operating operates at the discount end of the market, reported a 10 per cent rise in same-store sales last month. Among specialty stores, The Gap, the fashion retailer, clocked up a 12 per cent improvement in comparable store sales. Circuit City Stores, one the largest consumer electronics retailers, posted a 13 per cent advance in same-store sales. Among the department stores, Federated, which takes in Bloomingdale's and The Bon Marche, had a 5.3 per cent sales advance. May Department Stores recorded a 7.4 per cent sales improvement in its department stores. Neiman Marcus reported a 7.9 per cent improvement. Sears, the large Chicago-based retailer, which recently announced the closure of its catalogue operation, recorded an 8.3 per cent advance in same-store sales. There were laggards. Woolworth reported a rise of only 0.2 per cent in comparable domestic store sales in January. K mart saw general merchandise sales dip by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, although the specialty stores division posted a 2.5 per cent improvement. J. C. Penney also saw a 0.1 per cent decline, on a same-store basis, from its core chain.</p>

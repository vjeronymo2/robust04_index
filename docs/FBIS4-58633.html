			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, 6 May (INA) -- The newspaper  AL-THAWRAH has said that if Mrs. Tansu Ciller's government  fulfills its promises to Turkish merchants to reopen border  posts in order to carry out trade with Iraq, this will be a  decisive development in favor of sound Iraqi-Turkish relations.    In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, mouthpiece of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party, expresses confidence that fulfilling the  promises made by Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin  would be positively and quickly reflected in various sectors of  the Turkish economy, which has been suffering from serious  defects and obstacles since the blockade was imposed on Iraq in  1990. [passage omitted]    AL-THAWRAH says that if Mrs. Ciller's government fulfills  its  promise to reopen the al-Khabur border post, then the way will  be open for the Turkish economy to acquire the same privileges  attained during the prosperous trade exchanges with Iraq. These  exchanges used to refresh not only Turkish areas adjacent to  Iraq but all of Turkey as well. This was achieved by pumping  Iraqi oil into Turkish markets and promoting trade and economic  activities along the path of the oil pipeline, in addition to  supporting the Turkish lira, expanding the scope for businesses,  and establishing dozens of joint Iraqi-Turkish ventures and  firms.</p>

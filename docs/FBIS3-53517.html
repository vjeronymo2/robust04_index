			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nasir Qaddur, minister of state for foreign </F> affairs, by Murad Fathi in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] [Fathi] What do you make of the threats issued by  Turkish officials to Syria over the water issue.?    [Qaddur] There are no threats, strictly speaking. Turkey is  a neighbor, and Turkish officials understand we will not bow to  threats. On a government-to-government level, the two sides are  interested in developing friendly relations. Some Turkish  journalists, however, sometimes level charges over one issue or  another. In the meantime, the Turkish Government has pointed  out that these charges are not necessarily representative of its  policies. Turkey is as willing as we are to improve our  bilateral ties. As for the Euphrates, which originates in  Turkish territory and traverses Syrian territory before it ends  in Iraq, it has been an international waterway for thousands of  years, on the banks of which many civilizations have flourished.  In accordance with international rules regulating the use of  river waters, the three countries are all rightful claimants.  Hence, the existence of three-way technical committees working  on the water distribution. In 1987, we reached an agreement  with the Turks under which Turkey committed itself to the  allocation of 500 cubic meters per second for Syria before the  Ataturk Dam is filled. A clause in a protocol signed during  former Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to Syria on 20  January, 1993 provided for an even greater amount than that.    [Fathi] Will Syria give assurances to Israel of a share in  the water once peace in the Middle East is established?    [Qaddur] The Golan is Syrian territory. Israel has been  stealing water from the Golan and south Lebanon. The Israelis  are estimated to be misappropriating an annual 300 million cubic  meters from the Golan, which is Syrian territory. Syria needs  the water. Future water projects will try to utilize technology  for optimum use of the water. This is because the water  reserves are not enough to meet Syria's requirements. We have  irrigation and electricity projects in the east of the country,  and any shortfall in the water will result in the depopulation  of the area. Syria does not have enough water to spare for  Israel. As for assurances to Israel, when peace comes and  Israel vacates the occupied Arab territories, mechanisms will be  created to handle cooperation among the countries of the region.  It is premature to talk, at this point in time, about  cooperation and guarantees to Israel.    [Fathi] After the Palestinian-Israeli agreement was  signed, and after the PLO violated the Arab coordination, to  what extent can Arab coordination, particularly among the  parties concerned with the peace process, be achieved?    [Qaddur] No doubt, this agreement caused a huge rift in the  coordination among the states participating in the negotiations.  We believe that the unity of Arab ranks will serve the peace  process, and that any breakthrough on a single track will  complicate this process and will have negative repercussions on  it. This is because we are trying to establish a comprehensive  and just peace. Therefore, there should be a unified Arab  position. A strong partner will make peace, but a weak one will  make war. Syria always works to achieve at least the minimum  requirements of the ongoing peace process.    [Fathi] Will you go to the 12th round of negotiations?    [Qaddur] We are committed to the peace process, to which we  have been a party since the beginning, in accordance with the  bases of the Madrid conference. These bases were agreed upon  through elaborate discussions with the former U.S.  Administration. Eleven rounds of talks were held, during which  there was complete Arab coordination. Therefore, there has been  a true orientation toward peace. Syria is still committed to  coordination. However, it seems that Israel is so far  unprepared for peace and is not sincere about it. Israel is  behind the delay of the 12th session. It justifies this by the  need for time to digest the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In  fact, Israel wants to usurp more Arab rights. We are ready to  go to Washington on the condition that we receive confirmed  guarantees about the achievement of progress during the next  round.    [Fathi] How can progress be achieved during the next phase?    [Qaddur] If we return to the Madrid formula, we will find  that the objective is to achieve a comprehensive peace on all  fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Madrid formula is not  aimed at achieving bilateral solutions between Israeli and Arab  parties. The goal is a comprehensive peace binding all parties  to the conflict. This is what will end the conflict and return  rights to their owners. The mechanism for attaining this goal  is negotiations on all Arab tracks with Israel. The mission of  the Syrian-Israeli track is to discuss the issue of the occupied  Golan. Other tracks discuss other bilateral issues. The final  outcome of these tracks will be a comprehensive peace.  Isolating and ensnaring any Arab party into an agreement with  Israel will disturb the Madrid formula and will weaken the Arab  position, especially with regard to the issue of coordination.  In the long run, this will not be in the service of peace.    [Fathi] What about reports of secret contacts between Syria  and Israel?    [Qaddur] Peace is a noble goal, and it does not need any  secret agreements. No one has to be ashamed of it. Yet, there  was secrecy about the eleven rounds of the Washington talks.  The problems that were discussed during the negotiations were  not divulged. This was considered secrecy. Approximately 7,000  pages were written in such secrecy.    [Fathi] How do you assess the progress on the Syrian-Israeli  track so far?    [Qaddur] We can say that Israel is still far away from the  requirements of peace. Whenever the two delegations reach the  main point, namely, total withdrawal from the Golan, the  Israelis start talking about the fruits of peace. The Israelis  have not shown any signs that they will withdraw from the Golan.  They have not said they are ready to carry out a total  withdrawal from the Golan, although they know that Syria will  not relinquish any inch of its land. Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 are the basis for the peace process.  Israel entered the negotiations aware of this. These two  resolutions stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the  territories that were occupied in 1967.    [Fathi] There is much talk about Egypt's role in the peace  negotiations. How do you view that role?    [Qaddur] The Egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs  has said that Egypt is an Arab state and is not, as some Western  papers are saying, playing the role of a mediator. Egypt is not  playing the role of a mediator but is an Arab party, like Syria  and other Arab parties, that is seeking peace in the region. It  has more freedom than some Arab parties due to the state of its  international relations. It is an Arab country and it is eager  to preserve Arab rights. There is a wide-scale coordination  between Syria and Egypt on the highest level, especially between  President Hafiz al-Asad and President Husni Mubarak, to achieve  a comprehensive and just peace. This is an aspect of the  distinguished relations between the two countries.</p>

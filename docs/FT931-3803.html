			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Sport: War of the puppets - The new F1 season starts tomorrow / John Griffiths looks at the backstage battle over technology INDIANAPOLIS-bound Nigel Mansell was closer to the mark than perhaps even he knew when, with his waspish parting shot at his detested rival Alain Prost, he said that the Williams-Renault in which Prost will start the South African grand prix tomorrow was so advanced it could be driven by 'a puppet.' Indeed, grand prix technology is hurtling forward so fast that, left unchecked, a puppet might not be necessary. Max Mosley, the president of the Federation Internationale du Sport Automobile (Fisa), the world governing body of motor sport, says: 'We are talking about something which technically could be only three or four years away.' The cars, digital 'maps' of each circuit stored in their computer memories and with an occasional adjustment from the pits via telemetry, could be capable of racing on their own with steering, suspension and brakes responding by computer to electronic 'vision.' At the moment, they lack only the vision system - and even that technology exists. Human interest? Slap a helmet and overalls on anyone prepared to go along for the ride. He or she would lack the skills of world champions Mansell, Prost or Ayrton Senna - but would not need them. Nor, from the perspective of sponsors, increasingly uneasy at the spiralling costs of grand prix racing, would they warrant the Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) which the top drivers received in the 1992 season. Of all the team changes, personal rivalries, cash crises and other dramas which have combined to make the 1993 season one of the most important in grand prix history, the technology issue stands out. The grand prix world, familiar with the problems of driving round a circuit, has found itself at a crossroads. Along one route lies Indycar racing - equivalent to grand prix in north America - with which Mansell is grappling. Here, electronic control systems are banned, gearboxes are manual and engines have to be shared among teams. The emphasis is on equalising machinery to maximise competition between drivers. Down the other lies unchecked technology, ever-climbing expense and the diminution of the role of the driver. The recession has cut sponsorship budgets - one well-informed source suggests a fall of 50 per cent this season - just as teams must find the cash to keep up with the rapid technological developments. Manufacturers, sponsors, administrators, engineers and drivers are asking, as never before, whether grand prix should be sport or science. Mosley, a barrister and a former racing driver, is staking his presidency on curbing technology. On that basis, events in Paris on Thursday will be of more fundamental importance than whether young Damon Hill beats veteran team-mate Prost in the Williams-Renault at Kyalami tomorrow; or whether the late-signing Ayrton Senna will upset the applecart with a suddenly more competitive McLaren-Cosworth. On Thursday, the FISA world council is expected to endorse the proposals of its Formula One commission to ban, from the 1994 season, all electronic aids which detract from the role of the driver. That includes the computer-controlled 'active' suspension systems developed by leading teams at a cost of millions; traction control, which stops skids automatically; and possibly even the semi-automatic gearboxes which are one of the dwindling areas of grand prix technology of likely relevance to future road cars. Some leading teams have grudgingly accepted tentative costing-cutting as well as those measures aimed at helping less well-heeled teams, so increasing the closeness of the racing this season. Even so, Mosley could face a revolt. There have been muttered threats of legal action against the technology ban, on the ground that it has not won the approval of all teams. Mosley says he will stick to his guns. The prospect of a technology ban is viewed differently in F1's various camps. For leading technology-driven constructors such as Williams, McLaren and Benetton, yielding expensively-won advantage is a bitter pill to swallow. The attitude of the big manufacturers who back grand prix is conditioned by performance. Renault, Ford and Mercedes (powering the new Sauber team) oppose the ban. Ferrari, struggling woefully to get to grips with the technology, would be quietly grateful. Drivers, Prost prominent among them, are mostly in favour for it is their skills which are devalued by technology. Sponsors with no entrenched motor industry interests other than the simple desire to stay exposed to a 100m global grand prix television audience, maintain a discreet silence but welcome quietly the prospect of closer racing at less cost. Most important of all, the ban would mean that Indy and grand prix cars could move relatively quickly towards a common specification. Already, planning permission for been given for one Indy-style oval on a disused British Steel site at Corby in Northamptonshire while Silverstone's owner, the British Racing Drivers' Club, has completed detailed planning for a second. A third is being prepared by Donington Park's owner, Tom Wheatcroft. US motor racing officials, who show distaste for the intense politics and perceived gravy train of Formula One, pour cold water on the idea of a F1-Indy 'marriage.' But Mansell's presence on this year's Indy circuit, and sponsor pressure, could see the shotgun brought out. A technology ban would be of almost wholly unalloyed benefit. Grand prix has had its moments, Mansell's gloriously futile chase of Ayrton Senna at Monaco last year among them. But the very fact that grand prix overtaking manoeuvres are memorable as much for their rarity as their spectacle underlines Mosley's concern about the grand prix processional. Last month, Dale Earnhardt took a hard-earned victory in one of the most famous US races, the Daytona 500. During the contest, the lead changed 38 times. That is motor racing.</p>

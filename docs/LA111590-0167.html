			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRM SCRAPS PLANS FOR GOLF COURSE IN TOPANGA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDED A HOUSING PROJECT. BANKS WERE RELUCTANT  TO PROVIDE LOANS BECAUSE OF STRONG COMMUNITY OPPOSITION.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Japan-based Tohshin Co. say the firm will not proceed  with plans for a controversial golf course and housing project in Topanga  Canyon because obstacles to the project have deterred lenders.  </P> <P> Yuji Kanda, the general manager of Tohshin Co.'s California office, said  Tuesday that company officials have decided not to buy the 257-acre Montevideo  Country Club site from developer Christopher Wojciechowski, who filed for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection about a year ago.  </P> <P> The site is along the west side of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, across from the  Viewridge subdivision and about three miles south of Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Japanese banks were reluctant to finance the purchase because of the strong  community opposition, and because five county permits are still needed before  construction can begin, said a Tohshin consultant who advised the company on  the purchase.  </P> <P> Brad Godshall, an attorney representing Montevideo Country Club Inc., refused  to comment on Tohshin's decision. A bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled today  to discuss "a potential sale," he said, but he declined to disclose the  potential purchaser.  </P> <P> Tohshin backed out of the deal late last month, the evening before the  purchasing agreement was scheduled to be ratified by the federal bankruptcy  court with jurisdiction over Wojciechowski's assets.  </P> <P> "If it was a slam-dunk deal it would be all right, but to go through all that  hassle, the numbers didn't make sense," said the Tohshin consultant, who spoke  on the condition that he not be identified by name.  </P> <P> The sale had been contingent on Wojciechowski's obtaining five Los Angeles  County permits for the project, including a conditional-use permit, a zoning  permit, an area plan amendment and an oak tree removal permit.  </P> <P> Tohshin was planning to pay $22 million for the land and an additional $14  million when the necessary permits were obtained, the consultant said.  </P> <P> He said the county was probably going to require the developer to improve  Topanga Canyon Road and install a sewage system as a condition for approval,  which he said would cut into potential profits.  </P> <P> "The costs were going to be quite substantial," he said. "The whole project is  barely economically feasible."  </P> <P> Tohshin wanted to develop a golf course that could be certified as a tournament  level course by the Professional Golfers' Assn. But several golf course  designers advised the company that the proposed course probably would not meet  that standard, the consultant said.  </P> <P> Wojciechowski's plan to turn the rolling, oak-tree dotted meadow into the  premier private recreation project in the Santa Monica Mountains has been a  long-running controversy in Topanga. Some residents supported the project --  which had called for a hotel, a museum and a shopping mall -- saying it would  bring services and permanent open space to the canyon, but others adamantly  opposed altering the natural beauty of the land.  </P> <P> Opponents waged a fierce battle in county hearing rooms. County supervisors  ultimately rejected plans for a hotel and shopping mall and forced the  developer to scale back the housing.  </P> <P> When Wojciechowski filed for bankruptcy last year, many Topanga residents hoped  the project was dead. But announcements that Tohshin planned to purchase the  site and proceed with the golf course and housing rekindled the opposition.  </P> <P> In an effort to deter Tohshin from buying the land, members of the Topanga  Assn. for a Scenic Community deluged the company with postcards. According to  Bob Bates, president of the organization, the preprinted postcards said many  Topanga residents were staunchly opposed.  </P> <P> Bates said about 1,000 people sent postcards to the company's Los Angeles  office.  </P> <P> Kanda said the company was surprised at the amount of opposition. But the  Tohshin consultant said the opposition merely "tipped the scales."  </P> <P> The primary reason for the decision, however, was simply that Japanese banks  were "not that enthusiastic" about the project, the consultant said.  </P></p>

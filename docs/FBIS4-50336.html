			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan has consistently  enjoyed a surplus in its farm trade with Japan in recent years,  the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics  (DGBAS) reported Tuesday [17 May].    Taiwan registered a surplus of US$2.47 billion in its farm  trade with Japan last year, up 14.9 percent from that recorded  in 1987, the cabinet-level agency said.    Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan grew at an average of  1.6 percent annually between 1987 and 1993, with the amount  rising from US$2.49 billion to US$2.74 billion, according to  DGBAS statistics.    Farm imports from Japan, however, declined 18 percent during  the seven-year period to US$270 million for 1993, the  directorate said.    While two-way trade between Taiwan and Japan has continued  expanding, the share of agricultural products in total bilateral  trade has declined steadily, DGBAS officials said.    Farm goods accounted for 30.6 percent of Taiwan's total  exports to Japan in 1993, down 5 percent from the percentage  registered in 1987. The farm goods ratio to Taiwan's total  imports from Japan also dropped to 1.2 percent last year from  2.8 percent in 1987.    Husbandry goods, pork in particular, formed the bulk of  Taiwan's farm exports to Japan, accounting for 46.3 percent of  the total last year. Aquacultural products followed at 34  percent.    Taiwan has incurred a huge trade deficit in its overall  trade  with Japan as it has relied heavily on Japan for the supply of  machinery, parts and industrial materials.    Taiwan registered a record trade deficit of US$14.2 billion  with Japan in 1993 and the amount is expected to surge further  to a new high of US$16 billion this year. The trade imbalance  already hit US$4.96 billion in the first four months of this  year, according to customs tallies.</p>

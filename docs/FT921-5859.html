			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / McDonnell faces doubt on Taiwan stake deal MCDONNELL Douglas of the US is facing increasing difficulties in its attempts to sell 49 per cent of its commercial aircraft business to Asian partners. This raises doubts over the company's plans to launch later this year the development of a new 350-400 seater jumbo aircraft, the MD-12, to challenge Boeing in the large airliner market. The growing uncertainty over the future of McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft activities follows a statement by a senior executive of Taiwan Aerospace, which has been negotiating to take a stake of up to 40 per cent in the US company's civil aircraft business for Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) that it may buy only 25 per cent. The statement by Mr Liu Kuo-Chih, vice-president of Taiwan Aerospace, in a news agency interview on Friday hit the price of McDonnell Douglas shares, which closed Dollars 2 1/4 down at Dollars 63 1/2 . The decision would make it financially harder for McDonnell Douglas to develop its new MD-12 jumbo airliner, a direct competitor to the Boeing 747-400. Mr Robert Hood, president of the company's Douglas Aircraft subsidiary, said at the Singapore Air Show last week that the company was talking to other Asian nations about taking a bigger stake in the company's commercial aircraft business. He remained optimistic that Taiwan Aerospace would raise the Dollars 2bn for a 40 per cent stake, but also conceded that other Asian countries might end up taking part of the shares originally intended for Taiwan. McDonnell Douglas has been in discussions with investors in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia as well as Taiwan. The three Japanese aerospace groups, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries, have so far responded unenthusiastically to McDonnell Douglas. They have also been approached by Boeing and the European Airbus consortium. McDonnell Douglas announced last year it planned to complete its deal with Taiwan by the end of January. But Mr Hood indicated in Singapore that he now expected the deal to be completed by the end of this year. McDonnell Douglas, anxious to see off opposition in the US Congress on national security grounds, said there would be only limited technology transfer to Taiwan. This has led Taiwanese politicians to claim the country should be getting more.</p>

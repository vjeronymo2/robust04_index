			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 28 (AFP) - Doctors found 17 wounds on  the body of a lawyer who died in police custody here, the bar  association said Tuesday [28 June].    'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the association's head in Cairo,  told  reporters that national bar association chief Ahmad al-Khawajah  was informed of the medical report's contents by the state  prosecutor. Muhammad said the report into the death of Islamic  lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani mentioned "17 injury marks on  various parts of the victim's body," without giving more details.    The lawyers' association launched a protest campaign after  Madani's death in police custody on April 17, charging that he  died under torture. The interior ministry said an asthma attack  was to blame.    According to the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights a  total of 37 lawyers were arrested during the campaign, which  included a rally brutally stopped by police on May 17. Some 28  out of the 37 have been freed up to now, the group said.    A group of 33 lawyers decided last week to go on hunger  strike demanding the release of the lawyers and the publication  of the findings into Madani's death.  Muhammad said 27 of the hunger strikers had now ended their  protest deeming that the authorities had "met their demands."    But some of their colleagues had accused them of giving in.</p>

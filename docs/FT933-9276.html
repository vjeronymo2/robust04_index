			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Citibank to sell UK life unit to Cannon Lincoln CITIBANK is to withdraw from the UK life insurance underwriting business and is selling its Citibank Life Assurance unit to Cannon Lincoln, the UK life insurance subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation of Indiana. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. Just 18 months ago, Citibank made a significant push into the UK life business by acquiring the sales force of MI Group, a 700-strong sales team known for its hard-sell approach and reliance on cold-calling customers. At the time, Citibank Life had assets under management of Pounds 100m, which have since grown to Pounds 250m. Since then, Citibank has injected fresh capital into the subsidiary, most recently a Pounds 3.25m addition within the past few months, according to Mr Paul Curran, head of UK consumer banking for Citibank. Mr Curran said the move reflects the continuing rationalisation of the bank's operations worldwide. 'While we think life and pensions businesses are key, we don't think we need to be in underwriting,' he said. Citibank will continue as a 'tied agent' of the new combined entity, selling its products exclusively through its branches. Also, Cannon Lincoln sales agents will have access to Citibank customer lists and in turn, will offer some retail Citibank products, such as short term deposit accounts and mortgages to its own customers. The move is part of a growing tide of rationalisation in the UK life insurance business, spurred on by tighter disclosure regulations which are expected to heighten competition among firms. For its part, Cannon Lincoln said the acquisition is part of its strategy to play a significant part in the UK life insurance business. The combined businesses will have assets under management of over Pounds 965m and will become the 16th largest seller of unit-linked life and pensions products in Britain. It will have a combined sales force of 1,428 directly employed sales agents and 1,040 tied sales agents who sell Cannon Lincoln products exclusively but who are not directly employed by the company. After the acquisition, Cannon Lincoln will have 80 branch offices, up from the current 30, and its head office staff will roughly double to 720. Cannon Lincoln said there were currently no plans for rationalisation of staff following the acquisition.</p>

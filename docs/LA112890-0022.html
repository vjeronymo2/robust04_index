			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE CHECK OF BODYBUILDERS  </P> <P> I can't support The Times' editorial "Case of Mistaken Identity" (Nov. 16),  especially when you feel security officers should apologize for confronting two  questionable-looking individuals who happen to be using a ladies restroom, but  who just happened to be women themselves. Won't we admit that security  personnel are trained to spot unconventional appearances/behavior to protect  other women using the restroom, and if the two people the officers stopped just  happened to be a team of men plotting a robbery or rape, the press would  instead be praising the officers' caution.  </P> <P> Southern California was able to see the women bodybuilders on TV news, and --  sorry ladies -- anybody would have stopped them near a ladies restroom! Society  must be honest with itself. If we can expect sexist charges every time a woman  is approached, we are in big trouble. Society didn't choose their appearance,  and surely other women on the scene had to be grateful the two were checked  out. Let's be honest; they might have been men bent on violence, and our wives  and daughters might have been there. It's happened before -- but this time  security said no.  </P> <P> EDWARD T. BAGLEY, La Puente  </P></p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe's CIS aluminium imports rise 52% ALUMINIUM IMPORTS to western Europe from the Commonwealth of Independent States reached 550,000 tonnes last year, a rise of more than 52 per cent from the 361,185 tonnes imported in 1991 and well over three times the 123,452 tonnes recorded for 1990, according to estimates from the European Aluminium Association. Nevertheless, in spite of the output reductions forced on the European industry last year by low prices, for which the CIS imports were at least partly to blame, European production held up reasonably well. The association suggests that it slipped by 5.3 per cent, from 3.53m tonnes to 3.34m tonnes. The European industry did better than expected because in June the association forecast that 1992 output would drop to 3.28m. In the event, a smooth start-up at Pechiney's new smelter at Dunkirk in France helped to compensate for many of the cuts elsewhere in Europe. However, 1992 produced the third successive annual fall in European aluminium production and output was 7 per cent below the peak of 3.6m tonnes reached in 1989. And so far this year European aluminium production rates have continued to fall. According to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the output rate of 8,935 tonnes a day in the first quarter of 1993 is equivalent to 3.26m tonnes a year, just above the nine-year low reached early in 1992. The statistics will provide some ammunition for the association's campaign to have the European Commission impose severe quotas on imports of CIS aluminium to the European Community. Some analysts suggest, however, that the surge in imports from the CIS has benefited the world-wide aluminium industry by speeding up rationalisation. Mr Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, says: 'Our view is that one good thing to arise from the CIS dumping is that it has hastened the necessary rationalisation of high-cost European capacity'. Unlike the previous experience in the US - some smelters closed during the last recession but re-opened when prices picked up - 'many of the European closures will be permanent - and that can't be bad'.</p>

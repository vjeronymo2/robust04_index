			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Man United defeat hits shares SHARES IN Manchester United tumbled 52p to 527p yesterday in the wake of the English Premier League champions' elimination from the European Champions Cup. They recovered to 545p at the close. The defeat - over two legs and on the away goals rule - at the hands of Galatasaray, the Turkish champions, meant that the UK club failed to qualify for the lucrative mini-league stage of the competition. United would automatically have accrued some Pounds 1.27m for qualifying to this later play-off stage and then television fees and gate receipts could have brought in a further Pounds 4m. In the year to July 31, United lifted profits before transfer fees from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 8.19m. Touche Ross estimated that the aggregate value of the first team squad rose to Pounds 30m (Pounds 24m). The club currently leads England's senior league by 11 points.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] During the Warsaw Radio morning slot "Signals of  the Day" today, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and  finance minister, confirmed that there have been personnel  changes in his ministry. Two deputy ministers--Wojciech Misiag  and Henryk Chmielak--have been dismissed.    [Begin Kolodko recording] Today I am handing a thank you  letter to Dr. Chmielak and Minister Misiag, who will now be  working in a different capacity. This is in connection with  certain changes arising from the implementation of the Strategy  for Poland program, which is now official and has been adopted  by the Sejm. They are leading experts and we do not have enough  of them. They will be helping us out, using their experience,  expertise, and qualifications in a different way.    At 0805, on behalf of Prime Minister Pawlak, I will be  making  appropriate nominations. Dr. Krzysztof Kalicki from the Main  School of Commerce, a leading expert in monetary policy, will be  appointed as first deputy finance minister and secretary of  state. Professor Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, from the Law Department  at Warsaw University, who was until now my adviser on budget  policy, will be appointed under secretary of state, with  responsibility for supervising the budget sector.    I would like to add that these are not the only changes.  These are the changes that are being implemented today in this  ministry. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

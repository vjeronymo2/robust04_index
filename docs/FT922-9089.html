			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets: BAT runs smoke rings round history - The Bottom Line WHEN BAT Industries reported a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter pre-tax profit on Wednesday, you had to pinch yourself to remember that it was only two years since Sir James Goldsmith abandoned his attack on the conglomerate. The 'unbundling' of retailing and paper now seems like ancient history and no one any longer raises an eyebrow at the incongruity of BAT's remaining twin pillars of tobacco and financial services. The share price performance  -beating the FT-A All-Share Index by 20 per cent since the beginning of March and hitting a high of 807p last night - is evidence that the strategy has paid off. But with Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary, making terrible losses in the mortgage business, the improved perception of the group owes more to the relentless rise in tobacco profits (see chart) than to the newer, fancier financial services wing - which cigarette cash has helped to feather. An interesting statistic that did not make it into this week's presentation was that in the past five years, the world market for cigarettes open to international producers has increased from 1.7 trillion (thousand billion) to theoretically encompass the whole market of 5.4 trillion - including China, which remains difficult to penetrate. The growth has come from the ending of state monopolies in various EC countries, the opening up of the Far East under US trade pressure and the lifting of the curtain on eastern Europe. Fuelled by such US and UK brands as Kent, Lucky Strike and State Express 555, export volumes rose by 18 per cent in the first quarter. The potential for increasing penetration of new markets is illustrated by Japan, where the proportion of imported cigarettes smoked has risen from 3 per cent to 17 per cent. A few years ago, it would have been regarded as both tasteless and financially unsound to talk in a bullish fashion about the prospects for tobacco. The spreading of concern about the health risks was deemed to have turned the market 'ex-growth'. Now, however, financial sentiment has changed. The very bottom line is that BAT has been able to continue increasing dividends in spite of the problems at Eagle Star, enabling it to be compared favourably with the composite insurers. Nevertheless, the fall in the trading profit of continuing businesses, from Pounds 1.76bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.27bn last year, suggests that the diversification into financial services has been far from smooth. When the division's performance is broken down between the three main subsidiaries it is easy to spot the culprit: Eagle Star made a trading profit of Pounds 294m in 1989, but lost Pounds 392m last year. Meanwhile, Farmers Group, the US insurer bought for Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.93bn) in 1988, increased profit from Pounds 327m to Pounds 359m and Allied Dunbar, the life business, chugged ahead to Pounds 121m from Pounds 107m. As Farmers was bought for cash, the financing cost has been substantial. In the first quarter it knocked about 40 per cent off a record trading figure of more than Pounds 100m. Even the debacle at Eagle Star is now seen in a relatively sympathetic light. Although it paid partly for its aggressiveness in the mortgage indemnity market, the whole industry was caught out by repossessions and falling house prices. Eagle Star is now credited with moving towards lower-risk personal lines, with making the necessary premium increases to start rebuilding margins and with tackling the issue of distribution, which in the UK is typically done indirectly, through brokers. Recovery potential in financial services gives BAT two strong cards in the market rating game: steady growth from tobacco and bounce-back in the recession-hit part. Hence the high share price. Has it gone far enough? At last night's close of 807p, the prospective price-earnings ratio was 15 to 16 on a pre-tax profit forecast of about Pounds 1.5bn. The premium of roughly 10 per cent to the market looks deserved, bearing in mind the above-average yield and prospective dividend growth ahead of inflation. While scope for progress from a high point is limited, smokers would have done well to put their money where their mouth is.</p>

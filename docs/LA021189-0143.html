			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GANG MEMBER GIVEN 42 YEARS FOR SANTA ANA SLAYINGS  </P> <P> A Orange County judge on Friday ordered a Los Angeles gang member to serve a  total of 42 years to life in prison for the murders of two young men during a  gang battle in the streets of Santa Ana more than 4 years ago.  </P> <P> The sentencing of Ray Anthony Pina, 28, a member of Los Angeles' Diamond Street  gang, came 3 weeks after the acquittal of another man who was charged with  aiding in the slayings.  </P> <P> In that Jan. 19 decision, a jury returned a not-guilty verdict in favor of  Frank W. Halstead, 22, of Echo Park, who was the driver of one car involved in  the deadly confrontation with Santa Ana gang members on Sept. 9, 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought to Use Acquittal  </P> <P> Pina's attorneys had sought to use Halstead's acquittal as one reason for  granting Pina a new trial, because Halstead -- then facing criminal charges  himself -- cited the Fifth Amendment when brought to testify at Pina's 1987  trial.  </P> <P> But Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer denied this and other motions for a  new trial in sentencing Pina on Friday.  </P> <P> The judge, imposing the near-maximum sentence, ordered Pina to serve 10 years  to life in prison for attempted murder, 17 years to life for one murder  conviction and 15 years to life for the second murder.  </P> <P> Rather than allow Pina to serve the sentences concurrently, as is often done,  Rheinheimer ordered that the terms run consecutively for a maximum sentence of  42 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> "We're very happy with this sentence," Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton  said. "We feel Pina is an extreme danger to society who should get the maximum  sentenced allowed, and that's borne out by the legacy of dead bodies that he's  left behind."  </P> <P> Pina had a previous conviction on manslaughter charges in a different case,  Middleton said.  </P> <P> In the case for which he was sentenced Friday, Pina was convicted of fatally  shooting at least one of two F Troop gang members during the 1984 confrontation  in the 2000 block of West 5th Street in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Killed that night were Frank Villa, 21, and Anthony Silerio, 18.  </P> <P> Pina was a passenger in a car that night filled with Diamond Street gang  members.  </P> <P> Orange County prosecutors maintained that the Los Angeles gang members provoked  the confrontation by cruising down the streets of Santa Ana shouting "Diamond  Heads!" and verbally provoking the Santa Ana gang members.  </P></p>

			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Text] On September 7, the Kansai Science City Promotion  Organization published two reports entitled "The Academia Plan  for the Keihan Metropolitan Region," concerning future plans for  research activities in the Science City, and "The New Logical  City Image for Keihan," which describes a unified image for  municipal road development. The city's planning methods were  reviewed for the first time in 15 years since the 1978 release  of the Science City Construction Plan. These reports were  distributed to each concerned agency as a basis for future  discussions on the city's development.    The reports were compiled by the Science Council of the  organization, which was chaired by Juichi Oyabu, Professor  Emeritus at Osaka City University, and investigated by a working  committee established in April 1991. The "Academia Plan"  provided a research system for science and technology in Kansai  Science City. In addition, it advanced (1) research on the  foundations of human existence in philosophy and the arts; (2)  research on guaranteeing the conditions for the survival of the  human race, for instance on disputes, food, and energy; and (3)  research on future images of life, cities, and industry which  consider the coexistence of technology and the natural  environment as directions for the long overdue establishment of  research laboratories related to culture and society and future  themes the city must tackle.    In the "New Logical City Image," the 12 districts that form  Kansai Science City and the roads which connect them will be  interconnected in a logical system of ancient cities like  Heijokyo where the roads were laid out like the squares on a  checkerboard. The haphazard progress of building in each  district is unified under this "new logic." The objective is for  the Science City to give one impression.    These two reports written by the organization were  distributed to Kyoto Fu, Osaka Fu, Nara Prefecture, the National  Land Agency, ministries, agencies, municipalities, and the  financial organizations like the Kansai Economic Federation as a  basis for devising the grand plan for future support of Kansai  Science City.</p>

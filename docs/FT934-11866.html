			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Pint of beer still to include the head THE GOVERNMENT has decided not to blow the froth off a pint of beer, Philip Rawstorne writes. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, yesterday announced that pubs would be allowed to continue serving a pint that included 'a reasonable head'. The costs of the proposed change to the law, due next April, would have been out of proportion to the benefits to consumers, he said in a Commons written reply. Larger glasses and new bar equipment would have added an estimated 7p to the price of a pint. The Brewers' Society has advised pubs that the frothy head should not exceed 5 per cent of the pint.</p>

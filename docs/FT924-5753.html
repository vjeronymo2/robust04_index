			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Observer: Ship to Shaw Still on the subject of the Shaw clan, it's nice to see an old salt like Sir Brian Shaw (no relation to Roland) being put in charge of the Port of London Authority. More worrying is the fact that Sir Brian, who used to run Furness Withy, is also chairman of ANZ Grindlays Bank. The last person to double up as chairman of the PLA and Grindlays didn't have an easy time. Lord Aldington stepped down from Grindlays in 1976 after two years of heavy losses, and a year later he handed over a near-insolvent PLA to government trouble-shooter, Sir John Cuckney. In Lord Aldington's day Grindlays' problems were in its merchant bank - Brandts. Today they are in India where ANZ Grindlays is arguing with the Reserve Bank of India over a Rs5bn (Pounds 117m) claim. But Sir Brian has two big advantages over Lord Aldington. Now that the port of Tilbury has been privatised, the chairman of the PLA doesn't have to deal with bolshie dockers any longer. What's more he has a big portrait of Lord A hanging behind his desk to remind him of what can go wrong.</p>

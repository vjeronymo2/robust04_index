			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Telephone interview of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, by </F> Fawzi al-Jundi, from Cairo, date not given : "I Want To Give Up  My Official Responsibilities"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ  introduction]    [Text] The Arab people, from the Atlantic Ocean to the  Gulf, are following with mounting unease the deterioration of  events in Yemen. All are eager for the success of the union, a  natural thing between the two halves of Yemen, though reckless  bullets assassinate the hope in the Arabs' hearts. This war has  no winner and no loser. The loser is the spirit of restoring  Arab solidarity; the winners are those who seek to extinguish  the light in this nation, its movemennt toward development, and  collective action for greater stability here and in the Arabian  peninsula, the Gulf, and every Arab country, God willing.    [al-Jundi] Some observers think the failure of the Salalah  meeting between you and President 'Ali Salih was due to your  having proposed that the armed forces take action incompatible  with Yemeni unity.    [al-Bid] That is not true. We never did anything like that.  But our brothers in the Congress, or some of them, excel at  playing games, at maneuvering, talking, and misrepresenting  things. We leave it to you to pursue. We want to formalize the  document, nothing else. I hope everyone will abide by the  document on national consensus.    [al-Jundi] A prominent commander at the General People's  Congress has said that the Yemeni union can only be ended by war.    [al-Bid] Of course war. Those opening fire are aiming at our  union. We consider 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech of 27 April to  have opened fire on our unity. Perhaps the rest of the patriots  are rectifying this situation, because war and partition are two  sides of the same coin. If there is a motive for that, it is the  motive to destroy the union, though, God willing, despite all  our pains, we can survive this. Our people know that today there  are still breakaway groups from the 3d Brigade in the mountains  and on the roads. We cannot as yet supply statistics as to who  is alive and who is not, because they are still monitoring their  preparations in the 3d Brigade and the mountainous regions north  of Sanaa. They have their equipment, unfortunately. If the  action had been against their wishes, it would have been  possible to have no imminent collapse or pursuits of those who  lived, but they continued. The strange thing is that after  leaving the camp, organized preparations were seen in every city  with tribes--they were stacking barrels and clenching their  fists. How could this be, if the action was outside their  control, a big mistake in spite of those exerting all this  control? There are things time will reveal quite soon. We hope  to keep those who remain, and that they be destined to live,  both the 1st Brigade and the 2d. They are all sorely tried, and  offering their precious blood on land far from home. This is not  our battle. This is a crime being committed by a small group  that does not like Yemen, or the Yemeni people, or its union. It  is secessionists who are behind these deeds.    [al-Jundi] What is the role of the committee of political  dialogue after the militarization of the crisis?    [al-Bid] The dialogue committee, outside the coalition, is  active. I met them on Monday and Salih on Sunday. I wish them  further efforts and we will all cooperate with their initiative.  I welcomed it in my meeting with them.    [al-Jundi] The Yemeni Presidential Council issued a  statement  saying that the Council was legally and constitutionally  responsible for the protection of the united state in all its  regions.    [al-Bid] The former legitimacy is finished. What is called  the Presidential Council is a partitionist group, not the  Presidential Council we recognize in accordance with the  Constitution. The Presidential Council has, unfortunately, set  itself up as prosecutor, judge, and jury, and everything else,  and issued its verdict that the 3d Brigade was the cause before  the arrival of the committees--before the committees conducted  their investigations. How could it allow itself to do that? Is  this the Presidential Council? Is it not our right to admonish  this conduct, to understand that the people are aware, that they  know what's going on? This is one of their farces to impose  secession in the name of unity. This is not pro-union or a  legitimate action at all; it is a partitionist and isolationist  action on the part of individuals in the Presidential Council.  The Yemeni people know this. If they want to preserve the union  and stability, let them go back to the pledge document and the  accord.    [al-Jundi] Is there any hope that you will go back to work  in  Sanaa, the capital of the united Yemeni state?    [al-Bid] I hope to give up my official responsibilities, but  I will remain a combatant with the whole Yemeni people and all  citizens. As to Sanaa, Aden, or Ta'izz, they are all our cities,  and I am the one who recently proposed that the document capital  be Ta'izz; that would be where we work, given that it is in the  middle, and that most of the government staff is from Ta'izz. At  this point we are working from this capital, until the document  is implemented and the situation stabilizes in the two capitals:  the winter and summer capitals, Sanaa and Aden, in accordance  with the provisions of the document.</p>

The minister read the note where the  Treasury said it would not issue a special zero-coupon bond  series to sell to Brazil, but he did not believe it. He told a  reporter: "This must be the wrong note." Pedro Borio, Brazilian  Embassy press attache, who was already at home, was then  mobilized to find the "real" note. But the real note ended up  being the one the minister considered "wrong."    Two hours before, after his meeting with IMF officials, the  minister had met with Summers and said he was optimistic that  the IMF's delay in signing the stand-by agreement would not  prevent the Treasury from selling the zero-coupon bonds to  Brazil.    The major concern among government officials is that the  Treasury note could be interpreted by the creditor banks  committee as a signal to suspend the agreement to renegotiate  the debt. The operation to purchase the zero-coupon bonds on the  secondary market, which Brazil now will have to do, does not  create excessive concerns. The Central Bank already has been  making discreet purchases of these bonds through brokers.</p>

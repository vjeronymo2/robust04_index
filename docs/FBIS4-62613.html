			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 17, BNS -- The Latvian Farmers' Union and  its allied organizations decided Tuesday [17 May] against  leaving the ruling parliament coalition, which it forms with the  Latvia's Way faction.    The Farmers' Federation Council, which includes the Farmers'  Union, said it would continue talks with the government to  tackle the problems of farmers and ensure policy favorable for  the development of agriculture.    On the other hand, the federation plans to propose a popular  no confidence vote to the government and the parliament if they  fail to settle privatization of food processors, to protect food  market, to finance and credit farmers and to introduce favorable  taxation before the Aug. 1 deadline.    In addition, the federation demands a leadership shake-up in  the Economics Ministry because Minister Ojars Kehris is said to  be responsible for the unfavorable economic situation.    The Latvian Farmers' Union faction will not propose Kehris'  resigning in the Saeima (parliament) but will discuss it in  coalition sittings, said faction head Andris Rozentals.    Latvia has 180,000 individual farms at the moment, said  Farmers' Federation deputy chairman, Andris Auzins. From those,  only 1,000 are well-off, 7,000 to 8,000 "make the ends meet,"  while the rest live on family allowances and retirement  pensions, he said.    The agriculture suffers most from the chaotic situation on  the domestic market and the uncontrolled import of food stuffs,  Auzins said.    Agriculture Minister Janis Kinna argued that the Latvian  food  market was the best protected in the Baltics in view of the  introduced import tariffs on farm produce.    The Latvian Farmers' Union ran for the incumbent Saeima  together with the Farmers' Federation, the Unlawfully Repressed  Persons Association and the Daugavas Vanagi organization. In  the Saeima, it joined Latvia's Way to form the ruling coalition,  which now unites 47 deputies. From those, three have been  suspended on KGB collaboration charges.</p>

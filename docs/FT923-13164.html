			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Honeywell ahead after settling patent claims HONEYWELL, the US controls company, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in second-quarter net income, due largely to gains from settlements in a long-running dispute over camera technology. The group produced net income of Dollars 85.1m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.49bn, compared with income of Dollars 77.6m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.52bn in the same period of last year. However, some Dollars 7.4m in after-tax profits, or 11 cents a share, was due to Honeywell's settlement with various companies for their use of the company's patented technology for automatic focusing cameras. A court in New Jersey ruled in a test case in February that Minolta, the Japanese camera manufacturer, had infringed Honeywell's patent. Minolta subsequently agreed to settle the suit for Dollars 127.5m, and since then Honeywell has been reaching settlements with other camera manufacturers. It said yesterday it expected to report additional settlements in the third quarter. In the second quarter, its home and building controls unit made Dollars 48.2m in operating profits, up from Dollars 32.1m a year earlier, on sales up from Dollars 512m to Dollars 557m. The industrial unit made Dollars 45.1m, down from Dollars 58.1m, on sales which rose from Dollars 412m to Dollars 430.4m. The company said a changing product mix and aggressive pricing competition meant lower margins. The space and aviation business saw operating profits of Dollars 63.6m, compared with Dollars 60.6m, on sales down at Dollars 460.9m, compared with Dollars 548m. The sales drop was due to lower demand for commercial flight systems. The improved profit was attributed to 'rigorous cost controls, a favourable product mix in military avionics and non-recurring inventory valuation adjustments in commercial flight systems'.</p>

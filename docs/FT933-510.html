			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Georgia suffers another martyred moment MR Eduard Shevardnadze, safely back in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi yesterday, faces both the division of the country he leads into warring fiefdoms and the collapse of a 10-month policy mixing compromise with force, neither of which has brought him success. Bitter after his flight from the port city of Sukhumi, the last substantial base in the region of the Georgian forces that was finally taken on Monday by Abkhazian rebel forces, he blamed 'imperialist (Russian) forces' for the loss of the city. 'Sukhumi could have been saved even yesterday. Only Russia could have done it and we asked Russia to do it.' Mr Shevardnadze's keenly felt sense of responsibility for the loss of the city stems from the agreement he made in July with the Abkhazian leader, Mr Vladislav Ardinba, and the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, to withdraw Georgian forces from Sukhumi to allow negotiations to continue during a ceasefire. The negotiations were fruitless, the Abkhazian forces attacked the city  - and Russia, a guarantor of the ceasefire, sat on its hands. Though nothing has been stated openly, it seems clear that the Russian foreign and defence ministries were at odds - with the first proclaiming its readiness to uphold the agreement, and General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, flatly refusing to send troops to enforce it. He called instead for the Georgians to withdraw in the face of the Abkhazian attack. They have now done so and the Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet has been mobilised to assist in the evacuation of thousands of refugees fleeing the once-pleasant resort town. It seems clear that the Russian military, which has kept a large base at Gudauta, further up on the Abkhazian coast from Sukhumi, has at least winked at the supply of weapons to the Abkhazians from Russian sympathisers, together with the participation on the Abkhazian side of volunteers from the Russian North Caucasian states and further afield. Georgian officials go further, insisting that Russian soldiers and commanders, using the most modern weapons, took part in the fighting around Sukhumi in the past months. Either way, this has meant that the Russian military has, at least by default, commanded Russian state policy on Georgia, teaching the Georgians, whom Russians sometimes refer to as the 'spoilt children' of the former Soviet Union, a terrible lesson for claiming independence, refusing to join the Commonwealth of Independent States and - under the previous president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia - indulging in violent anti-Russian rhetoric. Mr Shevardnadze now 'rules' a dismembered country. Its three autonomous ethnic regions, South Ossetia, Adjaria and Abkhazia, have all claimed some kind of independence from Tbilisi. Adjaria, the smallest, is relatively peaceful but its leadership is at odds with the national government. South Ossetia, scene of violent fighting with Georgian forces in 1991-92, is now under de facto Russian protection and Abkhazia is largely held by the rebels. Further, the central Georgian region (it has no autonomous status) of Mingrelia has largely been infiltrated by troops loyal to Mr Gamsakhurdia, who is reported to be in Zugdidi, the region's main town, and is, according to the news agency Interfax, preparing a march on the neighbouring regional and industrial centre of Kutaisi. How far Mr Shevardnadze can count on his supporters for continued loyalty in the face of these reverses, and the return of Mr Gamsakhurdia, is the question of the moment. Mr Jaba Josseliani, leader of the Mekhedrioni faction in parliament and of the armed grouping of the same name, broadcast yesterday his loyalty to the Georgian people - but not to its leader. Mr Josseliani, with others of the chieftains whose opposition caused the violent ousting of Mr Gamsakhurdia at the end of last year, is unlikely to switch to the ex-president - but he may support an alternative to Mr Shevardnadze, or set himself up in his place. Georgian politics is clannish and violent: it is also inextricably mixed with the criminal gangs whose origins pre-dated Georgia's independence, but which have flourished in the relative anarchy and pervasive scarcity of goods during both Mr Gamsakhurdia's and Mr Shevardnadze's periods in office. Like many of the post-Soviet states, the government of the country is an embattled group with few resources, little administrative support or competence. The best of them struggle hopelessly to cope with the tasks of building a nation while its economy collapses, the rest of them simply use high office for personal or factional gain. Georgia has had not a day of internal peace since its independence was declared in 1990. Yesterday, its patriarch, Ilya II, said on television that 'the loss of Sukhumi does not mean that Abkhazia is lost to us forever. Even Tbilisi has been lost to us temporarily in history and that amounted to nothing.' In such a perspective, the present agony of the people in Georgia is another martyred moment among many - with more martyrs to its statehood yet to come.</p>

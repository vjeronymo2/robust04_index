			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 11 (XINHUA) -- J.P. Morgan Company of  the United States, the Barings Group of Britain, the Bank of New  York and other foreign consortiums have opened representative  offices in Shanghai since the beginning of this year.    The Shanghai office of the Barings Group also serves as the  China-based office of the European Consortium.    The Merrill Lynch Group of the United States, the largest  securities brokerage company in the world, opened its Shanghai  office in March 1993.    Since then representative offices have been opened by Credit  Lyonnais Securities Company, the Peregrine Brokerage Company of  Hong Kong, the Yamaichi International Company of Japan, the  Daiwa Securities Company of Japan, the Nikko Securities Company  of Japan and the Nomura International Company of Japan.    An economist in Shanghai said that overseas consortiums have  been spurred into action by the rapid growth of the securities  market in Shanghai.    Deals struck in the Shanghai Stock Exchange amounted to 500  billion yuan in 1993, he said.    The exchange currently offers 161 types of A-shares, shares  issued to Chinese to buy, up from only eight when it opened  three years ago. It also offers 28 types of B-shares -- shares  issued to foreigners to buy using hard currency.    A number of overseas consortiums are moving their Asian head  offices or their China head offices from Hong Kong to Shanghai,  the leading financial center in China, he said.    For example, in August 1993, Citibank of the United States  moved its China head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai.    The Morgan Stanley Company of the United States, which  opened  a representative office here earlier this year, has decided to  move its Asian head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai.    The economist said that other foreign consortiums which have  not opened offices in Shanghai are trying to obtain trading  seats in the Shanghai Stock Exchange so as to underwrite  B-shares.    Overseas consortiums are playing a major role in issuing  stocks and securities and helping China raise money, he said.    For example, in 1993 the Merrill Lynch Company undertook to  issue shares worldwide for the Shanghai Petrochemical  Corporation. Earlier this year, it undertook to issue bonds  worth one billion U.S. dollars for the Chinese Government  throughout the world.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading FT-SE futures led the share market higher as a squeeze built up in the derivative markets. Otherwise it was a painfully slow day's trading with a lack of institutional and retail interest. The June FT-SE 100 index moved to a premium to the spot index of 27 points at one stage as futures traders attempted to cover short positions built up the previous week. With fair value (the futures markets' theoretical premium) at just 15 points, there was a small amount of arbitraging between the futures and cash markets. This pushed the stock market higher, although towards the close another squeeze developed with June moving briskly ahead. June FT-SE closed up 28 points at 2,566, while its premium stood at 29 against 15 at the previous close. The doubling in the futures' premium is a sign of the market's belief that the immediate outlook for shares is positive. While the lack of institutional interest continues to cast doubt on how soundly based another rally would be, the prospect of further cuts in interest rates has encouraged the bulls. Turnover in Allied-Lyons traded options was boosted by continuing bid speculation, with call buyers in evidence. Total options turnover was slightly higher at 18,831.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In November Saitama University will establish a  forum for representatives of six Saitama engineering schools,  including the engineering faculty and science laboratory of  Saitama University, and three Kohsetsushi research institutes.  The goals of the forum are to discuss policies for promoting  industry in Saitama as prefectural industry becomes more  advanced and to seek methods by which the prefecture's research  institutions and companies can cooperate. Beginning in FY94 the  prefecture plans to make the research results of prefectural  universities available through the research institutes so that  the prefecture's companies can develop them. It will  aggressively promote exchange between industry, academia, and  government on industrial technology.    Participants in the forum will include six schools: Saitama  University's engineering faculty (Urawa), Saitama Institute of  Technology (Okabe-machi, Osato-gun), Shibaura Institute of  Technology (Omiya), Tokyo Denki University (Hatoyama-machi,  Hiki-gun), Toyo University engineering faculty (Kawakoshi), and  Nippon Institute of Technology (Miyashiro-machi, Nishi  Saitama-gun). In addition, it will include bodies under the  jurisdiction of the Science and Technology Agency (STA):  National Space Development Agency's Earth Observation Center  (Hatoyama-machi, Hiki-gun), Institute of Physical and Chemical  Research (Wako), and Research Development Corporation of Japan.    In addition to fostering mutual understanding and  cooperation  between universities and research institutes based in Saitama,  the forum will collect a broad range of opinions related to  Saitama's future industrial promotion policies. Some of the  broad topics they will discuss:    1) policies for cooperation between the prefecture's  engineering schools, kohsetsushi institutes, and small to medium  sized companies;    2) applications and utilization of research results by small  to medium sized companies;    3) policies for administrative support of increasing  exchange  between industry, academia, and government.    Regular meetings are planned at the rate of two per year  beginning in FY 1994.    Until now the separate efforts of sections -- such as the  industry, academia, and government section and the industrial  promotion section -- of the industry division have promoted  cooperation among the research institutes' professors and  researchers. In FY 1992-1993 approximately 40 members  participated in study groups on joint research between industry,  academia, and government and on the investigation delivering  grants and ventures given grants.    It is thought that the start of the forum will strengthen  cooperative links between the prefecture's universities and  research institutes.</p>

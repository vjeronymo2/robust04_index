			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will step up  the development of a shareholding economy this year in a move to  invigorate major state-owned enterprises, according to a senior  government official.    Li Junhua, director of the Municipal Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, said that one-third of the 1,000  major state-run enterprises in the city are set to be turned  into joint-stock companies this year.    A breakthrough was made in the number of shareholding  companies last year, he said.    In 1993 the municipal government approved 140 joint-stock  companies, bringing the number of such companies to 176. These  companies are engaged in commerce, science and technology,  manufacturing, finance, real estate development and consultancy  services.    Of the 176 companies, 108 are limited-liability companies,  Li  said. These 176 companies will eventually sell shares to the  tune of 9.92 billion yuan, with 95.6 percent to be issued to the  state and legal entities; the rest will be offered to Chinese  individuals and foreign investors to buy.    According to him, Tianqiao, Tianlong and two other  shareholding companies had their shares listed in China and  abroad in 1993.    He said, "their success marks a new stage in introducing the  joint-stock system to China's capital, and will help local  businesses participate in international competition and  institute a modern enterprise system."    Efforts will be made to enable more enterprises to issue  shares elsewhere this year, he said.    The Beijing Department Store Group, the urban and rural  trading center and two other shareholding companies are set to  issue shares elsewhere in February, he said.    Meanwhile, the Fangzheng Group and several other joint-stock  companies will try to issue shares overseas later this year.    Li Junhua said that the existing shareholding companies will  concentrate on transforming their operational mechanisms to as  to introduce a modern enterprise system as soon as possible.    "The shareholding system has injected vigor into  enterprises," he said. For example, assets of the Tianjin  Department Store Company, which led the nation in instituting  such a system in 1984, shot up to nearly 200 million yuan-worth  from 1.6 million yuan-worth last year, and its annual earnings  from sales soared from 27 million yuan to 200 million yuan.</p>

The rules include restrictions on the movement of boats and  other cargo ships inside the territorial waters and at the Gulf  country's ports, inspection of vessels and limiting the periods  of stay at port, Interior Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Badi, told  Friday's edition of UAE weekly AL-SHURUQ.    "These instructions have been conveyed to the Foreign  Ministry which will circulate them through diplomatic channels  to embassies of other countries," he said. "The new rules will  be strictly observed."    Al-Badi, former chief of the UAE armed forces, said  inadequate surveillance on shipping and ports in the UAE was  posing a security threat as most of the drug smuggling and  illegal immigration take place by sea.    He gave no figures on such activities but police records  show  more than 25,000 people from Iran, Pakistan, India and other  Asian countries have been arrested in the past two decades as  they tried to enter the UAE illegally.    Most of them came for jobs in the oil-rich country, tempted  by its lax penalties, proximity to their homelands and lack of  security along the coastline. This has prompted the UAE to  install more radars and step up coast guard patrols but the  problem has persisted.    The problem has also spurred calls for harsher punishment  against illegal entrants and shipowners who transport them. The  police records showed that the bulk of those immigrants arrived  by small boats, concealed under cargo.    "These people are only aggravating the country's security,  economic and social problems," a police official told AFP.  "Many of them can not find jobs and this prompts them to  indulge in crime. All those people are exacerbating the  unemployment problem since thousands succeed in sneaking in."    UAE authorities refuse to admit unemployment but according  to  government sources, more than 300,000 people are either jobless  or work illegally. The figure accounts for more than 40 percent  of the 700,000-strong workforce.    Inadequate surveillance of the 700-kilometre (437-mile)  shore  has also given rise to drug smuggling, reportedly originating  mostly from Iran and Pakistan. As a result, the UAE has become  the most vulnerable Gulf country to international narcotic  gangs, who are also tempted by its lax laws.    In 1992, around four tonnes of heroin, cocaine, hashish and  other kinds of drugs were seized in the UAE, accounting for half  the quantity busted in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC). The biggest drug haul in the region involved three tonnes  of hashish seized with 13 Pakistani smugglers in the UAE port of  Khawr Fakkan in 1991.    According to the new shipping rules, cargo vessels will not  be allowed to enter UAE territorial waters unless they produce  registration certificates, shipping permits, manifestos and  names of crew and passengers, al-Badi said.    Powerboats are not allowed to stay at port more than 72  hours  while dhows, the traditional Arabian wooden boats, can not stay  more than 21 days. They also must not move to another port  unless they have a shipment there.    "Crewmen will not be allowed in if they do not have naval  cards issued by their communication ministry," al-Badi said.    "We have also formed a committee which is now considering  setting up special centres at ports to receive users of our  ports to upgrade efficiency and boost security measures."</p>

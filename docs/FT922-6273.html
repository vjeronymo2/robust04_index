			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / West German industry in sombre mood THE MOOD in west Germany's manufacturing industry has grown more pessimistic about the country's immediate economic prospects in spite of better-than-expected gross domestic product figures for the first quarter. The results of the latest survey of business opinion by the Munich-based economics institute, Ifo, showed no expectation of an early recovery in exports. This view contrasts with a rather bullish economic assessment by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister. On the other hand, Ifo reported an appreciable improvement in the business mood in east Germany, where production is said to have stabilised. The most optimistic sector of all, predictably, is the east German construction industry, helped by big transfers of public and private funds from the west to revive the economy. The details were published yesterday as the main German public sector union, the oTV, formally agreed to call off strike action in spite of a union ballot rejecting a 5.4 per cent pay award. That piece of news, along with Mr Mollemann's estimate of a 2.5-3.0 per cent GDP growth in the first quarter, boosted German financial markets, although the longer-term scenario still looks gloomy. Last week's 5.8 per cent pay deal by IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, has lifted the storm clouds of industrial conflict from the economy, but that has yet to show through in business confidence. Indeed, the business community is clearly concerned at the level of the award - immediately adopted in both construction and printing industries - even though relieved there will be no widespread strike action. In his monthly commentary, Mr Mollemann said although the wage deals 'went far beyond the improvement in productivity,' they should at least remove uncertainty from enterprise planning. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said he saw no chance of a cut in German interest rates incurrent economic conditions, Reuter adds from Frankfurt. Mr Schlesinger said inflation was still running too high and wage increases, although lower than in 1991, were still steep and could not be compensated by increases in productivity. 'Under these circumstances, there is no chance to reduce interest rates at this moment,' he said. He expressed optimism that west German inflation could fall under 4 per cent by the end of the year. West German inflation was running at a rate of 4.6 per cent in April. He noted that west German wage increases also had an impact on east German wage levels. 'The rise in wages is clearly lower than last year. . . but wage rises of between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent. . . are still comparatively high,' Mr Schlesinger said, adding that wage increases of this size could not be compensated for by productivity gains either in the west or in the east.</p>

Commenting on the WASHINGTON POST's article in the TV  evening news bulletin "Panorama" on Tuesday, Kolodziejczyk said:  "I have reasons to believe that this is merely a big provocation  against the Polish Army and, perhaps, not only that."    The U.S. paper wrote on Monday that Poland had sold Soviet  arms, radars, tanks, torpedoes, and parts of anti-aircraft  systems to the United States for about 150-200 million dollars  during the 1980s.</p>

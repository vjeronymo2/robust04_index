			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (20): Change on the land - for good or ill  -Twenty-two per cent of the economically-active produce just 8 per cent of GDP FEW, if any, parts of the Mexican economy have been as subject to as much reform in the past four years as the agricultural sector. Since 1989 the government has eliminated almost all indirect subsidies, allowed more than half the farmers to sell their land for the first time, ended land reform, and, more recently, announced the removal of price supports for basic grains. Mexico's farmers have not yet seen much benefit. The agricultural sector grew by an annual 1.7 per cent in the four years to 1992, well below the average for the rest of the economy. The agricultural trade deficit has more than tripled. And hundreds of thousands of farmers have been left bankrupt after borrowing too much money. While critics charge that the crisis is proof enough that the reforms have failed, the government says the old system of supporting agriculture did not help Mexico's poorer farmers, and was prohibitively expensive. The new system, it says, will in time offer those who survive the shake-out a better standard of living. 'The reforms represent a profound transformation of Mexico's agriculture sector,' says Dr Arturo Warman, the government's Agrarian Attorney, 'but you cannot confuse them with an immediate solution. The changes open the possibility of a new development.' Mr Warman argues that the agricultural sector has been in crisis since 1965, and that the reforms have not made things much worse. Instead he and other officials point to bad weather, low international prices, and, above all, structural problems in the sector that date back to the populist agricultural redistribution policies of the 1930s as the principal causes of the current troubles. The government contends that Mexico's perpetual commitment to land reform and uncertain rules over ownership - which were reversed two years ago - made farms too small to compete in world markets, and deterred private investment. Years of protection meant farmers did not have to learn how to sell their crops to foreign markets. Poorly directed subsidies in credit, fertilisers and insurance made some farmers better off, but left the vast majority in poverty. The extent of the present problems are partly concealed by rapid growth in production of crops, such as corns and beans, that until now have been protected from imports. From 1989 to 1992 the production (measured in value) of corn increased by 52.8 per cent in real terms, and beans by 21 per cent. However, production of unprotected crops has nose-dived; rice production fell 19.6 per cent, soya by 40 per cent, and cotton by 80 per cent in the same period. On October 4 the government announced a radical new agricultural programme that would scrap price supports, and instead subsidise farmers according to how much land they own. The intention was to end discrimination in favour of basic grain production, which because of the increase in output of protected crops, was becoming increasingly expensive, and contributing to the decline of the unprotected sector. The programme, known as Procampo, breaks the link between subsidies and production, since a farmer will receive the same amount of aid whatever and however much he produces. It thus ends Mexico's long-term commitment to self-sufficiency in food, since output will in the future vary according to changes in international prices, and domestic costs. Procampo will eventually pay the 3.3m farmers who were producing subsidised crops between 400 pesos and 900 pesos for each hectare of land they cultivate, depending on the average productivity of the land. The subsidies will be phased in over the next two years at the same time as price supports are removed, and the market opened to imports. At present the government pays farmers about 750 pesos for a tonne of corn and pays another 160 pesos in transport and commercialisation costs. The international price plus delivery is about 450 pesos, the same average price Mexican consumers pay. The programme makes redundant Mexico's commitment under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) to allow US and Canadian corn exports without restrictions within 15 years, since Mexico will now open up unilaterally in two years. The scheme should encourage farmers to switch some production from formerly protected corn to export crops such as fruit and vegetables, and may arrest the decline in cotton, rice and other products subject to international competition. The diversification into value-added crops may be given a further boost by Nafta, which, if approved by the US Congress, would eventually remove US tariff and non-tariff barriers to such Mexican exports. Even without Nafta, exports of value-added products have surged in the past decade, taking advantage of the good climate in northern Mexico, its cheap labour force, and its proximity to the US. From 1980 to 1991 strawberry production increased by 420 per cent, tomato production by 57 per cent and melon production by 80 per cent. Procampo will have an important distributive impact in favour of the poor farmers in the south and centre of Mexico - one of the stated reasons the government is to go ahead with the reform. But it will also put cash in the hands of farmers a few months before next August's president election, and has thus been attacked as an attempt to buy votes. The average farmer in the rich northern state of Sinaloa produces six tonnes of maize per hectare, giving him, under the price support scheme, an equivalent subsidy of about 2,760 pesos per hectare - considerably less than the 900 pesos or so he will receive with Procampo. However, the average farmer in the southern state of Oaxaca produces less than two tonnes per hectare, most of which he consumes, so that he hardly benefits at all from the price subsidy. He will gain at least 400 pesos per hectare from Procampo. By injecting more than Dollars 3.7bn of cash subsidies into the rural sector every year, Procampo will give farmers money to improve quality of their land, and produce more profitable crops. With banks unwilling to lend to farmers because of the lack of guarantees in case of default, the land subsidy gives farmers a future cash payment that they can swap in return for credit. Not even the government contends that Procampo will solve Mexico's agricultural problems overnight. It admits it may in the long-run contribute to further decline in the sector. Many producers of corn and beans will not make a living selling crops at international prices, and will have to convert their land into non-agricultural use. Some recent studies by academic economists suggest that as many as 700,000 farmers could be forced out of work by full liberalisation of corn prices. While offering direct subsidies will soften the blow of price liberalisation, one official says: 'In the end we will have fewer people working in agriculture as a proportion of total employment. You cannot expect to improve the standard of living in the countryside, when you have 22 per cent of the economically-active nation producing just 8 per cent of GDP.' The implementation of Procampo is also likely to be difficult. 'Procampo sounds good on paper,' says one government official, 'but sometimes I wonder how it is going to work in practice.' The possibility of corruption is high, since the government will have to dole out cash payments to 3.3m farmers in a short period of time. The reform of the ejidos (communal land) will accelerate migration from the countryside. The reforms allow ejido farmers to sell their land, if a sufficient majority in the farm agree to do so, or rent it out. The changes also make it a lot easier for ejido farmers to enter into joint ventures with businesses, and formally end more than 50 years of continuous land reform. The changes have not yet had the impact hoped for, partly because the certification of land titles has been much slower than many expected. As part of the reform, the government agreed to certify land titles to about 102m hectares of land, about half of Mexico. Ejido land cannot be legally sold or rented out, and access to bank loans is difficult, until the land title is certified. The process has gone more slowly than some had hoped for, and the first title was only given out in August. Dr Warman says the programme of certification will not be finished until 1996 or 1997.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Property: A revamped Red Book - New rules and techniques for valuations The reputation of valuers was left in such tatters by recession that repairing the damage is going to be a long and difficult job. The question is whether the property profession will undertake structural repairs - to avoid similar damage during the next economic downturn - or simply try to restore a cosmetic gloss. By proposing to overhaul its valuation manual, known as the Red Book, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is taking the first steps towards restoring credibility. Its proposals are an encouragingly swift response to the Mallinson Report published in April, the most wide-ranging review of valuation practice undertaken which was chaired by Mr Michael Mallinson, formerly property director of Prudential Portfolio Managers. The 'new' Red Book addresses only those elements of the Mallinson Report which could be acted upon swiftly. Insurers have estimated, for example, that almost half of all professional indemnity claims could have been avoided if valuers had insisted on written instructions. This will now become mandatory. The deadline for comments on the new Red Book closed this week and the institution has received around 80 official responses. So what do valuers themselves make of the institution's attempts to bring practice up to scratch? While many comments are broadly favourable, concern centres on two main areas: the extent to which the new Red Book should govern all work done by valuers, including estate agency work; and the proposed introduction of new valuation concepts to sit alongside open market value, the basis on which valuations have traditionally been done. Although the old Red Book became the benchmark for all valuations, its rules only applied officially to very specific circumstances. In practice, these were usually situations where the valuation was going to find its way into public documents, such as published accounts, and probably comprised less than 10 per cent of all valuation work. But the institution has proposed that the new Red Book cover almost all valuations, including residential. This raises the question of when an opinion becomes a valuation. Valuers who do a lot of agency work are often asked for a valuation within a few days or less. Under such circumstances, they argue, enacting Red Book requirements will simply not be practical. Should valuers give customers what they want - a professional but speedy response - or should they insist on a more formal approach? The institution has suggested a compromise: advice to sellers during estate agency work is excluded from the new Red Book, but reports given to potential purchasers are covered. Even so, many commercial and residential estate agents will find working under the rigours of the Red Book something of a shock. 'The back of the envelope unfortunately remains a basic tool of the trade for many valuers,' said Mr Jeremy Waters, senior valuation partner with Jones Lang Wootton. The second area of contention goes to the heart of the valuers' work. The new Red Book will enshrine a new basis of valuation - estimated realisation price - to complement open market valuation. The concept of estimated realisation price has its roots in banking. Banks, the argument runs, are not interested in what a property is actually worth today, but how much they might raise if they decided to sell. Open market valuations are therefore too backward-looking. Estimated realisation price assumes a building is put on the market immediately and involves the valuer judging how long it will take to sell and how the market might move in the interim. The concept was given official approval in valuation guidance note 12, issued by the institution in conjunction with the British Bankers' Association earlier this year. The note was an honest effort to promote better understanding between valuers and bankers. Since much of the litigation surrounding negligent valuations has been brought by banks, few valuers would quibble with this aim. But introducing estimated realisation price into the wider context of the new Red Book is more controversial. There are three main objections: Most international valuation standards give open market valuation as a common method, so the UK risks moving away from accepted international practice by introducing an alternative. Rather than bringing clarity to valuations, clients will become confused about what the different bases offer. Valuations based on estimated realisation price could be open to abuse, because they involve an element of judgment about how the market is likely to move. Mr John Rich, head of valuations at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the surveyors, is openly opposed to the introduction of estimated realisation price. 'My main concern with what is being proposed is the new definition of value. There will be widespread confusion about what the different bases of valuation are supposed to provide,' he says. The debate surrounding the new basis of valuation underlines that the next phase of the reform process will be much more controversial. The Mallinson Report suggested a fresh look at the all-risks yield approach, the method of valuation used when open market evidence is not available. It also called for work on alternative methods based on the cashflow of a building. The report did refute suggestions that the all-risks yield approach was simplistic compared with valuation approaches used in other financial markets. But it also acknowledged that methods of valuation should withstand scrutiny if the profession is to retain clients' confidence. Reforms proposed so far do not go far enough. Much therefore depends on behind-the-scenes work on valuation techniques and the response of valuers to further reform. The real test will be whether the profession is prepared to adopt methods more in tune with the needs of its clients, even if that means changing other cherished tools of the trade.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mallinson Report recommendations still to be addressed  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Modification of all-risks yield approach  -Codifying discounted cashflow techniques  -Development of definition of worth (as opposed to value)  -Development of methods for expressing valuation uncertainty  -Standards for measuring and expressing price trends  -Guidance on derivation and expression of opinions on future prospects   for values  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

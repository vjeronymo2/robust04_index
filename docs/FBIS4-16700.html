			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS military analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The talks and consultations  on the Black Sea Fleet which provoked a discord between Russia  and Ukraine in the recent past, will need mutual concessions on  both sides but should be held by all means in line with the  agreement on the fleet which was signed by Boris Yeltsin and  Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow on April 15, a high-ranking officer of  the Russian Navy who refused to be identified, told ITAR-TASS on  Tuesday.    On the other hand, he added, naval experts are apprehensive  that the document opening the road to understandings on the  Black Sea Fleet, can be doomed to the same fate as the Massandra  Protocol singed by the two leaders last September, as well as  earler understandings on this difficult problem. Incidentally,  the protocol had clear benchmarks.    Experience showed that the adoption of documents does not  mean real moves by the Ukrainian side to settle the fleet's  problems.    Military sources in Moscow and Sevastopol report that  pressure on Russian servicemen continues in Izmail and Ochakov  even in the course of ten days which were given to draft an  agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in order to  force them to take the oath of allegience to Ukraine. Earlier,  similar attempts were made in Odessa and Nikolayev.    Military experts believe that the Moscow agreement on the  Black Sea Fleet has quite a number of "reefs". They note that,  under the agreement, Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea  Fleet, is not to have facilities of the Ukrainian Navy.    But it is highly improbable that Kiev will agree to this,  although it understands that the two powerful administrative  structures cannot rub elbows endlessly.    The cost of the Black Sea Fleet is another difficult problem  to be tackled by Ukraine and Russia while settling the destiny  of the fleet. One can count on serious progress in this sphere  only after the fleet's assessment as well as the calculation of  damage inflicted by Ukraine on Russia by "the lop-sided  privatisation" of fleet ships (the figure reached 60 in two  years' time).    Experts stress that the fate of the Black Sea Fleet can be  sealed only on certain conditions which Ukraine should fulfill.  For instance, it should not take lop-sided actions which will  challenge the sincerety of the negotiating process.    That was the essence of the warning issued by the Russian  president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov on April 16 who  said that the Ukrainian side, applying its usual "oozy" manner,  started interpreting the understandings reached by the Russian  and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow.    It began putting forth its own formulas concerning the  lease,  its periods and places of the fleet's deployment even before  talks provided for by the agreement started.</p>

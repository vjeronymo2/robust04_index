			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, 1 Feb. (PANA)--The Organisation of  African Unity (OAU) has expressed grave concern over about the  heavy debt burden of African countries which continued to  undermine the growth and development of most countries. In a  report to the 59th ordinary session of the OAU Council of  Ministers on Tuesday, the OAU said Africa's debt stood at 275.15  billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1992.    Even though the figures for 1993 are not yet out, the  organisation says "it is certain that their magnitude will not  have lowered to the desired level in order to relieve African  countries of the debt overhang". Since 1985, when member states  adopted the common position on Africa's debt, it has risen from  184.89 billion dollars to 275.15 billion dollars in 1992, an  increase of 49 percent. At the same time there has been a  continuing decline of resource flow.    "The situation is all the more alarming if one were to  compare the total debt to total exports or total gross domestic  product (GDP)" observed the OAU. For example, the debt/export  ratio increased from 361 percent in 1990 to 373 percent in 1992.  The debt service ratio to exports also increased from 30.1  percent to 35 percent during the same period.    "The severity of the debt burden on each and every African  country is significant especially if one takes into  consideration the ability to repay under the circumstances of  declining export receipts coupled with successive devaluations  of African currencies".    The OAU noted that the socio-economic conditions of the  majority of member states did not show any significant  improvement in 1993 in spite of the reform-driven policies which  have been introduced by governments since the beginning of the  1980s. Most economic indicators in 1993 showed a general poor  performance of African economies. At the 1990 prices, Africa's  GDP which grew at two percent in 1991, declined sharply to 0.7  percent in 1992, but picked up in 1993 when it recorded a mere  1.4 percent.    The main factors contributing to Africa's poor economic  performance include the deterioration of the terms of trade,  depressed commodity prices, low levels of investment, political  instability and inappropriate macro-economic policies.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Bush says Iraq will be forced to comply PRESIDENT George Bush insisted yesterday that Iraq would be forced to comply with United Nations resolutions despite Baghdad's threat to deny weapons' inspectors access to government ministries. At the same time a newly arrived UN weapons inspection team, due to begin work in Baghdad today, agreed to a one-day postponement because today is a holiday in Iraq. Referring to Iraq's recent resistance to weapons inspections, Mr Bush said: 'I can't tell how much of this is bluster. But they are going to comply with UN resolutions. I am absolutely certain of that.' The latest team of 22 UN inspectors is headed by a Russian, Mr Nikita Smidovich. Their visit is the latest attempt to discover remaining Iraqi stocks of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction. Previous UN inspectors were barred for 18 days from a ministry of agriculture building in Baghdad, before Iraq bowed to growing threats of renewed military intervention. On Thursday, the Iraqis threw down a further challenge, warning that no more visits to ministries would be permitted, a condition which a Pentagon spokesman in Washington described as 'preposterous'. Mr Smidovich has given no indication whether ministries are on the list of sites inspectors want to visit on this trip. But he said before leaving Bahrain: 'We have our orders and our rights are clear. We can visit any place in Iraq.' Mr Bush has refused to rule out the use of force if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein again defies the UN.</p>

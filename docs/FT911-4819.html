			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: TWA urges early route decision TRANS World Airlines, the heavily-indebted carrier, yesterday repeated its claim that it could be forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing if US government approval for the proposed sale of its London routes to American Airlines is not forthcoming 'immediately'. The route sale has proved controversial, with Mr Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation joining forces with TWA's unions to show an interest in acquiring the airline, so long as it retains the London routes.</p>

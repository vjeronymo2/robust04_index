			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / WDA to shed 17% of staff in shake-up The troubled Welsh Development Agency is to be decentralised with three new regional divisions and the loss of about 70 of its 420 jobs. The new structure was unveiled yesterday as the Labour party questioned the political impartiality of the agency's chairman and called on him to resign. The WDA's regional staff will be increased by 40 per cent to give stronger support to Welsh companies and to speed up urban and rural regeneration. The international division, responsible for inward investment, will also be reshaped. 'The agency will be slimmer, more effective and certainly in a shape that is more relevant to the next five years,' Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the chairman, said yesterday. He expects the changes to make cost savings of Pounds 1m annually The demand for Mr Rowe-Beddoe's resignation came from Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, who said the WDA chief had been chairman of the Conservatives Abroad Association in Monte Carlo. Mr Davies said: 'His role raising money and gathering votes for the Tories from tax exiles is wholly at odds with his job of public service at the WDA.' Mr Davies said it also called into question the future of Mr John Redwood as Welsh secretary. 'It strains credibility for John Redwood to call as he did in the summer for higher standards at the WDA, and to apologise to parliament for past lapses, yet appoint a chairman with strong partisan ties,' said Mr Davies. Mr Redwood said last night that Mr Rowe-Beddoe had been appointed because he was a very talented businessman. Mr Rowe-Beddoe said he had resigned from the association in Monte Carlo before becoming WDA chairman. 'I believe my appointment was for no political reasons whatsoever,' he added. 'I've never discussed political affiliations with the secretary of state either before, or at the time of, or following my appointment. I certainly believe I was selected as the best man for the job.' Referring to the highly critical report on the WDA last year by the Commons public accounts committee, Mr Rowe-Beddoe said the new structure was not a direct response but was a 'very important fundamental step' in the agency's reorganisation. Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said he was concerned that 'hidden' behind the decentralisation was 'a very substantial measure of privatisation . . . and a reduction in the capability of the WDA to offer a comprehensive package'.</p>

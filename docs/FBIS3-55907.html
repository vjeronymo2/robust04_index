Latvian Officials Call the Incident `a Provocation'"]    [Text] On 10 January, General Nikolay Taylakov, deputy  commander-in-chief of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of  Forces, and General Anatoliy Vodopyanov were arrested and  deported to Russia at the directive of Andrey Ruchs, chairman of  Riga's suburb of Vidzem. The arrest followed the Latvian  territorial defense troops' seizure of a military depot and  another official building held by Russian troops. Meanwhile,  local authorities said that the generals were arrested for fear  that they might attempt to mount armed security guard details at  the facilities that were to be handed over to Latvia.    Ilgonis Upmanis, chief of the Latvian Government's bureau on  the withdrawal of Russian troops, told BALTFAX that both  generals returned to Riga and that the republican prosecutor's  office filed a criminal lawsuit regarding the incident. Mr.  Ruchs, meanwhile, conceded that he had overstepped his powers.  Martins Virsis, chief of the Latvian delegation in talks with  Russia, has called the incident "a deliberate provocation,"  planned for a day when talks between Russia and Latvia were to  resume in Riga. His Russian counterpart, Sergey Zotov, said  that the beginning of the next round of the talks was out of the  question "until light is shed on this incident."    Given the situation, Russian Federation Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev ordered that units of the Pskov Airborne Division  be put on full alert.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Crime fear of small businesses SMALL businesses run a greater risk of becoming a target for crime than individuals or homes, a Home Office study of crime prevention schemes has shown, Charles Batchelor writes. The study found that 40 per cent of burglary victims suffered a second burglary within 12 months, and 48 per cent of 're-burgled' businesses suffered a third burglary. Up to two thirds of owners of small businesses were 'worried or very worried' about becoming victims of crime. The study recommends a seven-point plan for crime prevention. This includes closer co-operation between businesses in High Street Watch schemes, and better collection of data to identify patterns of crime against small business.

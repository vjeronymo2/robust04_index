			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / BBC confirms digital radio launch The BBC confirmed yesterday that it will launch a digital audio broadcasting service next September. Ms Liz Forgan, managing director of Network Radio, said in London yesterday that in addition to the existing five national BBC radio services there would also be extended parliamentary and sports coverage. The BBC says it is the first broadcaster in the world to make a firm commitment to launching a DAB radio service. The advantages of broadcasting a digital rather than the conventional signal include good reception everywhere without moving aerials. Car radios would be free of interference. 'The Proms will be crystal clear - even in a car,' Ms Forgan told a Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference. 'You'll be able to carry Radio 4 drama around the house without the signal breaking up or worrying about poking your eye out with an aerial.' The extra capacity provided by digital would mean access to parliament on an unprecedented scale and much greater coverage of live sport. The BBC executive yesterday urged manufacturers to get the special receivers on sale at the earliest possible moment and 'at a price listeners will find attractive'. Carat, one of the largest media-buying companies, says that between the third quarter of 1993 and the third quarter of 1994 Radio 1 lost 4.5m listeners. According to a detailed analysis by Carat Research 1m of the lost listeners were aged 15-24, even though Radio 1 has been trying to attract a younger audience.</p>

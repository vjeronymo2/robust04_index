			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Mozart Mania: A Mozart manuscript that had been locked away in a Philadelphia  seminary since the early 19th Century sold Wednesday for $1.7 million at a  Sotheby's auction in London. The International Mozarteum Foundation in  Salzburg, Austria, Mozart's birthplace, said that it had purchased the  manuscript with financial support from the Austrian government and the city.  The price for the manuscript of the "Fantasia and Sonata in C Minor" equaled  the world record for a single musical work set in 1989 for the score of a  Schumann piano concerto.  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Reuters Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in Reuters' shares to a new all-time high illustrates how the media company remains hot news. Since reporting its annual results last month, Reuters has risen 10 per cent while the FT-SE-A All-Share index has slid by 5 per cent. Some of the buying stems from technical factors. With about half the shares being held overseas, UK fund managers have been scrambling to re-weight their portfolios. That demand has squeezed the price higher in thin volumes. The risk is that the surge may tempt US investors to take profits, turning the UK's current drought of Reuters' shares into a deluge.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- A government job training  program designed to promote the transfer of technology to  developing countries got off to a poor start in fiscal 1993  because the number of applicants fell below expectations, a  Labor Ministry official said Wednesday [20 April]. The number  of applicants stood at 1,147 for the year ended March 31,  falling short of the 15,000 applicants envisaged for the first  year of the program, the official said.    Under the program, applicants will be given  Japanese-language  lessons and job training for the first year and then those who  pass a job examination test will be allowed to work in Japan for  a year without a working visa.    The official attributed the fewer-than-expected applicants  to  the sluggish economy, and the resulting drop in demand for  foreign labor.    The official also cited a hesitancy among employers to hire  those trained under the program.    Most applicants were from Asian countries. China led the  list of applicants with 602, followed by Indonesia with 426 and  the Philippines with 53.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In Four Years, Rents May Exceed </F> Wages"]    [Text] The introduction of a new system of paying for  housing and public utilities in the kray is under way. The  procedure for effecting transition to this system is prescribed  in Decree of the Russian Federation Government No. 935, dated 22  September 1993.    A week ago, kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko adapted the  government's decision to Maritime Kray, signing a decree with a  similar title--"On the Transition to the New System of Payment  for Housing and Public Utilities and on the Procedure for  Affording Citizens Compensation (Grants) in Effecting Payment  for Housing and Public Utilities."    In accordance with these documents, by 1998 an apartment  owner will pay 100 percent of the expenses for residential  upkeep and repair (except capital repair), as well as for public  utilities. Each year, beginning this year, the proportion of  money paid by citizens to compensate for these expenses will be  increased by 20 percent.    The social housing norm has been established in the kray at  20 meters per individual, and maximum norms for public utility  consumption (for example, 120 kilowatt-hours per family member  per month) became effective 1 March, within the framework of  which rents must not exceed 10 percent of a family's aggregate  income. The state is providing compensation and grants for this  purpose. Housing grant departments must be established in  administrations at all levels prior to 1 April.    Beginning 1 March, the proprietors of residences of all  forms  of ownership, including dormitories, will pay 20 percent of the  prime cost of housing and public utilities. According to  Mikhail Savchenko, chairman of the kray administration Committee  on Housing and Municipal Services, the average three-person  family in Vladivostok will pay 19,200 rubles [R] per month over  the course of this year for an average (two-room) apartment. In  general, citizens' expenses for the use of living quarters will  increase 17-fold.</p>

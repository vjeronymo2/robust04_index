			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / World Bank presses Asians to protect environment now The belief in rapidly growing Asian economies that prosperity must be assured before environmental issues can be tackled is incorrect, according to a World Bank report, published today. The report cites the principal causes of environmental degradation in Asia as government inaction, population growth, urbanisation and industrialisation, as well as the mistaken belief that strong economic growth is necessary to allow environmental protection. In the report - Toward an environmental strategy for Asia - the authors, Mr Carter Brandon and Mr Ramesh Ramankutty, argue against such a belief, saying that sensible environmental policies increase economic efficiency. 'The most financially viable environment-related investments are those that are good for both economic development and the environment,' the report says, 'including energy conservation, waste minimisation in industry (as opposed to end-of-pipe investments), recycling in the urban sector, fuel efficiency in the transport sector, soil conservation and sustainable forestry.' According to the World Bank, developing countries need to spend 2 to 3 per cent of annual gross domestic product to achieve greater 'sustainability'. In Asia, this translates into about Dollars 38bn annually by 2000, two-thirds of it in east Asia. 'It's cheaper to start with clean technology than to clean up afterwards,' Mr Brandon told a news conference in Bangkok. He cited the example of Japan in the early 1970s, when a public outcry meant that a quarter of all industrial investment was directed to pollution control equipment, instead of the usual 3 to 4 per cent. Increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent, by the end of the century, in itself would reduce the level of new capital investment required in Asia by Dollars 90bn, the report says. 'Not only are these savings very large, they are three times the cost of installing cleaner technologies on the facilities still to be constructed,' it says. One problem in convincing Asian governments of the need for environmental protection is the lack of data about the true cost of environmental destruction. Initial estimates suggest that air and water pollution in Bangkok costs more than Dollars 2bn a year, and in Jakarta more than Dollars 1bn. 'The magnitude of the (urban) problem is about 10 per cent of the total GDP of large Asian cities,' Mr Brandon said, 'while the magnitude of the solution is only about one or two per cent.' Some countries, however, are beginning to appreciate the scale of the problem. Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's prime minister, told a conference on business and the environment in Bangkok last week that the government would invest about Dollars 900m in environmental protection during the next five years. The World Bank report paints a grim picture of environmental decay in Asia. With vehicle numbers doubling every seven years, urban air pollution is at 'critical levels', and five of the seven cities in the world with the worst air pollution are in Asia. East Asian industry is now more than nine times the size it was in 1965, and emissions of industrial and toxic pollutants have increased exponentially. The report suggests a number of remedial measures, including pricing to limit the output of pollutants, vigorous enforcement of legislation, and public disclosure requirements to embarrass polluters.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLASNOST FICTION;  </P> <P> THE NEW SOVIET FICTION SIXTEEN SHORT STORIES BY SERGEI ZALYGIN (ABBEVILLE  PRESS: $22.50; 318 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 0-89659-881-0)  </P> <P> It is fitting that Sergei Zalygin chose the stories included in this volume of  recent Soviet prose. As the editor of the foremost Soviet literary monthly,  Novyi mir (New World), Zalygin inherits the mantle of his admirable  predecessor, Aleksandr Tvardovskii. When Tvardovskii edited Novyi mir in the  1950s and 1960s, he took every one of the few opportunities available to him to  publish poetry and prose that pushed at the limits of what was then  permissible. It was Tvardovskii who got the manuscript of Solzhenitsyn's "One  Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" into Khrushchev's hands, and -- with  Khrushchev's personal approval -- onto the pages of his magazine. Now, 25 years  later, it is Zalygin who has repeatedly promised his readers Solzhenitsyn's  work, including "The Gulag Archipelago," though he has so far been foiled by  ideological watchdogs. (The October, 1988, issue of Novyi mir, its back cover  heralding Solzhenitsyn's publication in the new year, was kept back until a new  cover could be printed.)  </P> <P> Over the last two or three years, under Zalygin's editorial guidance, Novyi mir  has been one of the very few journals to open its pages to both "conservative"  and "liberal" voices, though its bias favors the pro-Gorbachev, pro-perestroika  forces. Some of the boldest commentaries on the Soviet economic crisis and on  Soviet history -- including a scathing critique of Lenin -- regularly share  space with poetry and prose from the past and the present, from the emigre  heritage (Nabokov, Brodsky) and from "internal emigres" whose voices were  silent for the last decade or more. ("Doctor Zhivago" finally made its  appearance in Novyi mir's first four issues of 1988.)  </P> <P> That same ungrudging welcome of diversity is evident in Zalygin's selection of  stories for this anthology. Two of the stories, I. Grekova's "No Smiles" and  Vladimir Soloukhin's "Stepanida Ivanovna's Funeral," were written 20 years  before they finally reached their readers; several others date from 1986-87,  but more than half of the 16 stories were published before 1986, which is when  most observers date the real blossoming of glasnost. That does not by any means  make them bad stories: On the contrary, several of these "early" works are  among the strongest in the book.  </P> <P> All but one of the stories -- ably translated on the whole -- were written in  Russian, but several authors are non-Russian, offering foreign readers a rare  glimpse of life in Baku (Elchin's "Auto Accident in Paris"), in Tallinn  (Valton's "Love in Mustamagi"), in Soviet Georgia (Mishveladze's "A Question  Mark and an Exclamation Point"). Stylistic and philosophical traditionalists  such as Soloukhin and Valentin Rasputin comfortably coexist with the modernist  self-consciousness of Andrei Bitov and the disorienting fantasy of Viktor  Konetsky. Zalygin seems to have been guided by a desire to offer American  readers some sense of the range of fiction now available to Soviets, and while  his choices are perhaps a little cautious, by and large they succeed: No  generalities about gray Soviet prose or "socialist realism" will survive a  reading of this motley work.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, I will venture a few generalizations. Several of the most  readable and accessible stories re-create everyday Soviet life with all its  grim scarcity and frustration. Soloukhin's 20-year-old description of trying to  bury his mother, first published in 1987, is a howl of pain. He is outraged by  an economy in which even coffins are a "deficit product" for which he must  stand in line; he is maddened by a bureaucracy that makes him lie or pull  strings simply to get a priest to officiate. Most of all he is contemptuous of  a system that transforms a funeral into a battlefield, forcing grief to be  displaced by involuntary triumph at hard-won victories. Less emotional but no  less telling are Vladimir Makanin's "Antileader" and Tatyana Tolstaya's "Fire  and Dust." These are two of the most gifted artists currently writing, and both  portray ordinary people -- loving, weak -- whose dreams are corroded by time  and whose inarticulate envy sometimes explodes in violence.  </P> <P> Several stories involve fantasy. Sometimes fantasy abruptly tears an otherwise  dryly realistic fabric. In the Estonian story, "Love in Mustamagi," an ideal  love consummated in long stares and meaning smiles engenders -- somehow -- a  baby girl, imposing a humorous, implausible perfection on an altogether  imperfect world. Bitov's "Pushkin's Photograph" sends a man of the future back  to the era of Pushkin in order to photograph the poet and record his voice.  With the blend of playfulness and erudition familiar from his novel, "Pushkin  House" (Farrar Straus Giroux, 1987), Bitov's time-travel goes awry. Past and  future, poetry and history, imagination and reality blur into a phantasmagoria  with its own logic but without conventional boundaries.  </P> <P> The most explicitly political story in the volume is I. Grekova's "No Smiles."  Grekova, now in her 80s, is a mathematician by profession as well as a  consistently published writer of stories and novellas. (Two of the latter came  out in a Harcourt Brace Jovanovich volume entitled "Russian Women" in 1983.)  This story, however, was not published when it was written in 1970, and no  wonder. "No Smiles" concerns the hounding of a scientist who is accused of a  "fallacious orientation in research," and though it is set in an unspecified  country in the vague future, it reeks of Soviet truth. The sour taste of  ostracism is acutely conveyed in the heroine's sense that she has entered a  hostile world: Once able to count on an amiable environment, she is revolted to  find herself counting the smiles in the corridor instead.  </P> <P> Without personally enduring such an experience, one is unlikely to get closer  to the hideous ordeal of a "Discussion" -- that is, a witch hunt disguised as  constructive collegial criticism -- than via "No Smiles." The heroine's dry  mouth and "heavy feeling of flight," as if she were watching from the ceiling;  her unspoken commentary on the rank careerists and the true believers; her  ringing ears and the sporadic deafness that turns her ranting critics into  ludicrous silent movie actors -- it is all so real and so vile that her courage  is astounding. "I refuse to admit my mistakes," she says, as if she has no  choice but to be courageous, "because there were none. I am right. Burn me if  you will, but I can't do anything else." Grekova is no relativist: She is  willing to identify heroism; she recognizes integrity. But neither she nor her  heroine ever becomes complacent, or reduces complexity to simple categories.  And both of them recognize the appallingly high price that heroism and  integrity can exact.  </P> <P> Inevitably, not every story in "The New Soviet Fiction" will appeal to every  reader. But anyone who is curious about today's Soviet society, who wonders  about the reality and limits of glasnost, or who simply likes good fiction, can  gain a great deal from this volume.  </P></p>

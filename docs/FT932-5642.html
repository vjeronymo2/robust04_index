			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Doubt cast on single currency goal: Schlesinger says EC's 1997 target 'increasingly improbable' THE target of creating a single European currency by 1997 was 'increasingly improbable', Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, admitted yesterday. He insisted that the strict convergence criteria for economic and monetary union had to be maintained, in spite of fears that few, if any, European Community members will be able to meet them during the current recession. Yet he went on to suggest that one of the criteria - that government debt must be reduced to 60 per cent of gross national product - might be less critical than those controlling inflation and current budget deficits. Speaking to German bankers in Bonn, Mr Schlesinger rejected recent fears of 'competitive devaluations' by European currencies, warning that such charges could undermine co-operation in the European Monetary System. He defended the recent performance of the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, on the grounds that those currencies based on 'stable fundamentals' like the French franc had been successfully defended against speculative attacks. Mr Schlesinger said that the changes within the EMS had been a process of correcting unrealistic exchange rates - in particular those of sterling, the lira, peseta and escudo - and not 'competitive devaluation'. He declared that the D-Mark was no longer the single dominant currency within the ERM, but sought to counter any suggestion that it was itself heading for devaluation. In a wide-ranging speech in which he set himself firmly against any acceleration in the current process of gradual interest rate cuts in the lead rates on the German money markets, Mr Schlesinger also rejected claims that the German economy was facing its deepest recession since the war. He warned, however, that the recession could get worse unless the government acted urgently to cut its budget deficit, including unpopular cuts in social spending. Mr Schlesinger admitted that the importance of the D-Mark as the world's second reserve currency meant that the country faced daily re-assessment by the international financial markets, 'and we do not always provide good news'. Yet in spite of all the structural problems of unification, the ever increasing public sector deficits, and the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, the D-Mark had not suffered any serious loss of confidence. As for the long-term future of European economic and monetary union, he said it would still need big efforts for member states to fulfil the economic convergence criteria.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: China Airlines in Dollars 110.4m share offer CHINA Airlines, Taiwan's flag carrier, has launched a public offer of shares worth TDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 110.4m), becoming the island's first airline to go public, Reuter reports from Taipei. Applications to buy the 41m shares, priced at TDollars 68 each, will be accepted from today. CAL plans a stock exchange listing in mid-February. 'The offer will help us raise money to repay debts and finance purchases of new aircraft,' CAL said. It plans to expand foreign operations. CAL is currently 85 per cent owned by the China Aviation Development Foundation, technically a private body. The remaining 15 per cent was sold to local companies and CAL employees in share placements that began late last year. The public offer will reduce the foundation's ownership to about 80 per cent. Foreign investors will be allowed to buy the shares. CAL has remained profitable in recent years despite the difficulties faced by many international airlines. In the first nine months of 1992, pre-tax profits were TDollars 4bn on revenue of TDollars 33bn. CAL, which flies to 26 countries and territories, operates a fleet of 30 aircraft and plans to expand this to 34 by the end of next year. A recent survey found CAL was the world's fourth most profitable airline, after British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific.</p>

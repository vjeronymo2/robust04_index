We have calculated a preliminary less than fair value margin of zero percent for Thai furfuryl alcohol sold in the United States during the period of investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on June 20, 1994, (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case (59 FR 38201, July 27, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 19, 1994, officials of the Department of Commerce (the Department) visited the petitioner's facilities to observe the furfuryl alcohol production process for purposes of developing the questionnaire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 3, 1994, we issued the antidumping questionnaire to Indo-Rama Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. (IRCT), which accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). In August 1994, the Department conducted a questionnaire presentation in Thailand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRCT submitted responses to the relevant sections of the Department's questionnaire on September 6, 1994, and September 21, 1994. On September 16, and October 3, 1994, the petitioner submitted comments regarding deficiencies in IRCT's questionnaire responses. A supplemental questionnaire was issued on October 6, 1994. On October 14, 1994, the respondent submitted its response to this supplemental questionnaire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of the petitioner, on October 18, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until no later than December 9, 1994 (59 FR 53634, October 25, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 14, 1994, the petitioner alleged that the respondent was selling furfuryl alcohol in the home market at prices below the cost of production (COP). On November 21, 1994, based on the petitioner's allegation, the Department initiated an investigation of sales below the COP ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford dated November 21, 1994). The Department issued IRCT Section D of our questionnaire on November 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The respondent had originally submitted purchase price (PP) data in response to Section C of our questionnaire. However, as more information was put on the record, it became unclear whether prices to the United States should have been reported on a PP or an exporter's sales price (ESP) basis. Accordingly, on December 2, 1994, the Department requested that the respondent submit ESP data. (On several occasions prior to December 2, we had suggested that respondent submit this ESP data if respondent thought it was necessary ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  memo to file from Greg Thompson dated December 2, 1994).) On December 7, 1994, the respondent submitted the ESP data. Based upon the information that is now on the record, we are treating IRCT's U.S. sales as ESP transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OH). furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. IRCT reported that it sold merchandise in the home market identical to that sold in the United States. Accordingly, no difference in merchandise information was reported in IRCT's sales listings. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales by IRCT of furfuryl alcohol to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of this preliminary determination, we have found that all of IRCT's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore, we based USP on ESP prices, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated IRCT's ESP sales based on FOB U.S. storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. In accordance with section 772(e) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the following movement charges: foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for credit and warehousing expenses, and indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States and in Thailand. Finally, we added duty drawback to the USP calculations in accordance with section 772(d) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 834 F.

In those cases where the respondent failed to provide any information on duty drawback, we made no addition to USP as BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD eased in the afternoon from earlier highs, but spot metal was still fixed at a five-week high of Dollars 346.25 a troy ounce. Some profit-taking crept into the market, which touched levels above Dollars 348 at one stage after New York opened higher than expected. Gold is looking to consolidate above Dollars 345, before a test of Dollars 350, traders said. Dealers said the morning cuts in German interest rates were the key supportive factor, with the market ignoring dollar strength. There was little sign of heavy producer selling, and intermediate resistance was brushed off. Most BASE METALS on the LME ended the day higher in both dollar and sterling terms, after nervousness caused by the currency market activity caused irregular movements. Traders said the ERM realignment and German interest rate cuts, although not likely to have any immediate impact on metals demand, were expected to aid economic recovery in the longer term. A threat of renewed industrial action by Polish COPPER miners came just as the kerb closed but gave an early boost to the after-hours inter-office market. London's sterling COCOA prices fell in spite of the dollar's sharp rise.</p>

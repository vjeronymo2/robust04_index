			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI VALLEY;  </P> <P> REVISED WATER PLAN IS MORE OPTIMISTIC  </P> <P> Casitas Municipal Water District has drafted revisions of a five-year water  management plan that sparked controversy when it was adopted in 1985.  </P> <P> The board will take public comment on the revised Urban Water Management Plan  through Dec. 19, when it will hold a public hearing on the plan.  </P> <P> The 1985 plan was attacked by environmentalists who said it was too vague, that  it did not do enough to prevent a water shortage and that it gave the district  too much power over smaller water agencies inside its boundaries.  </P> <P> The plan had predicted customer demands for water could outstrip the district's  available supply before the year 2000.  </P> <P> The revised plan paints a rosier picture by showing a possible surplus of  almost 5,000 acre-feet of water by 2005. The district serves the Ojai Valley  and parts of Ventura.  </P> <P> The new document outlines many conservation measures the district has  undertaken since the board declared a water-shortage emergency in April, such  as requiring agricultural irrigation audits and low-flow plumbing fixtures in  remodeled dwellings.  </P> <P> More conservation efforts, higher water rates and imported water from the  California Aqueduct are calculated to provide the surplus.

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Competition hits Nat Power - Market share expected to fall in face of nuclear and gas-fired plants NATIONAL POWER, the largest electricity generator in the UK, expects its share of the power market to fall by some 7 to 8 per cent to the low 30s over the next year, Mr John Baker, the company's chief executive, said yesterday. The fall, foreshadowed at the company's annual general meeting last month, is the result in part of increased competition from nuclear and gas-fired plants. Most of National Power's units are coal or oil fired. Mr Baker was speaking to regional journalists. He forecast 'good double digit dividend growth' for the current year. Plans were well advanced to reduce the group's dividend cover from the current 3.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent over the next two years, he said. His comments come amid widespread speculation about the future of National Power and PowerGen, the other main electricity generator, arising from an inquiry by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, into their costs and margins. The inquiry has been given added impetus by a rise in prices in the elec-tricity wholesale market since April. Prof Littlechild has said he will decide by the end of the year whether to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Some analysts believe National Power is unduly pessimistic in its public announcements. Mr Baker said it had become increasingly difficult to offset lower earnings with cost reductions, and earnings growth for the company over the next few years was uncertain. On coal he said National Power had not been able substantially to reduce coal stocks. Prospects for burning more coal in the foreseeable future were 'pretty remote'. This confirms the worst fears of British Coal which increasingly believes additional sales this year, essential if reprieved pits are to stay open, will be small. Mr Baker said it was in everyone's interest to have an efficient domestic coal industry. The company would try to take more local coal over the next few years, but it had to be at competitive international prices. Mr Baker confirmed intentions to expand abroad. 'By the end of the decade we hope that between 10 and 20 per cent of our earnings will come from overseas investments.' He indicated that he expected the government would sell its 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen by this time next year, provided there was no reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'The Treasury would clearly like to sell and we would be happy to co-operate,' Mr Baker stated.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Benefits of merit pay questioned by Acas PERFORMANCE-related pay rarely achieves completely what it is meant to do, Acas, the conciliation service, said yesterday, Lisa Wood writes. Mr Ted Ridley, principal adviser in the Acas work research unit, said that in spite of the popularity of performance-related pay there were often far more effective systems of motivation and reward for managements to introduce if they wanted to improve their organisation's performance. He said employers should look at alternative ways of motivating and rewarding employees.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (1): Air of quiet satisfaction  -Many people recognise the difficulties India faces - and the need for further radical reforms. What is missing is any widespread sense of urgency. India, it seems, will modernise - but at its own steady pace India is beginning to enjoy the first fruits of the economic transformation it launched three years ago. Foreign investment and exports are rising fast, the stock market is up, and long-stagnant industrial output is starting to recover. After six years of good harvests, the richer farmers are content - and spending money as never before. An air of quiet satisfaction hangs over the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, whose position is stronger than at any time since he took over the ruling Congress (I) party from the assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. He has steered India through a balance-of-payments crisis and through the unrest which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992. The Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition party whose supporters stormed the mosque, no longer looks the threat it was a year ago. Mr Rao has silenced his critics in the Congress party and seems likely to stay in command at least until the next general election which is due to be held by mid-1996 at the latest. While the post-Ayodhya violence came as a shock, India has avoided the deep-rooted social unrest which has hit Russia and some other states struggling with pro-market reforms. As Mr Rao told the Financial Times in a recent interview: 'The best thing is to show people that (reform) works . . . Perhaps in many other countries it has taken a longer time, therefore people have lost their faith and all kinds of difficulties are threatening to come. In India fortunately we have been able to convince the people though, of course, much more remains to be done.' The question is whether the celebrations will prove short-lived - or whether India has at last entered a time of rapid and sustained economic modernisation. With luck, including further adequate monsoons, the energies released by the reforms which have already been carried out should enable India to achieve the government's target of a steady growth rate of 5-6 per cent over the next year or two, up from an estimated 3.8 per cent for the year ending this month. However, this aim is quite modest, given that India grew at an average rate of 5.5 per cent in the pre-reform 1980s. To reach a significantly higher rate, India may need to undertake the radical reforms it has so far largely avoided - notably organising large-scale investment in infrastructure and cutting its bloated public sector. Moreover, as ministers acknowledge, without a growth rate of above 6 per cent, the country is unlikely to create jobs for its unemployed and underemployed masses or generate sufficient resources for education, health care and other development spending. As Mr P Chidambaram, a former commerce minister and staunch supporter of reform, says: 'Only if we grow at 6-8 per cent for 10 years will growth percolate down to the poor.' The immediate prospects seem bright. In last month's 1994-95 Budget, Mr Manmohan Singh, the reformist finance minister, deliberately relaxed curbs on public borrowing to stimulate growth, the second pump-priming in two years. He also extended the deregulation policies which have been a central feature of reform since 1991, cutting peak customs duties from 85 per cent to 65 per cent (300 per cent before 1991). He announced an overhaul of the complex and confused domestic indirect tax system. He cut interest rates by a percentage point to 14 per cent for the minimum lending rate. The Budget also set out plans for further financial market reforms, including steps to promote efficiency in banking and insurance. Mr Singh admitted he was taking a calculated risk with the public finances by permitting high levels of public borrowing. He justified the decision by pointing to record food stocks and record foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 14bn (up from Dollars 1bn in 1991) combined with much idle capacity in industry. Businessmen have pledged to seize the opportunities created by the pro-growth Budget. Industrial growth in the first half of 1993-94 was just 1.6 per cent; but there are signs of a marked recovery in the winter, led by consumer demand. Rural outlets, in particular, are posting large sales increases as farmers spend some of the gains of the good harvests. Indian companies are raising record amounts of capital: though some of it is being used to repay bank loans, some is intended for substantial projects. For example, no fewer than five oil refineries and nine petrochemicals complexes with investment totalling Dollars 30bn are planned, though not all are likely to come to fruition. For foreign investors, India looks more promising than at any time since independence. With signs of the Chinese economy over-heating, many international investors looking for alternatives among developing countries are turning to India and its vast unexploited market of 890m people. Since mid-1991, India has approved foreign direct investments totalling Dollars 5bn, including over Dollars 3bn in the past year. Much of it is concentrated in power, a top government priority. The amount actually flowing into India is also growing - from Dollars 148m in the 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 1.5bn in 1993-94. Foreign financial investment has mushroomed, since India in late 1992 opened its stock market to foreign institutions and eased rules for Indian companies to issue paper overseas. Investment from these sources has soared from virtually nothing three years ago to an estimated Dollars 3.5bn in 1993-94. The growth has been so fast that it has clogged the Bombay market's settlement machinery. Across India, there are high-growth cities where reforms are already bringing wealth. In Bombay, businessmen are no longer embarrassed about being rich. 'Before even if you had a Mercedes, you kept it in the garage,' says one,' Now it's okay to take it on the streets.' Jobs for well-educated commercially-minded young people are growing fast, particularly in financial services, advertising and other business services. Bombay yuppies no longer limit themselves to Indian-branded goods but shop for foreign names, often abroad, but increasingly in India, where, for example, Lacoste T-shirts, Ray-Ban sunglasses and Pierre Cardin ties are all available. The same is true in affluent corners of Delhi and in Bangalore in the south. Some rural districts also share in the spreading wealth, notably in the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, and in Punjab in the north, where farmers have grown rich supplying the nearby cities. Scores of entrepreneurs are benefiting from the expansion of exports - up 21 per cent in the 10 months to the end of January - and from exporters' tax-breaks. 'If you can't make money exporting from India now,' says Mr Narayana Bhatt, a Bangalore-based exporter of leather garments, 'then you should not be in business.' What is to prevent the activities of Mr Bhatt and thousands like him from pulling India towards full-scale economic modernisation? Unfortunately, there are potential blocks on the road to modernity, and not all of them are being tackled with sufficient vigour by the government. First, while the government cut public borrowing in the early stages of reform, it is now relaxing the purse strings. The biggest surprise in last month's Budget was the revelation that the fiscal deficit for the year 1993-94 would reach 7.3 per cent of GDP - compared with a target of 4.7 per cent. The target for 1994-95 was set at a generous 6 per cent. Mr Singh defended his decision by saying that there was scope in the slow-moving economy for pump-priming. The underlying reason is that the government does not wish to reapply the brakes so close to important state elections this year and the next general election. The danger is that inflation - now running at 9 per cent annually - may rise, adding to the sufferings of India's poor. It would only take a bad monsoon or an external shock such as a rise in oil prices to knock the government's plans off course. Poor infrastructure is an even greater hurdle. While India is making progress in trying to attract private investment into power projects, it will be the late 1990s before these new schemes make much of an impression on the general shortages. The government originally planned to install 48,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 1991-96, a figure cut to 30,500MW because of financial constraints. However, a review late last year showed the public sector would only build 13,000-14,000MW; private companies would have started work on stations with an output of 3,000MW. The inadequacy of telecommunications is equally acute, with investment delayed by a combination of legal disputes over contracts for mobile telephone networks and political argument about privatisation policy. The liberalisation of investment in roads, rail and ports is even further away - though domestic air travel has quite successfully been opened to privately-owned carriers. The inefficiency of publicly-owned services and industries remains a strong drag on the economy, accounting for nearly half the nation's capital but producing only about 27 per cent of its output. The government has sold stakes in leading state-owned enterprises, including banks, steel operations and electronics manufacturers. But ministers have opposed selling more than 49 per cent of a unit for fear of losing control. As Mr C Rangarajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, says: 'There's not been much movement on reforming public sector units, we recognise that. Partial disinvestment is where it stands.' Ministers are also reluctant to liberalise India's restrictive labour laws, which seriously limit employers' rights to make surplus workers redundant. While companies can find ways around the law - through voluntary schemes and redeployment - large-scale dismissals are virtually impossible. Finally, India's progress could be held back by the low educational standards of much of its population. Only 52 per cent of Indians can read, compared with about 75 per cent of Chinese. It will take time to integrate the remainder, or even their children, into a modern economy. None of these medium- and long-term problems is insoluble. India has one of the best-educated elites in the developing world, including civil servants, businessmen and technical experts. Indians living abroad are a fund of energy and ideas, as well as capital. Many of these people recognise the difficulties the country faces - and the need for further radical reforms. What is missing is any widespread sense of urgency. India, it seems, will modernise - but at its own steady pace.</p>

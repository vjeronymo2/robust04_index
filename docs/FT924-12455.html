			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson advances 17% JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group, yesterday turned in a 17 per cent increase in third-quarter net earnings on sales which rose nearly 12 per cent, helped by a lower tax rate and a weaker dollar. The company had net earnings of Dollars 425m, or 65 cents a share, against Dollars 363m, or 54 cents. There were fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter following the company's Dollars 500m stock buy-back programme in the second quarter. Pre-tax earnings increased 12.3 per cent in the quarter. The company's sales of Dollars 3.48bn in the latest quarter were lifted about 3.8 per cent by the benefits of a weak dollar. During the quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson was charged Dollars 116m, plus interest, in damages awarded to Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing. The company also received Dollars 74m from the settlement of a lawsuit with Amgen. Johnson &amp; Johnson said the net result of these had no material effect on third-quarter earnings. For the first nine months, the company had net earnings of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 2.05 per share, on sales of Dollars 10.25bn, against earnings of Dollars 1.19bn, or Dollars 1.78, on sales of Dollars 9.3bn.</p>

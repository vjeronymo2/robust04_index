			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITIZENS TO RESEARCH HOLIDAY ALTERNATIVES  </P> <P> The city is looking for 11 residents to serve on a task force that will be  asked to find holiday observances the city can sponsor without offending  people's cultural and religious values.  </P> <P> The City Council voted in September to form the citizen task force after  protests from residents and local churches shot down a plan to set up a  Christmas tree outside City Hall this December.  </P> <P> There was also criticism of a plan to establish some form of prayer at the  start of council meetings.  </P> <P> Several residents who testified before the council said a Christmas tree  officially endorsed by the city government would offend their non-Christian  beliefs, and a prayer or silent moment held before council meetings also would  offend many.  </P> <P> After the plans for the tree failed by a 2-2 vote, the council approved the  idea of the task force as a means to find inoffensive ways for the city to  sponsor holiday displays or celebrations.  </P> <P> Applications to the task force will be accepted until Nov. 30. The 13-member  task force, which will include two members of city's Cultural Affairs  Commission, is expected to issue its report to the commission in March.  </P> <P> The commission is expected to present its findings to the City Council in  April.  </P> <P> Residents should call the city at (714) 724-6684 to request an application.

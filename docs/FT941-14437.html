			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Second Consolidated plans to make Pounds 25m capital repayment Second Consolidated, the investment trust which took over the unquoted and illiquid assets of Drayton Consolidated from Invesco, is planning to make a capital repayment of about Pounds 25m after realising more than half of the trust's initial assets. Second Consolidated was created out of the remains of Drayton Consolidated in November 1992, and is managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial, with the intention of winding it up within three to five years. The board announced a 20.6 per cent increase in net asset value for the trust's first year to end-October, while the share price rose 72.7 per cent to 171p. The discount to net asset value has fallen from 36.8 per cent to 11.4 per cent. There will be an ordinary dividend of 2.1p, but this level is likely to decrease as investments are sold. The capital repayment, by means of a capital reduction, is planned for late March, subject to shareholders approval. Realisations totalled Pounds 12.1m to end-October, but since then sale proceeds have increased to Pounds 29.7m. The trust has disposed of about 40 per cent of its stake in Oak Industries, the Boston-based cable television component company, realising Pounds 5.3m, and sold its entire holding in Peregrine International Holdings, realising Pounds 7m. The placing of the Oak shares was complicated by US securities regulations, which meant the trust was unable to sell at short notice when the share price was at its height. Further gradual disposals may be more straightforward. The geographical distribution of the fund has shifted towards a US weighting, as most disposals were in the UK, but the strongest growth was in the US portfolio, particularly Oak Industries and Mid-States. US assets account for 64.5 per cent of the portfolio, against 45.1 per cent initially.</p>

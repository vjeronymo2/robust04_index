			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sheinberg steps down at Goldman Sachs Mr Eric Sheinberg, the Goldman Sachs partner from whom Mr Robert Maxwell's former employees are seeking restitution of some of their pension assets, has resigned. From the beginning of the 1995 fiscal year, Mr Sheinberg, Goldman Sachs' longest-tenured general partner, will become a limited partner, the status accorded those who are no longer pursuing full duties. He will continue to work as a proprietary trader - buying and selling shares for the firm's own account. A spokesman for the firm said Mr Sheinberg had asked to become a limited partner to give himself more time to pursue his personal interests. Goldman Sachs partners may not withdraw their capital from the firm in full upon retirement, but withdraw it over a period of years instead, usually in the form of interest on the sum they have built up. Mr Sheinberg became a general partner in 1971 after 10 years with the firm. An internal memo credits Mr Sheinberg with having pioneered the concept of '24-hour trading' in international securities markets and for introducing US-style block share trading to the European markets. In April, lawyers for the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme Trustees and the Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme filed lawsuits in New York each seeking Dollars 57m from Goldman Sachs and Mr Sheinberg personally in connection with the alleged diversion of scheme assets. The lawsuits, which are continuing, also seek unspecified damages. The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m (Dollars 90.20m) of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman Sachs and for which the schemes were never paid. Both Goldman Sachs and Mr Sheinberg have said they will vigorously contest the charges.</p>

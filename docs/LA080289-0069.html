			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHEERLESS AND UGLY';  </P> <P> LIFE INSIDE L.A.'S SLUMS: A WINDOW ON DESPAIR  </P> <P> Maria Figueroa has bought cans of Black Flag to fight cockroaches, and set  traps to catch mice. She has nailed boards across one screenless window -- so  the children won't fall out. She has put a large piece of plywood over another  window -- to prevent stray bullets from fights in the street from shattering  the glass above her bed.  </P> <P> The 22-year-old Salvadoran immigrant -- one of perhaps 450,000 people who the  city estimates live in slum conditions in Los Angeles -- so far has refused to  surrender to the challenges of living in a little square box of a room at the  Cameo Hotel.  </P> <P> Most of her time is spent confined to this 12-by-12-foot space, which she  shares with her two little girls and her two brothers, who recently fled El  Salvador. She, Claudia, 1 1/2, and Yaritsa, 3, share the double bed while the  brothers sleep on the floor.  </P> <P> "We find ourselves under these circumstances," she says without a trace of  self-pity, "but we can't afford to get a better place."  </P> <P> When officials speak of slums in Los Angeles, they talk about supply and  demand, tax laws, city task forces and the demographics of immigration. But the  tenants tell a more basic, and tragic, story about the ugliness of these  buildings, with their broken fixtures and leaky pipes, rats and maggots,  endless noise, crime and fear.  </P> <P> Once, the Cameo, just west of downtown at 504 South Bonnie Brae St., was a  decent place. Made of solid brick and decorative trim, it was built in 1925 for  tourists, who at the time considered nearby MacArthur Park a prime Los Angeles  attraction.  </P> <P> Now, the carved relief "cameo" sculptures on the facade are gone or covered  with graffiti. A fire escape climbs the front, ruining whatever grace was lent  by the original design. A steel gate slices the lobby in two, making the place  look more like a prison than the entrance to an apartment house.  </P> <P> Over the years, as the surrounding Westlake neighborhood deteriorated,  transients, prostitutes and drug addicts moved into the Cameo. By the early  1980s, Cubans from the Mariel boat lift were there. They were so rough, one  former owner claimed, he had "to pay them off" just to get inside.  </P> <P> Today, most of the 700 or more tenants living in the 174-unit building are,  like Figueroa, from El Salvador. The majority are families with children,  paying $250 to $275 a month. No deposit is required and utilities are included.  </P> <P> This is about the cheapest possible rent in Los Angeles, but even so, people  don't stay long. They move as soon as they can do better. Figueroa, there two  years, is considered a longtime resident.  </P> <P> The building has been a subject of several city prosecutions in the last  decade, for unchecked vermin, defective plumbing, gaping holes in walls and  ceilings or unsafe conditions in the event of fire.  </P> <P> It is also among 11 properties named in City Atty. James K. Hahn's suit against  142 property owners and their lending institutions, charging that they milked  the buildings for profit and failed to maintain them.  </P> <P> The suit calls the Cameo a "transitional slum" because the current owner,  Mordehai Ben-Horin of Encino, has been fixing it up. Even so, he is a defendant  along with his lender, Bengal Discount Corp. of Inglewood. He is accused by the  city attorney of being a "straw man" for other hidden owners, an allegation he  denies. Bengal is one of a cluster of affiliated lending companies that have  financed slum properties throughout Los Angeles for several years. Bengal  recently settled a portion of the case.  </P> <P> Indeed, Figueroa and other tenants say the building is a much better place than  it was a few months ago. The rats and maggots that fed on human excrement and  garbage in the halls and stairwells are gone. So are the winos and addicts who  crept in at night to sleep in the passageways.  </P> <P> There are other buildings that appear much worse. The front of 521 S. Union  Drive a few blocks away, for example, is full of graffiti. Garbage spills out  of dumpsters by the front steps.  </P> <P> Herminio Ruiz, a 28-year-old cook who pays $280 for a "single" that includes  three small rooms, shows holes where plaster has crumbled away and mice have  come in, worn screens, warped windows and ceiling stains from leaks.  </P> <P> This building is not included in the city attorney's suit, but the Department  of Building and Safety has proposed that it be one of the first three  properties in the city placed in a new "rent escrow account program." This  would enable the city to place tenant rentals in special bank accounts; owners  cannot retrieve the money until they make repairs.  </P> <P> Another building, at 4020 S. San Pedro Ave., southeast of the Coliseum, is part  of the suit and has "the look" common to Los Angeles slums: long, dark, narrow  hallways, institutional brown paint and walls and ceilings full of bulging  lumps, left from years of patching holes. The common bathrooms at the end of  the halls smell, and their walls are mildewed.  </P> <P> Here, in Luz Ruiz's one-room unit, she shows holes in the walls, a door that  cannot close properly or be locked and a window that won't close. But the  toughest part about living in this building, she says, is the waiting in line  every night, either to use the common toilets or bathtubs at the end of the  hall or the one four-burner gas stove downstairs.  </P> <P> "There are definite effects on the psyche and physical well-being on people  that are forced to live like this," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy  for disease control for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.  Serious and even life-threatening health conditions can result from rat  infestations, lack of adequate water supplies and extreme hot or cold  temperatures, particularly for infants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cheerless and Ugly'  </P> <P> But slums are also "a depression-inducing environment," Fannin noted. "Much of  the hopelessness you see among poor people has a lot to do with their  environmental situation, which is so cheerless and ugly."  </P> <P> The effect can be "very long-lasting to a child or to an adult's self-esteem,"  she added. When children play in dark hallways because it is too dangerous to  play in the street, she asked, "What kind of distorted image of life comes out  of an early childhood experience based on fear of other people, or fear of the  streets or of being outside?"  </P> <P> Several buildings named in the city's suit have been recently cleaned up, and  like the Cameo, have fresh coats of paint in the halls and new lighting. But  physical improvements alone don't turn a building around if the people and the  neighborhood remain the same. So the Cameo is still a slum.  </P> <P> Just as Figueroa still battles cockroaches and persistent ceiling leaks at the  Cameo, the small 22-year-old with a heart-shaped face and short, curly dark  hair must also deal with the street where she lives.  </P> <P> Two of the three buildings on Bonnie Brae that are closest to the Cameo are  vacant. The street has a "narcotics problem," according to police, and nearly  every night men furtively gather in small groups, or stagger along the sidewalk  by themselves. If a stranger pauses near the billiards joint on the corner,  someone approaches moving his arm up and down as if shaking dice -- a signal  there is rock cocaine for sale.  </P> <P> "They don't let you sleep," Figueroa said. "In the morning I wake up, I'm very  tired. They yell and they throw bottles. They break bottles fighting."  </P> <P> Noise is ceaseless inside, too. There is loud music in other rooms, the sound  of people walking on the floor above and the shrill cries of children playing  in the halls because there is nowhere else for them to go.  </P> <P> According to Los Angeles Police Officer Phil Michaelson, the senior patrol  officer in the area, the Cameo no longer has much of a drug problem, but it is  a place where tenants argue a lot with each other. When police are dispatched  to the building, he said, "most are dispute-type calls."  </P> <P> Figueroa doesn't spend much time outside, except to go to the store for food in  daylight hours. She spends most of her time watching the children or cleaning  her unit, which like most slum apartments, seems oppressively overcrowded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Keep Bad Spirits Away'  </P> <P> Actually, there is very little here: an old refrigerator, a particle-board  dresser and two metal chairs. A wall shelf holds a small black-and-white TV, a  clock radio, stuffed animals and plastic flowers.  </P> <P> A small Central American herb called a ruda sits on the window sill. She mixes  its pungent leaves in a drink "when the children are afraid," she explained,  "and I use it to keep bad spirits away."  </P> <P> A corner of the room has become her "kitchen," which she has tried to spruce up  by sticking blue contact paper unevenly to the wall. Here she has a hot plate,  two pots, a frying pan, a strainer and two forks in a glass.  </P> <P> Her $250 rent takes half her monthly welfare money. She has worked, she said,  as a maid, for $60 a week, and in a garment factory for $90. She stopped four  years ago when she met the father of her children. He is no longer there.  </P> <P> "This is what happens to all the women," she said, in a matter-of-fact tone.  "They just leave the women with the children and you have to fend for yourself.  That's what happened."  </P> <P> On the first of every month she takes the rent money in cash to the lobby. She  gives it to Adolfo Estrada, a 34-year-old who sits in an office with bars  facing the lobby, like a cage.  </P> <P> Tenants tend to say he is "malo," the Spanish word for bad, and "mean." Some  seem genuinely afraid of him. They talk of fights they have had with him, or  the angry way he reacts when they say something needs repairing.  </P> <P> "Sometimes he won't give us the mail," Maria Melgas said. "I ask for the mail  and he says there's no mail if you don't pay the rent."  </P> <P> "He seems to always pick on the women," added another tenant, Aidee Alcantara.  </P> <P> Estrada, for his part, doesn't try to hide his contempt for tenants at the  Cameo. "I was in one building before in Echo Park," he said vehemently one day.  "The people were nice. This area is different. Different people. It's more  difficult." The worst part, he said, is that they are "not clean."  </P> <P> Melgas and Alcantara are friends of Figueroa, visiting back and forth every  day. When these two attend English classes to meet their amnesty requirements,  Figueroa takes care of Melgas' baby and Alcantara's 4-year-old. Because she  came illegally in 1983, fleeing the war after guerrillas wiped out her family's  crops, Figueroa does not qualify for amnesty.  </P> <P> One day, as often happens when they get together, they talk about the building.  </P> <P> "The ceiling is down again," said Melgas, a 30-year-old with five children.  "Pieces of it are falling."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jailed for Wife-Beating  </P> <P> Alcantara commented that one of her neighbors was jailed for beating up his  wife. "But he's getting out today."  </P> <P> They snort derisively at the boric acid the owner has had placed along the  floorboards to fight cockroaches. They do not believe it works, but Melgas said  she doesn't buy spray and fight the bugs as Figueroa does. "What can you do? We  just let them run. They're everywhere. They crawl all over me."  </P> <P> She wonders if this is why "one of my little boys, he's got rashes all over and  he's losing his hair."  </P> <P> The women call Ben-Horin "Senor Ben" and say they see him around often. He  tends to wear jeans, an old shirt and work shoes when he's there. His gleaming  white Mercedes convertible is parked outside.  </P> <P> Ben-Horin, 59, bought the building in December, 1987. It was one of 12 Los  Angeles properties previously owned by Vijaynand Sharma, who had defaulted on  his loans.  </P> <P> Sharma was convicted in 1987 of the largest number of slum violations in city  history. He is now a fugitive and has not served any of his 20-month jail  sentence.  </P> <P> Ben-Horin said most of the properties, including the Cameo, were in bad shape  when he got them. The former manufacturer, by his estimate, has spent more than  $300,000 on the Cameo alone, putting in new boilers and a fire sprinkler  system, relighting the halls and repainting. He needs to spend another $150,000  to finish repairs, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces Trial  </P> <P> Apart from the city attorney's civil suit, he still faces trial this summer on  criminal charges for code violations that were also filed by the city attorney.  Stephanie Sautner, head of the city's slum housing task force, said the agency  took the action because "work was proceeding too slowly."  </P> <P> "Too slow by whose standard of measure?" Ben-Horin responded, saying he  believes that he is being unfairly targeted because he took over buildings  owned by Sharma, whose case was highly publicized. Given the poor condition of  the Cameo when he bought it, he believes that he is going as fast as he can.  </P> <P> "There is God and there is the city," he said, exasperated.  </P> <P> City officials often fail to take into account the damage tenants can cause, he  said, explaining that slum conditions come from both "tenant habits and the  accumulated failure on the part of the owner to keep up with repairs."  </P> <P> Once repairs are done, he continued, "what it will be in a year's time depends  on what kind of tenant is there."  </P> <P> In one building he finished repairing last year, several panels of the new  solar heating system on the roof were smashed and several of the newly  installed carpets badly stained.  </P> <P> But the Cameo tenants say a lot depends on how well the repairs are done. Some  of the work in their old building seems purely cosmetic.  </P> <P> "It leaks here," Figueroa said, taking a metal rod to poke at her bathroom  ceiling, which routinely breaks down from leaks. It had been recently repaired,  again.  </P> <P> "They come, they put a board up there," she said. "It collapses and they come  and put another board."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Sydney Pollack, the Oscar-winning American director, says he is planning to  film a love story set in the turmoil of Cuba a week before the triumph of its  1959 revolution. In Havana for the Cuban Film Institute's 30th anniversary  celebration, the director of "Out of Africa" and "Tootsie" told Cuban  television Saturday that he is thinking of using Cuban actors for the film. He  did not elaborate, however, and did not say whether the film will be shot in  Cuba. Pollack first visited Cuba in 1986 for the annual Latin American Film  Festival.

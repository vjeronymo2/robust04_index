			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR SCUTTLED PLAN FOR PEACE TALKS, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> In a stinging rebuke to Israel's caretaker prime minister, the State Department  said Monday that Yitzhak Shamir torpedoed a U.S. initiative that was "on the  verge" of producing unprecedented direct peace talks between Israel and a  representative delegation of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Shamir's continuing rejection of the American plan "will probably mean losing  an important opportunity to move the peace process forward," the department's  statement said.  </P> <P> The statement, read by department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, injected the  Bush Administration directly into Israel's continuing political crisis by  strongly implying that the country will have no chance for peace as long as the  74-year-old prime minister remains in power.  </P> <P> Shamir is in the early days of a 21-day mandate to form a new government to  replace the national unity coalition he headed until March 16. At that time,  the coalition fell after Shamir rebuffed the peace initiative put forward by  Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Shamir's archrival, Labor Party leader  Shimon Peres, who supports the Baker plan, failed last week in an attempt to  form a government of his own.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, and the Reagan Administration before it, have made no  secret of their preference for Peres. However, the U.S. government tried to  soft-pedal its attitude in public because it wanted to avoid charges of  meddling in Israeli politics.  </P> <P> But the department's Monday statement, approved by Baker and other top  officials, amounted to a direct, point-by-point reply to remarks by Shamir in  an interview earlier in the day.  </P> <P> In the interview on Israel Radio, Shamir mocked Peres' assertion that Labor  pulled out of the national unity government because Shamir's refusal to say  "yes to Baker" had stalled the peace process.  </P> <P> "I must say there is something perhaps ridiculous in the very slogan 'Yes to  Baker,' " Shamir said. "What is this 'Yes to Baker'? We are happy we cooperate  with the U.S. government in the bold effort to reach some sort of agreement  with the Arab world in the conflict between us and them.  </P> <P> "But if there is understanding and cooperation between us and the United  States, no one can expect we will accept every proposal or idea of an American  secretary of state, come what may," Shamir said.  </P> <P> In its response, the State Department said, "Saying yes to Secretary Baker's  (proposal) meant saying yes to the government of Israel's (own) plan, yes to  Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and yes to peace. Continuing to say no will give  us very little to work with. . . . "  </P> <P> Under the Baker plan, the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt and the United  States would meet in Cairo to select a Palestinian delegation to negotiate with  Israel over conditions for West Bank and Gaza Strip elections. The Palestinians  elected would negotiate a peace agreement.  </P> <P> The elections were originally proposed last May by Shamir, but West Bank and  Gaza Palestinians refused to participate unless they were given a voice in  determining the rules for the balloting. Baker's plan was intended to get over  that hurdle.  </P> <P> Tutwiler's statement came much closer than Administration officials ever have  before to claiming that Shamir balked at a time when the effort was nearing  success.  </P> <P> "The government of Israel asked us to find a Palestinian partner from the  (occupied) territories to help implement its May, 1989, initiative," Tutwiler  said. "We were on the verge of accomplishing that objective. Indeed, we felt we  were close to producing Palestinians from the territories who were prepared to  talk to Israel about the elections in the territories." She added that the  Baker plan "would have enabled us to achieve this."  </P> <P> Meanwhile in Jerusalem, several thousand Israelis, including a group of army  reserve officers on a hunger strike, staged a protest rally in front of the  Parliament building to demand changes in the electoral system, the Associated  Press reported.  </P> <P> Israel Army Radio said that more than half a million Israelis, an astonishingly  large number in a nation of only about 5 million, had signed petitions  demanding electoral reform.  </P> <P> The petitions were presented to Chaim Herzog, who holds the largely ceremonial  post of president. Herzog called for electoral reform and criticized Israeli  politicians for showing a "total contempt for the principles of democracy."  </P> <P> Under the Israeli electoral system, the Knesset's 120 members are elected on a  nationwide ballot that assigns seats to a bewildering variety of political  parties on the basis of their proportion of the vote. No party has ever won a  majority, so all governments have been coalitions.  </P> <P> The present Knesset is so evenly balanced between Shamir's Likud Party and  Peres' Labor Party that neither man has been able to cobble together the 61  votes needed to install a government.  </P></p>

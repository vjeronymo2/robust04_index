			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard hit by weak prices ELLIS &amp; EVERARD, the chemicals distributor, yesterday announced a fall in profits despite an increase in turnover, as margins in the UK and US continued to come under pressure. 'It hasn't been the easiest of years,' said Mr Stephen Bentley, finance director. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 12.6m as chemical prices remained weak, especially in the US. At the interim stage turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 198m while profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 7.5m. Preymer (Spain), a 70 per cent owned subsidiary, the acquisition of which in 1990 marked the company's entry into continental Europe, continued to disappoint and incurred a small loss. But turnover increased to Pounds 383.4m (Pounds 357.9m), helped by acquisitions and the dollar exchange rate. In dollar terms, US turnover increased only 2.8 per cent while in sterling terms it increased 9.2 per cent. Gross profits increased to Pounds 90.6m (Pounds 86.9m). But higher administrative expenses, including Pounds 1m of rationalisation costs, dragged operating profits down from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 14.2m. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 9.1m at the end of the period with gearing at 14.3 per cent (25.4 per cent). But interest costs increased, partly due to short term cash flow needs, to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 800,000). Earnings per share fell to 11.5p (15.9p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.8p is proposed to make a maintained total of 7.05p. COMMENT Despite the obvious parallels with MTM, Ellis &amp; Everard's profits decline was expected and the company has not been been dogged by questions about its accounting practices. Trading this year has already shown some improvement, especially from the swimming pools division which benefited from a warm spring. Nevertheless, the chairman's departure cannot help the share price of a company which could still be some way from recovery. Although this year's results will be helped by cost savings and will not be held back by discontinued businesses, last year's exchange gains will probably be reversed and margin recovery in the UK and US may take time. Forecast profits of Pounds 15m put the shares on 13.3 times, which is not expensive relative to the sector. But until the controversy dies down, and a successor to Mr Marshall found, the shares may go sideways at best.</p>

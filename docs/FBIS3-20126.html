			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tom Hansson report: "Crisis Near for EU Timetable"] </F>   [Text] The way is open for the European Parliament's  approval of the Swedish accession agreement. If only the EU  [European Union] can solve its internal problems.    This was European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel's  pronouncement to yesterday's press briefing and these "internal  affairs" also came to be the main theme of the briefing.    "The situation within the EU is serious. If it is not  resolved soon, there will be every justification for talk of a  crisis. Something that could in its turn deadlock the European  Parliament."    Soon -- perhaps at this coming weekend's meeting of foreign  ministers. But certainly not as late as the summer's meeting of  foreign ministers on Corfu. Even though Dinkelspiel says that  he does not see how the issue can be resolved.    "As far as I am able to judge there is no definite deadline.  Technically it will be possible to carry on a good way into  April."    The Swedish side is currently working on the treaty of  accession. It is expected that this will be translated and put  before the European Parliament "in early April."    "But the parliament already has a base on which to begin its  work and it has done so," the European affairs minister said.    However, he declined to make any statement himself about the  distribution of votes in the European Parliament [sentence as  published]. Something that Social Democratic opposition leader  Ingvar Carlsson, for example, has done.    "The question is of some importance, but not of such  importance that I think it justified. Thus we have therefore,  quite intentionally, not decided on a position."    As a nonmember Sweden is still a mere spectator of the  ongoing debacle between Spain and Britain and the rest of the  EU. What Sweden is doing is "following" what is being said in  Brussels, London, and Madrid. Further negotiations are not  being contemplated.    "But we have of course close contacts with the countries.  But we always have, with everybody."    But does the current conflict in Brussels not help to  strengthen the no side here at home?    "It could have a temporary influence on public opinion. But  if there is a serious crisis, it could have more lasting  negative repercussions."    But Dinkelspiel was unwilling to agree -- not fully at least  -- to the suggestion that the Swedish Government already knows  what the final outcome will be, that everything has really  already been settled.    "The negotiations are incomplete. But it would of course not  be wholly truthful of me to say that I do not know in what  direction things are leaning."    So it is now fully in order for the European affairs  minister  to go to South Africa on Thursday [24 March]. At the head of  the first Swedish trade delegation to visit the country since  sanctions were lifted. And let Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas deal with Europe over the next 10 days.</p>

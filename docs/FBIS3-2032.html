Super 301 is an amendment to Section 301 of the 1974 trade  act, which gives the President authority to impose trade  sanctions, although it allows trade disputes to drag on for as  long as a decade.    Under Super 301, effective from 1988 to 1990, U.S. names the  countries which it says engage in unfair trade practices and, if  a resolution is not reached in 18 months, imposes punitive  tariffs, sometimes as high as 100 percent, on certain imports  from these countries.    In 1989, Japan, Brazil and India were the targets for Super  301. The threat of trade sanctions resulted in concessions from  Brazil and Japan, especially in the areas of processed wood  products, supercomputers and satellites.    Reinstitution of Super 301 by an administrative fiat from  the  President, meanwhile, supersede efforts in Congress to renew the  measure through legislation.</p>

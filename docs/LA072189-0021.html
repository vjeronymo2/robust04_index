			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ASTRUD GILBERTO: NAIVETE REMAINS  </P> <P> There was something oddly appropriate about Astrud Gilberto's modest entrance  on stage at Catalina Bar and Grill on Wednesday night. She slipped between the  members of her quintet, waiflike as ever, still looking as though she were not  quite sure if she belonged there at all.  </P> <P> It's been more than two decades since Gilberto became a virtually accidental  star of the then-new bossa nova via her understated vocals on the recordings of  former husband Joao Gilberto. Her wispy, almost expressionless voice drifted  across the music's sensual, samba-based rhythms with the innocence of a child's  balloon floating on a summer zephyr.  </P> <P> Not much has changed in the intervening years. Gilberto's opening set included  most of her early bossa-nova repertoire -- "One Note Samba," "The Girl From  Ipanema," "Desafinado." Some newer material by Gilberto herself and Paulho  Jobim were clearly products of the same style.  </P> <P> She sang with perhaps more focus and strength than was present in her early  years. But the vulnerability and sense of naivete were the same. Like Chet  Baker's vocals, Gilberto's interpretations were affecting less for their  musicality than for their sense of one-on-one intimacy -- the feeling of  hearing a lover whisper a soft and tender song.  </P> <P> Wisely, Gilberto surrounded herself with a musical setting perfectly tailored  to display her best qualities. Many of her vocal lines were fortified with  unison instrumental lines, usually from Jay Ashby's excellent trombone playing.  And the arrangements always made the most of Gilberto's fragile voice,  occasionally framing it with brisk riffs, at other times supporting it with  warm, softly sounded harmonies.  </P> <P> Gilberto will never be a major-league jazz singer; nor, in fact, can she really  compete with such second-generation Brazilian performers as, say, Gal Costa or  Flora Purim. But there's no denying the appeal of her musically ingenuous but  emotionally moving style.  </P> <P> Gilberto continues at Catalina Bar and Grill through Sunday.  </P></p>

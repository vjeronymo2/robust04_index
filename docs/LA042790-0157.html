			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS ALLOWED TO JOIN PUBLIC ONES IN '92;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION: SCHOOLS SUCH AS MATER DEI WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN LEAGUES THAT  UNTIL NOW HAD INCLUDED ONLY ORANGE COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS.  </P> <P> The Southern Section's general council approved a proposal Thursday that would  allow its member schools to join any geographic area for the purpose of placing  them into athletic leagues beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> Private and parochial high schools will be allowed to request membership in any  Southern Section geographic area, meaning parochial high schools such as Santa  Margarita, Mater Dei and Servite would be allowed to join leagues that until  now had included only Orange County public schools.  </P> <P> Public schools in Orange County now are grouped in leagues with other Orange  County public schools; private and parochial high schools in Orange County are  grouped with schools outside Orange County.  </P> <P> Many of the county's 54 public high school principals at Thursday's meeting  opposed the proposal.  </P> <P> "The door is now open so that parochial schools can go into any geographic  area," said William Brand, principal at Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> "A school like Servite, which is essentially on the border of Orange and Los  Angeles counties, can pick and choose where it wants to play. Shouldn't other  schools have some control or say over their destiny?"  </P> <P> William Brelsford, principal of St. Bernard High School and president of the  Catholic Athletic Assn., applauded the decision. "The opposition of this whole  issue is based on the objections of one area in the Southern Section, Orange  County," Brelsford said.  </P> <P> "On a whim, that area has been allowed to exclude one school (Santa Margarita)  from being placed into its area. How can one area dictate to the CIF (Southern  Section)?"  </P> <P> Santa Margarita, which lost a series of appeals to join the Orange County  geographic area last year, will request placement into the county area  beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> Administrators at Mater Dei and Servite said they are uncertain about their  future league placements.  </P> <P> "It's an easy decision for Santa Margarita, but at this point, it's a bit  premature to speak for Mater Dei," said John Weling, the school's principal.  "When you consider transportation costs and missed class time our students  incur playing in a Catholic league, today's decision is encouraging."  </P> <P> Council Notes  </P> <P> Football teams in the South Coast and Pacific Coast leagues will be competing  in higher playoff divisions beginning next season. South Coast League members  move from Division III to Division II and Pacific Coast League members move  from Division VIII to Division VII. The Pacific Coast League's move means there  are six leagues in Division VII and each league will be guaranteed only two  entries in the playoffs.  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Oil boom in CIS may attract Dollars 85bn THE former Soviet Union is on the verge of a massive foreign investment boom in the oil, gas and minerals sector, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. It estimates that up to Dollars 85bn (Pounds 55bn) of foreign capital may flow into the Commonwealth of Independent States as a consequence of deals signed between 1990 and early 1993. While this huge inflow will be spread over decades, initial investment over the next four years could reach almost Dollars 10bn, the ECE believes. This is double total foreign investment so far in CIS countries in all industrial sectors combined. Of the 39 projects identified by the ECE report*, 22 are in Russia and eight in Kazakhstan. Over half involve American or British companies. The biggest to date is a deal between British Gas and Agip of Italy with the government of Kazakhstan, entailing investment of Dollars 6bn during the first 10 years and up to Dollars 20bn over 40 years. The ECE notes that most of the projects are in the oil and gas industries. 'There is considerable scope for further large-scale investments in the CIS's still under-exploited mineral resources sector, including in gold, copper, coal and aluminium.' The UN body has also recorded a steady increase in the total number of foreign investment projects in the CIS and eastern Europe. Total foreign investment registrations in the former Comecon area more than doubled, from 31,000 at the start of 1992 to 64,200 at the end. In the CIS alone, registrations trebled from 4,200 to 13,250. The ECE says foreign investors are increasingly shifting away from establishment of joint ventures towards buying existing companies or setting up wholly-owned subsidiaries. In several eastern European countries, over half the value of total foreign direct investment is now accounted for by privatisation. *East-West Investment (Incorporating East-West Joint Ventures News), No 1, January 1993, annual subscription (4 issues) Dollars 80, single issue Dollars 20, available from UN Sales Section, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Labour lead confirmed in widest opinion poll: Kinnock and Major rule out coalition despite surge in Lib Dem support MR NEIL KINNOCK looked set last night to emerge from Thursday's general election as the leader of the largest party in a hung parliament after the most comprehensive opinion poll of the campaign gave Labour a 2.5 point lead. The poll, which confirmed the recent surge in Liberal Democrat support at the expense of both main parties, came as Mr John Major and Mr Kinnock bluntly ruled out any post-election coalition with Mr Paddy Ashdown. Mr Ashdown reaffirmed that an unequivocal commitment to electoral reform would be the price of such a deal. But he appeared to soften his previous threat immediately to vote down any legislative programme which did not meet that condition. The Conservatives' implacable opposition to proportional representation was underlined further by Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary. He warned that, alongside looser immigration controls, it could trigger an upsurge in rightwing extremism in Britain comparable to the growth of the German fascist movement. The ICM poll for the Press Association, covering more than 10,000 voters interviewed last week, puts Labour on 38.7 per cent, the Conservatives on 36.2 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 20.4 per cent, with others on 4.7 per cent. Translated into parliamentary seats it would give Labour 305 overall, six or seven more than the Conservatives but 21 short of an overall majority. That would leave the Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power. A much smaller Harris survey for the Daily Express last night put Labour on 38 per cent, a one-point lead over the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats were at 21 per cent. The ICM poll suggests, however, that the average swing of 7 per cent from Conservative to Labour since the last general election may understate Mr Kinnock's potential gains in some decisive marginals. It puts the swing in West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside at 10.5 per cent and in the south-east at 9 per cent. A separate ICM poll for Today newspaper of 52 marginals also suggests Labour is doing particularly well in its target seats. The results followed an apparent acknowledgment by Mr Major that the Tories may lose their overall majority on Thursday. In an attempt to win back wavering supporters from the Liberal Democrats, he said a hung parliament would lead to unstable government. Mr Major, who launched a further sharp attack on the opposition parties' support for Scottish devolution and closer European integration, insisted he remained confident of leading a majority government. But ministerial colleagues acknowledged a more realistic ambition was to win back enough wavering voters to emerge as the largest party. Mr Ashdown's public insistence that the Liberal Democrats would be prepared to support whichever of the main parties met his terms was undercut by a senior member of his frontbench team. The colleague said it was 'inconceivable' that the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who make up half the party's parliamentary support, would sustain in office a minority Conservative government. The Liberal Democrat leader appeared to soften his previous insistence that his party would vote down any legislative programme, or Queen's Speech, which did not include a commitment to electoral reform. He told BBC's Election Call there might be circumstances - a sterling or international crisis - in which he would keep his options open. But his insistence that, in the event of a hung parliament, he would be seeking a 'partnership government' with representation for his party at all levels was curtly rejected by Mr Kinnock. Asked if he could see circumstances in which Liberal Democrats would have cabinet seats, Mr Kinnock said he could not.

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sharp decline to Pounds 0.4m at London &amp; Clydeside SHARP reductions in profits from house building and commercial property development has left London &amp; Clydeside, the USM-quoted Scottish concern, with only Pounds 404,000 profit before tax and the final dividend is halved. The profit, for the 12 months to September 30 1992, plummeted from Pounds 1.82m previously. The final dividend is cut to 2.7p (5.2p), reducing the total from 7p to 4.5p. That was uncovered by earnings per share of 2.9p (14.9p). Mr Norman Chalmers, chairman, said: 'We can't see any secure upturn in the housing market.' He expected the outcome for the first half of the current year to be similar to last year, when there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 120,000. There was some question of whether the interim dividend would be maintained at 1.8p. However, 'we hope at least to hold the total'. Operating profit fell to Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 3.36m) on turnover of Pounds 22m (Pounds 21.4m). House-building made about Pounds 18m sales, but profits were Pounds 600,000 down. Mr John McIntyre, managing director, said two up-market sites increased the average price to Pounds 79,000 (Pounds 75,000). But volume was about 10 per cent down. Newer ranges included terraced houses at less than Pounds 40,000 each, which it was hoped would push up unit sales. Development profit fell from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 200,000. The sale of one building to a government department had been delayed, although it was hoped it would come through this year. Rental income from the Pounds 4.5m property portfolio remained flat at about Pounds 450,000. Gearing edged up to 100 per cent on net debt of Pounds 11m.</p>

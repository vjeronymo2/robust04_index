			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Mexico restrains growth in imports MEXICO posted a trade deficit of Dollars 3.64bn (Pounds 2.36bn) in the first quarter, up 7.9 per cent on 1992. The rise is smaller than previous years and follows a sharp slowdown in import growth. Imports reached Dollars 15.38bn in the first quarter, a rise of 10.3 per cent, compared to growth rates of 20-30 per cent last year. Exports rose to Dollars 11.75bn, 11.1 per cent more than the same period last year, with manufacturing exports performing particularly well. The trade numbers come on the back of an unexpectedly favourable increase of 2.4 per cent in gross domestic product in the first quarter. Some sectors, such as textiles and apparel, and metals and machinery, suffered from high interest rates and tight fiscal policy, while construction rose 7.6 per cent and services were up by 2.6 per cent. For March the government reported a trade deficit of Dollars 1.23bn.</p>

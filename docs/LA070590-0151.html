			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> CINEMA PROJECT DELAYED  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski has ordered the city to make  further environmental studies before allowing construction of a 12-screen  cinema complex on Foothill Boulevard.  </P> <P> The judge's decision is a victory for pharmacist Bob Mastro, head of the Small  Town Preservation Committee, and three residents who sued to block a plan by  Edwards Theatre Circuit Inc. to build a complex with nearly 3,000 seats.  </P> <P> Theater opponents contend the project is too large and would bring crowds and  traffic to La Verne. Their attorney, John Murdock, said the ruling will force  the city to rescind its approval of the project. "It's a very significant  victory for the people," Murdock said.  </P> <P> But city officials say the theater would have no more seats than existing  multiscreen complexes in Azusa and Montclair. City Manager Martin Lomeli said  the judge apparently didn't understand the city's environmental analysis.  Lomeli said the ruling doesn't mean the project is dead.  </P> <P> In addition to the lawsuit, the Small Town Preservation Committee is  circulating petitions to put an initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot that would  prohibit construction of theaters with more than 1,000 seats.  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: LSO free to be imaginative - Concert While the other London orchestras find themselves caught up in a frantic race to stay alive, the London Symphony Orchestra is in the luxurious position of having time to think about music. A glance over the autumn season just coming to an end reveals a higher proportion of imaginative programmes than with any of its rivals. In order to please the captains of the arts, each of the orchestras has taken on board a young maestro who can hoist the sail for 20th-century music. At the LSO this is Kent Nagano, who is looking a well-informed choice. At the time of his appointment as Associate Principal Guest Conductor (how complicated titles get when everybody has to be called something) he was on the brink of success; now he has definitely arrived. It is a matter of taste whether his concert on Thursday counted as imaginative, or just bizarre. Works by Boulez and Mahler found themselves coupled with Paganini's First Violin Concerto, a showpiece for Sarah Chang, the highly-publicised teenage violin virtuoso. The result was like looking down the wrong end of a telescope. The majority of the audience (it was a full house) had turned up to focus on the tiny musical stature of Paganini. Very young musicians often face criticism if they fall short in interpreting great music, but there was no danger of that here. The Paganini is frothy, insubstantial stuff and Sarah Chang was well ahead of any problems it might have posed. Her personality as a performer is all confidence, far more outgoing than the not-quite-so-young Midori was when she first came on the scene. Chang attacks the most difficult portions of the music with fearless confidence and makes a remarkably large sound for one so slight. This concerto abounds in thirds, sixths and octaves, even in harmonics, with which she dazzles quite effortlessly. Most talented 12 year-olds would be happy to get one note so well in tune at a time, let alone two. While he was looking after the accompaniment, Nagano probably had time to cast his mind back to Boulez's short Messagesquisse for seven cellos or think ahead to the challenges of Mahler's Fifth Symphony. As both were being recycled from a concert the week before, rehearsal time had presumably been sufficient for Nagano to get the sharpness of ensemble that he wanted. The Mahler was a virtuoso performance, decisive, big in scale, loud, not unlike Tilson Thomas (former LSO Principal Conductor) in the same symphony. Each made his case with panache, but sur-prisingly it was the otherwise more cogent Nagano who took the Adagietto too slowly and cossetted it to excess. The finale was also pulled around, but climaxed in a blaze of glory. At least those who had come to see Chang stayed to the end. Sponsored by Coopers and Lybrand Financial Services Consultancy</p>

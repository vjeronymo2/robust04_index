			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> ** 1/2  </P> <P> CALLOWAY  </P> <P> "Calloway" Solar/Epic  </P> <P> Brothers Reggie and Cino-vincent Calloway, formerly of Midnight Star, have  produced a debut album that sounds as if they've been influenced by the  catalogues of platinum-selling crossover acts like Lionel Richie and Atlantic  Starr. "I Wanna Be Rich" -- currently a staple on pop radio -- is about as tame  and mainstream as you can get.  </P> <P> It's the type of record that's typically slammed by sneering critics and bought  with wallet-waving abandon by pop audiences, and it's pretty obvious whose  favor Calloway is courting. Those who like "I Wanna Be Rich" should be equally  won over by "You Are My Everything," a ballad so unbelievably bland that it's  hard to imagine its being performed by two guys who used to churn out funky  fare like "Freak-a-zoid" and "Operator."

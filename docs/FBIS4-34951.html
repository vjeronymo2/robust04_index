			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 27 Jun (PL) -- Processing Haitian  refugees on the high seas, as recommended by the White House,  has become the largest operation conducted in 50 years by the  U.S. Coast Guard and the costliest operation ever.    Just the floating processing platforms -- two vessels off  the  coast of Jamaica -- cost the U.S. taxpayer some $120,000 a day,  the Florida SUN-SENTINEL reveals today. The use of the Coast  Guard Cutter Hamilton costs $2,100 per hour while its six  accompanying helicopters cost $750 each for the same amount of  time. Meanwhile, daily fuel expenses for the hospital ship USS  Comfort, used as a processing center, run as high as $15,300.    The operation entails intercepting the so-called boat people  [previous two words in English], examining their asylum requests  on the floating platforms, and repatriating those who are not  eligible.    The process involves eight Navy vessels, 15 Coast Guard  vessels, and hundreds of immigration officials. The cost of  this process will probably continue to rise as more Haitians try  to escape.    "This is the largest operation conducted by the U.S. Coast  Guard since World War II. Between the vessels of the U.S. Coast  Guard and those of the Navy, the United States has never had so  many vessels off the Haitian coastline," Lieutenant Commander  Jim Howe told the newspaper. The Pentagon plans to spend  another $65 million in the next four months. Those funds will  also be used to meet the needs of eight U.S. Navy vessels  patrolling the Haitian coast.    Ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, meanwhile,  expressed  opposition to Washington's plan to discourage Haitians from  trying to leave their country in rafts. U.S. authorities fear  that an exodus might crowd the floating platform to process  refugees.    Since this operation began a week ago, 194 Haitians have  been  interviewed, 52 were deemed eligible to seek asylum while the  rest were repatriated.    However, since 24 June, when Washington decided to tighten  economic sanctions against the coupist leadership, another 800  have been intercepted on the high seas.</p>

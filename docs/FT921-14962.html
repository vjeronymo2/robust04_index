			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / BBC reviews central costs and staffing THE BBC has launched a review of all costs and staffing levels in its central bureaucracy. It may lead to job losses and the contracting-out of services. The review, being conducted with the help of Price Waterhouse, will look at all services not directly involved in programme making - from finance and personnel to computer services, audience research and publicity. Last October the BBC announced the Producer Choice initiative, which allows programme makers to hire technical services from outside the corporation. The new review aims to put programme makers' central overheads under similar scrutiny. It is being led by Ms Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel. She said yesterday that under Producer Choice resource capacity had to be set at appropriate levels by April next year. 'This principle must apply to all overhead services, not just programme resource departments,' she said. The introduction of an internal market for all BBC services is potentially one of the most fundamental changes in the way the corporation is run.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hizballah: Israel's Terms Betray </F> Its Anxiety About Effectiveness of the Resistance"]    [Text] Beirut -- In a statement it issued yesterday,  Hizballah reacted to the Israel call for a crackdown on the  resistance in the south and in the occupied territories. It  said that "their terms and demands calling for the disarmament  of the resistance reveal the extent of the enemy's anxiety about  the effectiveness of that resistance, its forces, and its  ability to undermine the enemy's security and presence in the  occupied territories. Furthermore, such terms reflect a clear  Zionist line relying on U.S. political and military support."    It added that "these conditions give a very good idea of the  attrition to which the enemy is subjected, resulting in policy  confusion." It expressed fear that "the enemy might turn that  problem around by exploiting some willingness to discuss these  terms or respond to some of them, like what happened to the  Hamas representatives in Jordan."    It "totally" rejected these terms, and it asked: "Do recent  declarations by enemy leaders call for a strong and firm  reaction or does not the matter deserve any bother by some  people?" It warned against the "suspect trumpets trying to give  the recent confrontations and the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist  aggressions the label of internal disputes and to turn the  matter toward sectarian sedition and conflict." It urged "these  trumpets to stop these attempts, particularly as what they say  does not indicate that they see the occupation and its agents as  a threat to the homeland, the people, the territory, and  sovereignty."</p>

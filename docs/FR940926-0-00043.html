Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA addressed the proposal's benefits with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to CNG vehicles. The notice did not directly address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of regulating the CNG fuel containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received no comments directly addressing the benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of regulating CNG containers. Brunswick criticized the proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believing that it would place carbon fiber containers at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive disadvantage. Brunswick stated that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single burst factor would provide less benefits than if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency adopted NGV2. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Because NHTSA is adopting Brunswick's request for multiple safety factors, that commenter's concern about a single safety factor is moot. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA anticipates that the number of CNG fuel vehicles will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase greatly in the near future, in light of directives by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Clinton Administration <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  and legislation by Congress to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop vehicles powered by cleaner burning fuels. This final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will increase the safety of this growing population of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12844 increased by 50 percent the number of alternatively fueled vehicles to be acquired by the Federal Government from 1993 through 1995. (April 21, 1993) In addition, in 1993, the President established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternative fueled vehicles throughout the country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA stated that each container would cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $600. The agency further stated that the container testing costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would range from approximately $4,050 to $8,600 for each model of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVC, NGV Systems, PST, Brunswick, ARC, Thomas Built, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flxible addressed the costs of the proposal with respect to CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. NGVC and the CNG container manufacturers stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal, especially given the single safety factor in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burst test requirements, significantly understated the costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rulemaking. Brunswick stated that container manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incur significant costs since they would have to redesign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requalify their currently designed tanks. As a result, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the CNG containers would be more expensive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavier. It estimated that the proposal would increase costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 10 percent and 55 percent, depending on the material and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method of construction. Brunswick further stated that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would add many millions of dollars on an industry-wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVC commented that the qualification tests could cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $20,000 for each model of container since many tests will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required on prototype containers. It stated that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers estimate that the design, manufacture, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualification costs could approach $150,000 per container model,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a figure that greatly exceeded NHTSA's estimate of $74,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that the basis for the comments about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of this rulemaking have been largely eliminated except in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with carbon fiber tanks. The comments were based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposal for a single safety factor of 3.5 for all types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks. As noted above, the agency has decided to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiple safety factors that are consistent with NGV2 except in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of the factors for carbon fiber containers. Since all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the container manufacturers commenting on the proposal either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already certify to or can comply with NGV2 without any design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, the cost to manufacturers will be minimal for noncarbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiber tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Rulemaking Analyses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' This action has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated the costs of the amendments in a Final Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation (FRE) which is included in the docket for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. As discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost for the pressure cycling, burst, and bonfire testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will range from $9,000 to $21,725 per container size and type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the cost of the containers used in the test is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to range from $1,800 to $6,600. Since the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors in the burst test applicable to carbon fiber containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are more stringent than those in NGV2, the cost of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers will increase. Based on comments by Brunswick and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other information, the switch from carbon fiber containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting a 2.25 safety factor to carbon fiber containers meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the factors adopted in this final rule will increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container cost and the lifetime fuel costs about 8.75 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles equipped with Type 2 containers. Those costs would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range from $115 for passenger cars to $602 for heavy trucks. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switch would increase costs about 37.1 percent for vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with Type 3 and Type 4 containers, resulting in a cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase ranging from $496 for cars to $2,560 for heavy trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. Information available to the agency indicates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses manufacturing CNG fuel containers are not small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has determined that the rule will not have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment. No state has adopted requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating CNG containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The agency has determined that this rule will have no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. On the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG vehicles will encourage their use, NHTSA believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will have positive environmental impacts. CNG vehicles are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to have near-zero evaporative emissions and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State requirement imposes a higher level of performance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. That section does not require submission of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

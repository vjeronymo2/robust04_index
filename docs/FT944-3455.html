			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scholl shares dip on profits warning Shares in Scholl, the healthcare products group, fell 18 1/2 p yesterday to 125p, after it warned that trading conditions remained difficult. At the same time the group said it would take an Pounds 8m exceptional charge against full-year profits to cover restructuring costs following a strategic review. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said: 'Even with two new product launches, we do not anticipate that the shortfall in profits at the interim stage will be made up in the second half of the year.' Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 9.96m. UK sales were down, in part because of continued destocking by retailers and wholesalers. Sales were flat in continental Europe but strong in Asia Pacific. The forecast final dividend of 3.8p, giving 6.4p for the full year, will be maintained. The charge includes provision for the loss of 100 jobs. Cost savings should amount to Pounds 1.5m in 1996. The group will close 21 retail outlets, mostly in Germany, the UK and Canada. Brand management will be centralised and located in the UK. Product rationalisation will include the reduction of the number of footcare products from 109 to 57 over the next two years, and a buyer is being sought for Valdor, the French cosmetics business. Goodwill of Pounds 3.7m, previously written off to capital reserves, will be written off through the profit and loss account.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Where relationships may be too close for independence - Prem Sikka, Anthony Puxty and Hugh Willmott on why the provision of non-audit services to audit clients should be re-examined THE time has come to address a neglected aspect of the effectiveness of auditors in discovering fraud: the question of their independence when they are allowed to sell non-audit services to their audit clients. In other European countries such as Germany, auditors must act exclusively as auditors. But whenever this restriction is proposed in Britain, the auditing industry argues little evidence exists to show that the provision of non-audit services to audit clients impairs independence. It is difficult to provide hard evidence to refute this argument. The public is told little about company-auditor relationships, and the auditing firms fail to publish meaningful information about their affairs. Companies are now required to show the audit and non-audit fees generated by auditors in their accounts. But there is nothing on topics such as the profitability of the audit, contract details, the composition of the audit team or how it works, which would help assess auditor independence. Yet when accountants provide non-audit services to their audit clients, there are many instances in which they may jeopardise the independence of their assessment by auditing the figures of their own colleagues from the tax, consulting or corporate finance departments. In the aftermath of a company collapse and fraud, the quality of audits is sometimes scrutinised through investigations by Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) inspectors. Their reports could shed some light on the debate. Unfortunately few of these reports are published. Even those in the public domain do not always comment on auditor independence. On those rare occasions when they do, some reports have concluded that the provision of non-auditing services does or may impair the service provided. In their 1976 report on the frauds and collapse of Roadships, for instance, the inspectors (one of whom was a Touche Ross partner) concluded that 'independence' is destroyed when the 'work which is being audited is in fact work which has been done previously by the auditors themselves acting as accountants'. The report concluded: 'We do not accept that there can be the requisite degree of watchfulness where a man is checking either his own figures or those of a colleague . . . For these reasons we do not believe that (the auditors) ever achieved the standards of independence necessary for a wholly objective audit.' Similar concerns were expressed in the 1979 DTI report on the collapse of Burnholme and Forder. The inspectors (one of whom was an Ernst &amp; Whinney partner) concluded: 'In our view the principle of the auditor first compiling and then reporting upon a profit forecast is not considered to be a good practice for it may impair their ability to view the forecast objectively and must endanger the degree of independence essential to this work.' These views at the very least challenge the assertion made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in its recent response to the McFarlane report on the future development of auditing that: 'There is no evidence - for example in DTI inspectors' reports - that auditors' objectivity is compromised by the provision of other services.' Inspectors' reports have also been critical of other relationships affecting auditor independence. One on the Grays Building Society from the Registrar of Friendly Societies noted that auditor independence was compromised due to the length of time served by an auditor, leading to an approach which was described as 'mechanical and predictable'. Audit failures in a 1976 DTI report on Hartley Baird concluded that the auditors were 'too closely connected with' one of the directors. There may be an expectation from the government that the accountancy bodies will act on the findings and recommendations of DTI reports. But these associations are in no position to control multinational auditing firms. Their main concern is to promote and defend the work of their members. So the inspectors' comments and recommendations have been ignored. Auditors continue to audit the figures created by their own firms and colleagues. This is something no other watchdogs are routinely expected, or allowed, to do. Cosy relationships with directors are not disturbed. In the mid 1980s, the need to implement the EC Eighth Directive - which covered audit regulation - presented an opportunity for substantial reform. The government issued a discussion document that included proposals for curtailing the sale of non-auditing services by auditors. But in the face of pressure from auditing firms, their trade associations and patrons, the proposals were abandoned. It was only this year, after government pressure, that the accountancy bodies approved ethical guidelines to forbid auditors from reporting on specialised asset valuations which they have themselves valued. These guidelines do not currently include pension valuations. There are no other such restrictions on the provision of services by auditors. The ultimate responsibility for safeguarding the interests of stakeholders lies with the DTI. Yet current ministers have shown no interest in taking action on the provision of non-audit services. That is in spite of comments from Mr Michael Heseltine, now secretary of state at the DTI, in his 1987 book Where There's a Will. He argued at the time that accountancy firms ought 'to be debarred from doing any other work for a company for which they act as auditors . . . to prevent any possible conflict of interest'. The British government's attitude contrasts sharply with that in many other countries. Consider the case of Fokus Bank in Norway. In 1991 the Norwegian government removed its auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, which were also supplying substantial consultancy services. The reason, according to a senior official, was: 'It is very questionable that an audit firm combines its role as a key management adviser with the statutory audit function'. Such a move is highly unlikely in Britain where the accountancy bodies are the regulators of the auditing industry. The recent Cadbury and McFarlane reports could have examined questions of auditor independence in detail. But they were sponsored by the accountancy bodies and have done no such thing. The reports make no mention of the recommendations in the DTI inspectors' reports. With the collapse of BCCI, the opportunity should have been taken to examine the issue of auditor independence. But such matters were beyond the range of Lord Justice Bingham's terms of reference. Instead, the government is relying upon the accountancy bodies to look into the auditing aspects of the BCCI failure. Yet the disciplinary action taken against the large firms has been limited. As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry admitted to Parliament in November 1991: 'No auditor criticised in an inspectors' report has been debarred from auditing as a result of information in that report'. Within the current regulatory arrangements, poor audit quality is unlikely to be prevented. A way forward would be for the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee to investigate matters relating to auditor independence.

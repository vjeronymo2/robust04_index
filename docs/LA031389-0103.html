			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> France's environmentalist Greens Part made a surprise surge in municipal  elections while the mainstream right-and left-wing alliances ran virtually neck  and neck. Interior Minister Pierre Joxe estimated that only about 70% of the  electorate of 38 million voted. Initial results showed President Francois  Mitterand's Socialists and his Communist allies together gaining around 1% more  of the vote than in the last municipal elections in 1983. Two conservative  parties -- Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy -- lost about  2% of the vote compared with four years ago, while the Greens captured as much  as 4% compared to less than 1% in 1983.  </P></p>

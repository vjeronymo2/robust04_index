			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOROUGHBRED RACING;  </P> <P> JACKSON'S LUCK CHANGING AGAIN  </P> <P> Bruce Jackson was hoping to make his New York training debut in the Breeders'  Cup Mile on Saturday with the Irish colt In Excess. Unfortunately, In Excess  was one of several horses locked out of the Mile because of the large number of  entries.  </P> <P> Last weekend at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., Jackson was brimming with  confidence as he sent out the English filly Native Twine in the Queen Elizabeth  Challenge Cup. But something went wrong, and Native Twine finished last.  </P> <P> In July, the Jackson colt Jovial was considered the best 3-year-old in the West  after consecutive victories in the Cinema and Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park.  Jovial was being pointed for the $1-million Travers Stakes and a host of other  major events when he was stricken by a serious stomach ailment.  </P> <P> Lumped together, the three incidents would provide most trainers with a good  start on an ulcer. But Jackson, a veteran of the thoroughbred and quarter horse  wars, simply shrugs and looks down his stable roster for the next batter.  </P> <P> "Good horses make the difference," Jackson said at Santa Anita. "They answer a  lot of worries."  </P> <P> Besides, those three sad tales all have happy endings, in varying degrees.  </P> <P> Anticipating the capacity Breeders' Cup Mile crowd, Jackson ran In Excess at  Santa Anita last Sunday in the Volante Handicap. The colt won easily.  </P> <P> Native Twine came out of her Keeneland race fine and will run at Santa Anita on  Nov. 4 in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes.  </P> <P> And Jovial, after flirting with a dangerous case of colitis, is training again  toward what could be a banner 4-year-old campaign.  </P> <P> "He was a very sick horse," Jackson said as Jovial returned to the barn after a  gallop. "It turned out something was killing all the bacteria in his stomach.  They had to treat him with a lot of antibiotics, then pump him full of stuff  that would restore his system -- dairy cultures, things like that. He's in good  health now, but I'm not about to rush him. I want him feeling strong before we  put any pressure on him."  </P> <P> In Excess, also a 3-year-old, has been impressive. The Volante was his second  stakes win in four starts since arriving from England in July. In Excess has  run only on grass, but Jackson trains him on the dirt and claims he will be a  better main-track horse than Jovial, who came to this country as a turf runner.  </P> <P> "Jovial didn't like it at all," Jackson said of the dirt track. "We had to  teach him to handle it. But In Excess loves it. Eddie Delahoussaye worked him a  mile once at Del Mar in 1:34 and change. I asked him to guess the time and he  said, 'Oh, about 1:38.' That's how easy he did it."  </P> <P> As for Native Twine, Jackson took all the blame for her Keeneland failure.  </P> <P> "When she got here from England she had a cut on the left side of her mouth,"  the trainer said. "I had it healed, but just in case there was still some  tenderness I left the bit a little bit loose. So what happens? She flips her  tongue over the bit and stops running."  </P> <P> This year, Jackson has for the most part been successfully applying his  know-how with American horses to a wave of foreign runners. Jackson and his  primary patron, real estate developer Jack Munari of Palos Verdes, have tapped  into the pipeline of British bloodstock agent Richard Duggan.  </P> <P> Duggan has a reputation for finding potential European talent for American  clients on a budget that does not require oil money or small fortunes. Jackson  is a believer.  </P> <P> "While most guys are watching replays from races around here, Richard is  studying tapes from England and France," he said. "In Excess bolted in a race  at Royal Ascot and embarrassed his owner, so he was up for sale. We've got a  filly named Hunting Party who finished second to Salsabil -- before Salsabil  became the best filly in Europe. The horses are there, and he knows where to  look."  </P> <P> Has Jackson changed his methods to accommodate his new brood of foreign-trained  runners?  </P> <P> "Not really," he said. "It's the ability of the horse that really makes the  difference. I did make a whirlwind trip to England and France last spring, and  that was valuable. I was able to see what horses go through earlier in their  careers. That way, I can understand better how they might act later when they  get over here."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> In the wake of trainer Roger Stein's request to have a 976 handicapping line,  the California Horse Racing Board is investigating all licensees (owners,  trainers, etc.) who also make public selections in any form. CHRB Executive  Secretary Dennis Hutcheson said the board plans to enforce a strict  interpretation of the rule against such practices, but he left open the  possibility of a rule change down the line.  </P></p>

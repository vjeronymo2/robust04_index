			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Where freedom is everything - Insurance for Life Funds under management at Scottish Widows exceed Pounds 21bn, which makes the society the third-largest mutual in terms of asset size. The power it exerts in the life and pensions industry has led to the label 'Scottish mafia,' which it shares with two other mutuals north of the border, Standard Life and Scottish Amicable. In terms of financial strength - a key feature in any long-term investment provider - the society was awarded Standard &amp; Poor's top assessment because of its strong free asset position and initiatives taken to improve efficiency and quality of service. As a proportion of total assets, the level of free assets indicates how much capital is available for development as opposed to assets set aside to meet liabilities to policyholders. The free asset ratio is an important indicator for mutuals since, unlike proprietary life offices, they cannot go to the stock market to raise capital. Scottish Widows has free assets worth more than Pounds 2bn, which is 20 per cent greater than the average of the top 10 mutuals. Managing director Mike Ross says: 'A strong financial position enables us to maximise the investment freedom which we can give to our investment managers. Greater investment freedom means greater policyholder returns over the longer term.' Nevertheless, the society's performance has dived in recent years. Poor performance has hit its most popular funds - conventional with-profits, managed unit-linked, and equity unit-linked. The with-profits story reflects the problems that have beset the entire sector. With-profits funds aim to achieve a good but steady return through investment in gilts, fixed interest, property and equities. Part of the return is guaranteed; hence the attraction for investors seeking a degree of security. For some time, the society has ploughed a substantial proportion of its with-profits fund into equities and property. But poor historic returns on property have affected all with-profits funds, while the 50 per cent equity exposure on the Widows' fund has had a relatively heavy weighting towards FT-SE 100 stocks at a time when smaller companies have shown better performance. The society's conventional with-profits fund has returned below-average results over five, 10 and 15 years, although it remains one of the top performers in its category over 20 years. The society's more recent unitised with-profits plan has performed above average since launch. But the managed unit-linked fund, which offers a mixed portfolio of investments, has been below average over the past five years after peaking in 1989, when it was among the top performers in its category. In 1992 and 1993, it fell into the bottom 25 per cent. Market analysts say the society has taken steps to rectify its investment problems, but it is too early to see the results. Charges are an important feature of any investment plan, and Scottish Widows' personal pensions offer below-average charges on all lengths of contract, according to its reduction in yield (RIY) figures - that is, the equivalent annual charge over the full period the policy is in force (source: FT 1994 Personal Pensions Handbook and Pensions Management). Where commission is paid to advisers, the society deducts an extra 30 per cent from premiums paid during the initial period. This can be anything up to 27 months, depending on the term of the contract. With the importance of independent advice increasingly being recognised, it is perhaps surprising that Scottish Widows is increasing its direct sales operation from 5 to 20 per cent by 1998. Independent advisers are responsible for 95 per cent of business now while tied agents, who sell the products of a single provider, account for only 3 per cent. The society monitors its tied agents carefully following a fine by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) of Pounds 100,000 for 'incorrect advice.' Sales of personal pension transfer plans to employees with company scheme benefits also are monitored carefully. The society has sold 35,000 transfer plans, more than 50 per cent of which were cases where the company pension scheme was being terminated.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FACT FILE 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name: Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance Society Status: Mutual Founded: 1815 Market position: Third largest mutual in terms of asset size Financial strength: Standard &amp; Poor's assessment is 'good' Funds under management: Pounds 21.8bn (at 5/1/94) Premium income: Pounds 1,786m in 1992 (life and pensions) Number of personal pension plan clients: 450,000 Sales outlets: 95 per cent through independent advisers, 5 per cent through direct sales and tied agents. Plans to increase direct sales to 20 per cent of distribution Commission paid: Average life office rates to independent advisers, eg between approx 47 per cent and 60 per cent of the first year's premiums on a 20-year contract Nil commission terms available? Yes, through any adviser or tied agent. Where commission foregone, a greater proportion of premium actually invested in plan Recurring single premiums? Yes Expense ratio (management expenses divided by total premium income): 20.15 per cent in 1991, 18.12 per cent in 1992 (industry average last calculated in 1991 at 19.3 per cent) Reduction in yield 1993* (equivalent annual per cent charge over the life of the contract): 1.5 per cent on 25 year unit-linked personal pension (industry average 1.6 per cent). Below average on most contracts and terms) Penalties on early retirement or termination: On new unit-linked plans - no penalties; with-profits plans, a discretionary 'market value adjuster' (MVA) penalty may be imposed Performance*: Sharp decline on managed unit-linked fund since 1989 and on equity fund since 1991. Unitised with-profits above average over five years, conventional with-profits good over 20 years but below average for shorter periods. Charges: Life office illustrations of what your investment may produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real charges on the final fund of Scottish Widows' managed unit-linked plan, we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Full commission paid                          6% grth            12% grth  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium          pounds 76,012      pounds 147,301 Pounds 200               (pounds 80,900)    (pounds 158,000)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Single premium           pounds 26,457      pounds 79,593 Pounds 10,000            (pounds 28,200)    (pounds 85,200)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Nil commission  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium          pounds 81,621      pounds 161,635 Pounds 200               (pounds 80,900)    (pounds 158,000)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Single premium           pounds 27,896      pounds 83,772 Pounds 10,000            (pounds 28,200)    (pounds 85,200)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Theoretical no charges  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium Pounds 200               pounds 91,129      pounds 183,971  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Single premium Pounds 10,000            pounds 31,071      pounds 96,463  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- As can be seen, where full commission is paid, Scottish Widows' charges are significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected return. When the commission cost is stripped out, the reverse is true on the monthly premium plan but not on the single premium contract.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Source: FT Personal Pensions 1994 handbook and Pensions Management  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

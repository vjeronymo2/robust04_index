			<p>BFN     [Text] Tatsuro Toyoda (president of Toyota Motor  Corporation), chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, in a news conference on 21 June once again voiced  his objection to insistence by the U.S. on setting numerical  targets in the auto sector, saying, "My understanding is that it  was agreed in the Japan-U.S. government-level talks not to  discuss numerical targets." This remark was made in reference to  the position of Andrew Cardo [name as published], managing  director of the American Automobiles Manufacturers Association  (AAMA), who emphasized the need for setting numerical targets in  a meeting with Toyoda on 20 June.    Speaking about a proposal on making the number of imported  car dealers an objective criteria between Japan and the United  States, he noted there are differences in the form of dealers  existing in Japan and the United States. He warned against the  U.S. position, insisting, "We will have to have an agreement  (with the United States) on what dealers are."    According to Chairman Toyoda, AAMA Managing Director Cardo  paid a courtesy call on him on 20 June, and, on that occasion,  expressed "a strong view in support of numerical targets,"  saying, "it is more convenient to have numerical targets to open  up Japan's closed market." Chairman Toyoda told reporters, "We  are against numerical targets, and I do not think the government  agrees to them either."    Regarding the objective criteria as a way of gauging the  degree of market openness of Japan, Chairman Toyoda said, "The  definition of criteria is not clear. Even with respect to the  question of how many dealers sell both domestic cars and  imported cars, I personally think we will have to reach an  agreement (with the United States) on what dealers are. For  instance, one dealer has many stores in Japan, while most  dealers have only one store each in the United States.    Meanwhile, regarding Japan's imports of auto parts from the  United States, and in connection with the fact that it is  becoming questionable if 1994's target of buying $19 billion  worth of U.S. auto parts can be met, he avoided making a  clear-cut comment, except to say, "With economic conditions  changing, it is difficult to make a prediction. All companies  are making considerable efforts." In 1993, 11 auto  manufacturers in Japan imported $15.5 billion worth of U.S.-made  products (14.1 percent more than in the preceding year).    Asked about the offensive regarding imported cars in the  Japanese market, he confidently replied, "There is no fear of  imported cars becoming a dominant force yet." On the question  of expanding specifications for compact cars, he said, "We would  like to reach a conclusion by the end of summer."</p>

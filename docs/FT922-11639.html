			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: IBM invests in Hungarian computer maker INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the US computer company, is making its most important move into eastern Europe by taking a majority stake in a subsidiary of Muszertechnika, the privately owned Hungarian computer distributor and manufacturer. With its link with Muszertechnika's MT-Computers subsidiary, IBM hopes to strengthen its position in the Hungarian market, which is dominated by clones of IBM personal computers, mainly of east Asian origin. IBM's share of sales of personal and mini-computers in Hungary stood at 10 per cent in 1991. Muszertechnika currently has a 25 per cent share of the Hungarian market. Muszertechnika, which IBM Hungary described as the most advanced computer company in eastern Europe, is already a supplier of add-on boards for the US company's personal computers. The IBM equity investment in MT-Computers, for a sum not yet disclosed, follows efforts by Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, to liquidate the late Mr Robert Maxwell's 10 per cent stake in the Muszertechnika holding company. Muszertechnika said that the worth of the group had increased since the Maxwell share purchase last year, which valued it at Dollars 110m.</p>

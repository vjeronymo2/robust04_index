			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Unesco prize received by De Klerk and Mandela South African President F W de Klerk (left) and Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, flank French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday at an Elysee Palace lunch. In Paris they were joint recipients of the Felix Houphouet-Boigny peace prize awarded by Unesco. At the weekend the two shared a platform at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mr Mandela used that occasion to reassure businessmen concerned about the prospect of nationalisation of industry in post-apartheid South Africa and made clear an ANC government would honour external debt commitments.</p>

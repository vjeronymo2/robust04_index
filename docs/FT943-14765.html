			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Construction orders hit four-year high Construction contracts were worth almost Pounds 2.1bn in May, the highest figure for four years, figures published yesterday by the Environment Department show. The surge follows a dip in orders in March and April which caused concern that the pace of construction recovery might be faltering. Industry leaders said yesterday that the latest increase was encouraging. There was concern, however, that a rise in interest rates could halt progress. Mr Christopher Vickers of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: 'Any rise now would be a blow to confidence.' The recovery had been expected to slow following the bunching of large contracts at the end of last year, when the government approved the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Underground line extension in London. The value of construction orders in the three months to the end of May, at constant 1990 prices, was 13 per cent lower than in the previous three months but 12 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Most encouraging for the industry and the economy in general was a sharp rise in April and May of private-sector orders for offices, shops, factories and warehouses, indicating that the recovery is starting to prompt increased investment by manufacturers and services industries. Orders for private industrial construction were a third higher than in the same period last year and 7 per cent higher than in the previous three months. Private commercial orders were 29 per cent higher than a year ago but 2 per cent lower than in the preceding three months. The rise in private-sector investment will need to be sustained to offset falls in public spending if construction output is to continue rising. Road orders in April and May fell to Pounds 69m and Pounds 46m respectively, compared with a monthly average of Pounds 140m in the preceding 15 months. The value of all infrastructure contracts in the quarter fell 34 per cent compared with the previous three months and 6 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Private housing orders were 18 per cent higher than a year ago, but 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CZECHS CUTTING BORDER FENCE  </P> <P> Soldiers with trucks, machine shovels and wire cutters toiled in freezing  weather today as Czechoslovakia started to dismantle part of its "Iron Curtain"  frontier with the West.  </P> <P> Work on a five-mile section along the confluence of the Morava and Danube  rivers dividing Czechoslovakia from Austria began at 7 a.m., the commander of a  border guard unit said.  </P> <P> "The damned thing is going at last," said a member of the army engineering unit  engaged in the work.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia announced Nov. 30 that it would dismantle barriers on its  240-mile southern frontier.  </P> <P> In Prague, a joyous cacophony of bells and whistles today heralded a popular  victory over the Communists, and Czechoslovaks settled down to choosing a new  president to replace Gustav Husak, who resigned last week. Parliament, which  meets Tuesday, has two weeks to elect a president, but the choice could be made  in days.  </P></p>

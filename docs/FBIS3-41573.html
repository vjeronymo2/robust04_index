The international environment organisation said yesterday  substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs, such as  hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),  were themselves harmful to the global environment.    HCFCs, used as substitutes for CFCs in producing foam  insulation for household refrigerators and in commercial  refrigeration, destroy stratospheric ozone. The chemicals are  subject to phase-out by the year 2030 in industrialised nations.    Greenpeace said HCFCs produced now would add to ozone layer  depletion in the next 10 to 20 years and claimed that any  additional use of these substances is environmentally  irresponsible.    HFCs, promoted as alternatives to CFCs, cause global  warming.  According to Greenpeace one kilogramme of HFC134a has the  global warming potential of 3,200 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide,  the major greenhouse gas.    It said environmentally safe alternatives, which exist,  should be preferred as substitutes for CFCs over these  ``interim'' substitutes.    Greenpeace yesterday claimed that parties to the Montreal  Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer were falling  back on their commitment to protect the ozone layer.    ``Despite some progress made on funding for ozone-friendly  technology transfer and development in developing nations, the  parties appear to be backsliding on their most fundamental  objective -- phasing out all ozone-depleting chemicals and  bringing on line environmentally-sound technology as rapidly as  possible,'' said Michael Affleck, Greenpeace International ozone  coordinator.    Mr. Affleck said efforts to establish firm criteria for  adopting permanent, ozone-friendly alternatives rather than  interim chemical substances that have adverse environmental  impact might have been blocked in some developing countries  which were able to secure renewed and increased funding for  technological transfer to phase-out CFCs.    He said it was developed nations which would benefit from  the  transfer of technology. These countries, mainly the producers  of the interim substitutes and exporters of the technology,  would be able to take back their money contributed to the  Multilateral Fund through the selling of the interim chemicals  and the technology to developing nations.    He questioned why parties to the Montreal Protocol did not  begin to use environmentally sound alternatives now instead of  waiting until 1995 when a review is scheduled of control  measures applicable to the developing countries with respect to  HCFCs, HBCFs and Methyl Bromide.    Greenpeace's arguments about action to reduce  ozone-depleting  substances came at a time when the fifth meeting of parties to  the Montreal Protocol is being held in Bangkok by the United  Nations Environment Programme.    Kamal Nath, India's minister of the environment and forests  and president of the fourth meeting of parties to the protocol,  earlier told a press conference that the protocol was on the way  to successful implementation, although some countries have yet  to join and the Copenhagen Amendment, which agreed  environmentally safe alternatives should replace the interim  substitutes, has yet to be ratified.    Mr. Nath, however, said that even though there was a need to  phase out CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, industries  could not switch overnight and the protocol should not adversely  affect industrial strategies of developing countries.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (4): Remarkable somersault - Profile of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos IN a speech remarkable for its frankness, and poignant in its acknowledgement of good intentions that went disastrously wrong, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos signalled a turning point in Angola's history. Delivering what may prove to be the epitaph of Angola's ruling party or the manifesto for its revival, he told delegates attending the third congress of the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) party that they could not resist the tide of history. It was December 1990. Sixteen months later, Mr dos Santos is still engaged in his formidable task, presiding over the transition from war to a fragile peace, from authoritarian one-party state to a multi-party democracy, and from Marxism to a market economy. The Angolan electorate is scheduled to go to the polls at the end of September to pass judgment on a remarkable ideological somersault by the MPLA leader. 'Some see him as a pragmatist,' observes a former Angolan politician, now retired from the fray, 'others see him as an opportunist, determined to stay in power at all costs.' Wherever the truth lies, the 49-year-old son of a bricklayer will need to draw on all his political skills when helping guide his party and Angola through the months ahead. Mr dos Santos, one of the two key players in Angola's peace process, was only 37 when he succeeded Dr Agostino Neto, the country's first president, who died after emergency surgery in a Moscow hospital in 1979. His credentials were impeccable. Born in Luanda and a member of the Mbundu tribe, the ethnic base of the MPLA which makes up almost a quarter of Angola's population, he joined the party at the age of 19 in 1961, the year which marked the start of armed resistance to Portuguese rule. As the colonial government cracked down on dissent, Neto fled north to Zaire where he became vice-president of the MPLA youth movement in Kinshasa. After two years he took up a scholarship to study petroleum engineering at the Oil and Gas Institute of Baku, in Azerbaijan, then part of the Soviet Union. After graduating in 1969, he took a military telecommunications course and the following year joined MPLA guerrillas in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda. Elected to the party's Central Committee and Political Bureau in 1974, he became independent Angola's first foreign minister in 1975. In August 1987, President dos Santos announced that Angola would seek membership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a further reform package paved the way to admittance in September 1989. As the 1988 US-brokered peace process took effect, with South Africa ceding independence to Namibia in return for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops based in neighbouring Angola, so the pace of economic and political change quickened. 'A real democratic revolution dominates today's world', President dos Santos told the MPLA congress in December 1990 - the last to be held under Angola's one-party system. 'With good sense, realism and caution,' the president continued, 'Angola will able to attain peace'. Sixteen months later, his message holds good.</p>

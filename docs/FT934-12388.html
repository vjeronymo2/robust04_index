			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Motorcycle crowds hide declining industry ABOUT 140,000 visitors are expected at the six-day Motor Cycle Show which opened at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre yesterday. That is about three times the number of motorcycles the industry expects to sell in the whole year. While new car sales continue to recover, executives in the powered two-wheeler market believe that at best their sector is bottoming out after more than a decade of decline. In 1980, Britons bought 315,000 motorcycles, scooters and mopeds. By last year sales were down to 52,000 and Mr Graham Sanderson, spokesman for the British Motorcycling Federation and an executive of market leader Honda, yesterday said that sales were likely to fall further, to about 45,000 units this year. Mr Sanderson said the market would be doing well if this level was sustained next year. One consolation for importers, which control most of the market, and for the resurgent Triumph Motorcycles, now the UK's only producer of any significance, is that the value of machines sold has risen sharply. Industry estimates find that more than two-thirds of all machines sold are of 250cc and above, with many buyers being prepared to pay upwards of Pounds 6,000. NEC show spokesman Mr Dennis Bates said that the majority of sales were made to affluent over-35-year-olds who use motorcycles for leisure rather than for essential transport. However, there is growing concern that young people, on whom the market once relied, are no longer entering the sector via mopeds and low-powered machines. Honda, the world's biggest motorcycle maker which has about 30 per cent of the UK market, has just returned to profitability in the UK after years of losses obscured by its expanding cars business. Midlands property entrepreneur Mr John Bloor remains confident about the future of Triumph, the Leicestershire-based company he controls, which has been making motorcycles with the Triumph badge for three years. Triumph has already captured 13 per cent of the UK market for machines over 750cc.</p>

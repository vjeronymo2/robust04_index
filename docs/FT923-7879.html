			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Regulator faces action over power charges ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS could be paying Pounds 750m for unwanted new power stations, a lobby group for cheaper electricity said yesterday. The group, known as Coffer, or the Coalition for Fair Electricity Regulation, made the accusation in a letter to Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator. It plans to take him to court for failing to keep prices down. Coffer, which was set up last week with the aim of taking the regulator to a judicial review, gave Prof Littlechild a deadline of September 1 to respond to the letter. It argues that because regional electricity supply companies have invested in the new stations they have signed long-term contracts to buy their output. This means they must buy power from the stations, regardless of whether they could get it cheaper elsewhere.</p>

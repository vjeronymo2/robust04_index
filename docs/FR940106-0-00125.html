			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clauses (2) through (5) of &sect;617.15(d) are renumbered (3) through (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Revision of &sect;617.16 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234 of the Trade Act of 1974 specifies the State law provisions that shall be applicable to claimants for TRA purposes, and &sect;617.16 distills the provisions of section 234 in a definition of ``applicable State law.'' Section 617.16 is now being revised for two essential reasons. The first reason is to include in the definition the situation of the worker who is not entitled to UI after separation from adversely affected employment, as is provided for in Section 234. This had not seemed relevant after the 1981 Amendments, because of the addition in section 231(a)(3) of the eligibility requirement that the worker must be entitled to and have exhausted all UI. The 1988 Amendments, however, have prompted rethinking of the roles and responsibilities of the States in the administration of the TAA program, and particularly of the role of the ``applicable State'' (i.e., the State whose law is the applicable State law) in the case of TAA program benefits other than TRA. Accordingly, the definition of ``applicable State law'' is broadened so that it is a useful reference point for all TAA program benefits. While providing a useful reference point, there is no intent in revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.16 to suggest that an individual who is not entitled to UI after a qualifying separation from adversely affected employment may be entitled to TRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second reason for revising &sect;617.16 is to conform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.16 to the revision of &sect;617.26, relating to the roles and responsibilities of the States as liable States and agent States in the administration of the TAA program. As discussed below, &sect;617.26 is revised to incorporate the Department's thinking as set out in Change 2 to GAL 15&hyph;90. In this connection, consideration was given to including in &sect;617.16 the definition of ``applicable State'' which is set forth in Change 2. Upon further consideration, however, it was decided that the definition of ``applicable State law'' furnished the most useful reference point for all purposes of the TAA program, and that a special definition of ``applicable State'' is neither necessary nor useful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, &sect;617.16 is revised to track more closely Section 234, and to serve as a useful reference point for all of the purposes of the TAA program. The section also is modified to make it clear that the UI entitlement referred to is that which immediately follows a qualifying separation from adversely affected employment, and not UI entitlement in some past period, however recent or remote it may have been.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Revision of &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clause (A) of &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii) explains that training is not appropriate when the firm from which the individual was separated plans to recall the individual within the ``reasonably foreseeable future''. Also, &sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) defines ``appropriate'' as including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that the individual will be reemployed by the separating firm. These provisions are consistent with &sect;617.22(a)(1)(ii) on conditions for approval of training when there is reasonable prospect of suitable work within the foreseeable future. (See item 43 below.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While it is reasonable to deny training under &sect;617.22 (a) to a worker who is scheduled for recall, there is an identified need to provide additional guidance in the regulations on the application of the term ``recall that will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future'', for purposes of administering &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(ii)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations are consistent with the Administration's position to tighten waivers. Publication of these regulations will improve efficiency in utilizing waivers. This moves the current TAA program in to closer alignment with the Transitional Adjustment Assistance provisions of NAFTA. Therefore, this section is being amended by adding a new clause ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to &sect;&sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(A), for use in approving training and granting waivers. Clause ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) provides guidance on two types of planned recalls. The first type is a specific recall where an individual or group of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and notified by the employer to return to work within a specified time period. In this situation an individual would not be approved for training and a waiver of the training requirement would be granted for purposes of receiving basic TRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second type is a general recall where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals, or by other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, but does not specify a certain time period in which the recall will occur. In this situation, if the recall in each individual case is reasonably expected to occur after the individual would exhaust his or her eligibility for regular UI associated with the most recent total separation that is within the TAA certification period, the individual would be treated as any other individual who was separated from adversely affected employment and the participation in training requirement would be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Revision of &sect;617.21 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 617.21 describes the activities that are included as reemployment services and allowances. Paragraph (e) of this section is revised to add child care as a support service. This revision is made to eliminate any uncertainty that child care is a support service and that the costs for such service may not be charged as a related cost of training and paid with TAA program funds. See also the Department's response to item 47 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

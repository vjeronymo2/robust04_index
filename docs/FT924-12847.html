			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (2): West is still cautious - Prospects in eastern Europe THE COLLAPSE of Europe's east-west barriers opened up a vast new area to companies looking for new markets and acquisitions to speed their entry into them. From the Elbe to the Pacific Ocean the demise of communism sent western companies scurrying to take advantage of new low-cost production areas close to rich European Community markets. With a few exceptions, however, such as the US General Electric corporation's pioneering takeover over the Hungarian Tungsram lighting company, or Volkswagen's stage- by-stage purchase of a controlling 70 per cent stake in Skoda Automobila, the Czech car company, the amount of equity investment involved has been small by western standards. The initial target areas have been cars, trucks, household appliances, tobacco, pulp and paper, glass, cement, breweries, furniture, food, pharmaceuticals and other consumer goods. The best prices have been obtained where foreign consultants and merchant bankers have been able to attract several potential buyers prepared to bid against each other. The lowest prices have been realised where potential buyers were few, where modernisation or environmental reclamation costs were high or where building a new plant on a greenfield site was a credible alternative. The spreading recession in most western markets and greater awareness of the cost and previously unexpected difficulties associated with buying assets in former communist countries, has also led to greater caution and unwillingness to pay high prices for assets which are often technologically obsolescent or burdened with severe ecological problems. Experience has also shown that assets left too long in the hands of their former communist managers before sale deteriorate alarmingly in net value. This is due to asset disposals and accumulating debts with other enterprises racked up by managers facing eventual privatisation but having to survive somehow in the meantime. But this has not deterred consumer companies looking for established brands to build on or supplant with their own, or strategic investors in sectors like power engineering, where the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri moved in early and fast to Poland and Hungary, and big potential growth areas such as telecommunications. Initially, most investment commitments by western companies, including new greenfield projects, have been modest. Prudent caution in what was practically unknown territory only three years ago has been reinforced by the positive experience of companies which have obtained large productivity gains with little initial investment. Electrolux of Sweden and the ABB group are among several multi-nationals which reaped big productivity gains through injections of managerial know-how, low-cost organisational changes, and the slimming down of bloated labour forces. Thus far western companies, including thousands of small and medium-size private companies - mainly from Germany, Austria, Italy and France - have committed less than Dollars 7bn to the region. Hungary has emerged as the clear favourite of foreign investors, followed by Czechoslovakia and Poland. Uptil now, few foreign investors have been attracted to Romania, despite its low foreign debt and 23m-strong potential market. Bulgaria, which has only just resumed partial interest repayments after declaring a unilateral moratorium on its Dollars 12bn foreign debt, also suffers from its distance from European Community markets and the extent of its former dependence on now collapsed Comecon markets. After initial euphoria at the prospect of opening up the vast Soviet market, foreign investors have also taken fright at the scale of the former Soviet Union's problems and the degree of political uncertainty. The pace of acquisitions has been set largely by the speed and efficiency of the privatisation procedures in the various countries. For unlike acquisitions in other parts of the globe the seller in this region is seldom a private owner. The seller is overwhelmingly the state or a municipality, either directly or through the various privatisation agencies set up to provide a legal and institutional structure for foreign acquisitions. The various privatisation ministries or agencies are also involved in organising mass privatisation programmes (MPPs). Some potential foreign investors see the MPPs, especially in Czechoslovakia, as eventually offering opportunities to make acquisitions cheaply by buying up vouchers from millions of cash-strapped, unsophisticated first-time investors. This remains to be seen. But in the meanwhile foreign buyers have built up a precious data bank of experience over the last three years. According to Mr Andrejs Cakste, the senior vice president in charge of mergers and acquisitions for Electrolux, the Swedish-based domestic appliance group, the specific characteristics for acquiring a company in eastern Europe include a high degree of politics, experience at all levels and above all the need to pay close attention to ecological and other problems linked to the specific nature of communist-style economic management. In an area where basic concept s such as market clearing prices, discounted cash flows, income streams, depreciation and even working capital were largely unknown, it is hardly surprising that one of the first problems faced by potential foreign buyers was that of grossly inflated estimates of the real value of the assets on sale. Three years into the process, however, much has changed. Obtaining the highest possible price, and being able to fend off accusations of selling out the 'national silver' to foreigners for a pittance is less of a priority for the privatisation agencies. Instead, the emphasis is increasingly on seeking a foreign buyer who will give the best employment guarantees and, above all, provide the best assurances of future investment and inputs of managerial skill and new technology. Signs of growing national and ethnic intolerance are clouds on the horizon which could change the political climate for foreign investment and acquisitions. But the consensus now among policy makers in the region is that attracting foreign buyers willing to modernise and integrate former state enterprises into the world economy is the best way to ensure the irreversibility of the democratic social and political changes since the collapse of Soviet power.</p>

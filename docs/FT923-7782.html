			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets (At a glance): Bottom marks for TOPSI Kleinwort Benson's TOPSI-100 Index is made up of the 100 largest equities with historic yields over 120 per cent of the yield on the FT-A All-Share Index. In the past, high yielding shares have often been good performers - but not in the current recession. As the graph shows, the TOPSI Index has substantially lagged the FTSE-100 since the start of 1991. High yields normally indicate that the market believes a company will have difficulty maintaining its dividend, or even paying any dividend at all. In many cases over the past two years, market fears have been justified.</p>

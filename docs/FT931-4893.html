			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Azerbaijan begins pipeline talks with Turkey Azerbaijan's oil minister has begun talks in Ankara that will focus on proposals to build a pipeline to Turkey's Mediterranean coast, according to a Turkish official, reports Reuter. He said Azeri oil minister Mr Sabit Bagirov would meet Turkish foreign minister Mr Hikmet Cetin and officials from the state pipeline company Botas. Talks on piping Azeri oil to Turkey's Yumurtalik terminal had so far been positive and a statement would be made next Monday, he added. One problem has been the choice of route. Turkish officials say the Azeris do not want a pipeline to pass through Armenia because of the war in Azerbaijan's Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

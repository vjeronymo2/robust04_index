			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hajime Wada, Japan Development Bank: "New Demand </F> for Products Through Innovation; The Need for Greater Efficacy  in Organization and Distribution"]    [Text] 1. The adjustments in long-term capital  investment are basically a reaction to the excessive expansion  during the Heisei boom. Japan needs to establish a forward  looking investment strategy and not wallow in needless pessimism.    2. We are at the point where as a whole we can finally  forecast a bottoming out in fiscal 1994 with capital investment  in electrical equipment leading the way cyclically and with a  partial spilling over into other investment categories.    3. It will be necessary to address structural reform in  order to sustain a recovery. To that end, it would be effective  to create new demand for products by restructuring capital and  businesses, by converting import categories, and by innovation.  <H5>  The Extended Slump Is in Reaction to Rapid Expansion </H5>   After private sector capital investment started downward in  fiscal 1992, the decrease accelerated sharply in fiscal 1993 and  is forecast to remain negative during fiscal 1994 as well.  Should the decreases continue for three successive years, this  would be the first time since the end of World War II. There are  some who view this long-term slump in capital investment as a  structural decrease caused by the bursting of the bubble and  connect it to a still longer-term bottoming out; however, such a  view is overly pessimistic.    Capital investment depends on forecasting business results  and expected earnings which affect the future of private sector  companies. If such a future is unclear, the willingness to  invest atrophies and economic vitality is lost. In order to  avoid excessive decreases, it will be necessary to analyze the  reasons for the current slump in capital investment, decide on a  recovery scenario, and then examine the conditions necessary for  a sustained recovery.    The reason for the extended drop in capital spending is that  basically there has been an unusually sharp response to the  Heisei boom. During the Heisei boom there initially was a policy  of low interest rates together with a growth in demand for all  business categories: 1) the construction of office buildings  which accompanied the centralization of finance in Tokyo; 2) an  increase in consumer demand reflecting the advantages of the  high yen and the efficacy of capital; 3) increased investment in  housing accompanying the low interest rates; 4) deregulation  (information, communications, finance, insurance, retailing,  etc.); 5) technological innovations in microelectronics, new  materials, and biotechnology; and 6) major construction projects.    However, there is a point of fundamental difference between  the Heisei boom and preceding periods of high growth. During  preceding periods, while industrialization in heavy chemicals  moved forward through technological leadership, population  shifting from the agricultural to the urban sector promoted  investment in the urban infrastructure and created a demand for  durable consumer goods such as symbolized by the "three sacred  appliances [television, refrigerator, and washmachine]." The  growth in domestic demand on a large scale was, in a manner of  speaking, structural.    This kind of growth in structural domestic demand was not a  significant element in the Heisei boom. Aside from the  technological innovation and deregulation, such growth was  transient. Moreover, with the focus for a time on demand growth  in the form of full employee participation, companies confronted  restrictions on supply and demand. In particular, in looking at  the trends in supply and demand within the construction  industry, we find these pressures continuing from about 1988  through 1990, exceeding those of the construction boom which  started in the Japanese archipelago during the 1970's. This was  absolutely unprecedented. As evident typically in office  buildings, we find that because construction starts lagged,  construction already started continued even when demand  softened, with an enormous reaction.    That the current slump which has dragged on this far is  basically a reaction to the reckless expansion that took place  during the Heisei boom. Or, to phrase it in different terms, it  is unnecessary to be excessively pessimistic about the future.  <H5>  There Are Signs That Electrical Equipment Will Lead the </H5> Recovery    According to a survey of major company capital investment  done by the Japan Development Bank (February 1994), signs  pointing to a recovery were already showing up in the second  half of fiscal 1993. Investments which will generate fresh  demand are being made in semiconductors, liquid crystals, new  pharmaceuticals, laser disks, and medical equipment. Among  these, the largest capital investments are being made in  semiconductors.    When we measure the differences in capital investment by  business category over the past 10 years, one can point to  electrical equipment, which includes semiconductors, as leading  all other business categories in making changes. The category  leads general machinery and chemicals by six months. The reasons  appears to be the short three-to-four-year silicon cycle, the  fierce domestic and foreign competition, and that the industry  is able to make subtle changes in response to shifts in domestic  demand.    We can ascertain through statistical testing (the Granger  Test) that there is a definite correlation between investment in  electronics equipment and investment in chemicals, general  machinery, and precision machinery. We see this in steppers and  inspection equipment in the general and precision machinery  categories as well as in the gases used during the diffusion  process to manufacture semiconductors and the epoxies supplied  by the chemical industry. Although we could hypothesize that the  recent trend is like past patterns, this time we also have  liquid crystal displays, which makes the electronic equipment  lead all the more striking.    In addition to these trends among major companies, a similar  survey of leading companies done by the Japan Development Bank  and a short-term economic survey of small and mid-sized  companies throughout Japan done by the Bank of Japan, which  looked at various correction patterns of the past, trends in  land investments (a deductible category), and the movement of  the leading indicators, estimate growth in GDP base capital  investment fiscal year 1994. The surveys suggest that growth  will remain negative this fiscal year but that bottom will be  hit in the October-December quarter of calendar 1994 with an  upturn coming in the January-March quarter of calendar 1995.    Looking at this fiscal year cyclically, we see a bottoming  out of capital investment centered in part on manufacturing.    There is also an aspect to take note of. According to  industry correlated tables from 1980 to 1992, electrical  equipment had both high production superiority and high export  competitiveness. As already discussed above, we can see the  ripple effect of its lead on other industries, but the effect is  not as great as it has been in the past with home electronics  and appliances. Furthermore, in nonmanufacturing areas, which  lagged about a year behind the manufacturing ones in reflecting  negative earnings, there are areas that will need time to  recover.    Given this, with the expected recovery limping along, the  potential is there for it to emerge as something small in scale.  Consequently, whether or not the recovery becomes something  sustained will have much to do with somehow creating fresh  demand in a variety of areas.    The recovery in semiconductors and liquid crystals has  provided the United States an opportunity for a booming  expansion by allowing it to take the lead in capital investment  in machinery, including that revolving around Asia. With our  domestic demand focused on multimedia, increasing development of  innovations in information technology is definitely taking  place. However, there is the concern that to the extent the  recovery can provide the opportunity for exports, it will be  tied to the high yen and the continued growth in the balance of  payments. Therefore, even if new products are developed as in  the past, it is clear in terms of economic scale that including  the export market will be more effective than to restrict  investment to the domestic market.    In order to extricate ourselves from the current impasse, we  must solve the dilemma of exports.  <H5>  The Investment Strategy Used in the Past Will Not Work </H5>   If we analyze the balance between domestic savings and  investment while paying heed to long-term shifts in the ratio of  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the balance of payments, we can  see that the factor determining that shift is largely capital  investment by private sector companies. On the other hand, if we  look at this in terms imports versus exports, the shift in the  balance is due to imports, not exports.    Consequently, if it is important to reduce the surplus in  the  balance of payments, then the macroeconomic strategy necessary  to maintain Japan's corporate vitality becomes something as  follows. To wit, it will be important to shift the balance of  payments downward by promoting aggressive overseas development,  production, and importation in traditional areas where we have  lost international competitiveness. We will need to create an  environment in which we can fully realize those areas of  research and development, capital investment, and export, where  we are internationally competitive.    Furthermore, capital investment over the mid-term will  emerge  through important and decisive resolution of corporate  strategies. The business environment is transforming toward  this. Until 1980's, networks among Japanese companies as well as  internal company systems made possible extensive capital  investment with minimal risk. On the other hand, with the  macroeconomic prescription of a shift toward imports, the  existence of this rigid system becomes an obstacle.    Coming into the 1990's, U.S. companies that studied Japan's  system have pushed forward with networking among companies in  terms of the "design in" approach (cooperation among companies  from the design stage) and innovative manufacturing processes  which are bearing fruit in their recent capital investment boom.  This indicates that Japanese companies have completely lost the  relative superiority they held in the past.    Given this situation, future corporate strategies in  traditional areas will be something as follows: First, to effect  innovations in organizational change in order to effect capital  investment in intensive restructuring, more favorable  distribution, and innovations of organization in order to deal  with latent consumer and customer needs. Next, place emphasis on  product development in order to create fresh demand, that is, to  push forward with product innovation.</p>

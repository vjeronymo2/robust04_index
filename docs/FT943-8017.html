			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: GPG bid for art company set to succeed Guinness Peat Group, Sir Ron Brierley's UK-based company, may soon own a Picasso and an extensive collection of French impressionist, and modern Belgian and Dutch art, if it succeeds in its bid for Dunbar Sloane and European Art, the New Zealand concern which invests in art on a long-term basis. GPG has steadily increased its shareholding in the company to 31 per cent over the past 18 months. Apart from its art collection, valued at about NZDollars 12m (Pounds 4.66m), Dunbar Sloane has NZDollars 4m cash. Mr Dunbar Sloane said he would be accepting the offer, a mix of shares and cash, which values the company at NZDollars 13.5m. He expects GPG to sell the collection over the next four years as the European art market improves.</p>

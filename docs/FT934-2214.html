			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Day of frantic telephone diplomacy brings accord It was a day of frantic telephone diplomacy. By the time Downing Street aides summoned lobby journalists to a remote nook of the Palace of Westminster at 8.11pm to signal that a declaration had been agreed - bar a few uncrossed t's and undotted i's  - prime minister Mr John Major and his Irish counterpart had spoken twice. Some of their officials had been on the line far more frequently. The result was confirmation that the Major-Reynolds roadshow, which had taken in Brussels, Dublin and Brussels again in little more than six weeks would reconvene - they hoped in triumph - in London today. The language the aides used was still cautious. 'Some details', they said, had still to be 'sorted out'. But it was clear that - barring an extraordinary setback - the two premiers will today unveil the long-promised joint declaration that they hope will pave the way for peace. The cautious aides 'expect' the prime minister to brief MPs on developments in the afternoon. The prime minister's day of detailed, last-minute haggling on Ulster started about 10am when he met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, and others. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was in Belfast. At 10.25am the first 15-minute phone call between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds took place. Some square brackets cordoning off sensitive areas of text in the unfinished declaration were rubbed out. But more remained to be done. It was decided that the two leaders would have to speak again later in the day. In the meantime Mr Major had to deal with prime minister's questions in the House of Commons where, curiously, the situation in the province did not crop up - although the Rev Martyn Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, made a dogged and unsuccessful attempt to catch the Speaker's eye. The second conversation came about 4pm. Some progress was made in the course of a 'constructive' 10-minute exchange. But not enough. Aides were saying at 4.30pm that a third conversation between the leaders might be necessary. This turned out to be pessimistic. Officials were able to clear enough of the remaining logjam for the lobby journalists to be summoned. Mr Reynolds will arrive at Downing Street at 11am today and - perhaps - make history.</p>

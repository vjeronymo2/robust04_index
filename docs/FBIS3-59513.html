Billerbeck: "Japanese Company Does </F> Research in Oxford; Part of European Research Landscape"]    [Text] Oxford, VDI-N, 17 Sep--Japanese firms see in the  countries of Europe not only lucrative sales markets; they are  also interested in the ideas of local researchers and  developers. Technologies for future products are by no means  being developed only in Japan. An example of this is Sharp  Laboratories Europe (SLE) in the English university town of  Oxford.    Clive C. Bradley, the managing director of SLE in Oxford,  came right to the point: "Why does a company like Sharp invest  in research facilities abroad?" In his answer to the question he  cited several arguments for such a commitment. For one thing, a  technology company with international commitments cannot afford  to do without the productive influences of another scientific  culture, the creativity of researchers who have other ways of  looking at things. And for another, research on the spot also  supports integration into the respective markets.    "Moreover," Bradley went on, "we in Europe have easier  access  to what goes on here in colleges and universities. And,  naturally, we also want to avoid friction in international trade  and to improve our image."    Under no circumstances do the approximately 50 SLE employees  feel that they are an appendage to a central laboratory in  Japan. They have their own research areas in which each of them  wants to occupy a technologically leading position. They are  working on four main areas in Oxford: optoelectronics, image  processing, information technology -- especially in the fields  of translation systems and disseminated artificial intelligence  -- and liquid crystal technology.    The laboratory was founded in 1990 and was initially housed  in rented rooms. Then about 13 million pounds were invested  until 1992 in the construction and furnishing of its own  building, which is located in a technology park near Oxford. It  is anticipated that about 100 scientists and engineers will be  working here in the finally expanded building. Sharp employs a  total of 6,500 people worldwide in research and development. Its  investments in R &amp; D amount to about 660 million pounds a  year.    All SLE research projects are coordinated with Sharp's  central research and development, but are then developed in  Europe. The patents that are produced by the projects are also  first applied for in Europe or England. Bradley: "We think of  ourselves as part of the European research landscape and want to  be accepted as such. Our goal is broad collaboration with other  research facilities -- in so doing, we're trying to be as open  as we can." Of course, there are already cooperative ventures  with British universities -- first of all with those in Oxford  -- but universities on the European continent are also on  Bradley's wishlist: "We also participate in various European  research programs." The open admission that they are moving  toward becoming a European research facility is also expressed  in the company's personnel policy. The majority of its employees  come from Europe, some from the United States, and some from  Japan. Occupied by a European, the post of managing director is  also part of this policy. He admits that European engineers have  to in part be paid higher salaries than for comparable positions  in Japan. But this is compensated for by the already mentioned  advantages.    SLE research projects are conducted in large part in the  field of basic research. Dr. Robert G.W. Brown, the head of the  optoelectronics department: "We're working on, for example,  semiconductor nanostructures to be able to produce new kinds of  laser diodes with a broad color spectrum. Another team is  working with optical neuron networks. These make possible  completely new approaches to image processing since they process  optical data optically." In his opinion, the work they have been  doing on blue and ultraviolet lasers for optical storage and  printing systems has almost reached the production stage.    In the image processing sector in Oxford they are in  particular working on a new technique for the three-dimensional  electronic representation of images. The new method gets by  without any additional aids -- stereo eyeglasses, for example --  and works like 3-D printing, with which we have been long  familiar. Another project is the development of a high-quality,  high-resolution color printing process.    Bradley cited a computer-supported translation system as a  typical example of a development project that is oriented toward  European market requirements. It should be capable of  automatically translating texts from one European language into  another. In the process the programmers have had to solve  serious problems inherent in the different structures of the  individual languages. However, a demonstration of the system  produced no distortion of meaning, not even after a sentence was  translated from English into German, then into French, and back  into English.    Research projects in the field of liquid crystals constitute  the fourth pillar in Oxford. For the present they are being used  in a big way in display units for portable computers. The Oxford  developers are working here especially with so-called  ferroelectric LCs, which permit substantially higher switching  speeds as compared with conventional materials.    SLE is one example of the Sharp Company's European  commitment, but not the only one by far. Kenjiro Tsugawa, the  head of the information systems department, alluded proudly to  the 25th anniversary of the head office in Hamburg, which is to  be celebrated this year. Worldwide, the company has 64,000  employees and it had a sales volume of about DM19 billion in  1992. Tsugawa: "We were able to triple our sales volume in  Europe in the past 10 years. Even in the difficult financial  year, 1992-1993, we were able to attain a sales volume of DM1.2  billion." Unlike other firms, they are determined to further  increase their investments in buildings and equipment as well as  their expenditures for research development since "these are  investments in our future."</p>

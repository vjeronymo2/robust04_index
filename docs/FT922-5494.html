			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical company, is expected on Thursday to announce a rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 345m to about Pounds 360m, excluding property disposals. Attention will be focused on margins at Boots The Chemist, and on attempts to turnround Halfords and Do-It-All. Thames Water, largest of the privatised water companies, may announce an increase in annual pre-tax profit of less than Pounds 20m, to Pounds 230m or so, next Tuesday, while the dividend increase is expected to be 10 per cent. As its area is one of the worst affected by drought, its views on metering will be of interest. It will also be questioned on progress on its Pounds 4bn capital spending programme, including the London ring main. Siebe, the engineering and controls group, is likely to be questioned closely on North American trading next Wednesday. Optimists are forecasting a modest advance in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 159m to Pounds 162m, with the more pessimistic pitching for a decline to Pounds 150m. Both parties agree strong cash generation is likely to have cut the high gearing. Reed International, the publishing and information group, reports its annual results on Wednesday, with some analysts expecting a small decline compared with last time's pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 218.5m. However, Reed is expected to show strong growth once the recession is clearly over. De La Rue, the the UK-based security printer and payment machine maker, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m, up from Pounds 58.9m, when it announces annual results on Tuesday. The group which has been successfully turned around by Jeremy Marshall, chief executive and formerly of Hanson, has successfully managed to cut out more costs. These profits would represent 32.1p of earnings and analysts expect the dividend to increase from 13.7p to 15p.</p>

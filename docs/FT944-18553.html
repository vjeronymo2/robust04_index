			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: Commodities, the vexing exception - The Global Investor It has been a pretty lousy year for conventional investors. Bond markets have collapsed: equities, as measured by the FT-A World Index, are up just 5 per cent. Even gold has gone nowhere, having started the year at Dollars 391 an ounce and risen to just Dollars 396. The vexing exception has been commodities: not oil or precious metals, but boring old copper, rubber and soyabeans. The Economist commodity index is up some 40 per cent since January. The smart fund manager would not have spent his time shuffling paper assets. He would have rented a warehouse on the Rotterdam docks and filled it to the roof. Commodities are mostly regarded these days less as an opportunity than a threat. They are a harbinger of inflation, and thus bad news for other types of asset. Given the historical evidence, this is not unreasonable. The bond markets are a distinctly fallible guide to future inflation; sometimes they overplay it, sometimes underplay it, sometimes get it wrong entirely. Commodities, on the other hand, are not so much a guide to inflation as a component of it. How big a component is another matter. As the accompanying charts remind us, there have been three surges in world inflation since the early 1970s: in 1973-4, 1979-80 and 1987-90. In each case commodities (measured by the IMF index, which gives a longer series) started moving several months in advance. But there were also two subsidiary blips in inflation, in 1976-77 and 1983-84. In each case the commodities index jumped sharply, even though the underlying trend in inflation was still downwards. The 40 per cent rise in the Economist index thus poses an obvious question: is it forecasting a surge or a blip? In one important sense, this rise is abnormal. It began not at the start of the year, but the previous spring. Despite that, the rise in retail prices in the developed world is still subdued and uncertain. This implies an historically unusual reluctance by consumers to pay higher prices. Several reasons can be advanced for this: in particular, the revolution in working practices throughout the developed world, which has created an unpreceden-ted sense of job insecurity at all levels of society. Whatever the cause, this phenomenon implies in turn a squeeze on manufacturers' profit margins. There is anecdotal support for this: the tyre manufacturer able to raise prices by only 5 per cent in the face of a soaring rubber price, the food company faced with a 50 per cent rise in the nut price and unable to charge more for a packet of roasted peanuts, and - at the lunatic end of the scale - UK newspaper proprietors slashing their prices in response to a jump in the cost of newsprint. This situation can only be finally resolved in one of two ways: either consumers agree to pay more, or manufacturers are forced to pay less. If the former, central bankers will be confirmed in their suspicions of reviving inflation and will jack up interest rates. So much the worse for commodities as a non-interest bearing investment. If the latter, so much the worse for commodities again. The choice between these two options cannot easily be resolved. Indeed, it might be termed the dominant theme for investment in the mid 1990s. The original upsurge of inflation in the developed world can be set down to various causes: the Vietnam war, the collapse of Bretton Woods, the first oil shock of 1973. There is no clear explanation of why inflation should then have remained endemic for over 20 years. Without knowing why the phenomenon was there in the first place, it is hard to be confident that it has gone away. Let us suppose that the dragon of inflation is indeed loose again. In that case, commodities might be expected to do well in the short run. But since they have done spectacularly well now for 18 months, it is worth recalling their record over the longer haul. Since the beginnings of inflation in the early 1970s, retail prices worldwide have gone up fivefold and commodities threefold. Equities have gone up by a factor of six: they have also, of course, provided an inflation-proof stream of income in the form of dividends. The fact that commodities have done so dismally compared to equities is hardly surprising. The whole thrust of advanced economies is away from basic materials and towards services and added value. First IBM overhauls US Steel, then Microsoft overhauls IBM. In the whole scheme of things, raw materials are becoming less and less important. This in itself should stand as a warning to investors. Commodities may lag behind the world economy in their sum of value, but global savings do not. It follows that as a home for investment, commodities become progressively less and less liquid: and that any attempt by investors to switch into them in size is more and more likely to lead to speculative excess. How far this is happening now is not easy to determine. Even manufacturers, who buy commodities for their primary purpose of consumption, can only talk anecdotally about a degree of speculative pressure. But an unusual shift of portfolio funds into commodities in the past year would go some way to explaining the apparent paradox whereby commodity producers have been able to push through price increases which their customers know they cannot pass on. With or without the return of inflation, this suggests that rather a risky bubble may have developed in the commodities markets. Only last week Goldman Sachs, the all-powerful US investment bank, sent a bullish circular to its clients entitled 'The Case for Commodities'. You have been warned.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 29/9/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   % change over period                       US     Japan    Germany    France   Italy   UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                0.09      0.05     0.09       0.10    0.15   0.10 Month               0.41      0.21     0.41       0.46    0.69   0.42 Year                3.50      2.50     5.88       6.19    8.50   5.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week               -0.23      0.07     0.30       0.45    1.27   0.43 Month              -1.00      1.24    -0.71      -0.38    2.42  -0.42 Year               -2.47      1.60     1.84       0.06    2.21   0.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week               -0.34     -0.04     0.64       0.84    2.03   0.63 Month              -2.09      1.99    -1.42      -1.37    2.89  -1.20 Year               -7.26      0.50    -2.93      -6.18   -4.09  -3.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week                 0.0       0.1     -0.3        0.1     0.8   -0.7 Month               -2.7      -3.0     -5.1       -7.6    -3.1   -7.9 Year                 2.5      -0.7      7.7       -4.9    12.3    2.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

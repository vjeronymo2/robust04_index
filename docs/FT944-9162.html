			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Celsius advances 29% at nine-month stage Celsius, the Swedish defence group, yesterday announced income after financial items of SKr644m (Dollars 88.4m) for the nine months to September, a 29 per cent increase from SKr499m in the same 1993 period. This year's performance reflected a strong operating result and some capital gains, whereas a year ago it was strong money market returns on the back of falling interest rates which generated most of the profit. The improved operating profit of SKr449m, against SKr196m, was due mainly to rationalisation. On top of this there was a SKr143m capital gain from the sale of 40 per cent of Safe Partners, an offshore company, in September. The group expects a full-year profit of around SKr900m.</p>

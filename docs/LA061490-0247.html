			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MOSES TO MISS GOODWILL GAMES?  </P> <P> Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter intermediate  hurdles, apparently will miss the Goodwill Games.  </P> <P> Moses, a paid representative for the international competition that runs from  July 20 to Aug. 5, is not competing in The Athletics Congress track and field  meet at Cerritos College in Norwalk.  </P> <P> The meet, which opens today, is the sole U.S. qualifying event for Goodwill  Games track events.  </P> <P> Bill Sears of the Goodwill Games organizing committee and Mark Parkman of  Turner Broadcasting System, which is televising the Olympics-style event, said  they were unaware that Moses was not entered at Norwalk.  </P> <P> He did not compete last year, lacked a sufficiently recent qualifying mark from  TAC to be considered and did not file a petition to enter the meet.  </P> <P> Under rules established by TAC, athletes must finish first or second at Norwalk  to qualify for the Goodwill Games or must compete at Norwalk and then get a  special invitation.  </P></p>

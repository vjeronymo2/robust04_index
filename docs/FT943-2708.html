			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Chancellor raises base rates by half a point - At a Glance Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, moved to nip inflation in the bud this week by raising base rates by half a point to 5.75 per cent. The last rate change before that was a quarter-point cut to 5.25 per cent in February. Clarke said he decided to raise rates on Monday 'to take no risks with inflation' at a time of strong economic growth. Some business organisations criticised the move, but the market's initial reaction was relatively favourable. However, the announcement on Thursday that retail sales had fallen in August prompted questions over whether the chancellor had acted prematurely. For mortgage rates, see Page V.</p>

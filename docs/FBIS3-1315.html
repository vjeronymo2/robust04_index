The general principles section deals with the inviolable  respect for and sovereignty of the Somali people; opposing the  use of force to resolve anything; implementation of the  cease-fire and voluntary disarmament; respect for and  preservation of human and democratic rights; creation of  suitable conditions to enable the Somali people to coexist  fraternally in line with their traditions, culture and politics;  and rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country to enable  it to rise out of the destruction of the civil war.    The second section of the agreement provides for the  formation of an administration: The restoration of peace to  Somalia, giving priorities to trouble spots; the holding in  Mogadishu of a conference to be attended by the signatories to  the Addis Ababa agreement and the Somali National Movement on 15  April this year; the drafting of election laws and procedures;  and methods for participating in the national reconciliation  conference.

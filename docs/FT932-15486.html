			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Observer: Heart of the matter If Lord Hanson can do it, why can't Malcolm Walker, Britain's frozen food king? Walker, the ebullient chairman of Iceland Frozen Foods, is suffering from an increasingly common affliction of Britain's multi-millionaire class. He has caught the radio bug. Walker, 47, who transformed a roadside strawberry stall into a Pounds 600m retailing growth stock, wants to open a commercial radio station in his company's north-west back yard. He has persuaded Chrysalis, the media group, and Greenalls, the brewers, to help him start Heart FM. Not that he has the field to himself. There are plenty of other likely lads ranging from Owen Oyston, the socialist millionaire, to former Granada boss David Plowright, who fancy their chances of being the voice of the north-west. But Walker's big advantage is his marketing flair. He's already playing tapes of Heart FM's romantic, easy listening music in Iceland's 100-plus shops in the region. And in case customers are not listening, he has plastered his shop windows with giant posters - Heart FM, the future sound of the north-west? But is this the sort of message that the City wants to hear? It is one thing for a veteran businessman like Lord Hanson to indulge himself by setting up Melody Radio. But Walker is a relative newcomer to the stock market and a good 20 years younger than Melody Radio's promoter. Unlike Lord Hanson, Walker still has to prove his staying power. Better to stick to frozen food for a bit longer, Malcolm.</p>

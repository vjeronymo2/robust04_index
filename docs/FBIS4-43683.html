			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- In the view of Dieter Spoeri  (Social Democratic Party of Germany), chairman of the economic  ministers' conference, the Bundesbank is endangering Germany's  economic recovery with its unclear monetary policy. In an  interview with DPA in Stuttgart on Sunday [19 June] the  Baden-Wuerttemberg economics minister said that the  international financial markets are, on the whole, on a  dangerous "crash course." "The visible sign of that is the  dramatic increase in the capital market interests, which have  gone up by more than 1.5 percentage points since the beginning  of the year. This once again destroys the recovery of the  development of investments, which had become visible over the  past few months."    In Spoeri's view, the clear line of the Bundesbank has been  completely lost. For some time now periods of excessively long  intervals between reductions of the interest rates have been  alternating with inexplicably high reductions of the interest  rates, such as in May. This has eliminated the leeway for a  constant policy of interest rate reduction for months.    Furthermore, the rigid fixation of the Bundesbank on the  short-term development of the money supply is absolutely  counterproductive for stability policy, the minister noted. The  excessive expansion of the money supply has been caused by the  Bundesbank itself. In addition, by dramatizing the development  of the money supply the Bundesbank is fanning fear of inflation  on the part of the actors on the financial markets, a fear that  is actually unjustified in Germany at the moment.    Spoeri says that for him it is still a secret how the  Bundesbank wants to persuade the partners to the wage  negotiations to come to wage contracts for 1995, too, which are  compatible with stability, if it acts in this way. As a result  of contradictory statements by leading Bundesbank members  regarding further leeway for the reduction of the interest  rates, Spoeri thinks that "not even the direction of monetary  policy in Germany can be seen clearly anymore."    He appealed to the Bundesbank to prevent a "crash scenario"  on the financial markets by returning to the criteria of  constancy and predictability in the indispensable policy of  reducing interest rates.</p>

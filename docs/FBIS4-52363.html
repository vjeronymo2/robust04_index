			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Margarita H. Debuque] </F>   [Text] The country's export earnings for the first quarter  this year rose by 17.8 percent to $2.92 billion -- a  $440-million uptick from $2.48 billion in the same period last  year.    Dollar earnings for March alone amounted to $1.05 billion,  or  up 24.6 percent from its year ago value of $842.46 million.  Month on month, March export receipts exceeded February  earnings by a hefty $132 million.    The National Statistics Office said this is only the fifth  time export earnings for a single month hurdled the  billion-dollar mark. The other four times were in September to  December last year.    As before, electronics and components (composed of  micro-circuits and semiconductors) continued to get the lion's  share of exports. Dollar earnings in the sector, registering at  $302.04 million, accounted for 28.8 percent of total March  exports. This followed a whopping 49 percent annual growth.    Garments and accessories came in second with receipts valued  at $161.44 million. Though earnings dipped slightly by 0.4  percent from the previous month, the sector still absorbed a  chunk of export receipts -- about 15.4 percent of total March  export earnings.    Meanwhile, ignition wiring set and other wiring sets used in  vehicles, aircraft and ships ranked third after netting earnings  of $32.14 million. This is 36.2 percent higher than the  previous year's value of $23.6 million, but 5.6 percent lower  than $34.06 million in February.    Riding the wave of economic recovery in foreign markets,  dollar earnings from exports of woodcrafts and furniture  registered at $29.35 million a 15.9 percent jump from last year  is $25.33 million.    Similarly, demand for frozen and chilled shrimps and prawns  leaped by 66.6 percent to $28.33 million. This was tailed  closely by cathodes and sections of cathodes of refined copper  and gold with receipts ringing up $27.34 million and $22.35  million respectively. Gold in particular, more than doubled its  earnings as it posted the highest growth rate of 129 percent. A  decline in demand, however, was posted by the coconut oil  industry because of competition from other vegetable oils and  stunted local production.    To show for this, export earnings from coconut oil, though  in  the eighth slot, fell by 13.1 percent to its March value of  $20.89 million.    Other top dollar earners of the country were fresh bananas  ($20 million) and footwear ($18 million).    The ten principal exports altogether recorded earnings worth  $661.88 million accounting for 63 percent of total March 1994  exports.  <H5>  Top Markets </H5>   In the first quarter of the year, the Philippine's trade  with  the ten major foreign markets registered at $2.41 billion. This  is 18 percent higher than $2.04 billion posted in the comparable  period last year.    For March alone, dollar receipts from the ten top markets  amounted to $871.88 million or 83 percent of total export value.    The United States remained the top importer of Philippine  products with export earnings from that country reaching $360.55  million. U.S. consumers gobbled up 34.3 percent of total  exports.    Demand for Philippine products there rose 18.5 percent from  last year's level as consumers crawled out of a recession.    Local products that did well in the U.S. market include  garments, electronics and ignition wiring sets.    Japan ranked second, with Philippine imports worth $176.69  million or 16.8 percent of the country's total export receipts  in March.    Third was Hong Kong, with export purchases reaching $55.11  million, followed closely by U.K. with imports worth $51.02  million.    Gains from the major export markets in March added up to  $228.52 million or 21.8 percent of total export earnings.    Other markets were Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, the  Netherlands, Thailand and Korea.</p>

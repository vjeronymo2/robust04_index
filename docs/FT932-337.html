			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Primerica backs investment veteran against Merrill - Robert Greenhill has been snapped up to strengthen the group's weak link MR SANFORD Weill's delight was undisguised when he announced last week that Mr Robert Greenhill, the former president of Morgan Stanley, had agreed to be chairman and chief executive of Smith Barney Shearson. Mr Weill, chairman of the financial services group Primerica, had created Smith Barney Shearson in March when he bought the stockbroking and asset management business of Shearson Lehman from American Express, and merged it with Primerica's Smith Barney securities unit. The Dollars 1bn merger created a brokerage house to rival almost any on Wall Street. Yet the new operation, for all its strengths in retail stockbroking and asset management, lacked a presence in one crucial area - investment banking. When Smith Barney, a purely retail firm, merged with Shearson Lehman, the latter's investment banking operation had stayed with American Express. At the time of the Shearson acquisition, Mr Weill appeared content to concentrate on retail stockbroking. Yet, the unexpected availability of Mr Greenhill, who suddenly stepped down as Morgan Stanley president in March having missed out in the race to be chairman, clearly revived his interest in turning Smith Barney Shearson into an investment banking powerhouse as well. In the 56-year-old Mr Greenhill Mr Weill has landed not only a close friend and adviser (the two are neighbours in Connecticut), but one of Wall Street's premier investment bankers. In his 31-year career at Morgan Stanley, Mr Greenhill created the firm's mergers department and later ran its investment banking business for 13 years. During the 1980s he worked on some of the biggest corporate deals of the era, servicing a roster of blue-chip clients that included IBM, General Motors and RJR Nabisco. The former Morgan Stanley banker now has the job of building up Smith Barney Shearson's investment banking muscle to the point where the firm can wrestle with the only integrated brokerage and investment banking firm on Wall Street of a comparable size - Merrill Lynch. It is a formidable task. The two firms are in the same league when it comes to retail broking; Merrill has 12,700 brokers, who generated brokerage commissions of Dollars 714m in the first quarter of this year; Smith Barney Shearson has 11,600 brokers, who brought in a combined Dollars 576m of commissions over the three months. Merrill also has the lead in asset management, with about Dollars 500bn of US customer assets under its control, compared with Dollars 310bn for Smith Barney Shearson. It is in the investment banking arena, however, that Merrill dwarfs the Primerica unit. In the first quarter, Merrill's revenues from investment banking totalled Dollars 445m, whereas Smith Barney Shearson's combined revenues were only Dollars 121m. Mr Greenhill's job is to close that gap. There is plenty of logic behind the move into investment banking. At the best integrated securities firms, the retail stockbroking and investment banking businesses have a truly symbiotic relationship - the brokers need the investment bankers to create products (corporate stocks and bonds) that they can sell, while the investment bankers need the brokers' network of investors to sell their products. If Smith Barney Shearson chose not to develop an investment banking operation, the distribution capabilities of its retail broking business would go to waste. As Mr Weill put it last week: 'We're going to build . . . a great investment banking and brokerage company. It would be very hard to be terrific in one part and not terrific in another part.' Or, as Mr John Keefe, an independent securities industry analyst, says: 'With all that new sales capacity which came with Shearson, they needed a bigger investment banking presence.' Mr Weill's ambition to build an integrated securities house, however, is not easily achieved. Merrill remains the only firm successfully to run large broking and investment banking businesses side by side. The last one that tried, Shearson Lehman, failed miserably, and the attempt ended in American Express selling Shearson's broking business to Primerica. Smith Barney Shearson could run into one of the problems that bedeviled Shearson Lehman - the inability of two different business cultures to mix. At Shearson Lehman, the blue-blooded, relationship-oriented world of investment banking clashed with the more free-wheeling, sales-oriented world of retail stockbroking, and the result was a lot of unhappy executives, not much synergy, and disappointing earnings. The culture clash issue is real. Mr Greenhill is a characteristically cultivated and reserved Morgan Stanley banker, while his new colleagues at Smith Barney Shearson (especially the firm's president-to-be, retail chief Mr Joseph Plumeri) are motivational managers used to handling an army of hard-selling brokers. Mr Greenhill, however, is not unnerved by the prospect of working alongside an entirely new breed of Wall Street professional: 'It should be a lot of fun,' he says. Throughout his business career, the Primerica chairman has generally had a good sense of timing, but some analysts question Mr Weill's decision to push Smith Barney Shearson into investment banking at a time when the business is enjoying an unprecedented boom. Some fear the current strength of the market may cause Smith Barney Shearson to expand too much, too quickly. Although he applauds the hiring of Mr Greenhill, industry analyst Mr Keefe says: 'My concern is how much the industry can stand . . . especially when the business gets tough again. This is a difficult environment from which to judge the future because it's so active and so profitable.' Although Smith Barney Shearson plans to shed about 1,200 support staff following the merger of the two firms, it will soon start hiring investment bankers. Fortunately, several years of industry consolidations mean there is a large pool of unemployed bankers waiting to return to Wall Street. Mr Weill will also be hoping that Mr Greenhill brings some of his old Morgan Stanley clients with him to Smith Barney Shearson. 'It's a free country, and clients will do business with whom clients want to do business.' The new Smith Barney Shearson chairman does not lack an incentive to work hard. Three days after he agreed to take the job, Mr Greenhill spent Dollars 35m of his own money on Primerica stock. The day after, the stock price climbed 7 per cent on the news of his hiring, adding Dollars 2.4m to the value of his holding. The price rise added considerably more to Mr Weill's substantially bigger stake in Primerica - another reason for last week's smiles.</p>

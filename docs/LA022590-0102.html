			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTO'S MACHINE OPERATOR GOOFED  </P> <P> Telecast of the winning numbers in the California Lotto was delayed more than  40 minutes Saturday night after the person who operates the machine forgot to  hit the button that releases the balls.  </P> <P> The automatic number selector shakes numbered balls around in a plastic bubble,  then drops down seven balls with the winning numbers.  </P> <P> The tape of the drawing was not telecast or the numbers publicly announced  until 8:45 p.m.  </P> <P> An auditor and security officials were on hand to monitor the selection, "to  keep it all honest," said John Schade, spokesman for the state lottery. "So  that there is no question that the numbers that were announced were the ones  that came down at that time."  </P> <P> The winning numbers were 44, 30, 33, 18, 36 and 49. The bonus number was 43.  </P> <P> Saturday night's jackpot was $6.3 million.  </P></p>

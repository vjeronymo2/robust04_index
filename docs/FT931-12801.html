			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sales at Nestle move ahead 8% NESTLE, the world's largest food group, said its consolidated sales grew 8 per cent in 1992 to SFr54.5bn (Dollars 37.78bn), broadly in line with a forecast made in November. The group said the increase in sales volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals, was 3.3 per cent, compared with the 4 per cent rise in the previous year. The decline was mainly due to a combination of recession and price increases in Brazil. The sales figures include a substantial contribution from Source Perrier, consolidated since July 1. Up to the end of October, Perrier added SFr800m to sales. The group will publish its profit and dividend proposal on March 24.</p>

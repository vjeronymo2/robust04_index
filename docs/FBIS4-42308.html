			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal."-initialed report: "Chancellor and Candidate Vie for </F> Support of Economy"]    [Excerpt] Bonn, 31 May -- The parties are widely in  agreement as far as the findings are concerned -- as an economic  center, Germany is in a difficult situation. However, there are  considerable differences regarding the necessary therapy. This  became obvious at the annual meeting of the Federal Association  of German Industry [BDI] in Bonn. BDI President Tyll Necker  pointed out that his association had warned of the dangers for  Germany as an economic center since 1987, and called for a major  reduction of costs, deregulation, and for flexibility.    Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl regards more part-time jobs  as  an essential opportunity to reduce unemployment. Apart from  that, he called on the credit sector to think about  possibilities to mobilize more equity capital and improve the  financing situation in general. Federal Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP],  admitted that industry, which continues to constitute the basis  of prosperity, had sometimes been badly treated. The minister  accused the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] of  preventing in the Bundesrat the necessary reforms for improving  the quality of Germany as an economic center. However, he  appeared to be optimistic believing that Germany had already  embarked on the path out of the crisis. SPD Chairman Rudolf  Scharping threw cold water on Rexrodt's optimism when he said  that the German economy was still far away from a real upswing.  Scharping warned against an unrealistic assessment of economic  developments only because of the upcoming election and against  presenting the economy as being sounder than it really is.    The federal chancellor said he was optimistic about economic  developments. Kohl delivered his speech at the dinner at night,  which is why he did not meet his challenger, who addressed the  meeting in the morning. Rexrodt said that the Germans had  understood that they have to make efforts themselves and that  they could not always come up with demands. In that respect,  people understand the necessity to consolidate the state  finances. The minister resolutely rejected the creation of new  subsidies. He gave assurance that the coalition would before  long present the tax policy concept for the next legislative  term as demanded by the business community. Moreover, the  coalition was thinking of ways and means of introducing tax  concessions for private risk capital that goes to the new  laender. The coalition had picked up this proposal from Necker.  In the medium term, tax on revenues must be cut. Moreover, the  solidarity surcharge, due to be reintroduced in January 1995,  must be phased out again as quickly as possible. The essential  thing is not only to reduce high unemployment but to return to  full employment. This will mean that the labor market has to be  reorganized and made more flexible. All measures must be geared  toward strengthening industry decisively, because economic  developments are essentially dependent on industry and not on  the service sector, as many people now claim. Rexrodt said that  the strong growth rates in the east German production sector  confirm his assessment that, deep inside, German industry is  sound and vital.    Yet, according to Scharping, the growth rates on the foreign  markets are not sufficient when hardly anything or nothing at  all is happening on the domestic markets, which are decisive for  75 percent of the economy. Enterprise incomes in east Germany  are only the result of transfers. Investments are being "blown  up" through special depreciation. The SPD chancellor candidate  repeated the promise that if they were to win the election in  October, the SPD would under no circumstances increase the  burden of taxes and rates beyond the 1995 level. The more than  52 percent of state share in the national product would be  reduced in the same way as net new borrowing, once the overall  developments of the economy permitted.    At the same time, Scharping promised the continuation of  investment promotion for 1995. The minister president of  Rhineland- Palatinate was worried that the share of research and  development funds in the federal budget sank by almost  one-third. This must change, because aviation and space  technology, environmental and gene technology must be  strengthened again in Germany. Therefore one must think how  participations in risk capital can be effectively promoted  through regulations in the sphere of income and corporation tax  laws. At the same time, a reform of the trade tax was  necessary, too.    Having said that, Scharping once more outlined his ideas of  a  supplementary tax for high income earners. It is to be expected  that private consumption would significantly decrease as a  result of a burden caused by the contributions to the nursing  care insurance and the solidarity surcharge. This would make  moderate wage agreements more difficult. Since this was bad for  the economy, the state should no longer attack the pockets of  the employees and increase taxes only for the top 20 percent of  income-earners. "Everybody has the moral duty to contribute to  the well-being of the community as a whole," Scharping said.  [passage omitted]</p>

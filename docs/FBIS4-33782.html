			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary on the "National Radio News" program] </F>   [Text] A brief analysis on the 24th General Assembly of the  OAS, just hours after its conclusion, is inescapable at this  time. For five days, foreign ministers from 34 countries of this  hemisphere gathered at the Amazon city of Belem do Para to  discuss two issues that centered the debates: finding a peaceful  solution to the Haitian crisis and creating a common market for  free trade in South America. Other issues that weighed on the  OAS foreign ministers' agenda were issues that range from  hemispheric security to the risks of collapse that democracies  of this region are faced with due to a social uprising which is  motivated by extreme poverty.    From the very beginning of the assembly, a topic which was  not included on the agenda occupied the attention of Joao Baena  Soares, outgoing secretary general of the OAS, and Brazilian  Pesident Itamar Franco. We are referring to the demand of Cuba's  reincorporation into the OAS. In that sense, the call by Baena  Soares and Franco was expressed to examine the possiblility of  Cuba's reintegration. Baena's exhortation immediately opened a  debate in which Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, and Venezuela  pronounced themselves in favor of finding a formula that would  put an end to Cuba's isolation in the OAS. But, once again, U.S.  arrogance was felt when it said there first had to be political  reforms on this island that would merit the approval of the U.S.  Government.    While this was taking place at the OAS General Assembly,  dozens of demonstrators gathered in front of the Teatro de la  Paz to demand the end of the U.S. economic blockade on Cuba.  The U.S. representation was unable to stop the insistent demand.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nedlloyd forecasts reverse into red NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, expects to post a loss for the year, reversing forecasts of a 'modest' profit. The company gave no figures but said the full-year net result would be considerably better than the Fl 117m (Dollars 65m) net loss posted in 1991 before the inclusion of book profits on divestments. Overall, Nedlloyd posted a net profit of Fl 145m in 1991, thanks to extensive book profits of Fl 263m. The company has already said that proceeds from divestments would be limited this year. After barely breaking even in the 1992 first half with a net profit of Fl 1m, Nedlloyd said its unpublished third-quarter results had been 'disappointing but positive'. Nedlloyd blamed the downturn on a further weakening of economic conditions in key markets since it issued its previous profit prediction in mid-August. The company forecast that its ocean-shipping sector, which recorded an operating profit of Fl 44m in 1991, would post a small operating loss for 1992. This was due to lower freight rates in its container logistics business.</p>

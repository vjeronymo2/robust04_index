			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (18): Giants line up for a battle royal - Power PC/Pentium Though it would be easy to consider the competition between Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processors and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processors as a straight fight for world supremacy between Intel's x86 family and the IBM/Motorola/Apple PowerPC, the situation is not quite that simple. There are other factors in the equation, such as what happens in the world of operating systems and workstations. But a battle royal does seem likely. For the first time in 12 years Intel's dominance of desktop and personal computing processors has been threatened. Its designs are tied to a pantechnicon of baggage from its past successes. Every new design has to make sure that applications written five or even 10 years ago can run in the new environment. RISC processors, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to run a set of instructions that have been optimised to meet the needs of desktop applications. As such, they are ready to take on the demands of new operating systems and new applications requirements like multimedia, communications and complex, rich document structures. They also have enough power to emulate the 'old world' of the PC, if those applications are needed in the newer environments, while leaving much of the baggage behind. Intel's response to RISC processors came a year ago with the launch of the Pentium, but the circuit is big, hot and offers only marginal performance improvements over the 486 processor. It's also still expensive, costing around Dollars 700 each in lots of 1,000. Although the Pentium is still in production, this year it has had a significant redesign which reduces the chip size by 45 per cent, reduces the voltage required from 5V to 3.3V, and reduces the design geometries from 0.8 micron to 0.6 micron. Most important of all, the clock speed goes up from 66MHz to 90MHz, with 100MHz available in limited quantities. Known as the P54C, this solves many of the problems with the earlier device, nearly doubling performance on industry-accepted benchmarks. It also reduces heat dissipation, making it much more amenable to use. The PowerPC, designed by IBM, Motorola and Apple, is by far the strongest rival Intel has had to face. The first processor, the PowerPC 601, has recently been upgraded from 66MHz to 100MHz and its performance is ahead of the P54C. Its price is down to Dollars 238 each in lots of 20,000. The alliance has a range of other processors in the family, including the 603 for low-end, low-power consumption applications and the 620 for high-end workstations. PowerPC is such a strong contender because it is the first RISC processor to be manufactured by a merchant-market semiconductor producer, Motorola. While Motorola makes only the component, all other RISC processors are manufactured as part of a larger business model - where they are an integral part of, and so funded by, the sale of complete workstations. Motorola's processor families, the 68xxx and 81xxx, have either been beaten in the market by Intel or other RISC processor suppliers. The company therefore has a strong vested interest in seeing PowerPC succeed and is prepared to use the tighter margins and aggressive marketing common in the semiconductor industry. The workstation market itself is changing. Workstations are usually powerful, expensive, specialist systems, but the arrival of Pentium means that a typical PC can now provide similar performance at far more aggressive price points. Perhaps the most important question, however, is in software. Intel and PowerPC can, or will be able to, run the leading operating systems for the forseeable future, such as Microsoft's WindowsNT, Unix (especially the unified X/Open variety), OS/2 and the WorkPlace OS coming later this year. PowerPC's advantage in the field of software is that it can also run Apple Macintosh applications. Though often sidelined as a niche product, the Macintosh accounts for about 15 per cent of the desktop market and has a number of applications, especially in areas such as multimedia, crying out for higher performance hardware. Intel is unlikely to take this threat lying down. It has the resources to be aggressive in the market and is bound to respond. But as Compaq Computer's announcement in February - that it is seriously considering using PowerPC - demonstrates, for the first time Intel has a real fight on its hands.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Calculating base value for shares MY WIFE has shares acquired in two main blocks. Her parents gave her some as part of a settlement on in March 1976. She inherited some more shares when her mother died in February 1988. (The shares were actually received several months later when probate was granted.) Is it correct to assume for Capital Gains Tax purposes, that both sets of shares have a base value which is their value on 31/3/82? (My wife made an election under 596(5) of the Finance Act 1988 on 24/2/91) Where can I find the values at 31/3/82 of the shares? (or the values at other relevant dates?) Your wife's original shareholding is indeed deemed to have been acquired on March 31, 1982 at its market value on that day (on the quarter-up basis). On the other hand, the shares which she inherited are deemed to have been acquired on the day of her mother's death at their probate value (on the quarter-up basis). Any sale will be deemed to come primarily out of the later holding (which will be pooled with any further purchases etc.) If her mother's shares were valued for inheritance tax purposes, then that value should appear in the statements sent to her by the solicitors at the time when the residue of the estate was distributed. In a local reference library, you may find the books of adjusted March 31 1982 prices published by Extel Financial or Stubbs (Dun &amp; Bradstreet), or the Stock Exchange Daily Official List. Alternatively you can ask your tax office, although they may take a long time to supply the figures. In any case, you should ask the tax office for some or all of the following free pamphlets: CGT13 - The indexation allowance for quoted shares; CGT14 - Capital gains tax: an introduction; CGT15 - Capital gains tax: a guide for married couples; CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Between the lines of the Lamont Budget Excise duty Clause 1 (1) increases the excise duty on spirits; (2) increases the excise duty on beer; (3) and Schedule 1 increases the excise duty on wine and made-wine; (4) increases the excise duty on cider. Clause 2 increases the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars, hand rolling tobacco and other smoking and chewing tobacco. Clause 3 (1) increases the rate of excise duty on petrol and derv; (2) increases the excise duty on fuel oil and gas oil by amending the rebate payable; (3) increases the excise duty on unleaded petrol by amending the rebate payable; (4) increases the rate of excise duty on furnace oil by amending the rebate payable. Clause 4 Introduces a single rate of vehicle excise duty (Pounds 50) for tricycles, increases the rate of VED by up to Pounds 10 for 900,000 motor cycles, by Pounds 14 for 385,000 special machines and by Pounds 25 for 20,000 recovery vehicles. The changes affect licences taken out after March 19 1991. Clause 5 (1) reduces the half-yearly fixed licence fee of gaming establishments to Pounds 10; (2) amends the payment arrangements for gaming licence duty payable by casinos, and; (3) increases the new gross gaming yield thresholds for calculating the main charge to gaming licence duty. Clause 6 Schedule 2 introduces a new system for charging duty on beer based on the alcoholic strength of the finished product. Clause 7 exempts all mine rescue vehicles from VED from March 20 1991. Exempts pedestrian-controlled mowing machines from licensing and registration. Removes exemption from licensing for non-operational fire engines from June 1 1991. Removes redundant exemption from licensing for civil defence vehicles with effect from October 1991. Clause 8 provides the transport secretary with powers to make refunds of VED to vehicles over 3,500 kg travelling by train between member states in combined transport operations. Clause 9 and Schedule 3 Parts I and II repeals the Vehicle (Excise) Act 1972 (Northern Ireland) and extends the Vehicle (Excise) Act 1971 to encompass Northern Ireland. Consolidated act to come into force on a day to be appointed by the secretary of state by order made by statutory instrument. Clause 10 and Schedule 4 introduce a new type of trader, to be known as a registered excise dealer and shipper (Reds), who may import and pay excise duty on goods from another EC member state without having to submit customs entries for clearance of the goods. This measure will be introduced from royal assent to the Finance Bill although registration as a Reds will not commence until 1992 in preparation for the completion of the single market in 1993. VAT inspection Clause 11 and Schedule 5 extend to excise duties the powers officers already have to inspect commercial records for VAT purposes, in preparation for the completion of the single market in 1993. Clause 12 Increases the rate of value added tax to 17.5 per cent with effect from April 1 1991. Clause 13 states that input tax may continue to be reclaimed by a business where the supply of goods and services, specificed by Treasury order, is provided direct to an employee for use in the course of that business. This is already current practice, where road fuel is paid for by a mileage allowance, but will by placed on a statutory basis by means of a Treasury Order to be laid after royal assent. Clause 14 reduces the waiting period for recovering value added tax on bad debts from two years to one. This amendment will be deemed always to have had effect. Clause 15 extends the Value Added Tax Act 1983 to permit overseas companies, established in the UK, to be a member of a value added tax group without the requirement for a resident director in the UK. Clause 16 introduces a statutory right for taxpayers to receive interest in cases where an error on the part of Customs &amp; Excise has resulted in loss of funds to them. Clause 17 introduces a reduction in the rate of the Serious Misdeclaration Penalty from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Clause 18 extends the relief from car tax for cars supplied for leasing to the disabled for at least three years, to leases which end within this period - when the lessor is a charity. This will become operative from royal assent. Clause 19 Proposes to allow relief from car tax on cars used by registered car tax traders for research and development purposes only. This puts on to a statutory basis a long-standing concession. Clause 20 provides for unchanged basic and higher rates of income tax (at 25 and 40 per cent respectively) and for the basic rate limit to be set at Pounds 23,700 for 1991-92. Clause 21 provides for the married couple's allowance to remain unchanged (at Pounds 1,720) for 1991-92. Clause 22 reduces the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1990 from 35 per cent to 34 per cent. It also sets the fraction used for calculating marginal relief at nine four-hundredths (equivalent to a marginal rate for marginal relief of 36.25 per cent). Clause 23 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1991 at 33 per cent. Clause 24 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1991 at 25 per cent and sets the fraction used for calculating marginal relief at one-fiftieth (equivalent to a marginal rate for marginal relief of 35 per cent). It also increases the ceiling for the small companies' rate from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 250,000 and the ceiling for marginal relief from Pounds 1,000,000 to Pounds 1,250,000. Clause 25 sets the limit for mortgage interest relief (and relief for home annuity loans for the elderly) for 1991-92 at Pounds 30,000 (unchanged). Mortgage tax relief Clause 26 restricts tax relief on mortgage interest payments made on or after April 6 1991 to the basic rate of income tax both for loans not in Miras and for loans in Miras. Schedule 6 makes changes to the rules for taxing the benefit arising from beneficial loans made to employees by virtue of their employment. The main changes are consequential to the removal of higher rate relief for mortgage interest payments (Clause 26). The schedule also corrects technical defects in the calculation of cash equivalents of beneficial loans for employees who have both loans on which the interest qualifies for tax relief and other loans at different rates of interest. Clause 27 removes the requirement that to be eligible for mortgage tax relief a caravan should either be: (i) 'large' (more than 22ft long or more than 7ft 6in wide), or (ii) a 'rateable hereditament'. Clause 28 sets the car benefit scale charges for 1991-92. These are 20 per cent higher than the scale charges for 1990-91. Clause 29 provides for an income tax charge on a standard amount of Pounds 200 from April 6 1991 on the benefit derived by employees from the private use of each mobile telephone provided by employers. There will be no charge if there is no private use by the employee or if the employee is required to, and does, make good the whole cost of any private use. Clause 30 increases from Pounds 200 to Pounds 300 the de minimis limit for taxing benefits arising on loans made to employees by virtue of their employment. Clause 31 introduces the new tax relief for vocational training which will apply from 6 April 1992. Clause 32 empowers the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations for the administration of the tax relief for vocational training provided by Clause 31. Pension schemes Clause 33 amends the conditions for mandatory approval of occupational pension schemes by adjusting the allowable retirement ages; and by removing an inconsistency between tax and social security requirements. Clause 34 extends, to existing approved occupational pension schemes, the effect of any regulations made after April 17 1991 which restrict the conditions on which discretionary tax approval may be granted. Clause 35 clarifies the present provisions dealing with withdrawal of tax approval from, and alterations to, occupational pension schemes. The clause is deemed always to have had effect. Clause 36 doubles (subject to unchanged limits) the rate of tax after April 1 1991 in establishing employee share ownership plan (Esop) trusts which satisfy the qualifying conditions laid down in the Taxes Acts. Clause 37 permits options under a discretionary employee share option scheme approved by the Inland Revenue to be granted at a discount of up to 15 per cent of the market value of the shares. The measure takes effect from January 1992. Clause 38 increases, from a date to be fixed by Treasury order, the limit on the size of share options which may be granted to individual participants in an approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme. The limit, expressed in terms of monthly savings, is increased from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250. Clause 39 increases the limit on annual appropriations of free shares to individual participants in an approved all-employee profit-sharing scheme. The limit is increased to the greater of Pounds 3,000 or 10 per cent of salary (subject to a ceiling of Pounds 8,000). Clause 40 provides a tax relief for the costs which companies incur on or after April 1 1991 in setting up employee share schemes approved by the Inland Revenue. Clause 41 provides a tax relief for the costs which companies incur in establishing employee share ownership plan (Esop) trusts which satisfy the qualifying conditions laid down in the Taxes Acts. Clause 42 extends the income tax exemption for directors and employees who benefit from being given priority rights in a public offer of shares. From January 16 1991, the exemption is extended to cover circumstances in which the public offer comprises a package of shares in two or more companies. The clause also extends from the same date the existing exemption for 'special benefits', such as bonus shares, in respect of shares acquired under such a public offer but outside an approved employee share scheme. Clause 43 increases, from April 6 1991, the limits on the availability of tax relief for the foreign earnings of seafarers who work abroad for a qualifying period of 365 days. Clause 44 extends the tax relief for foreign earnings so that employees in Kuwait and Iraq forced to return to the UK early because of the Gulf crisis, or unable to return to those countries because of it, qualify for relief from UK tax on their foreign earnings up to the date of their return to the UK. Clause 45 extends the relief insurance companies get for levies imposed under investor protection schemes. Payments made already under statutory schemes qualify for relief. Provision is made to extend relief, by regulations, to non-statutory schemes. Clause 46 and Schedule 7 bring forward insurance companies' entitlement to repayment of tax on exempt pension business income. They will be able to claim back the tax in the year in which the income is received rather than having to wait until their overall tax liability is agreed. The change will be phased in from a date, to be specified in regulations, linked to the introduction of Pay and File planned for 1993. Clause 47 and Schedule 8 raise from Pounds 150 to Pounds 200 the annual premium limit for tax-exempt policies issued by friendly societies. Clause 48 and Schedule 9 change the tax rules for existing building society shares to deal with a new form of share: permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs). They exempt sterling-denominated Pibs from tax on capital gains; bring Pibs into the accrued income scheme; give relief for the incidental costs of issuing Pibs; and prevent capital gains arising where Pibs are issued to existing building society members on preferential terms. Clause 49 and Schedule 10 ensure that interest on building societies' Pibs will be paid after deduction of income tax at the basic rate, and that building societies will not get relief for any interest on Pibs that exceeds normal commercial interest. Clause 50 provides that interest and dividends paid by building societies to investors during transitional periods leading up to the 1986 change in the system of accounting for composite rate tax may be charged to tax at rates in force for 1985-86. Clause 51 and Schedule 11 make technical changes to the accrued income scheme and the deep discount and deep gain legislation to deal with the issue of securities in tranches. Accrued interest included in the issue price of securities will qualify for relief under the accrued income scheme. Tax relief for the interest paid by the issuer will be restricted to the amount taxable in the hands of the subscriber. The definition of 'issue price' for determining deep discount/deep gain securities will exclude any accrued interest. The changes apply to securities issued on or after March 19 1991. Clause 52 relaxes the anti-bondwashing rules, so that the six-month period during which a charge can arise when securities such as shares are bought or sold using options will generally be reduced to one month. Overseas securities Clause 53 (and associated regulations to be made later in the year) change the rules governing the lending of overseas securities. They will enable a lending chain of more than three parties without a tax charge arising on the resulting disposals. Clause 54 and Schedule 12 provide for arrangements to govern the accounting for tax on manufactured dividends and interest paid as compensation for non-receipt of the real dividends or interest (for example, by a borrower to a lender of securities). Broadly, manufactured dividends and interest will be treated in the same way as their real counterparts. Clause 55 and Schedule 13 adapt the capital allowances system to take account of retrospective adjustments made, under the VAT Capital Goods Scheme, to the amount of VAT payable on certain capital assets. Clause 56 extends capital allowances to expenditure on the construction of toll roads. Relief will be given through the industrial buildings code of allowances at 4 per cent per annum. Clause 57 provides corporation tax relief to an oilfield participator for expenditure incurred on or after March 19 1991 in obtaining an abandonment guarantee (defined in Clause 90). In the event of a guarantee being called it also denies relief to any participator in the field for expenditure met out of the payment by the guarantor. Clause 58 restores corporation tax relief where a defaulting oil field participator reimburses a guarantor who has been called upon to meet the participator's liability to contribute to oil field abandonment costs. Clause 59 provides corporation tax relief to an oil field participator for any expenditure which it is obliged to meet after June 30 1991 on behalf of a defaulting co-participator which has failed to meet its own share of the cost of abandoning the field. Clause 60 restores corporation tax relief where a defaulting oilfield participator reimburses a co-participator which has been required to meet the defaulter's share of field abandonment expenditure. It also provides for the reimbursement to be treated as ring fence income for corporation tax purposes in the hands of the non-defaulter. Clause 61 makes a minor technical correction to the rules dealing with the interaction between capital gains and capital allowances for oil licences relating to undeveloped areas. It restores a cross-reference to scientific research allowances which was omitted from the 1990 Capital Allowances Consolidation Act. Clause 62 paves the way for regulations, to be made in the autumn, enabling investors to have both a single company Pep and a general Pep in the same year. Clause 63 removes the upper limits on single charitable donations by individuals or companies which qualify for income tax or corporation tax relief. The change applies to donations made on or after March 19 1991. Clause 64 enables proprietors of unincorporated businesses to set their trading losses against their capital gains, for the year in which the loss is made or the following year. Clause 65 increases the limits for tax exemption enjoyed by trade unions and employers' associations which pay provident benefits. The limit for gross sums increases from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,000 and the limit for annuities increases from Pounds 625 to Pounds 825. Clause 66 amends the definition of a normal commercial loan for certain tax purposes. It deals with loans where the rate of interest reduces when the results of the debtor company's business improve or the value of its assets increase. It also deals with limited recourse loans based on land not used for dealing. Clause 67 updates one of the rules that remove tax obstacles to the conversion of a building society to a plc, to take account of the abolition of composite rate tax. Clause 68 amends Schedule 11 of the Electricity Act 1989 to ensure that all interest paid on debentures issued under that act is tax-deductible. Clause 69 widens the terms of the present exemption of UK investment managers acting on behalf of non-resident clients. False declaration Clause 70 introduces a penalty where someone makes a false declaration in order to receive deposit interest without deduction of income tax, or deliberately fails to inform the building society, bank etc, that he or she has become liable to income tax. Clauses 71 to 80 make a number of changes to the taxation of non-resident trusts, including imposition of a charge to capital gains tax when a settlement ceases to be resident in the UK on or after 19 March 1991. Clause 81 changes from one acre to half a hectare the maximum amount of land which can normally qualify for capital gains tax private residence relief. Clause 82 provides that the last three years (previously the last two years) that an individual owns a property which has at any time been his or her home will automatically continue to qualify for relief from capital gains tax. The Treasury will have the power to change the period back from three to two years and vice versa in future. The clause also increases the maximum special exemption available to individuals who let part or all of their home from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 40,000. Clause 83 confirms that the capital gains legislation governing transactions between the Housing Corporation and housing associations should apply equally to Housing for Wales. Clause 84 makes a correction to the rules allowing capital gains on foreign assets to be deferred where they cannot be remitted to the United Kingdom. It makes it clear that the relief is available where the unremittability arises in the country where the assets are situated. Clause 85 makes minor changes to the capital gains tax rules which exempt Qualifying Corporate Bonds so that bonds convertible into other corporate bonds are exempt and bonds convertible into shares or securities of the issuing company's quoted parent are not exempt. Clause 86 provides that shares acquired between April 6 1982 and April 5 1983 under the Business Start-up Scheme are no longer to be pooled with other shares for capital gains tax purposes. Clause 87 reduces the qualifying age for capital gains tax retirement relief from 60 to 55; and increases the exemption ceilings so that all of the first Pounds 150,000 (previously Pounds 125,000) and half of the next Pounds 450,000 (previously Pounds 375,000) of gains are exempt from capital gains tax. The changes apply to disposals made on or after March 19 1991. Clause 88 corrects minor defects in the capital gains tax rebasing rules. Clause 89 replaces the existing definition of oilfield abandonment costs allowable for petroleum revenue tax (PRT) purposes with a broader definition (also covering relevant land and seabed restoration costs) for expenditure incurred after June 30 1991. A rule is provided for apportioning costs between oilfields where appropriate; and PRT relief is made available to oilfield participators for expenditure incurred on or after March 19 1991 in obtaining an abandonment guarantee (defined in Clause 90). Clause 90 defines an 'abandonment guarantee' for the purpose of Clauses 57, 58, 89, 91 and 92. For relief purposes an abandonment guarantee is a guarantee obtained by an oilfield participator from an unconnected third party to cover the participator's share of the costs of abandoning the field. Clause 91 precludes PRT relief for oilfield expenditure met out of a payment by a guarantor under the terms of an abandonment guarantee taken out by a field participator.) Clause 92 restores PRT relief where a defaulting oil field participator reimburses a guarantor who has been called upon to meet the participator's liability to contribute to oil field abandonment costs. Clause 93 provides PRT relief to an oil field participator for any expenditure which it is required to meet after June 30 1991 on behalf of a defaulting co-participator which has failed to meet its own share of the cost of abandoning the field. Clause 94 restores PRT relief where a defaulting oilfield participator reimburses a co-participator which has been required to meet the defaulter's share of field abandonment expenditure. It also provides for the reimbursement to be treated as a PRT chargeable receipt in the hands of the non-defaulter. PRT penalties Clause 95 removes doubts over the law on enforcing PRT penalties. Clause 96: Amendment of Government Trading Act 1990. The purpose of clause is to correct a technical defect in the way the order-making powers work in relation to establishing the values of assets and liabilities under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973 as amended by the Government Trading Act 1990. Clause 97: National Savings - repayments to customers. This clause validates certain payments to National Savings customers. National Savings has followed a long-standing practice of dating repayment warrants for the expected date of receipt, which has also been the date used for valuing the amounts to be repaid, and for other rights such as participation in Premium Bond prize draws. National Savings received legal advice last year that some of their regulations required repayments to be valued for the day on which they were posted. The necessary amending regulations to validate National Savings' practice came into force on February 11 1991. Finance Bill provision is necessary to cover the period before that date.

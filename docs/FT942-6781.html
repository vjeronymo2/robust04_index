			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Labour shifts poll focus to social chapter Labour claimed yesterday that its twin agenda of 'jobs and social justice' would provide better living standards for working people, as the focus of its European election campaign moved to the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, outlined his party's 'positive approach' to the social chapter, arguing that it would guarantee Britons 'the basic rights and standards enjoyed by every other worker in Europe'. As the first week of the Euro-election campaign drew to a close, Mr Prescott interwove his call for social justice with another powerful attack on the government's economic policy. He accused the Conservatives of resurrecting 'the five great evils' outlined by Sir William Beveridge, the pioneer of the welfare state, 50 years ago - idleness, want, disease, squalor and ignorance. However, in spite of calling again for full employment and a minimum wage, the shadow employment secretary was careful not to be drawn too closely on how these goals would be implemented. He said the exact formula by which Labour would calculate a minimum wage was 'under constant review'. On the issue of full employment, he said that the first aim of a Labour government would be to reduce the jobless total. Labour's approach to the social chapter is similar to that outlined by the Liberal Democrats earlier this week, in which they argued that the government's lone refusal to sign was losing the UK money that would otherwise have been available for training. Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, has said that the social chapter makes it 'absolutely clear that there are hundreds of millions of pounds available specifically for the relief of unemployment and for training'. Mr Carlisle said last week that these funds could be 'targeted on areas of most need.' He said Britain was contributing to the social chapter in any case and the government was being 'incredibly cussed'. Yesterday, Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, widened the scope of that attack. He said funds intended to help the unemployed were being blocked because of an unresolved policy dispute between Britain and the European Commission. Mr Beith said the government's insistence that regional structural funds be concentrated on helping unemployed people was at the heart of the controversy. The European Commission maintained that priority should be accorded to plans for training people already in jobs. He called on the government to 'sort this mess out'.</p>

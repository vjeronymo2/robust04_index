			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with its ongoing process of guideline review, the Commission welcomes comment on any aspect of the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary. Specifically, the Commission solicits comment on which, if any, of the amendments submitted to the Congress that may result in a lower guideline range should be made retroactive to previously sentenced defendants under Policy Statement 1B1.10. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  28 U.S.C. 994(a), (o), (p); sec. 7109 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub.

L. 100&hyph;690, Nov. 18, 1988, the United States Sentencing Commission reports to the Congress the following amendments to the sentencing guidelines, and the reasons therefor. As authorized by this section, the Commission specifies an effective date of November 1, 1994, for these amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Policy Statements, and Official Commentary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Amendment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commentary to &sect;1B1.3 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following additional paragraph as the eighth paragraph:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``A defendant's relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant's offense level). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant's culpability; in such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commentary to &sect;1B1.3 captioned ``Application Notes'' is amended in Note 9(B) by deleting ``and the time interval between offenses'' and inserting in lieu thereof:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ``, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity.''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reason for Amendment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment clarifies the operation of &sect;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) with respect to the defendant's accountability for the actions of other conspirators prior to the defendant's joining the conspiracy. The amendment is in accord with the rule stated in recent caselaw. See, e.g., United States v. Carreon, 11 F.3d 1225 (5th Cir. 1994); United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir. 1992). Cf. United States v. Miranda-Ortiz, 926 F.2d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Edwards, 945 F.2d 1387, 1393 (7th Cir. 1991)) (applying earlier versions of &sect;1B1.3). By expressly addressing this issue, this amendment will ensure consistency in guideline interpretation. In addition, this amendment adds a well-phrased formulation developed by the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Hahn, 960 F.2d 903 (9th Cir. 1992), to the commentary addressing the circumstances in which multiple acts constitute the ``same course of conduct.''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2.

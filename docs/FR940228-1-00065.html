			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;This NPRM proposes, in &sect;668.16 (currently &sect;&sect;668.14 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 668.15) to strengthen and expand the standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability for participating institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing areas previously not regulated or for which there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were only guidelines, such as: The maximum time frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed in the standards for satisfactory academic progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for completion of a student's educational program and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion of standards to include those general areas that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be reviewed by State postsecondary review entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SPREs). The SPRE review areas are included because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas may have a significant bearing on an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability and thus should be considered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary reviews the administrative capability of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the NPRM does solicit comments on whether these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional proposed standards should be implemented across  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the board or be made applicable only to institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g., institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with short-term programs and institutions with a history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative problems. For example, this section of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM includes the proposed requirement that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that offers a vocational program of less than two years in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length that prepares students to enter recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupations must demonstrate that the borrower's increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual expected earnings, based on completion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, will exceed the annual amount of Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program assistance received for the programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The provisions in proposed &sect;668.17 (currently &sect;668.15)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing default reduction measures reflect statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes made by the Amendments of 1992 and current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> departmental practices. The provisions in the Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1993 that address institutional appeals of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cohort default rates are not included in this NPRM and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be addressed separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;As mandated by statute, all participating institutions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to implement a fair and equitable refund policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This statutory provision is similar to the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair and equitable refunds prescribed by the FFEL program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations for institutions that participate in the FFEL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. Section 668.22 proposes to clarify the terms used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy. The NPRM also proposes to mandate a refund policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix A) that an institution must use to calculate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's refund if the student is not entitled to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> refund and an institution's State and accrediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency do not have specific refund standards. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of a new statutory provision that specifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order of return of refunds to the Title IV, HEA programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other sources of aid without regard to the amount of aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received from State or private sources, this NPRM proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remove the fraction that is currently used to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the portion of the refund attributable to the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and that attributable to other sources of aid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In accordance with the statute, institutions will now be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to have compliance audits every year rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every two years, as required by current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.23 proposes to allow institutions that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose a great financial risk to the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., institutions that received less than $100,000 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total annual funding under the Title IV, HEA programs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not had deficiencies identified in their most recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted audit reports) to submit audits biennially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, under this proposal, an institution would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to submit a compliance audit for any year in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total Title IV, HEA program funds it received were less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $25,000. This section also proposes to extend audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements to foreign institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM also contains a proposed change to the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pell Grant Program regulations. This NPRM proposes to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 487(c)(7) of the HEA that provides that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may offset the amount of Title IV, HEA program disbursements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against liabilities or may receive reimbursement from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department for those amounts if, in the course of any audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted after December 31, 1988, the Department discovers or is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed of any Title IV, HEA program assistance (specifically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that an institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to its students in accordance with program requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the institution has not previously received credit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement for these disbursements. Although this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relates directly to the Federal Pell Grant Program and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be included in the Federal Pell Grant Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, it is contained in Part G of the HEA and is subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the negotiated rulemaking process explained below. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has been included in this NPRM instead of the Federal Pell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant Program NPRM, which was not subject to the negotiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / People: Strutt returns to Hong Kong Henry Strutt, 40, head of Robert Fleming's Far East broking operations, has been appointed managing director of Jardine Fleming, the jointly-owned Hong Kong merchant bank which regularly provides around a third of Flemings' total profits. Strutt is no stranger to Hong Kong. He worked for Jardine Fleming from 1980 to 1992 and was in charge of Jardine Fleming's Tokyo business before returning to London. He takes over in July from Alan Smith, 50, who has been managing director for more than a decade. Jardine Fleming, set up in 1970 with a capital of Pounds 250,000, is jointly owned by Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming. It is Hong Kong's oldest merchant bank, operates in 15 countries in the Pacific basin, and employs 2,200 people, or nearly as many as Robert Fleming's total UK staff. In 1992 it reported after-tax profits of Dollars 76m and in the first six months of 1993 earned Dollars 77m. Robert Fleming's Peter Jamieson, the first managing director of Jardine Fleming, was an old university chum of Henry Keswick, the chairman of Jardine Matheson, who also sits on the Robert Fleming board. Since then Jardine Matheson has tended to supply the joint venture's non-executive chairman and Robert Fleming has often provided the managing director. John Manser, Fleming's current chief executive, headed Jardine Fleming in the late 1970s. However, Alan Smith, 50, a British solicitor who joined Jardine Fleming in 1972, has spent the bulk of his career with the Hong Kong merchant bank and his promotion to executive chairman suggests that the joint venture is starting to have a life of its own. Traditionally, the Taipan of Jardine Matheson's Hong Kong operations has been chairman of Jardine Fleming. Smith takes over as chairman next month from Nigel Rich, the current Taipan, who is moving to London to be chief executive of Trafalgar House.</p>

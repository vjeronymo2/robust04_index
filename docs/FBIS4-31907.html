			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bratislava 14 June (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  "The cabinet of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar was not defeated by  poor economic results but by the power-thirst of politicians  from the ranks of the former government coalition," the daily  SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, published by Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), writes. However, political entities  which have emerged as a result of the breakup of the two former  government coalition parties -- the HZDS and the Slovak National  Party (SNS) -- are built on an "unsure footing" and have no  voter base, the paper adds.    The Democratic Union (DU), which emerged from the HZDS, as  well as the National Democratic Party (NDS), established by  members of the anti-Meciar wing within the SNS who later  withdrew from the party, "had nothing but to join the government  in March and begin to carry out their pre-election campaign for  state money," the paper says.    "The ministers rushed after voters and in order that their  paths are not too obvious they came up with the government  programme," the author says.    Politicians from the other parties and movements who only a  year ago spoke about turncoats with disrespect, now willingly  offer them cooperation. However, the first ones are maneouvring  in search of the most advantageous positions for themselves,  their declared programme notwithstanding, the paper says.    While as recently as a year ago Democratic Party Chairman  Pavol Hagyari criticised NDS Chairman Ludovit Cernak for turning  quite of a sudden from a nationalist to a conservative (Cernak  was dismissed as SNS chairman and expelled from the party at its  February congress for holding a moderate position) today Hagyari  readily offers Cernak a coalition, the paper says.    However, Cernak, who does not believe in miracles, has  instead grabbed the more stable slate of the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH). Only elections will show whether his  move was correct. The latest public opinion polls show that Jan  Carnogursky's KDH does not enjoy the support of even five  percent of voters, the author asserts.    If someone thinks that there is a rush on the Slovak  pre-election political scene then it is only appearance. The  leaders of some parties simply want to wake up only after the  elections, the paper concludes.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY  </P> <P> Oh, the joy of feasting once again on a magazine of short stories ("Tales for a  Summer Day," July 1).  </P> <P> When I was growing up, such magazines as Liberty, Collier's and Saturday  Evening Post were eagerly awaited and their short stories devoured upon  arrival.  </P> <P> Then such magazines disappeared, forever, we thought. Then Los Angeles Times  Magazine brings back the days of my girlhood, and with such beautiful stories.  None of that esoteric stuff I can hardly comprehend, but human stories about  real people.  </P> <P> Keep it up! Maybe the young people will come back to the pleasures of reading  instead of their robotic TV watching.  </P> <P> ROBERTA DIAMOND  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has called on Russia to adhere to the agreed August  deadline for withdrawing its troops from the Baltic states.  This was an important confidence-building measure for the  region and for security throughout Europe, Kinkel said on  Wednesday [9 March] at a joint news conference with his  counterparts from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in Bonn.  Germany did not want to take on an "official role as  intermediary" between Russia and the Baltics, but it did want to  "help mediate." At the same time, Kinkel reaffirmed German  support for the efforts of the Baltic states to be accepted  gradually into the European Union [EU] and the Atlantic defense  alliance.    Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys expressed the  expectation that the negotiations on association with the EU  would begin in the second half of 1994 and be concluded at the  beginning of next year. On the situation of the Russian  minority in the Baltic states, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri  Luik said that even foreign organizations had found no evidence  of human rights violations. Problems arose mainly on practical  issues concerning the integration of Russian citizens.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Judge Drops Unocal Lawsuit: A federal judge granted a request by Mesa Limited  Partnership to drop a lawsuit by Unocal Corp. stemming from Mesa's unsuccessful  attempt to take over Unocal in 1985. Unocal had sought profits, estimated at as  much as $181 million, resulting from Mesa's disposal of 6.7 million shares of  Unocal stock that Mesa exchanged for Unocal debt securities in May, 1985, to  settle the takeover dispute. A Unocal spokesman said no decision had been made  whether to appeal the ruling.  </P></p>

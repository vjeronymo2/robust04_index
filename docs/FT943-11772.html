The company, which distributes anti-theft devices for cars, saw sales cut from Pounds 2.97m to Pounds 2.3m after supplies from Italy were disrupted. Mr Paul Layzell, chairman, said he did not anticipate further difficulties now the Italian group had completed its factory move and new product launch. Earnings per share dropped from 1.59p to 1.08p. An interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is declared.</p>

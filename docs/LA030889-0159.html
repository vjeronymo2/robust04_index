			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCHNEIDER TIES RECORD WITH GIANT SLALOM  </P> <P> Swiss superstar Vreni Schneider tied a World Cup record with her 13th victory  of the season when she won a women's giant slalom ski race today.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," Schneider said after beating Yugoslavia's Mateja Svet  by .77 seconds for her sixth victory in seven giant slaloms this season.  </P> <P> The 13 victories equals the mark established by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark, who  won 10 giant slaloms and three slaloms in 1979. One of Schneider's victories  was in a combined event, in which the result of a downhill and a slalom were  factored together to form a third, or combined, result.  </P> <P> Schneider, winner of the women's overall, giant slalom and slalom titles  already, had previously broken the women's record of 11 victories, set in 1973  by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell.  </P> <P> Heading into the final women's race of the season, a slalom on Saturday,  Schneider, 24, has the opportunity to win an unprecedented 14th event and 13th  race. A win also would give Schneider a sweep of the season's seven slaloms,  making her only the fourth skier to complete an unbeaten season in an Alpine  discipline.  </P> <P> Jean-Claude Killy of France swept the five downhills contested in 1967,  Moser-Proell won the eight women's downhills in 1973 and Stenmark won all 10  giant slaloms in 1979.  </P> <P> Schneider completed two runs over the 50-gate, 4,089-foot Mt. Nishidate course  in 2 minutes, 22.57 seconds. Svet, who finished second in the season giant  slalom standings, was timed in 2:23.34.  </P> <P> Christine Meier of West Germany was third in 2:23.89.  </P> <P> Maria Walliser of Switzerland, a distant second behind her teammate in the  overall standings, was fourth in 2:24.27.  </P></p>

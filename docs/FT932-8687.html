			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Removing the risk from high-tech - In A Nutshell Companies which want to adopt innovative but risky new processes and high-technology companies which have developed new techniques but are encountering resistance from prospective clients may benefit from a new European Commission programme. Under the Technology Performance Financing scheme (part of the Sprint programme) the commission underwrites up to 50 per cent of the risk attached to bank funding for a project (up to a maximum of Ecu 75,000, or Pounds 58,000 per project). Companies borrowing funds make performance-related repayments. They must apply to one of the participating banks, which will provide about 80 per cent of the funds needed, typically Ecu40,000 to Ecu200,000. Banks in the scheme include National Westminster, Allied Irish, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Generale de Banque and Finlombarda.</p>

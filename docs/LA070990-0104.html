			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BOY, 15, ARRESTED IN STANTON IN CONNECTION WITH GANG KILLING  </P> <P> In a dawn raid on a Stanton gang stronghold, police arrested a 15-year-old boy  on suspicion of murdering Rosendo Ibarra, a 17-year-old shot in the head while  talking to his girlfriend on the telephone.  </P> <P> Two other suspects in the April murder, including the man police believe pulled  the trigger, were not at home.  </P> <P> Garden Grove police were still searching for them early this afternoon.  </P> <P> Police believe the 15-year-old, whose name was not released because of his age,  helped plan Ibarra's murder.  </P> <P> "He took part in the conspiracy, and we believe he went with the fellows that  did it and walked right up with the shooter," said Detective Mike Handfield of  the Garden Grove Police.  </P> <P> The killing was believed to be the latest spasm in a decades-old dispute  between residents of the Rose Street neighborhood in Stanton and the La Colonia  neighborhood in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Ibarra, a construction worker who lived in La Colonia, was gunned down at a pay  phone in a Garden Grove shopping center across the street from his home.  </P></p>

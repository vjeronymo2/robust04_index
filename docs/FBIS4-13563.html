			<p>BFN     [Text] Knesset Members [MK's] Darawshah and al-Sani' of  the Arab Democratic Party have asked Prime Minister Rabin to  remove the closure on the territories. At a meeting with the  premier this morning they said that the measure was making life  very difficult for Arab residents and had increased their  bitterness. The two MK's also reported on their recent visit to  Damascus. Prime Minister Rabin said he was optimistic about the  chances of promoting negotiations with Syria, and in this regard  was awaiting the visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher at the end of the month.</p>

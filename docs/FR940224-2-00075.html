			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix C_Issued Associated With Expanded Fedwire Operating Hours <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This appendix analyzes issues associated with expanded Fedwire funds and securities transfer operating hours. The appendix is organized in three parts. First, settlement practices in financial markets are analyzed, with particular attention to Herstatt risk. Second, the operation of the Fedwire securities transfer delivery-versus-payment service is analyzed. Finally, other implementation issues associated with expanded Fedwire hours are analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement Practices in Financial Markets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion of settlement practices and risks in financial markets takes into account (1) the integrity of settlement during times of financial stress, (2) multi-currency, cross-border settlements, (3) domestic corporate and interbank markets and the needs of the futures markets, and (4) the current availability of bank payment services on a 24-hour basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Settlement during times of financial stress. Concerns regarding the ability of counterparties to meet their payment obligations and the certainty of settlement are heightened during times of financial stress. Sudden events that disrupt markets can increase the risk associated with domestic and, in particular, multi-currency transactions, and can contribute to uncertainty, payment delays, and market liquidity problems. If such problems are widespread, systemic risk may be increased substantially. It is during times of stress in the financial markets that the certainty associated with interbank settlement across the books of the central bank takes on added importance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, the Fedwire funds transfer service has been opened early on an ad hoc basis, at short notice, during times of stress in the financial markets at the request of market participants and regulatory authorities. For example, the Federal Reserve opened the Fedwire funds transfer service early on the days following the October 1987 stock market break and the beginning of the Gulf War. Experience has shown, however, that market participants are not prepared operationally to use facilities, such as Fedwire, when these facilities are made available during ``off-hours'' on an ad hoc basis at short notice. These difficulties suggest that to be most helpful during times of financial stress, Fedwire should be available in the early morning hours on a more routine basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multi-currency settlements. With respect to multi-currency settlements, the settlement of a foreign exchange contract involves the settlement of both currencies involved in the contract, such as the U.S. dollar and the Deutsche mark or the U.S. dollar and the yen. In such settlements, risk management and efficiency considerations must take into account payment arrangements in the country of issue for each currency, including the relative intraday timing of payments and the finality of payment in the respective currencies. Settlement risk is incurred by paying final funds in one currency before receiving final funds in another currency. As a general matter, the magnitude of settlement risk in the foreign exchange markets has grown substantially, in large part as a result of a vast expansion of foreign exchange trading. At the same time, there has been continued reliance on traditional methods of settling trades one currency at a time with significant delays before related payments and contra-payments become final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the large U.S. cities are in the western-most time zones of the major financial centers, under current settlement arrangements for multi-currency transactions, the U.S. dollar is normally the last currency to be settled. The two charts at the end of this appendix provide information on global time zone relationships and on the operating hours of selected large-value interbank transfer systems in different countries. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These charts were published in the report on Central Bank Payment and Settlement Services with Respect to Cross-Border and Multi-Currency Transactions, Basle, September 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On an exception basis today, banks may choose to require final payment of the U.S. dollar leg of a multi-currency transaction either in advance of, or in certain cases simultaneously with, final payment of the contra-currency, as a means to protect against risk of nonpayment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Foreign exchange market participants have indicated that such protective measures are taken, for example, in special cases where counterparties would exceed their U.S. dollar credit lines. Banks, however, find these exception procedures to be very expensive due to the lack of an established mechanism to effect settlements under these terms (that is, final U.S. dollar payment before, or simultaneously with, final payment in the other currency). For exception processing, the parties must negotiate how the related payments are to be made and closely monitor the settlement process to ensure that the payment sequence unfolds as expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In markets for exchange traded derivative instruments, some settlements are conducted currently using delivery-versus-payment techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Substantially earlier Fedwire funds transfer service operating hours as well as later payment system hours for other major currencies will increase the opportunity to achieve simultaneous or near-simultaneous settlements of individual deals involving the U.S. dollar and European and Asian currencies, where needed. Such settlements might involve a variety of new institutional designs for settlements, including private correspondent bank DVP services, new clearing organization procedures, or innovative arrangements that are not readily apparent given current payment system constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

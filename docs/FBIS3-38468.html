Kashmir figured prominently in the talks  between the prime minister and the German leaders in Bonn. Mr.  Narasimha Rao explained to them the problems faced by India  because of Pakistan's abetment of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir  and Punjab. [passage omitted]    Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German  minister for economic cooperation and development Mr.  Carl-Dieter Spranger, and reaffirmed India's commitment to  closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German  leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment  flow from Germany. He emphasized that the theme of the Asian  partnership choice and strategic partnership should be made a  reality [sentence as heard].    Our correspondent S. Sudarshanam adds from Bonn that India's  line of thinking is in tune with Germany's new Asia policy which  seeks to widen its cooperation with the Asian countries like  Japan, China, and India. The German minister told the prime  minister that he would lead a 20-member delegation to India soon  to explore further cooperation in trade, investment, and joint  venture in technical and technological fields. The signing of  aid protocol for this year will also come up during his visit.    Meanwhile, the new foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan,  told  newspersons at Bonn that the German leaders emphasized greater  cooperation in trade, science, and technology. He said Germany  is a major trading partner with India and two German ministers  in charge of economic development and foreign affairs are  planning to visit India before June this year.    The chairman of the German multinational corporation, Bayer,  held talks with the prime minister and indicated that Bayer is  to set up a pharmaceutical plant at Manali in Tamil Nadu. This  afternoon, the prime minister will have talks with the German  chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, on strengthening economic and trade  relations. Dr. Kohl will host a working lunch. Cooperation in  scientific, technical, and cultural fields and issues of mutual  interests are likely to figure in the talks.

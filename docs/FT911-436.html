			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / SIB wins Pounds 3.6m judgment in investment case THE Securities and Investments Board has obtained a Pounds 3.6m judgment against a man it alleged was the 'moving spirit' behind a scheme which resulted in UK investors losing Pounds 3m. The money had been put into Hamilton House Associates, a Birkenhead-based investment business. The High Court granted SIB an indefinite extension of an order freezing the assets of Mr Neil Bradshaw, who was said to have fled to the US. Mr Craig Orr, for SIB, told Mr Justice Mummery that the new order was needed to help SIB enforce the Pounds 3.6m judgment, which included interest on the lost funds. He said none of the money, which had been transferred to the US, had been repaid. Fimbra ordered Hamilton House Associates to stop trading in February last year. About 300 investors had invested in what were marketed as fully secured and guaranteed bonds.</p>

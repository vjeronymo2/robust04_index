			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (9): Breakthrough in the factories - Shop-Floor Systems, demand continues to grow ALMOST every type of computer hardware that exists in a commercial data processing department can be found somewhere in a manufacturing environment. The basic electronics of manufacturing technology is the same as in the rest of the business world; it is the fine-tuning which is different. Large manufacturers typically depend on a mainframe for their central corporate functions and this is likely to continue. Though most want to make more information available to users by introducing distributed systems and client/server architectures, the need for the biggest companies to consolidate and store large volumes of data will probably persist. Only a mainframe can cope with that load. Moreover, the spread of ED1 (electronic data interchange, or paperless trading) could slow or even reverse the erosion of the role of the mainframe. However, as mainframes are no longer cheaper to run than smaller boxes, manufacturing applications such as MRP systems have been steadily moving, through a process of downsizing, from mainframes to mid-range machines or even networks of personal computers. The general change of management strategy in manufacturing, from central control to local responsibility - the so-called cellular concept - favours the spread of mid-range machines or PCs rather than mainframes. In the past decade computing has brought great changes to the management of manufacturing through MRP systems, but it has only just begun to make an impact on the shop-floor. Most shop-floors receive an action list as output from the MRP system and that is as far as the computer stretches. The advent of the just-in-time manufacturing philosophy has persuaded many companies that the computer has to be introduced on the shop-floor to support the production process. Shop-floor data collection is usually handled by a mid-range machine, although PCs are replacing mid-range machines in some sites. Mid-range open systems hardware based on the UNIX operating system is beginning to be used in factories where the ability to integrate systems from different manufacturers is essential. Personal computers have changed the life of factories, if rather slower than that of offices. As factories get cleaner, standard PCs can be used in more and more places. It is now often quite appropriate for an ordinary PC to be in a foreman's office. Tens of thousands of PCs, mainly IBM or clones, are scattered around British factories. On the design side, workstations from companies such as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are the standard tools of the trade. Where life is too rough for the standard PC, ruggedised machines are used. In some cases robust terminals can be put on the shop-floor with the main computing facility kept in a back office or, for that matter, in another town or country. Local computing power is usually needed for many applications that involve graphics or diagrams. For these the machine has to be on site because the telecommunications system cannot transmit high volumes of data over any great distance. Specially adapted equipment or protective packaging may be needed in the factory for many reasons, as Mr Graham Crocker, a manufacturing specialist at IBM, points out. It may be dirty, the temperature may vary from very hot to very cold, there may be vibration or disruption of the electricity supply. There may be risk of fire or liquid being spilled or worker's hands may be greasy. There may be electromagnetic interference from other machines, requiring computers to be kept in steel cases. Shop-floor workers may be less familiar with computer systems than office workers; special keyboards with function keys may be preferable to the conventional Qwerty layout. On the shop-floor small ruggedised hand-held computers from companies such as Coventry-based Husky are being adopted by some large companies both for data collection and for quality control. At the Royal Doulton china factories, for example, Huskys are used to keep track of the 40,000 types of product. Hand-held and laptop machines have grown in popularity as they have got lighter and their screens have become easier to read. At the same time they have been enhanced by being able to store more data and to run longer before the battery needs changing. The principal requirement of the manufacturer which differs from that of the commercial user is a high degree of hardware availability. Reliability is one aspect of availability. Mr Richard Ridler, manufacturing industry marketing manager for ICL, points out that whereas some office systems can go down for 10 or 20 minutes occasionally without causing anything worse than annoyance, in a factory this could be disastrous. Mr Graham McKenzie, manufacturing systems manager with Digital, identifies three levels of resilience. Digital VAXes can be clustered so that if a disk drive fails on one recovery can be achieved within a few minutes. Two machines can be connected within a single cabinet so that if one goes down the other will pick up the task within a few seconds. Or three machines can be tightly coupled so that if one of them fails the process will carry on uninterrupted and unnoticed by the user; this is normally called fault-tolerance. Response time is another aspect of availability. Industrial users expect subsecond response times for many functions, where office users could be asked to be more patient. A third factor is the working regime. Office systems are typically shut down to users overnight and at weekends, whereas factory systems may have to work a 24-hour day and about 360 days a year. It is therefore important for the manufacturer to decide what level of availability is needed for his systems before investing in hardware. Continuous uptime can be achieved, but the price goes up as availability is increased. Prospects for systems suppliers to manufacturers in the longer term must be rated as good. The negative signs are that, as in the office market, users are expecting to pay less for more all the time and the market for MRP systems shows some signs of saturation. Only the smaller factories do not have these systems and they may either have no pressing need or no money to invest. On the positive side the pressure of competition is making manufacturers concentrate more on the need for automation, especially on the shop-floor. Large manufacturers are getting stricter with their suppliers on quality, forcing those companies to invest more in technology. Finally, the technology itself is clearly becoming ever more capable of delivering real benefits.</p>

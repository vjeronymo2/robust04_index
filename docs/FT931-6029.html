			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant urges rejection of Aberdeen bid Brabant Resources, the oil and gas explorer, yesterday urged shareholders to reject the all-share bid from Aberdeen Petroleum as its prepares to issue its defence document early next week. Mr Nicholas Gay, finance director, asked investors, 'especially small shareholders, to wait for what we send them'. The defence document is expected to address several issues raised by Aberdeen in its final offer submission. These include Aberdeen's estimate that in the period from its formation in 1986 to December 31 1991 Brabant spent Pounds 14m on exploration. Brabant is expected to argue that this includes the carrying costs of assets held as a result of acquisitions. The figure quoted by Brabant is likely to be closer to Pounds 5m. The exploration company is also preparing to attack Aberdeen's overhead costs. Brabant will claim that its overheads, which have averaged 9 per cent of turnover for the last three years, compares favourably with Aberdeen's 27 per cent average. Aberdeen is offering 35 shares for every 10 of Brabant's. Aberdeen shares closed 1p down at 16 1/2 p yesterday, while Brabant's were steady at 42p. Both companies are quoted on the USM.</p>

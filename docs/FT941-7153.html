			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (2): The unfamiliar taste of austerity - Mark Nicholson examines the reactions to spending cuts in a welfare super-state Some unfamiliar calls - in Kuwait at least - have recently been emanating from the finance ministry and central bank. They are calls for sacrifices, belt-tightening and austerity, and they are being couched in uncommonly pointed terms. Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister, last month spoke of reform measures requiring 'sacrifices on all levels' and the 'urgent need' to undertake 'structural' changes to government spending. He suggested Kuwait should look to cut spending in its 1994-95 budget by 20 per cent. Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the governor of the central bank, amplified such thoughts. 'I'll be after more than a 20 per cent cut in spending,' he said. 'The problem is the structural imbalances in the budget.' What is unfamiliar about such talk is, first, that it is being uttered at all. This is a result of the fact that soft world oil prices, the fiscal legacy of the Gulf war and reconstruction after it, the impending repayment of Kuwait's foreign debt, big arms purchases and towering recurrent costs in the government's accounts have combined to put an unsustainable squeeze on state coffers. So tight is the squeeze that Kuwait's government now feels forced to signal the abandonment of its time-honoured role as unblinking provider to one of the world's most featherbedded welfare states, and raise the alarm. But it is also new for the government to feel it has to issue such signals so publicly. It is doing so because it is preparing the ground for what looks set to become the most contentious and difficult budget debate in Kuwait's history. In April, when spending cuts and service fee increases are expected to be included in Kuwait's 1994-1995 budget proposals, they will have to be approved by the opposition-dominated National Assembly. The government appears to believe, with some justice, that Kuwait's newly empowered MPs will need a good deal of softening up before they can be convinced to pass measures which, for the first time in Kuwait's recent history, will promise an overall erosion of the state's plethora of benefits. The case for some belt-tightening is pressing. Kuwait's official budget  - which omits defence spending, debt repayments and investment income - for 1993-94 envisaged a KD1.5bn fiscal deficit. This is already off track. According to Mr al-Rodhan, the budget deficit already stood at 67 per cent of the projected total for the June-July financial year at midpoint in January. Moreover, the initial budget estimates were based on projected oil revenues, comprising 89 per cent of total government income, and assumed output of 1.75m barrels a day at Dollars 14 a barrel. Weak oil prices since have forced the government to revise this basis to Dollars 10.5 a barrel on output of more than 2m b/d - which implies a considerable cut in income. As good luck, and some good management, would have it, Kuwait appears likely to be able to finance the 1993-94 deficit from its own resources. Domestic treasury bill sales will fund part of the gap, but the lion's share is likely to come from the investment income of the Kuwait Investment Authority, which oversees Kuwait's still substantial overseas investments portfolio. Although Kuwait's holdings of just under Dollars 100bn were slashed to between Dollars 35bn-Dollars 40bn to pay for Gulf war costs, the world's buoyant equity markets over the past year are understood to have given KIA a return of at least 20 per cent on these holdings for 1993. But the real problems lie in the next two to three years. In 1995 the government is due to start the first principal repayments on the Dollars 5.5bn jumbo loan it took out on international markets to tide it through its immediate post-war needs. This will immediately add commitments of at least Dollars 2.7bn both in 1995 and 1996, commitments which, says Sheikh Salem, Kuwait will certainly meet. Since Kuwait cannot easily bet on firmer oil prices - particularly with the prospect of an eventual return of Iraqi oil on the horizon - or continued bullishness in world equities, the government has little choice but to tighten control of spending and revenues at home. Government committees are understood now to be examining what measures can be taken. Nothing definitive has yet been tabled. But the finance ministry and central bank are making it known that the government wage bill, which accounts alone for 52 per cent of total spending, is under review, as are the quite enormous subsidies on power and water. Defence spending, which to date has been kept firmly off budget, might also be hauled in for reconsideration. Only the latter is likely to win much sympathy from the National Assembly. But while the government wrestles to control its own financial problems, it is forced also to consider those of Kuwait's despondent private sector - which historically has depended almost entirely on government spending to sustain it. According to Sheikh Salem, Kuwait's non-oil economy has shrunk by 33 per cent since before the Gulf war. The causes of this shrinkage are manifold. They include the effects of war damage, the decline in domestic markets as a result of Kuwait's policy of reducing its population, the banks' reluctance to commit credit to businessmen until Kuwait's 'difficult debt' programme is definitively resolved and, perhaps as much as anything, a crippling lack of confidence among Kuwaiti investors themselves. The private sector will be hard for the government to ignore, since otherwise there is little prospect that Kuwait's economy will be capable of absorbing the additional 5,000-6,000 Kuwaitis who enter the labour force every year. The bloated public sector, which already employs 96 per cent of all employed Kuwaiti nationals, is not set to grow in the next two to three years, whatever the oil price does, and cannot conceivably absorb efficiently the new cohorts of young Kuwaitis. Faced with a lack of initiative from domestic investors, the government has therefore turned to foreign investment as a potential palliative, and is entertaining with increasing seriousness the prospect of privatisation. The government's offset programme (discussed on page IV of this survey) has already won hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign investment commitments, though as yet few firm projects. The government is also cautiously discussing the possibility of inviting foreign investment in the banking sector and small parts of the domestic downstream petroleum industry. But Kuwait's caution towards foreign investment - it is a highly emotive topic among parliamentarians - places it at a considerable disadvantage in the Gulf where places such as Dubai, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have long since introduced packages of incentives for foreign investors including free zones, tax breaks and subsidised finance. Tax on foreign companies in Kuwait, as an instance of comparison, presently stand at a highly discouraging 55 per cent. A programme of privatisation is also being considered, within the framework of a lengthy World Bank study which concluded that Kuwait has little choice but to divest itself of state holdings if it is to create an environment of economic growth, let alone get its own financial house in order. Some early steps are being taken. By the end of this year, the pioneering telecommunications ministry expects to be in a position to float 51 per cent of the telephone system in a public offering. The KIA is studying the divestment of its holdings in more than 60 Kuwaiti companies, most of them picked up during the state mop-up of debts following the 1982 stock market crash. But it is early days for the privatisation programme and a considerable amount of preparation is required before local or foreign investors are likely to want to bite. And all such preparation is liable to provoke political opposition. Sales of public utilities or aspects of the health services would require a rise in service fees, which would face strong opposition. Privatisation itself would almost certainly require short-term job cuts in what are presently cossetted public sector areas. Little wonder, with such prospective political battles ahead, that the government is sounding shriller about Kuwait's economic straits.</p>

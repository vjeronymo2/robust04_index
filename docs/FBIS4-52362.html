			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] and other  militant groups are asking for the immediate release of arrested  rebel leader Wilma Tiamzon and a 300 other political detainees.  The request was made by NDF Vice Chairperson Luis Jalandoni and  the hierarchy of the League of Filipino Students.    The group said that Tiamzon's rights and and those of her  comrades should be respected so that the peace process being  pushed by the Ramos Government can be successful.    According to NDF, Tiamzon should be freed since no charges  have yet been filed against her in court.</p>

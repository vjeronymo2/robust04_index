He added that the five UN Security  Council permanent members have asked the UN secretary general to  brief them on each side's positions.    Kliridhis made this statement while replying to reporters'  questions at a luncheon for Greek Independence Day hosted by  Greek Ambassador to Nicosia Alexandros Sandhis. Asked whether  there is any possibility that the proximity talks will continue  until 29 March, Kliridhis said there is very little leeway. He  added that he believes the UN secretary general should proceed  in preparing his report on the conclusion of the proximity talks  and submit it to the Security Council.    After today's parade marking the 25 March holiday, Kliridhis  was asked to comment on the latest developments in the proximity  talks. He said that both the Greek Cypriot side and the five UN  Security Council permanent members have asked for an objective  report that describes each side's stance.</p>

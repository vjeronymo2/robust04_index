			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: Confused question of censorship - Video In most places the end of summer is marked by slowing growth and the first signs of autumnal decay. But the home-viewing landscape is burgeoning suddenly into a vast, bewildering jungle. There are exotic flora like Laser Discs and Digital Video, turning your TV room into a riot of hi-fi sounds and colours. There are the modest but multiplying sense-experiences available on normal video. And there are corners of complete and tangled confusion, like the current state of video censorship. One recent development in this corner is worth note: the tendency for distributors to rush out large-screen (re)releases of controversial films while our censor dithers about video certification or our MPs haggle over what we can watch in the privacy of our homes. Hence the recent reappearance of Quentin Tarantino's violent, powerful thriller Reservoir Dogs at cinemas near most of us. Another Tarantino work, True Romance, may do the same since that too has been lingering in the censor's office. Since Tarantino's last film Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and since a film adapted from a Tarantino story (Natural Born Killers) has been the talking point of the American movie summer, are British VCR-owners really happy to be subjected to this Mrs Grundyish nonsense? If not, they should make their voices heard while the debate lasts. And if Britain's powers-that-be will not hear them, perhaps the EC's will. While some movies dawdle, others rush into the new formats. DW Griffith's seminal epic of world cinema The Birth Of A Nation (Connoisseur) may have taken 80 years to reach your VCR, also via recent censorship turmoils. But at least it means we can now travel at one bound to the origins of cinema. And you cannot stop glossier modern products like The Firm (CIC), Aladdin (Disney) and, soon, Jurassic Park (CIC) from jumping almost straight into your sitting room after large-screen exposure. The Firm is this month's multi-format market leader. Already out on Laser Disc, it will have the first ever simultaneous release on VHS and Digital Video. The film is 2 1/2 hours of John Grisham-based nonsense, with Tom Cruise battling a corrupt and murder-prone law firm. Entertaining: even if there is a low-aim inevitability about the choice of a proven catchpenny hit for this trend-setting multiple release. We would hardly expect the honour to have fallen on a coterie masterpiece like Scorsese's Edith Wharton adaptation The Age Of Innocence. But Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer will soon be romancing it on Laser Disc. Nor on genuinely original movies like Brian De Palma's hallucinogenic murder mystery Raising Cain (on video only from CIC) or on the Terence Davies Trilogy (ditto, Connoisseur), a haunting 1970s apprentice work from the British maker of Distant Voices, Still Lives, or on Peter Greenaway's The Falls. This last, also from Connoisseur, is the pick of the month. You will be old and grey before it gets to Digital Video or Laser Disc, but you should try it now on VHS. It was the longest and greatest of Greenaway's pre-feature films before fame came with The Draughtsman's Contract. I almost said his 'nonfiction' or 'short' films. But both terms would be violent misnomers. The Falls last three hours and its joke-documentary form - stories about a group of mysterious accident victims whose names all begin with 'Fall' - is as fictive as you could get without being arrested for aesthetic fraudulence. But relish Greenaway's gleaming surrealist visuals, the po-faced epigrams of his narrator and the wondrous flair for briskly wagging shaggy-dog tales. The release of The Falls also proves that while other home-viewing systems may offer state-of-the-art sound and vision, you can still only get state-of-the-art art on VHS. That is: if our censor allows.</p>

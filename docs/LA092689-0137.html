			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council has named four of seven members to the board of  directors of the newly created Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Corp., an  agency formed last month that could generate millions of dollars for the city's  arts programs. The members, all Costa Mesa residents, are Susan Krause, Frank  Cole, Mike Chitjian and Ronald Bauer. None is affiliated with local arts  organizations, but Chitjian serves on the city's Cultural Arts Committee, said  Ann Gyben, assistant to the city manager.  </P> <P> Three other board members, including two to represent the city's hotel  industry, will be named at Monday's City Council meeting. The full board  eventually will determine the new corporation's overall goals, spending  policies and its funding mechanism, now being developed by City Council staff.  </P> <P> This year, Costa Mesa arts groups received $159,000 from the city. The new  corporation, which may be funded through fees charged hotel and motel guests,  could bring in $2 million annually for arts and tourism, city officials have  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA VOLLEYBALL TEAM REPRIMANDED  </P> <P> UCLA was reprimanded by the Pacific 10 Conference because it used an ineligible  volleyball player during intercollegiate men's matches last fall, Commissioner  Thomas Hansen announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Kent Steffes, a transfer from Stanford, played in several two-man professional  beach volleyball tournaments last summer, for which his playing partners  received prize money, a violation of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules.  </P> <P> One of his partners who received money was Wally Martin, a UCLA assistant coach  who, according to a statement released by the Pac-10, was reprimanded and  placed on probation by UCLA administrators. The statement said Martin was told  that any future serious violation of NCAA rules would result in his  termination.  </P> <P> According to results published in Volleyball Monthly, Steffes and Martin played  together in several tournaments, including one in Orange County and another in  Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> Steffes, who is listed in the UCLA media guide as the 1988 beach volleyball  rookie of the year, was declared ineligible before the regular men's volleyball  season last spring, so UCLA's NCAA championship was not affected.

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Saving and Borrowing): Tempting the tepid Lenders have been offering gifts in various guises all year to tempt the lukewarm house-buyer. Indeed, by abolishing mortgage indemnity premiums (Mips), Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester might have thought it was offering the ultimate gift. Yet, this is of real interest only to those with a small deposit, writes Olive Thompson of Moneyfacts. Moreover, although radical (in that it applies to all mortgages), it is not an entirely new initiative. Leeds and Holbeck waive the premium on their new, discounted, variable-rate deals for first-time buyers. Other lenders which do not charge Mips on specific products include Portman, Skipton, Melton Mowbray, Citibank, Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages, Homeloans Direct, Legal &amp; General, The Mortgage Business and UCB. Some lenders are more flexible than others where premiums are concerned. Northern Rock now allows them to be added to the loan, as do Yorkshire BS and Lambeth, but Greenwich and Derbyshire insist on the payment up-front. Increasing the debt could be the easy option, but do not overlook the fact that interest will be charged - and can mount up - if the premium is not paid off during the first year of the mortgage. Cash rebates can be particularly useful to a first-time buyer to offset the cost of Mips, which could be Pounds 880 on a property valued at Pounds 55,000, with a 5 per cent deposit. The Pounds 1,000 rebate offered by Chelsea is for advances over Pounds 40,000 - for advances up to and including Pounds 40,000, the rebate is Pounds 500. Fixed-rate mortgages for three years can still be found at less than the standard variable rate. The Woolwich recently reduced its two-year fixed rate by 1 per cent to 7.49 per cent. Longer-term fixes may be attractive for those who want peace of mind: the TSB has revised its five-year fixed rate down by 0.24 per cent to a comparative 8.95 per cent. Although the majority of banks and building societies have increased their savings rates following September's base rate rise, a number still have not passed on the benefits to their investors, writes Christine Bayliss. The Scarborough has actually cut rates by 0.5 per cent on its Scarborough '94 account. Fixed-rate products - both flat and escalating rates - continue to be popular. Indeed, the demand has been such that bonds from the Chelsea and West Bromwich were available for only a short time before being withdrawn. Rates of around the 8 per cent mark are available for two to four years. The highest comes from the Confederation Bank: 9 per cent for five years. Offshore institutions have, in the main, also followed events onshore. With higher balances, they often pay more, the bonus being that the interest is paid gross. While it is taxable and must be declared by UK residents, the interest received can be re-invested for maximum benefit until the tax bill is due. In some cases, it is possible for investors to choose when the interest is paid to make maximum use of this advantage.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: LPO and Kyung-Wha Chung - Concert On Monday Franz Welser-Most and the London Philharmonic began their Festival Hall concert in deceptively low profile, with the 18 year old Schubert's Stabat Mater. It inhabits the limbo reserved for those more than competent works by future masters which betray too few signs of the mature composer to come. This sober, graceful Stabat Mater might have been composed by any number of well schooled musicians and few listeners would guess Schubert first. The LPO's choir sounded grey, their collective imagination unstirred. Then the violinist Kyung-Wha Chung arrived to play Bruch's D Minor concerto - his Second - and electrified everybody, as she is wont to do. Though this thoughtful, honestly made late-Romantic concerto boasts no astonishing wattage, she compelled us to listen to it as if it were a graven revelation; her commanding bow and her luminous conviction brooked no argument. Bruch would have been pleased, and indeed honoured. The orchestra, beautifully rehearsed, played their secondary role superbly. Kyung-Wha Chung used to deliver almost anything with a pantherish intensity, often several scalding degrees beyond what the music could really bear. Here, it was lovely to hear her playing Bruch's unspectacular concerto with such acute sympathy and poise - but no hyper-dramatic pressure. Fluent musicianship was Bruch's leading virtue, and when it is made as plain as this one can't but admire and surrender to it. Nonetheless, in Sibelius's Fifth Symphony after the interval the LPO strings were surely inspired by Chung's high-definition model. Their stark, fraught phrases boasted a passionate unanimity far beyond the British string-norm. (Presumably the LPO's new Leader, Joakim Svenheden, had something to do with that too.) The woodwinds were properly plangent, with a touch of shrillness in the right places, and all the brass were resoundingly secure. Yet the symphony seemed simpler than it is. Despite Welser-Most's fine gradations from pp to ff, everything sounded brightly polished, up-front - no chiaroscuro, no suggestive depths. As a result, the symphonic impetus sometimes flagged even while the actual execution dazzled. There were some magical passages - like the first dance-paragraph of the Scherzo, which materialised out of the air with the utmost sweetness and modesty, set as if at a shy distance. The Andante variations could have done with more delicate effects of that kind; and in the Finale the famously unforgettable up-and-down thirds for horns never accumulated their full sense of thankful return and expansive release. In short, we got a sharp symphonic blueprint but only hints at the dramatic subtext, which is always the heart of the matter in Sibelius as in Mahler. I look forward to hearing Welser-Most conduct this Fifth again in (say) five years' time, by when his scrupulous attention to the musical surface should extend to a wider focus.</p>

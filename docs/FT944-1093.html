			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Coopers' Maxwell move fails Coopers and Lybrand, the leading accountancy firm, has failed in its attempt to stop an investigation into its auditing of the Maxwell Group pension funds, Jim Kelly writes. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's regulator, wanted to investigate its role as an auditor. High Court judges Lord Justice Henry and Mr Justice Kay said: 'The question should be addressed promptly, and its resolution should not await and be dependent on the final resolution of civil proceedings, which may be some years off.' The case hinged on whether regulators can investigate cases still being heard in criminal and civil courts. As such it is seen as a test case for regulators in all sectors, including the financial markets. Coopers and Lybrand argued that if it were to lose a case before the JDS the result could be 'catastrophic' for the firm. The accountancy firm Price Waterhouse had previously successfully argued that a JDS investigation into its part in the BCCI affair should await the conclusion of civil actions. Coopers said: 'The decision has gone against us. We are taking legal advice at the moment.' An appeal is seen as extremely likely.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> LANDSLIDE KILLS 17 IN PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> Heavy rains and aftershocks to the deadly July 16 earthquake triggered a  landslide in a northern mountain highway, killing at least 17 people, officials  said today.  </P> <P> Gov. Patricio Dumlao of Nueva Viscaya province said the landslide struck Dalton  Pass in Santa Fe, 110 miles north of Manila.  </P> <P> Dalton Pass, a major route to the Cagayan Valley in northeastern Luzon island,  had remained impassable because of massive landslides sparked by the temblor  two weeks ago, Dumlao said.  </P> <P> The 17 fatalities were travelers bound for Manila from Isabela province just  north of Nueva Viscaya, Dumlao said. On reaching the blocked portion of the  highway, the travelers left one bus to board another when an aftershock  triggered the landslide on the rain-weakened mountain, burying the 17, he said.  </P></p>

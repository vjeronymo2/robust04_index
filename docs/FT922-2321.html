			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Observer: Neddy goes west Did Norman Lamont check with Welsh secretary David Hunt before abolishing the National Economic Development Council? The chancellor of the exchequer was adamant yesterday that there was no place during the 1990s for the tripartite approach to economic management which the NEDC had represented since its inception in the corporatist 1960s. But Hunt seems to have other ideas. He is busy setting up a new Welsh economic development council. It will bring together Welsh industrialists, trade unionists and local authority leaders to do just the job that NEDC was supposed to do for Britain. It is hardly surprising that some at Westminster are beginning to mutter that Hunt seems to be turning into more of a closet-socialist than his predecessor, Peter Walker.</p>

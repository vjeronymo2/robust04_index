			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Political parties  and organisations of various countries expressed full support to  the January 31 statement of a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry  of the DPRK denouncing the perfidy of the United States in  reversing all points of agreement and promises between it and  the DPRK.    Joint statements were published by the Danish Workers'  Party,  Common Cause, the Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist)  and the Communist Party of Denmark on February 10, by the  Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party (Marxists)  and the Left-Wing Alliance of Bulgaria on February 3 and by the  People's Democratic Movement of Guyana, the Amerindian Action  Movement of Guyana, the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's  Reunification and the Guyana-Korea Friendship Association on  February 2.    Statements were also released by the National Committee of  the Workers' Party of Zaire, the Central Committee of the  October 8 Revolutionary Movement of Brazil, the Asian Regional  Institute of the Chuche Idea, the Nepal-Korea Friendship  Association and the Union of Tanzania Workers.    The statements denounced the aggressive moves of the United  States in violating the sovereignty of the DPRK.    They noted that the United States which is responsible for  the origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must not  try to solve the issue from the position of strength but  affirmatively respond to the formula of package solution  proposed by the DPRK for a fair solution to the nuclear issue in  the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement.    Pointing out that it is a mistake to try to stifle the DPRK  with strength, the statements urged the United States to act  with discretion.    H.G. Mahundi, police superintendent of the Ministry of Home  Affairs of Tanzania, in a statement released on February 7 said  that the "nuclear issue" of Korea could not be solved by a  strong arm or strength and demanded that the United States  correct its wrong stand, abide by the agreed points and respond  to the DPRK-U.S. talks before it is too late.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Confidence in Johannesburg is shaken A weaker gold price added to the upset on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, still reeling from the impact of Monday's gun battles in the city centre which rocked market confidence, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg. The overall index shed 58 to 4,968 after losing nearly 3 per cent the day before. The golds index fell 97 to 2,026 as bullion failed to hold above Dollars 388 an ounce. But dealers said bargain hunting by local institutions pushed the industrial index up 36 to 5,762 after the previous day's 2 per cent drop. Mr David Schapiro, of stockbrokers Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that Monday's events had done severe damage to international investor confidence in the short term, even if there had been little panic selling. The finrand closed at R4.765 against the dollar after starting the week at R4.705.</p>

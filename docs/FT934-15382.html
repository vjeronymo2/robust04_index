			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Growing enthusiasm for electronic imagery - Alan Cane looks at Virtuality's debut and the market for virtual reality technology INVESTORS have already had the chance of a punt on 'virtual reality', the esoteric technology which dresses users in visors and wired gloves to persuade them they are part of an alternative electronic world. Division, based in Bristol, came to the market at 40p earlier in the year, the first VR company to go public anywhere in the world. The shares shot up to 100p and have since been trading comfortably at about 80p. It raised Pounds 5m, enough to support its research and development for three years. Today, W Industries, under its new name of Virtuality, makes its market debut by way of a placing, hoping to raise some Pounds 10m. International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, and Motorola, a leading semiconductor manufacturer and communications specialist, have already taken stakes valued at about Pounds 1m apiece. Institutions are showing enthusiasm for Virtuality's convincing electronic imagery suggesting the placing will be a success. The question remains whether investors understand the significance of what they are putting their money into or whether they are simply backing a fashionable but incomprehensible technology. Mr Charles Grimsdale, chief executive of Division, says his company's products excite 'tremendous interest but limited understanding'. He believes the market will be worth Pounds 1bn by the end of the decade, split between a comparatively small number of companies. At one level, VR represents immense possibilities for entertainment - 'real' experiences impossible to reproduce safely or economically by other means. At another it is the next stage in the development of the way humans interact with computers; the move from the two dimensional desktop represented by, say, Apple's Macintosh or Microsoft's Windows, to a three dimensional workspace. Users become immersed in this workspace; they can interact with objects in the electronic environment. In one striking example, developed by Division for Matsushita of Japan, two individuals can simultaneously wander through a virtual kitchen. They can work together to move the cooker, the refrigerator or the extractor hood. Although virtual reality is a new technology, it already can be divided into a number of different market sectors. First, there is entertainment - the area which Virtuality has chosen to make its own. Founded by Mr Jonathan Waldern in 1988, the company had a turnover of Pounds 5.24m at the end of 1992. Among its achievements is a contract with Sega Enterprises of Japan, the world leader in sophisticated arcade games. Mr Waldern sees Virtuality developing in three directions. First, complete systems, software and hardware integrated together to create arcade games. Second, specialised VR software written to customer's specifications. Third, packaging and licensing the company's skills to third parties. Division, for example, is already licensing its technology to Virtual Reality Games of Leeds, a subsidiary of Global Entertainments, to develop second generation arcade games. Virtuality will use some of the money it is raising to complete its work on 'second generation' VR products for the latest range of low-cost personal computers. It raises the possibility of VR machines for the home in the near future. Second, computer aided design and manufacturing. The Calibre Institute, attached to the University of Eindhoven, developed a system for Espeq, a group of 300 companies in the building trade. It created electronic images of three houses complete with interiors which house purchasers could walk through, inspecting the various rooms. According to Espeq, during the two days the VR system was in use, more houses were sold than in any previous two-day period. Division has just developed a Pounds 4,000 tool called dVISE which enables designers who have created conventional two dimensional designs to turn them into three dimensional virtual models, giving them the opportunity to view their work as if it had been manufactured. Mr Grimsdale believes that this kind of software can be used to ease customers into VR. Third, simulation and training. Mr Grimsdale says: 'This has exciting cost implications. Suddenly we can create effective simulations in which the user gets a full 360 degree view for perhaps one tenth of the current cost'. Conventional aircraft simulators cost several million pounds and utilise five large mirrors and a similar number of computers. This can be replaced by two computers and a headset with display screens in front of the eyes. Whole battlefield training systems may be only eight years away. Finally, scientific simulation. Glaxo, for example, uses VR for molecular modelling, while Matsushita is using a system for air flow simulations. Shell is experimenting with seismic models. Entertainment is some 30 per cent of the market today but that is likely to fall as companies make greater use of VR in computer-aided design and simulation. The overall market is currently growing at 80 per cent to 100 per cent a year from, admittedly, a very small base. The technology continues to be a primary driver, however: 'What really excites me is the staggering rate at which graphics technology is evolving', Mr Grimsdale says.</p>

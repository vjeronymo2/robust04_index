			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / The limits of voting reform The eight referendums now under way in Italy, and the four scheduled for next Sunday in Russia, are two very strange events, but they have one thing in common: they are both taking place because the national system of government is in crisis. Needless to say, these referendums cannot repair the old system nor provide a new one. But with luck the voters may provide some general sense of their preferences for the way ahead. In Russia, even this modest hope may prove to be out of reach, so deep is the disarray of the political system. President Yeltsin is hoping to reassert his authority by asking the voters to declare their 'trust' in him. But it is not clear what this question really means; even if the answer should be 'Yes' by a large margin, this may not be enough to end the paralysing stalemate between the president and the parliament. The Italian referendums should have better prospects because Italy's problems are much less serious. The political parties and their leaders are horrendously corrupt; but the system itself is still essentially democratic, and the machinery of the state is a long way from total breakdown. Italy's magistrates have taken the first vital step in exposing the filth in the Augean Stables; today Italy's voters will show whether they support a far-reaching clean-up. The principal indicator will be the verdict on electoral reform. The question is disconcertingly modest: do the voters want to change the way the Senate is elected, from proportional representation to a large dose of majority voting? On the face of it, this seems disarmingly irrelevant, in relation to the political crisis, since real political power is held by the lower chamber, not the Senate. But the political symbolism will be clear to all: a vote against proportional representation will be a vote against the whole of the machinery which fostered the system of partitocrazia and all-pervasive corruption. And the political establishment could not then avoid a parallel reform in the voting system for the lower house as well. The question is: what kind of voting system would bring the most beneficial reform? At this point your liberal pluralist might seek to dissuade the Italians from leaping from an Italian frying pan into a British fire. He would point out that while Britain has had many decades of so-called strong government, it has had almost no good government in living memory; the present phase exemplifies the worst of all worlds. Yet this is not the place to rehearse again the arguments on the theoretical merits of different voting systems. On the contrary, any given voting system is less important than the larger political equation; if radical political reform is possible in Italy, it will not be determined solely or even mainly by detailed voting rules. Look, for example, at the French voting system, which is apparently among those under discussion in Italy. For 25 years it has worked rather well, with extended periods of stable government, with reasonable majorities, and with alternations between left and right. But in last month's elections the system blew a fuse, with a result which is so unbalanced, even by British standards, that it may well contain the seeds of dangerous instability. In the first round of voting, the conservatives got 39 per cent of the valid votes cast, or 25 per cent of the electorate; but in the second round, after elimination of the also-rans, they ended up with 78 per cent of the seats. This must be an alarming result, even for the conservatives. In principle they should rejoice at the decimation of the Socialist Party; in practice, they know their real support in the country is less than in 1981, when it was the Socialists who won a landslide. Moreover, they must be disturbed by one indicator of popular anger: the number of spoiled ballot papers, which in most past elections has tended to fluctuate between 300,000 and 600,000, but which soared last month to a record 2.1m. Mr Edouard Balladur, the very moderate new prime minister, has refused to promise economic miracles, or even a change in the Socialists' conservative economic policy. But an unreasonable majority will set up unreasonable expectations, and the first expectation must be that this government will bring faster growth and lower unemployment. Unless policy changes, however, the chances are that unemployment will continue to rise. With such a large majority to satisfy, and with presidential elections looming two years from now, there must be a real prospect that the populist tail will wag the conservative dog, if not in parliament then on the streets. As it is, the government's programme is already a mongrel mixture of moderate conservatism and raw populism. The moderates get monetary stability, fiscal rigour and European integration; the populists get threats of protectionism in agriculture and other trade, and a law-and-order campaign against drugs, delinquents and illegal immigrants which has already resulted in several police shootings. This could be an explosive mixture. What makes it explosive, however, is popular alienation from a traditional political establishment which has failed to deliver France from the pain of restructuring and unemployment. This alienation shows up in protest votes, protest abstention, protest spoiled ballot papers, and the desertion of the Socialist Party. Mr Balladur is sitting on a crisis which is just waiting to explode; but this cannot be blamed on a majority voting system which is unrepresentative.</p>

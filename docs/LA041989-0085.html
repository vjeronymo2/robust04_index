			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MIXED-USE COMPLEX WINS HEARTY OK  </P> <P> A proposal to build a $1-billion mini-city at the site of the old Pike  Amusement Park won the enthusiastic backing Tuesday of the Long Beach City  Council, which voted to amend the local coastal plan to clear the way for the  project.  </P> <P> The plans to construct an 11-building, mixed-use project that would eventually  employ 8,000 people must still go before the state Coastal Commission and be  reviewed in detail by Long Beach. The project, a venture of the Ratkovich Co.  and Enterprise Development West, would be built over a 13-year period, with  ground-breaking scheduled for 1990.  </P> <P> The changes in the local coastal plan and downtown shoreline plan would enable  developers to build at more than double the density now permitted, as well as  to erect buildings as tall as 600 feet.  </P> <P> The 13-acre complex would include offices, shops, residences and up to 500  hotel rooms.  </P></p>

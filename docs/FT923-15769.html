			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / European Finance and Investment, Germany (2): Face to face with reality - Berlin is unlikely to challenge Frankfurt VISIONS a few years ago of Berlin swiftly reclaiming its pre-war role as the most important German economic and financial centre have collided head-on with reality. West German banks have neither upgraded their presence in Berlin since unification nor considered moving headquarters to the city. Bankers are unanimous in believing that Berlin's financial future will be as a regional banking centre which will scarcely make a dent in Frankfurt's dominant position. More than 150 banks operate in Berlin compared with 95 in 1989. Among the newcomers establishing branches were 24 foreign institutions and several private banks including Trinkaus and Edmond de Rothschild's Banque Privee. The Americans, however, apart from Citibank, an investment bank and a broker, are content to observe the Berlin scene from Frankfurt. 'At present I don't see a real demand for Berlin to be a financial centre,' Mr Kurt Kasch, board member of Deutsche Bank in Berlin and a frequent critic of the city's inward-looking political and economic leadership. His own branch is the largest of DB's 16 main branches and is responsible for two and one-half east German Laender plus Berlin. Unusually, it also arranged the bulk of Deutsche Bank's government-guaranteed Hermes export loans last year to east German companies trading with the CIS states. Mr Kasch said that as long as the German Government and parliament were not in Berlin there would be little chance that the major German banks would upgrade their presence in the capital. But the move from Bonn to Berlin has been delayed for financial and bureaucratic reasons and is not expected to begin until 1998. Mr Egbert Steinke, spokesman of the Berlin Chamber of Industry and Trade (IHK), said the delay in Berlin's transformation into a working capital is also negatively affecting the move by service-oriented businesses to the centre of east Berlin where the government has staked out its claim for government ministries. Berlin has been enhanced since 1990 by serving as the financial base for the operations of the big four west German banks in the northern part of east Germany and has become the centre of a regional banking network established by Berliner Bank (BB) in which the city still holds a 56 per cent share. BB gained branches throughout east Berlin by its takeover of Berliner Stadtbank and is well represented in the surrounding state of Brandenburg with its capital of Potsdam. The recent green light given by the city government to BB's plans to merge with Landesbank Berlin, the former Sparkasse of Berlin, means that it would overnight become Germany's seventh largest bank and the only one with headquarters in Berlin. Dr Kurt Fischer, a board member of Berliner Bank and chairman of the Central and East German Bank Federation, has been active in carving out a new role for his bank which he stressed was a 'private' one. He too saw little sense in Berlin attempting to duplicate financial functions of Frankfurt and that it would be a 'long time' before financial institutions in Berlin would greatly increase their volume of business. 'We cannot move the head offices of the banks, the people, the buildings or the technology from Frankfurt,' he remarked. He and other Berlin-based bankers warn against neglecting the medium-sized producers, once a mainstay of the city, who were now being tempted to move out to greenfield sites in eastern Germany. Banks earned more from producers than from service companies and they, in any event, were slow in coming to Berlin Mr Fischer said. The economic recovery of eastern Europe would enhance Berlin's role - Poland is only 90km away - but it is still likely to be years before such a revival takes place. Plans by Mr Manfred Stolpe, the prime minister of Brandenburg, for a special German-Polish economic development zone on either side of the border, have been placed on ice. The government does not have the money to launch so ambitious a project as long as eastern Germany continues to drain its resources. Across-the-border economic ties between east Germany and Poland are also hindered by the creaking Polish telephone network - it takes at least four hours to get a call from Frankfurt an der Oder to Slubice across the river - and monumental delays for truck traffic at the border and on inadequate Polish roads. Additional crossing points are to be built but few companies will invest in either western Poland or the east German border area until the infrastructure has been greatly improved. Meanwhile, the lack of native-owned and managed privatised east German companies - as opposed to east German subsidiaries of west German companies  -has placed a damper on hopes the miniscule Berlin stock exchange might attract east German companies. Mr Dieter Hiss, president of Landeszentralbank Berlin, doubted it would be used by newly-privatised east German companies. Given the choice they and east European companies seeking a stock market launch would probably opt for Frankfurt.</p>

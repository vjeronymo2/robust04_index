			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Doctor seeks political cure for Belfast's ills: The difficult task facing Dr Joe Hendron in Gerry Adams' former constituency THE political landscape has changed in West Belfast, where the predominant Roman Catholic population lives in gritty red-brick houses, in a physical landscape not helped by bomb damage and metal grilles on traffic lights and pub windows. Dr Joe Hendron, the freshly elected Social Democratic and Labour party MP, is a moderate nationalist who cheerfully provokes republican hardliners after narrowly winning the seat on April 9. 'They are extremely hostile to me because they were beaten in the election,' he says. Dr Hendron, who will work within the UK political system, has replaced Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, who would not. Because it supports violence, Mr Adams' party is excluded from round-table talks on the province's future which began again yesterday. Dr Hendron estimates that he was helped by about 1,500 Protestants in Unionist enclaves who voted tactically. Sinn Fein said those voters supported loyalist paramilitaries; Dr Hendron says that is 'an extreme insult'. Smouldering tensions in his constituency flared with the murder by loyalist terrorists last week of a 26-year-old mother, Mrs Philomena Hanna, at a chemist's shop on Springfield Road. Dr Hendron was jostled by Sinn Fein supporters as he visited the site. 'Hendron's voters killed Philomena,' read posters. If Dr Hendron, aged 59 and a GP since the 'troubles' began, was supposed to be a conciliator, his first action, prompted by Mrs Hanna's death, was regressive. After urgent consultations with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the gates along the 'peace line'  - a spiked barrier that rises as high as bedroom windows on houses along the Protestant and Roman Catholic divide  - were closed. In justification, the loquacious MP shows a card he was given at an interdenominational service after the killing. 'This was handed out to all the people. 'The walls of separation do not reach to Heaven.' That is what I would say. 'So many politicians are screaming 'These gates must be kept open', but they are not living on the peace line. People are very frightened.' A greater test will be Dr Hendron's performance over coming years. Non-participation in the Westminster system has been ingrained among radical Irish nationalists for decades. Dr Hendron wants to work with Northern Ireland Office ministers to encourage investment in West Belfast, drumming up interest in the US, Canada and elsewhere. He also wants to talk with the police and Army about ending harassment. Mr Adams did nothing, he says. Mr Richard McAuley, Sinn Fein's spokesman, responds: 'We have a very well-run constituency service which provides a useful service in West Belfast. Unlike Joe Hendron, we did not engage in making promises we could not keep.' Dr Hendron is also part of the SDLP delegation at the round-table talks  - hoping to deliver a deal by which local politicians can be given real political control. When he canvassed on Unionist housing estates, the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement  - supported by the SDLP but despised by Unionists because of the role it gives the Irish republic  - was top of the agenda. 'I said, 'But isn't that what the talks are about?' I said that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not a sacred cow.' Success in the talks would require huge compromises with the Unionist community. West Belfast would need much convincing.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (25): Survive three years to avoid the net - Expatriates NO ONE knows quite how many voluntary British exiles there are, but the best guess seems to be something in the order of two millions. Under Britain's tax code, the closer their connection with the UK, the greater their exposure to the major direct taxes - income Tax (IT), capital gains tax (CGT) and inheritance tax (IHT). In determining how close that connection should be taken to be, three principal statuses need to be considered: residence, ordinary residence and domicile. None has a comprehensive statutory definition. Of the three, residence can most readily be changed; ordinary residence rather less so; while domicile, which may be defined briefly if not precisely as your natural homeland, is the most adhesive. If you were born in the UK of British domiciled parents and have lived substantially all of your life there, you will be resident, ordinarily resident and domiciled within the UK and, as such, liable to IT, CGT and IHT respectively on worldwide income, gains and assets. Should you spend a complete tax year abroad (ie, April 6 to April 5) without emigrating or taking up employment, you will become non-resident for the year but will remain ordinarily resident and domiciled within the UK. As a result, your overseas income will escape IT for that year, but in all other respects your worldwide liability will continue. By contrast, short-term employment overseas which lasts for more than a year, although without encompassing a complete tax year, will not change any of the three statuses. Consequently, your UK tax liability will continue undiminished except, perhaps, in relation to salary itself. For, if you spend neither 62 consecutive days, nor more in total than one-sixth of the days in the period in Britain, it will be exempted. However, if your job overseas does encompass a full tax year, then - provided it is full-time employment, all the duties of which are performed outside the UK (incidental duties in the UK can be ignored for this purpose) and your home visits exceed neither six months in a tax year nor more than three months on average - you will be treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident from the day following your departure. You will then cease to be liable for tax on all income arising outside the UK and on all capital gains, wherever arising - with the sole exception of gains from UK business assets. While your liability to IT would continue in the case of most UK sources - for example, pensions, letting profits and dividends - there are some exceptions, including income from certain holdings of British government securities. By contrast, your liability to IHT would be totally undiminished. Bear in mind, though, that if your spouse does not also obtain full-time employment overseas, then if accommodation is retained in the UK for your joint use, he/she will be UK resident in any year in which a home visit takes place, thus reintroducing worldwide liability to CGT and, potentially, IT too. What then of those who emigrate? They too will, in most cases, be regarded as not resident and not ordinarily resident from the day after departure, provided their absence exceeds a complete tax year and UK visits do not contravene the six-months or three-months average rules. But there are two important differences. First, if the emigrant is not working then, as for non-working spouses, residence status in the UK will follow for any year in which a UK visit takes place, if accommodation available for occupation is maintained there. But, most important, emigrants also cease to be domiciled in the countries that make up the UK. In consequence, their liability to IHT is downgraded to tax on UK assets only - but not until three years have elapsed from the change of status. Thus the UK's domestic law. But in all of these cases, it must be borne in mind that the rules can be overridden by the provisions of Britain's many double taxation treaties. They can affect the determination of residence status and (in the case of the UK/US agreement) domicile, too. The type of income which can be taxed and the rate applicable may also be varied. Apart from this, for expatriates to escape totally from the UK's tax net is not easy. To do so, they must emigrate, have no income arising in the UK, remove their assets overseas - and then stay alive for three years] Furthermore, if after your sojourn overseas you return to your homeland, do not expect any special treatment. Resumption of permanent residence in the UK brings with it once again taxation on a worldwide basis. For example, the fact that your assets have been accumulated wholly during your period overseas will not prevent the Inland Revenue from claiming up to 40 per cent of them in IHT when you die. Is this fair? Or has our national familiarity with expatriates bred, if not contempt, then perhaps a failure to consider the benefits they bring to the nation?

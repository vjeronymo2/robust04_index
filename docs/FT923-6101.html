			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures dive STERLING cash and futures prices discounted a full percentage point rise in base rates yesterday after the pound came close to touching its ERM floor against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Short sterling futures dived again in the early afternoon as the pound touched DM2.7860, less than a pfennig from its ERM floor. News of an opinion poll showing that a majority of French will vote against the Maastricht treaty next month worsened spirits. The September contract fell 22 basis points from its previous close, to 88.98. The December contract dipped 26 basis points from its previous close to a low of 89.00. Volumes were very high, at over 50,000 lots. In the sterling cash market, period rates firmed even further. Three-month money rose to 10 7/8 per cent on the offered side from its previous close of 10 13/16 per cent. All period rates from six-months out closed at 11 per cent on the offered side for the first time. The one-year rate had previously finished at 10 7/8 per cent. Several dealers suggested that the British government may have missed its chance to turn the market by not lifting interest rates yesterday. 'If they raise rates to 11 per cent tomorrow, they will find that the market is already lending money at that figure,' said one dealer. 'Eleven per cent base rates may not be enough to save the pound.' The only relief appeared to be in the Eurodeutschmark futures market, which rose on hopes of a cut in short-term German interest rates. At one stage, the September contract was up 3 basis points from its opening level at 90.39. The Bank of England was highly accommodating in its operations, dealing in all four bands and the repurchase agreement (repo) at the rates established on Monday. The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m. In the morning, it bought Pounds 50m of Band 2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 15m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 2m of Band 3 LA bills, Pounds 184m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 9m of Band 4 LA bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 226m of Band 4 bank bills. Later the Bank bought Pounds 5m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 69m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds 252m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 3m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds 145m in Band 4 bank bills, and Pounds 60m in the repo.</p>

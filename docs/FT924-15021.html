			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Tax filibuster upsets legislative timetable THE US Senate was yesterday struggling to tie up legislative loose ends before going into recess ahead of next month's election. After delivering a stinging rebuke to President George Bush on Monday night by overriding his veto of legislation to re-regulate the cable television industry, the Senate timetable was derailed by a lengthy filibuster of a Dollars 27bn tax and urban aid bill. The bill, which proposes the creation of 59 new enterprise zones and a package of individual and corporate tax breaks, was held up in a one-man 'talkathon' by New York Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato, seeking to add to the bill protection for workers faced with job losses in his home state. 'I'm just getting my second wind,' the senator declared to an almost deserted Senate yesterday morning after holding the floor virtually throughout the night. After trying to delay the recess until he got his way, Mr D'Amato withdrew yesterday afternoon having learned the House had adjourned, scuppering chances of the full Congress considering his amendment. Earlier, both houses had voted by the more than two-thirds majorities required to overturn Mr Bush's veto of cable television legislation, which allows the Federal Communications Commission to set 'reasonable' rates for basic cable services. Mr Bush said yesterday the override, the first of his presidency after 35 successful vetoes, was a result of the television networks ganging up against the cable industry. Asked if the defeat would hurt Mr Bush's chances of re-election, his Democratic rival Governor Bill Clinton replied: 'It won't do him any good.' It was unclear yesterday if Mr Bush would seek to veto the tax bill. While Mr Bush approves of many of its provisions, he is unhappy with technical changes, such as increased payments required of those individuals and corporations who file quarterly estimated tax payments, which could be construed as tax increases. The delay to the bill also held up senators' consideration of a House-Senate compromise bill aimed at encouraging the use of alternative fuels and boosting energy conservation. Majority leader George Mitchell said the Senate would sit until Monday if need be to finish its work. On Monday both houses gave final approval to a Dollars 14bn foreign aid bill, which includes Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees for Israel and Dollars 417m in aid for the former Soviet republics.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Argentine economy shows 6% growth Argentina's economy expanded by 6 per cent in 1993, its third consecutive year of strong growth since Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, made the peso convertible and began his market-oriented reforms in early 1991. Gross domestic product expanded to Dollars 255.33bn, making Argentina the region's wealthiest country, with income per head of Dollars 7,800 (Pounds 5,340), according to figures this week. However, private economists expect growth to decelerate to about 3.5-4 per cent this year, thanks mainly to a reduction in the foreign capital inflows that have driven the economy ahead since 1991. Capital inflows are expected to fall to Dollars 10bn from Dollars 17.61bn last year. Argentina's low investment rate is alarming private economists. Although investment rose by one-eighth over the previous year, at 18.4 per cent of GDP it is still low by international standards. Investment at the height of Argentina's hyperinflation crisis in 1989-90 averaged 15 per cent of GDP. A European banker commented: 'Investors and businessmen have been burnt so often in the past that they are unwilling to take risks now.' Growth came mainly from privatised utilities, the construction industry and the financial sector. Manufacturing industry rose 4.5 per cent, while agriculture - which produces two-thirds of Argentina's exports - fell 1 per cent. Concern continues to grow over Argentina's poor savings rate and its heavy reliance on foreign capital. Last year's savings rate edged up to 16 per cent of GDP; consumption rose by one-fifth, to 83.5 per cent. Argentina's trade deficit is also deteriorating rapidly. The 1993 deficit of Dollars 3.7bn is expected to rise by one-third this year to Dollars 5bn.</p>

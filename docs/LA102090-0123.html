			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE APPROVES ROCKWELL CLEANUP FUNDS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE $11.8 MILLION WOULD BE SPENT TO REMOVE CHEMICAL AND  RADIOACTIVE RESIDUES, UPGRADE POLLUTION CONTROLS AND TEST GROUND WATER. SENATE  PASSAGE APPEARS LIKELY.  </P> <P> The cleanup of radioactive and chemical contamination at Rockwell International  facilities west of Chatsworth will likely receive about $11.8 million in the  next fiscal year in an energy and water spending bill approved Friday by the  House of Representatives.  </P> <P> The figure represents the full sum proposed for the fiscal year that began Oct.  1 under the Department of Energy's six-year, $37.3-million plan to clean up the  site.  </P> <P> The department will use the funds to remove chemical and radioactive  contamination, found mostly at low levels in soil and buildings, and to upgrade  pollution controls on equipment at Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory.  </P> <P> Some of the funds also will be spent on ground-water testing at Rockwell's De  Soto Avenue plant in Canoga Park, where the firm has handled chemicals and, in  the past, conducted nuclear operations, including the manufacture of nuclear  fuel.  </P> <P> Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), whose 21st District includes the field  laboratory, said he is pleased with the funding levels and vowed to continue  his efforts to ensure that the cleanup continues on schedule, press secretary  John Frith said.  </P> <P> "At this point, everything looks good," Frith said.  </P> <P> The energy and water bill, negotiated by a House and Senate conference  committee last week, contains a total of $3.15 billion for Department of Energy  environmental restoration and waste management projects nationwide.  </P> <P> This includes defense as well as non-defense facilities.  </P> <P> The bill does not break down projected spending for individual sites, but Frith  said that energy officials indicated that the overall funds in the measure  would permit them to allocate all of the funds proposed for the Rockwell  cleanup.  </P> <P> The Department of Energy had initially projected $9.8 million in the next  fiscal year for the 25 separate Rockwell projects in the West San Fernando  Valley, but increased the figure to $11.8 million when President Bush submitted  his proposed 1991 budget to Congress.  </P> <P> The measure is expected to be passed by the Senate and sent to Bush for his  signature in the next week.  </P></p>

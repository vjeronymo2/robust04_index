			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Early this morning, Colombia and Great Britain  signed an agreement to promote and protect investments, just as  the "24 Hours" newscast has already mentioned in an exclusive  report.    The article on compensation, which had originally delayed  the  signing of the agreement eight months ago, now reads as follows:    Principle of expropriation with just, adequate, and  effective  compensation -- by virtue of this principle acknowledged by the  Constitution, the state will not expropriate, unless it is of  public or social interest, foreign capital investments in a  discriminatory manner or without previously paying fair,  adequate, and effective compensation.    According to some experts, this article runs against the  spirit of Article 58 of the national Constitution, according to  which there can be special compensations for the sake of equity.  Nevertheless, in the agreement signed today in London, Colombia  promised to always pay compensation. Despite changes made to  the article that had prompted Britain's original refusal to sign  the accord, there still places in which it contradicts the  national Constitution. These contradictions likely will come up  when the Constitutional Court and Congress review the agreement.    [Begin recording of constitutional expert Luis Carlos  Sachica] A fair, effective, and adequate compensation might turn  out to be completely different from what the Constitution says  considers prior compensation -- compensation in which the  interests of both the community and the affected parties are  taken into consideration. [end recording]    The new agreement basically seeks to protect the interests  of  British investors.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent opens the week on a quieter note BOURSES had a quieter day after last week's excitements, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT overturned early losses to close at a new six-month high, but weakness in banks and carmakers kept its gains within bounds. The DAX index ended 5.79 higher at 1,647.16. Turnover was reported to be low compared with Friday's DM9.9bn. Siemens stood out with a gain of DM10.50 to DM635.20, its highest close since mid-July. Last week Robert Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation for the electricals major, with qualifications about the speed and extent of measures which it is taking to improve its competitiveness. Volkswagen dropped by DM2.80 to DM291.70 as analysts said that there is bad news to come. In banks, following last week's gains on interest rate sensitivity, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein each shed DM2.70, to DM415.30 and DM432.70 respectively. The day's biggest mover was Lufthansa, up DM4.50 or 3.7 per cent to DM113.50 on newspaper reports of talks with Europe's largest tour operator, Touristik Union International, over combining the two companies' air tour operations. PARIS concentrated on Eurotunnel after reports in the local press that a settlement in its dispute with the contractor, TransManche Link, was imminent. The shares improved by FFr1.20 to FFr38.85 in heavy volume of 3.5m shares. The CAC-40 index, however, lost 3.45 to 1,904.73, off the day's high of 1,915.41. Cap Gemini Sogeti was another big riser, gaining FFr10.30 or 6.5 per cent to FFr169.50 in spite of France Telecom denying reports that it was negotiating to take a stake in the computer services group. Axa slipped by FFr43, or 3.6 per cent to FFr1,142 on speculation that it might announce a rights issue today. MILAN opened strongly but some corporate blackspots trimmed the market's advance later in the day, and the Comit index finished 4.91 higher at 509.12. Foreigners remained active buyers, particularly of telecommunications stocks after Friday's confirmation that the government planned to reorganise the sector. Sip added L51 to close at L1,715 before trading up to L1,728 after hours and Stet rose L75 to L2,345. Montedison gained L16 to L1,257 on continued buying sparked by last week's news of negotiations with Sweden's Kabi. Italmobiliare and its Italcementi subsidiary were both marked down after worse than expected results late on Friday from the former's French unit, Ciments Francais, and weekend newspaper reports that another Pesenti group company had been mentioned in investigations into bribes paid to political parties. Italmobiliare closed L345 higher at L38,320 but sank to L36,500 after hours and Italcementi fell L270 to L8,893. AMSTERDAM was strong in the major blue chips with Royal Dutch gaining Fl 2.40 to Fl 156.10 and Akzo Fl 1.60 higher at Fl 143.00. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.3 to 98.0. There was no respite for KLM and Fokker although Dasa indicated that it still hoped to complete a deal with the latter on taking a 51 per cent stake: the shares slipped Fl 1.30 and 20 cents respectively to Fl 26.70 and Fl 10.40. Disappointing provisional 1992 results from paper and packaging groups KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG, which announced late last year that they were to merge, had varying effects on the shares: KNO lost 40 cents to Fl 29.60, Buhrmann-Tetterode shed 70 cents to Fl 29.40 while VRG gained 60 cents to Fl 23.60. ZURICH ended a quiet day slightly firmer. The SMI index closed 3.6 higher at 2,137.2. Among industrials, bearers in cement producer Holderbank, the most active stock, rose SFr6 to SFr594 following recent recommendations by brokers. Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers jumped SFr39 to SFr490. Last week the Swiss government said 60 training aircraft ordered by South Africa from Oerlikon's Pilatus subsidiary were not regarded as arms, and were therefore not subject to an export embargo. ISTANBUL resumed its upward trend and the 75-share index advanced 191.33 or 4.1 per cent to 4,863.15 after profit-taking on Friday left the market 3 per cent weaker. ATHENS continued its impressive upward surge with the general index adding 32.56 to 833.63, a 24 per cent rise since the start of the year. Analysts point to lower inflation and the prospect of cuts in domestic interest rates as underpinning the market, which will also benefit from the expected strong performance of the agriculture and tourism sectors this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 8                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open      10.30     11.00     12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1130.16   1129.09   1129.16   1130.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1189.79   1189.65   1188.94   1188.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                1129.52   1113.35   1097.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                1189.21   1183.60   1171.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 13.00     14.00     15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1131.53   1132.43   1131.62   1131.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1190.38   1192.90   1191.05   1190.15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Feb 2     Feb 1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                1089.43   1088.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                1155.59   1158.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1133.09 ; 200 -  1193.14 Low/day: 100 -  1128.87  200 -  1187.61  .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Lib Dems seek to stand out as a distinct option MR PADDY ASHDOWN yes-terday tried to clear a distinct pitch for his party by lam-basting the Labour and Tory manifestos equally. Significantly, however, he gave a cautious welcome to Labour's stance on constitutional reform. Mr Ashdown acknowledged that Labour's pledge to enhance its Plant committee report on electoral reform was a positive step. The Liberal Democrats would take part in a formal inquiry into alternative systems, he said, as long as legislation was guaranteed. However, Labour's commitment to proportional representation in its manifesto was 'gift-wrapped fudge'. Mr Ashdown continued to insist on PR as the prerequisite for his party's support in a hung parliament. He refused to accept that could mean a pact only with Labour. 'As the Tory party faces the reality of defeat, they will be accommodating these sorts of ideas,' he said. Labour was closer to accepting reality, he believed. The Liberal Democrat party supports the single-transferable vote system of PR but Mr Ashdown hinted that he might accept the German additional-member system where proportionality is ensured by topping up the parliamentary strengths of parties from lists. It has ruled out the alternative-vote system. The Liberal Democrats are trying to set themselves apart from Labour so that the party is not seen merely as a soft alternative to Labour. They realise that a strong Labour showing in opinion polls would send some wavering Tories back to the fold because of fears of a Labour government. That would harm Liberal Democrat chances in the party's target seats. Mr Ashdown said Labour's manifesto was 'particularly disappointing' because of its timidity. 'If they were writing the New Testament, they would be saying the meek can inherit the earth as resources allow.' Speaking on a tour of Essex and the Midlands, he added that the Labour and Conservative manifestos were virtually interchangeable. Neither passed the 'hope test' or was sufficiently tough on tackling the recession, education and the environment. 'Only the Liberal Democrats have published a manifesto of fresh ideas, with hope for the future,' he said.</p>

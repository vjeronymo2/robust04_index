			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GIRL WHO FELL FROM SEAWALL IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION;  </P> <P> ACCIDENTS: THE CERRITOS CHILD RECOVERS FROM HEAD INJURIES AND CUTS AFTER  FALLING DURING A FAMILY OUTING ON ANACAPA ISLAND.  </P> <P> What was supposed to be a camping adventure on one of the Channel Islands  turned into a vacation nightmare for the family of an 8-year-old Cerritos girl  who fell off a seawall while looking at sea birds.  </P> <P> Maryanne Duarte fell 15 feet and landed on rocks on Anacapa Island Friday, said  her father Carl, 36, who witnessed the accident.  </P> <P> Maryanne was reported in satisfactory condition Saturday after suffering head  injuries and cuts on her left arm and leg, said a nursing supervisor at St.  John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard.  </P> <P> "It has not been a good trip," Duarte said. On the day of his daughter's  accident, she cut her hand on a knife.  </P> <P> Then Duarte's 64-year-old father, Manuel, panicked and fell, breaking his leg,  after seeing the child tumble off the wall.  </P> <P> Maryanne, described by her father as somewhat of a tomboy, was on her way back  to shore after her first camping trip to Anacapa Island when the accident  occurred.  </P> <P> Maryanne, her sister, grandfather and father were waiting for a National Park  Service boat to return them to shore when they saw brown pelicans, Duarte said.  </P> <P> "I was climbing over a lot of things. When I was at the top, I fell," Maryanne  said from her hospital bed Saturday. "My dad was there. He said the whole thing  went so fast."  </P> <P> National Park Service rangers administered first aid to the girl until a Coast  Guard helicopter from Los Angeles arrived and took her to the hospital, Petty  Officer Scott Wassermann said.  </P> <P> Duarte said park rangers and Coast Guard officials worked quickly to help  Maryanne. Coast Guard officials later called to inquire about her health.  </P> <P> "Everyone kind of worked together. . . ." Duarte said. "One of the park rangers  was a paramedic. He was taking all of her vital signs, and I was freaking out  all this time."  </P> <P> Duarte blamed himself for the accident.  </P> <P> He said he was leading his two daughters over the seawall to get a closer look  at the birds when Maryanne slipped.  </P> <P> She fell over a series of jagged rocks and finally landed about three or four  feet from the water, Duarte said.  </P> <P> In addition to the cuts and bruises, Maryanne suffered a slight cut on her  liver and must avoid rigorous activity for about 1 1/2 months, he said.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to get away from it all," said Duarte, a certified public  accountant.  </P> <P> "This was an excursion that turned into a nightmare."  </P> <P> Despite the accident, Duarte said he plans to take his daughters on another  camping trip to Santa Cruz Island later this fall. On that trip he plans to  take precautions.  </P> <P> Maryanne "is a muscular little kid. She likes to do different things. She's not  too afraid of anything," he said.  </P> <P> But next time, he added, "I'm going to have her tied to a rope."  </P></p>

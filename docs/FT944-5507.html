			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Motorola may buy Digital plant Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer group, said yesterday that Motorola, the US electronics group, had expressed interest in buying its semiconductor plant in South Queensferry near Edinburgh. Digital said: 'Our responsibility is to evaluate any proposal that the company receives concerning its assets, and we are currently involved in that process.' In the UK, Motorola confirmed that the company was involved in talks with Digital, and that the only plant mentioned in the discussions was the South Queensferry site. However Motorola said it would be 'inappropriate' to say more about the discussions at this stage. The South Queensferry plant, which opened in 1990, makes Digital's high-powered Alpha microprocessors for use in the group's personal computers and workstations. Digital, which recently completed a Pounds 65m expansion of its facilities at South Queensferry, agreed earlier this year to manufacture microprocessors at the plant for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the US company which is a rival to Intel, the leading US microprocessor manufacturer. At the time there were strong suggestions that Digital might be considering selling the plant to AMD. However Mr Vincenzo Damiani, Digital's European president, said then that it was unlikely the semi-conductor operations would be sold. Motorola also produces semiconductors in its plant at East Kilbride which are used as microcontrollers in cellular telephones, fax machines, engine controllers and smart cards. In September Motorola announced a Pounds 250m expansion of the East Kilbride facility to cope with rising worldwide demand. The expansion will be the third, and by far the biggest, that the company has made at East Kilbride in the past three years. It manufactures cellular telephone equipment at another plant in Scotland at Easter Inch near Bathgate. In contrast, Digital announced its third restructuring in two years in July, involving the loss of 20,000 jobs and increasing its net losses for the year to Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.34bn).</p>

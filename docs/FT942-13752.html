			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Aid agencies unhappy with decision in Rwanda Private aid agencies reacted bitterly yesterday to a decision to slash the UN peacekeeping force in Rwanda, saying it was sure to cause 'suffering on an enormous scale,' AP reports from Nairobi. 'We are appalled at the hypocrisy of the international community,' said Abiy Hailu of Christian Aid, a London-based charity. The UN Security Council, powerless to stop tribal warfare in the country, decided on Thursday to reduce the peacekeeping force in the capital, Kigali, to 270 security guards and military observers.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Anagen sees first orders for AuraFlex Anagen, the lossmaking diagnostic equipment company, yesterday predicted that sales should start to outweigh its development costs by 1996. Although pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 1.99m in the six months to June 30, the company said it expected next year to win its first orders for AuraFlex, its automated immunoassay system that detects infertility and thyroid deficiency in blood samples. Turnover, however, fell from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 483,000 as there were no first half marketing payments from Organon Teknika, the Akzo Nobel subsidiary which will manufacture and distribute the system. Mr Mervyn Sennett, chief executive, blamed the shortfall for increased operating losses of Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 1.34m). Organon Teknika is expected to pay Anagen a further Pounds 1m in the next 12 months, but Mr Sennett said it was impossible to predict exactly when hospitals using the system on trial would place firm orders. 'Our fortunes very much depend on AuraFlex,' he added. The company, which raised Pounds 14.3m from its flotation last year, has invested more than Pounds 20m on the system since 1989 and now has about Pounds 6m cash left. 'We've been burning cash to meet development costs but we do not expect to require more funds,' said Mr Sennett. 'Our reserves will see us through to positive cashflow.' Losses per share fell from 6.7p to 4.3p, reflecting last year's placing at 100p. The shares, which fell sharply in July but recovered slightly last week, fell 4p at 59p.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Markets: The opium of the chattering classes - London Ever since Kenneth Clarke was pushed centre stage in The Tories, an everyday story of Westminster folk, traders in the equity market have been confidently expecting an interest rate cut. Playing the part of a softhearted-but-plain-speaking Midlands' son of toil, the chancellor seemed certain to boost the soap opera's flagging ratings with some well timed relief for hard-pressed homeowners and grim-faced industrialists. Yet the summer came and went, the party conference season passed. Equity-watchers never lost faith that Clarke would eventually remember his lines. On Tuesday the market finally got what it wanted, with a half-point cut in base rates to 5 1/2 per cent, though the suspense had rather been spoiled by the long wait. As a result the FT-SE 100 index actually fell by 1.3 points on the day and only rose by 3.4 points through the week to finish at 3111.4. The muted response perhaps reflected fears that the interest rate cut was only part of the story. Would the sequel - 'Budget II - the next generation' prove a real tear-jerker? Opinions were divided. Astute TV addicts pointed out that in conventional plots the happy ending follows the sad scene, and that the rate cut was authorised because the inflation outlook was good. And since the fall was only half a percentage point, the budget might well prove to be less savage than feared. By the end of the week the market consensus was that perhaps only Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn of extra taxes would be raised. That encouraged hopes that the pattern of recent budgets, where equities rose in anticipation of the speech and fell in response, might be reversed. Elsewhere in the television jungle there was plenty of chatter. On Wednesday Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, finally agreed to allow ITV companies to own two franchises, intensifying the speculation about who was about to buy what. The move is intended to improve the efficiency of ITV companies by removing some duplicated costs. Now, apart from forbidding the merger of the two London stations, it is open season. Once the legislation is passed Granada is widely tipped to bid for LWT, and Carlton might have a tilt at Central. Then again, Central is rumoured to be eyeing Anglia which may also be on the receiving end of Meridian's attentions. MAI, which owns a majority stake in Meridian, is also supposed to be looking at buying HTV. The confused can perhaps take refuge with Yorkshire Tyne Tees, which, since it already owns two franchises, is about the only company which is probably safe. Dinner table conversation in Hampstead, never knowingly understated, reached fever pitch as the permutations proliferated. Another group apparently intent on turning a drama into a crisis was Opec, which met in Vienna this week. Despite the recent weakness in the price of crude oil, the cartel did not agree to cut production and oil prices tumbled to a five- year low of Dollars 14.50 a barrel on Friday. Adjusted for inflation crude oil is now almost back to the low point reached in 1986, and only marginally above the real price it traded at before the first oil shock of 1973-74. JR Ewing and Dallas fell victim to the last bear market, so would Opec follow this time? Those of a depressive disposition were busily writing the cartel out of the series: a weakened Opec laid low by increasingly efficient Western production and the strains of reducing oil incomes. The less apocalyptic script is that Opec was not prepared to be bullied into output cuts by the market when the degree of overproduction was so small. A few more chilly weeks in Western Europe might be all it needed to bring the market back into balance and pull the crude price back above Dollars 16 a barrel. Share prices of the large integrated oil companies held up on the assumption that the crude price weakness was temporary. There was, however, some selling yesterday by those US investors who returned to their phones after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. Over the week, Shell slipped 9p to 678p and BP 8p to 333p. Exploration companies, which do not have refining businesses to offset the falling oil price, fared worse. Lasmo fell 16p to 117p, and Enterprise 19p to 437p. The price of petrol has not thus far been a notable casualty. Still, it was not all gloom in the energy business. Half year figures from PowerGen and Scottish Power proved that privatisation is good for you. Having cut staff costs immediately after it was floated PowerGen is now running down its coal stocks and releasing cash. Scottish Power has taken advantage of the cheaper coal deal negotiated by the English generators to cut its own bill from British Coal. The threat of referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission still hangs over the English generating companies. That will probably curb the market's enthusiasm over the next few weeks but, in spite of the share price rise since flotation, many think the electricity companies still look attractive. Undoubtedly the star of the week was Peter Wood, the founder of Direct Line insurance, who has taken the motor insurance industry by storm since 1985. Under his profit-linked pay package he received a bonus of Pounds 18m. He also took a Pounds 24m payment to buy out his contract which had come to embarrass both Wood and Royal Bank of Scotland, the owner of Direct Line. Now the reluctant hero is to buy some Royal Bank shares, and fund managers concluded that if they were good enough for him, they were good enough for them too. The shares rose 14p to 384p. Wood is, apparently, a workaholic, which brings to mind J P Getty's recipe for success: get up early, work hard, and strike oil. These days it seems insurance, rather than oil, is the place to be.</p>

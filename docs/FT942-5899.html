			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Pehr pressure Six months after his 23-year rule over Volvo collapsed, we are still in the dark about Pehr Gyllenhammar's precise role in the final days up to the Volvo management and shareholder revolt against his plan to merge with Renault. But yesterday he decided to give a sneak preview, through a letter sent to the chairman of the Swedish parliament's constitutional committee. Before the fateful board meeting on December 2, according to the letter, PG was uncertain if the merger would be torn up. Such was the 'drama' surrounding the affair, he says, that his position as chairman was neither 'the only nor the best source of information' on the outcome. Instead he refers - somewhat darkly - to 'powerful interests' who decided to dump the project. The constitutional committee has stirred controversy by suggesting that a cabinet minister - Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister for European affairs, whose company profited from trading in Volvo shares at the time - may have had inside knowledge from briefings Gyllenhammar gave the government on the affair that the merger was doomed. So what did happen, PG?</p>

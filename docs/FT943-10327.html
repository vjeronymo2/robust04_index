			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Allied Irish interested in buying UK building society Allied Irish Banks yesterday signalled its interest in either buying a UK building society or adding to its US retail bank, as it disclosed a 13.6 per cent rise in half-year pre-tax profits to from IPounds 142.3m to IPounds 161.7m (Pounds 159.6m). It said it wanted to buy an institution with between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn of assets in the UK or US. 'Our pool of capital would allow us to move quickly without upsetting our shareholders,' said Mr Neil Dean, chief financial officer. Mr Hugh Feeley, general manager for Britain, said that the purchase of a building society would give AIB a stronger UK brand name, and would allow it to use IPounds 1bn surplus retail deposits from Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. The bank raised its interim dividend by 12 per cent to 4.6p (4.1p). Earnings per share rose by only 5.3 per cent to 14p (13.3p) due to dilution from US preference share issues by it and First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary. Income was flat at IPounds 599.7m (IPounds 600m), falling 1.9 per cent at constant exchange rates, and expenses rose by 6.4 per cent to IPounds 393.5m (IPounds 370m). But provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 43 per cent to IPounds 43.3m (IPounds 75.7m). The recovery in Ireland started to produce higher loan demand, with total loans and advances to customers rising by 1.7 per cent to IPounds 11.8bn. But this was offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin to 4.12 per cent (4.49 per cent). Mr Dean said Irish loans were now growing at an annualised rate of 10 per cent, a trend it expected to be sustained. 'It augurs very well for growth in Ireland, while the UK is not yet at the starting gates of loan growth,' he said. Income from sources other than lending fell to IPounds 185.3m (IPounds 191.1m), with growth in fees partly offsetting a IPounds 15m loss (IPounds 26m profit) on securities and foreign exchange dealing when it wrongly anticipated falls in European interest rates. Capital ratios strengthened to a 5.1 ratio of equity to assets (4.6 per cent), and a tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.1 per cent (7.1 per cent). Mr Dean said the bank did not consider itself over-capitalised. COMMENT AIB's home market has solid loan growth and low inflation, a position UK clearing banks might envy. It is pinning its hopes on income growth - perhaps augmented by acquisition - rather than cost control. Having solved UK problems, it has potential in all its main markets. But the net income fall in the first half shows how margin pressures can offset volume growth. The risk of a poor acquisition is also to be borne in mind. The shares closed at 261p, giving a prospective multiple of about 8. That is not expensive for a bank with growth prospects, even if it is verging on the over-ambitious.</p>

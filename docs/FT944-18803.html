			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Gold regains some of its glitter - Kenneth Gooding examines why the price has moved back towards Dollars 400 Gold bulls must be cursing Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke. Last weekend, he suggested that the International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold, which earns no interest, and use the proceeds to help heavily-indebted poor countries. Clarke's unhelpful remarks came at a time when gold had been making a determined move towards Dollars 400 a troy ounce, a level it reached briefly just over a year ago, and when the market was getting over its fear that big sales from central bank hoards would crush the gold price again. The latest rally started in August when a number of US financial organisations, familiar faces in the market, started to buy gold in an aggressive - but carefully controlled - manner obviously intended to drive the price towards the Dollars 400 level. If anyone asked about their renewed interest in gold, the reasons also sounded very familiar: they said US interest rates were going up and worries about global inflation were spreading. Various financial instruments were sold to investors on the strength of the rally and a great deal of money will be made if the gold price goes above Dollars 400 and stays there for any reasonable length of time. 'There is a huge, collective wish for the price to go through Dollars 400,' says Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. Smith says the gold market has changed dramatically from the heady days of the late 1970s and early 1980s when investors in the rich western countries were buying physical gold. Today, most physical gold-buying comes from the Middle East and the Far East, markets that are much more sensitive to price changes. Nor, says Smith, is the market mood the same as in the early months of last year when speculative activity was backed by a surge in physical gold-buying because the price had dropped to Dollars 330 and the metal was perceived to be cheap. The best that can be said about demand for physical gold at present is that it remains steady. The Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy organisation reported in its latest market update that, in contrast to the strong start in 1993, estimates for the first half of this year implied that gold fabricators (mainly jewellery makers) had bought 12 per cent less metal, or 1,400 tonnes.  This is slightly misleading, however, because of exceptionally heavy demand in the first quarter of 1993, with China at the forefront. GFMS, which is backed financially by some big gold producers, summed up by saying: 'The prospects for gold look very delicately balanced, and a good argument can be made for suggesting that the price will break out of the recent trading range, either on the upside or the downside, depending on the interplay between wealth creation, inflation, interest rates and, finally, perceptions about gold's fundamentals.' Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, says he is sceptical about a 'break out on the upside' being sustainable for long. And he is puzzled by suggestions that inflation will push the gold price ever upwards. 'History does not show that happening, nor does an objective reading of likely trends in real interest rates in coming months,' says Arnold. 'For gold to perform really well in an inflationary environment, one would have to have negative rates of return on money and a desire on the part of investors to physically buy and hold gold. 'I can't see a return to this situation in the foreseeable future.' What the gold bulls seem to overlook, adds Arnold, is that 'major structural changes in both supply and demand have reduced the volatility of the gold market. Both supply and demand now respond much quicker to a given price rise than in the past.' One accessible route into gold for private investors is through a unit or investment trust. 'Gold has been a very unfashionable investment,' says Julian Baring, fund manager of Mercury Gold and General, the top-performing commodity unit trust in the five, three and two years to August 1 (HSW, offer-to-bid; net income re-invested). 'But if you compare the performance of gold against US shares, it would not take much of a fall in the Dow Jones index or a rise in the gold price to break a 13-year bear trend.'</p>

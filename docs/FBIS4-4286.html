			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Bloody fighting erupted  this afternoon in the town of Omran, north of the capital Sanaa,  between northern and southern Yemeni forces, informed sources  told XINHUA here today.    The sources said the fighting between the Third Brigade of  the south stationed there and the First Brigade of the north  claimed a number of deaths and injuries.    This was the fifth clash between northern and southern  troops  since February 21, one day after the feuding president, 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, and the vice-president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  signed their reconciliation accord in Amman.    The fighting took place after President Salih warned that  "anyone trying to disrupt Yemen's unity and its national ranks  will pay a dear price."    He called on the entire Yemeni people to remain vigilant  against "separatists and powers opposed to the unity of Yemen."    He call was made at a mass rally held in Sanaa to  commemorate  the first anniversary of Yemen's multiparty general elections.    The Yemeni president, who heads the General People's  Congress, accused leaders of the Yemen Socialist Party headed by  Al-Bid of shuttling in some Arab capitals to raise funds for the  purchase of mines and guns with the aim of "aborting the process  of unity and democracy."    Vice President Al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad, one of the  Socialist Party's leaders had recently visited Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait and some other Gulf states.    North and South Yemen merged in May 1990 to form the United  Republic of Yemen.    The political crisis developed last August when Vice  President Al-Bid returned to Aden, capital of the former South  Yemen and refused to return to Sanaa.    The two men were said to have sharp policy differences over  a  number of key issues of the Republic.    The crisis has continued despite repeated Arab mediation  efforts to reconcile the two parties and end the feud.    Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tried to arrange a  reconciliation conference between Salih and Al-Bid. Jordan and  Oman previously arranged such meetings but failed to bridge  their differences.    A joint Omani, Jordanian, American and French military  commission formed at the end of February to prevent military  clashes in Yemen have called for restraint by both sides.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Regardless of the pros  and cons over the country's biggest business group entering the  automaking industry, Samsung Heavy Industries is moving fast  toward that goal by striking a deal with Japan's Nissan Motor Co.    Samsung, announcing a contract to adopt Nissan automaking  technology Thursday, said its cars -- intended strictly for  export -- will be patterned after three new 2-liter models made  by Nissan. It plans to notify the Trade, Industry, and Energy  Ministry of its agreement with the Japanese automaker as soon as  possible.    Immediately after the announcement, Assistant Minister Pak  Sam- kyu said his ministry will scrutinize the contract to  determine whether it complies with related laws when Samsung  submits a technology-import application. Although it looks fine  at first glance, the announcement was made by the concerned  company and may be different when studied from a legal  viewpoint, he told reporters.    Under the contract, Nissan will transfer technology on its  latest cars and jointly develop Korean models, as well as  provide engineering assistance to localize the cars and know-how  on running production lines. The two agreed to set no limits on  export lines for Samsung and to give the Korean company full  rights to change auto parts and design. The absence of limits on  export lines and design changes is unprecedented in Korea's  history of technology importation, a Samsung official said.    The key points to their agreement are that Samsung will have  its own car brand and independently choose overseas markets,  acquire the latest Nissan technologies including its unique VQ  engine and QT suspension, and exchange information on sales,  marketing and after- sales service.    In return, Samsung is to pay Nissan 1.9 billion yen (14.3  billion won, or 17.7 million U.S. dollars) in royalties plus 1.6  percent to 1.9 percent of the price of every warehouse release  in technology fees. Moreover, it will pay 6.76 billion yen (50.7  billion won) in delivery and technology fees for the three new  models in order to acquire full authority over their sales in  overseas markets.    Samsung had also been looking at Toyota of Japan and  Volkswagen of Germany, but chose Nissan after it accepted most  of Samsung's proposals. Nissan, with annual production capacity  of 2.81 million cars and turnover of 27.4 trillion won last  year, is the world's fifth biggest automaker after General  Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Toyota.    Samsung was drawn by Nissan's world-class technology and its  willingness to fully transfer advanced technologies. Samsung,  which jumped into truck-making just last year, expects to start  with 50,000 units in its first production year, the official  said. It pledges to more than fulfill the 70-percent guideline  set for localization to become a representative Korean exporter.</p>

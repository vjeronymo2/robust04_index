			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / China posts Dollars 170m trade surplus China posted a Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m) trade surplus in August, the first after more than a year of deficit, Chinese customs officials said yesterday. The General Administration of Customs put the success down to the elimination of the two-tiered foreign exchange system this year, according to the official English language China Daily. In January, China moved to a single currency by eliminating Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC), which were traded to foreigners in exchange for hard currency at a rate of Yn5.8 to the US dollar. The regular currency traded at Yn8.7 to the US dollar. After three years of trade surpluses, China recorded a Dollars 12.18bn trade deficit in 1993 as economic growth of 13 per cent fuelled imports of oil, steel, machinery, aircraft, cars and electronic goods. The government did not report exact figures for imports and exports in August but said the Dollars 170m surplus was a marked improvement over the Dollars 70m deficit of July and reflected new momentum in exports. Government and western economists had not expected the currency switch to forestall another trade deficit for China in 1994, because of rising prices and a continuing economic boom, but customs officials reported that the yuan's effective devaluation had made Chinese exports more competitive and imports costlier. For the first eight months of 1994 exports surged 31.5 per cent to Dollars 68.95bn and imports climbed 18.3 per cent to Dollars 68.85bn. Total foreign trade volume rose 24.6 per cent to Dollars 137.8bn through August.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Indian bank chiefs face securities fraud probe THE Indian government is pursuing possible fraud charges against senior executives of state owned banks involved in a securities trading scandal. Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, told the Indian parliament yesterday that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had been asked to examine trading in bankers' receipts by State Bank of India, the largest of the state owned banks, as well as by National Housing Bank and United Commercial Bank. Bankers' receipts are promissory notes issued by banks to register the transfer of government securities. Senior government officials said yesterday that bogus paper had been traded and that the police had been called in to pursue fraud charges. Funds from trading in bankers receipts were syphoned into the stock market and helped fuel the recent share price boom. The Bombay Stock Exchange index - which has fallen 18 per cent over the last two weeks - slid a further 237.95 to 3,420.05 in nervous trading. Institutions were reported to have intervened to stabilise prices. Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, confirmed that several officials of the three banks had been suspended or asked to take immediate leave. Apart from MH Pherwani, who resigned as chairman of National Housing Bank on Saturday, Mr K Margabandhu, chairman of United Commercial Bank, and Mr CL Khemani, deputy managing director of State Bank of India, have also been asked to take leave. Among others under investigation is Mr Harshad Mehta, a prominent Bombay broker and a leading 'bull' on the market who was recently forced to settle outstanding accounts with State Bank for Rs6.2bn (Pounds 120m). The Reserve Bank governor yesterday used a gathering with bankers to ask them to establish banks' total exposure in what is being described as India's worst financial scandal. Bankers informally say that banks' exposure to irregularities in the securities market could be Rs30bn-Rs40bn. Dr Singh told parliament that the Reserve Bank had established a prima facie case against the three banks named in the securities scandal.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Drugs chief sees need for change AN OLIVE branch was held out to the US administration yesterday by Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of the Anglo-American drugs company SmithKline Beecham. He called for a new social contract between the pharmaceutical industry and society. 'We must show President Clinton and his first lady the economic benefits of using pharmaceuticals. We must show our customers - those that pay for drugs  -that they are good value,' he said. 'We need acts not words. Part of that involves keeping down prices,' he told the last day of the FT pharmaceuticals conference in London. The industry had reacted too slowly to concerns about pricing by relying on national trade associations, Mr Wendt said. These found it easiest to defend the status quo. Senior executives had not shown sufficient leadership. 'We are at the eleventh hour and the 59th minute.' The US administration is scheduled to announce its healthcare reforms on May 1. The first lady, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, is heading the White House task force on the issue. Last month President Bill Clinton said he had been shocked by the cost of medicines and the amount the drugs groups spent on marketing and advertising. Mr Wendt admitted that company promises to limit average increases in drug prices to the inflation rate had been ambiguous. Some medicine prices had risen more than inflation, even if a group's average price had not. Drugs groups would have to look at their cost base, said Mr Wendt. His company was looking at every aspect of its business. He urged the industry to improve a tarnished image that made it an easy target for politicians. The industry had to regain society's trust. 'Our industry now ranks close to the bottom in most opinion surveys in terms of perceived social responsibility and contribution to the common good. . . . We must exclude less than honourable behaviour. . . . there should be an end to financial inducements to doctors.' He called for a new rigorous marketing code that could stamp out abuses on a worldwide basis. In order to prove the cost-benefit of drugs, he suggested international cost-effectiveness trials run by third parties.</p>

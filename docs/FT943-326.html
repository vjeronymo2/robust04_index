			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fed decision encourages recovery in blue chips - Market report The decision by the Federal Reserve to leave its key interest rates unchanged touched off the expected technical rally in the UK stock market yesterday. Led forward by firmness in bond markets and by a spectacular return to a premium on the December stock index future contract, equities rebounded sharply, closing just under the best of the day after Wall Street opened the new session with a further gain of 20 Dow points. There was no great increase in trading volume, however. Share gains were mostly moderate, but there were market hints of impending bid moves in the pharmaceuticals and insurance sectors. After touching 3,039.3 in early dealings, the FT-SE 100-share Index trod water for most of the day, rallying to close at 3,038.7, a net 30.2 higher on the session. A substantial rise in durable goods orders in the US, while not taken entirely at face value in London, indicated further strengthening in the US economy. The Fed's decision against a rate change left markets to continue worrying about the timing and direction of global interest rates, with today's meeting of the Bundesbank at the top of the list of concerns. Some analysts argued that the impending elections in both Germany and the US may render their respective central banks less anxious to act on interest rates for the time being. Two relatively small trading programmes were reported, perhaps linked to the strong upswing in stock index futures which spurred activity in the blue chip sectors. The broader market was also firm, albeit less active. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index regained 16.3 of its recent loss to close at 3,533.8. Seaq-reported trading volume increased only slightly, from 545m shares on Tuesday to 575.5m yesterday. Non-Footsie trading made up around 58 per cent of the day's total, a relatively high percentage and an indication that some private investors may have re-entered the market. Retail, or genuine customer, business in UK equities returned a value total of Pounds 1.38bn on Tuesday, confirming once again the presence of the big institutions, which are believed to have been sellers of stock during the recent shakeout. Dealers believed that, barring any unexpected move by the Bundesbank today, the recovery in the London stock market has further to run. The outlook for company profits and dividends is thought to have turned less confident, however, and there is some uncertainty as to how far the Footsie can run before the year-end, and whether it can meet the more optimistic of the forecasts from City analysts. The brighter mood in equities, which was also buttressed by the outcome of the auction of Pounds 2bn of British government securities, brought the focus back on to individual stocks, rather than to factors influencing investors across the full range of the market. Not all were favourable. Wellcome met selling pressure in spite of the company's assurances that it had taken steps to meet comments from the US Federal Drug Administration. Most other blue chip dollar-influenced stocks performed well, however. Among the consumer and retail sectors, which have taken a pounding over the past week, store shares were generally firmer; the dull spot being Sears, which was still upset by the half-time trading report. Banking stocks moved higher with the market. But analysts were wary of suggesting that the stock market had made a genuine and lasting recovery from the weakness of the past fortnight. Friday afternoon will see the end of the third quarter of the year, and the next two trading days could well bring some window-dressing operations by professional fund managers.</p>

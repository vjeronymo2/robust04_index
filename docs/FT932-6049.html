			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Headline to acquire Hodder &amp; Stoughton HEADLINE Book Publishing, the fast growing British publishing group, has agreed to buy Hodder &amp; Stoughton, the general and educational publisher. The deal, which will be announced formally next week, will make Headline, founded by Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson in 1986, the second largest British independent publisher after Macmillan. The acquisition will represent an enormous step forward for Headline, which specialises in popular commercial publishing. The company is taking over a privately owned publisher much larger than itself. Headline had a turnover of Pounds 15.7m in the year to December 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.05m, a rise of 68 per cent. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, which publishes both fiction and non-fiction in hardback and mass market paperbacks through Coronet, New English Library and Sceptre, had lower margins. In the year to June 1992 the company had a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.05m on a turnover of Pounds 55m. In the six months to December, however, earning levels increased with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.76m on sales of Pounds 30.7m. On Tuesday Headline asked for its shares to be suspended at 290p because negotiations on a substantial acquisition were at an advanced stage. In fact, the deal with the family-owned Hodder &amp; Stoughton has already been agreed, and the final legal details are being worked out pending the announcement. Neither Mr Hely Hutchinson of Headline nor Mr Philip Attenborough, chief executive of Hodder &amp; Stoughton, were available for comment. It is not clear whether Headline plans to integrate its large acquisition, with implications for jobs, or to run it as a stand alone enterprise. Hodder &amp; Stoughton has had a difficult time in recent years. In 1990, for example, the company increased sales by 4 per cent to more than Pounds 60m but the pre-tax profit was only Pounds 850,000. The company also lost one of its most popular and profitable authors, Jeffrey Archer. Current Hodder titles include Elizabeth Longford's The Future of the Monarchy and Morgan, the new biography of the novelist EM Forster. The company is also about to publish a new Le Carre novel. Headline, which last year bought Bookpoint, a book distributor, has shown steady growth in turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per share over the past five years. Pre-tax profits have grown from Pounds 104,000 in 1988 to their current Pounds 2.03m, while earnings per share have risen from 1.8p in 1988 to 11.9p last year. Headline has tended to discover and develop its own authors rather than paying large advances to established writers. One of its best known authors is, perhaps, Ellis Peters.</p>

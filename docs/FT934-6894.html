			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Chalker hardens line over aid to Serbs The government yesterday warned the Serbs that they risked air strikes and a withdrawal of humanitarian aid unless they were prepared to make territorial concessions to the Muslims in Bosnia. Baroness Chalker, Foreign Office minister, told the Lords: 'If there is no breakthrough in the discussions in Geneva next Monday and the lack of co-operation persists, parties must understand that the humanitarian commitment from the world at large will not continue indefinitely. 'The onus is now on the Serbs to make further territorial concessions to meet the Muslim demands in the Geneva talks.' Speaking during the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech, Lady Chalker declared: 'The Bosnian Serbs are being pressed hard. They understand that if they resume the strangulation of Sarajevo, they face the prospect of air strikes. 'And sanctions on Serbia mean that Belgrade also faces a bleak winter, not only the Muslims in central Bosnia.' Her comments appear to underline a hardening of the government's position over Bosnia. Last week Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned the warring factions in Bosnia that they could not expect humanitarian aid to continue indefinitely if there was no progress towards peace. And Lord Owen, peace envoy in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday reiterated his view that the world community would have to decide how long it could sustain intervention in Bosnia. Lady Chalker was speaking after a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, at which Mr Hurd made clear that sanctions could not be relaxed without some territorial concessions by the Serbs and Croats. She said: 'There may be in the future a possible suspension of sanctions, but there is a need first for territorial concessions.' She warned that hundreds of thousands of lives were at risk from the bitter winter. Some 2,700,000 Bosnians were reliant on humanitarian aid, with more and more becoming dependent as the weather deteriorated. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has again written to Mr Hurd to press the need for opening Tuzla Airport as a vital point of entry for supplies into central Bosnia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation between  the Russian Federation and the European Union (EU) is  practically ready for signing. On June 23 after the document is  coordinated in all ten languages of the contracting parties, it  will be initialled by the heads of the delegations participating  in the talks, the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic  Relations told Interfax.    The signing ceremony will take place in the Church of Saint  George on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24 at 10:00 in the  morning. The agreement will be signed by the Russian president  and the EU leadership.    Deputy Chief of the Department of Multilateral Cooperation  under the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations Maksim  Medvedkov stressed that it had taken two years of tense talks to  complete the agreement.    For instance, the unwillingness of the EU to improve the  conditions for Russian goods entering its markets was quite a  problem. Discord concerning export of Russian uranium and  activities of EU banks in Russia also hampered the talks.    The present talks helped to resolve these issues in general.    The agreement provides for mutual application of the basic  principles of GATT in trade with certain exception made for  nuclear materials on which a separate agreement will be  concluded by 1997.    A total of five EU banks which were given authorization for  operations with Russian residents but failing to use it due to a  presidential decree restricting activities of foreign banks  issued in November, 1993, will be given their rights back.    In what concerns other banks, during the period of  transition  Russia will keep the right to apply to them certain restrictions  defined by the agreement. In particular, the agreement said  that the share of foreign capital in the banking system of  Russia must not exceed 12 pct. The restrictions also concern  the number of branches of foreign banks and their right for  operations with residents.    Medvedkov stressed that the agreement on partnership and  cooperation between Russia and the EU provided for gradual  integration of the Russian economy with the single European  economic space. The principles used within the scope of the EU  for the free movement of goods, capital and services and of  establishment of companies and their activities, will be step by  step implemented in the countries which have joined the  agreement.    The EU is the biggest economic partner for Russia. The share  of the trade turnover with the EU is 35 pct of Russia's trade  turnover with the far abroad. The share of the EU in Russian  export is 36 pct.</p>

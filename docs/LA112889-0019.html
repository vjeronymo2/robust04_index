			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READING  </P> <P> I glanced at test scores of schoolchildren in Los Angeles County and felt great  pain in my eyeballs. These youngsters represent the future of America. The  prospect fills me with despair.  </P> <P> Let me recommend my solution -- a revolutionary reading program for the first  12 grades of school. Every student would be required to read at least 10 books  during the summer months in order to advance to the next grade level.  Validation of book reports would involve teacher and librarian cooperation.  </P> <P> Reading is the key to lifelong education. Benjamin Franklin and Abe Lincoln had  a total of four years of schooling between them, but they became readers, and  that made the difference.  </P> <P> In 12 summers each student will have read at least 120 books. Result: vastly  improved ratings in writing, spelling and other areas. In three years, Los  Angeles students will zoom up to mediocrity; in eight years they will breathe  the rarefied air of top quartile in nationwide tests.  </P> <P> If this program sounds too radical for the school system, then let one  innovative school principal try to experiment and lead the way.  </P> <P> GEORGE W. FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

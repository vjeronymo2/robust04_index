			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Mining Supplies prospects improve Mining &amp; Allied Supplies saw its pre-tax profit fall substantially from Pounds 281,000 to Pounds 41,000 in the year ended September 30 1992, but there were some signs of improvement. Mr Daniel Slabbert said he believed the increased level of sales experienced over the last two months was an indication that the worst was now past. Price rises by principal manufacturers of products distributed by the group could lead to increased profitability, he added. Anti-Friction Components, the distributor of bearing and power transmission components acquired in September, will form the cornerstone of growth in the UK in 1993. After a tax credit, earnings per share were unchanged at 0.5p, and those are wholly distributed as a maintained dividend. Extraordinary charges of Pounds 150,000 represented the closing of the fabrication division.</p>

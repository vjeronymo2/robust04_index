			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINES DRAWN IN 'MISS SAIGON' DISPUTE  </P> <P> Hopefully, Charlton Heston's comments in Counterpunch (Aug. 13) were a failed  attempt at prose and not the "obscene racist drivel" he accuses Actors' Equity  of in its attempt to reconcile the "Miss Saigon" affair.  </P> <P> He says, "Thousands of years ago, when blacks roved innocent in the African  rain forests and Jews reigned remote in their desert redoubts, actors were  wandering around Europe. . . ."  </P> <P> Centuries ago and presumably today Heston has us divided and categorized  incorrectly.  </P> <P> According to him, there were blacks, Jews and then there were actors.  </P> <P> Heston paints a clear picture of what we are all up against and the underlying  reasons the "Miss Saigon" controversy has erupted.  </P> <P> Incidentally, Mr. Heston, blacks are not a minority in the world. Nor did  actors spring to their feet full formed on the streets of Europe. All actors  have their roots in those tribal societies you mock in your opening statement.  </P> <P> ALFRE WOODARD  </P> <P> Member, Actors' Equity, Screen  </P> <P> Actors Guild, American Federation of TV &amp; Radio Artists, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Arco Announces Test Results: Atlantic Richfield announced that a test oil well  on Alaska's North Slope confirmed the presence of a "promising" amount of oil  in a field about two miles from Prudhoe Bay. The test well produced as much as  5,350 barrels of oil per day, more than twice the 2,500 barrels per day from a  well drilled late last year. Spokesman Al Greenstein would not speculate on the  size of the field until results come from another test well now being drilled.  The field was first announced by Arco and partners Exxon and BP Exploration in  February.  </P></p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Oman 'investigating motives' of 200 dissidents Authorities in Oman are investigating the motives of more than 200 dissidents, detained on sedition charges, having acknowledged the arrest of members of a 'secret organisation using the Islamic faith as a mask for arousing sedition and splitting national unity for which the Omani Moslem society is blessed'. Many detainees have been released; the rest will be tried. The government's six-week delay before announcing the arrests reflects its sensitivity over the existence of any dissension in a country remarkable for its cohesion and stability in the 24 years since Sultan Qaboos came to power. Among those detained were four employees of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), whose oil and gas exports provide nearly 80 per cent of annual state income; and two under-secretaries in the agriculture and commerce ministries. Since the beginning of this year, diplomats and businessmen in Muscat have commented on the rise of Islamic activism, particularly among Oman's youth who have drawn their inspiration, but not necessarily money, from a variety of sources including radical Islamic groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Diplomats and businessmen have suggested dissent may be related to the lifestyle of the elite and a rising number of unemployed school-leavers and university graduates. The economy this year has suffered from low oil prices and the weakness of the dollar in which oil payments are denominated, combined with a strong yen, 10 per cent budget cuts and spending which is heavily imbalanced in favour of current spending on defence and civil ministries. For example, the government share in PDO capital expenditure last year was only 7.5 per cent of total spending, and the same ratio exists this year, whereas capital equipment now on order for the armed forces is twice that proportion. Oman's privatisation programme and its attempt to attract private foreign investors is still in its infancy. Some Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn)-Dollars 5bn is conservatively reckoned to be held abroad. But this money will not return until more investment opportunities are created.</p>

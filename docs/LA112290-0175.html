			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER STRUGGLES FOR EDUCATION  </P> <P> Ask Melinda Nunez about the last four years and she will recount a textbook  case of teen-age motherhood.  </P> <P> No school. No money. No clue.  </P> <P> Melinda's story began early in ninth grade upon learning that she was pregnant  with her now-3-year-old daughter, Nina.  </P> <P> "I was a virgin. I never thought I was going to do anything until I got  married," she recalls. A month after becoming involved with the baby's father,  she was pregnant.  </P> <P> Three months later she dropped out of junior high after balking at her physical  education teacher's insistence that she play touch football.  </P> <P> Spurred on by her high school-dropout father, who told her "you gotta break the  chain," Melinda tried to go back to school after giving birth.  </P> <P> But it's hard to be a good student, she found, on the amount of sleep that a  mother of a wakeful infant gets.  </P> <P> "It wasn't perfect because I was up all night," she said.  </P> <P> Lacking infant care, Melinda also tried home study. "There's a pile of books on  the table and there's the soap operas. What are you going to choose? The soap  operas."  </P> <P> By her own account, the young mother also tried drugs, losing custody of Nina  to her great-grandmother when someone told social service workers.  </P> <P> After drug testing, parenting classes with the baby's father, Scott Ueda, and a  year of proving themselves, Melinda regained custody of Nina, a victory of  which she is proud.  </P> <P> She unabashedly presents her copy of a social worker's report she was once  ashamed to  </P> <P> show anyone. "I've proven them wrong," she said.  </P> <P> Time, meanwhile, marched on. Nina has gone from womb to preschool. Scott  graduated from high school on time and is a student at Santa Monica College.  But "mommy" is barely out of the ninth grade.  </P> <P> Now that Nina is in preschool three days a week, and with financial help from  Scott, Melinda is back at Venice High's Phoenix Continuation School, with a  target graduation date of 1992.  </P> <P> "He graduated on time, but he didn't have as much responsibility as I did,"  said Melinda. "He could always say, 'Here's the baby,' "  </P> <P> Unlike most of their peers, Melinda and Scott's relationship has apparently  survived teen-age parenthood and they plan to marry, she said.  </P> <P> The caption beside a snapshot of "Nina's third Christmas" reveals the family  history in a few spare statistics:  </P> <P> Nina: 2 years, 6 months  </P> <P> Mommy: 17 years, 8 months  </P> <P> Daddy: 18 years, 10 months.  </P> <P> "The reason we're still together is because we're growing up together," Melinda  said.  </P></p>

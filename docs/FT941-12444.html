			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Books: A constant chorus of disapproval - The fate of unconventional women in Victorian fiction FALLEN WOMEN IN THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY NOVEL by Tom Winnifrith Macmillan/St Martin's Press Pounds 35, 178 pages The serialisation of Middlemarch on BBC-2 currently in progress has focussed the attention of the nation on the position of young women in Victorian society. Tom Winnifrith's study of Fallen Women in the Nineteenth-Century Novel is a timely exposition of not only George Eliot's but of the other major Victorian novelists' concern with the problem of women making something of their lives other than as adjuncts to men. In Victorian Britain 'fallen woman' was a way of referring to a woman who had eloped and lived in sin with a lover (as George Eliot did) and/or who bore a child outside of wedlock. Winnifrith finds several among the heroines and villainnesses of Austen, Bronte, Thackeray, Dickens, Hardy as well as in George Eliot. Clare Tomalin's recent study The Invisible Woman showed how closely the notion was ingrained in the life of Dickens let alone his fiction. Winnifrith contrasts the crude punitive view of the fallen woman in a novel such as the highly popular East Lynne by Mrs Henry Wood with the sensitive attitude of George Eliot to, say, Maggie Tulliver mistakenly accused of eloping in The Mill on the Floss. 'Maggie's failings (he writes) fade into insignificance when compared with those of the society that condemns her. She is technically innocent, but feels herself guilty and tries to make amends for her guilt. Eliot was technically guilty, but felt herself innocent . . .' In her Prelude to Middlemarch Eliot lamented the lack of a convenient yardstick by which to make moral judgments about women. 'If she said' wryly, 'there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than anyone would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure and the favourite love-stories in prose or verse'. Gillian Beer, in her Darwin's Plots (1983) seized on the word 'variation' in that passage and pointed out that it is one of the key-terms in The Origin of Species which George Eliot read when it appeared in 1859, 13 years before she began to write 'Miss Brooke', the first part of Middlemarch. Beer's interpretation of the novel as an example of 'evolutionary narrative' hinges on vastly more than the coincidence of a single term; but one effect of the television serial is to support her account by giving us a compelling image of the Darwinian 'complex interdependency' of life in Middlemarch. Eliot apologised to her publisher George Blackwood for Middlemarch's excessive length but said it was essential to bring out the complexity of her project. Seeing it week by week enables us to experience it in the way it was given to its first readers. Like so many of the great Victorian novels it was published first in instalments - in Blackwood's Magazine, 1871-2. Eliot was engaged in writing the final parts while the earlier ones were being serialised. Two ladies who were avid readers came up to her and one, she tells us, said 'How could you let Dorothea marry that Casaubon?'. The other, 'Oh, I understand her doing that, but why did you let her marry the other fellow (Ladislaw) whom I cannot bear?'. Winnifrith points out that this public acclaim had an inhibiting effect on Victorian novelists. They had to cope with a censorious Mrs Grundy who had total sway over what could and could not be described. Frankness about sex was completely forbidden. Part of the fascination of Winnifrith's study is his uncovering of the hidden sexual agenda below the surface, from clues planted in the texts of the novels. On television this can be done by the camera. In part two of the serial, for example, there was a scene where Anthony Page showed us Dorothea (Juliet Aubrey) and Casaubon (Patrick Malahide) in bed together - a scene no Victorian novelist could ever describe directly. She looks thoughtful, puzzled, disappointed. He sleeps lightly. She turns and kisses him on the brow. He makes no response except one of faint disturbance and dislike. The crucial fact about Casaubon is his impotence. He is intellectually impotent but also sexually impotent. This is indicated in a number of ways that Winnifrith attempts to decode. One of the earthier minor characters, Mrs Cadwallader, describes Casaubon as a 'great bladder for dried peas to rattle in'; among similar descriptions there is a punning clue in the name of Casaubon's parish. It is called Lowick - a reference to the limp male member. In Middlemarch there are hints of illegitimacy but no real fallen women. Dorothea's problem is that her vast creative energy and capacity for life is cruelly frustrated by her marriages. But from Lydia Bennet, the eloper in Pride and Prejudice, to Hardy's Tess the field is large and Winnifrith shows how greatly attitudes changed to fallen women during the eight decades that we call the Victorian period. My only reservation about his book is that it is at times too compressed for comfort. Winnifrith might well have extended his study to the Edwardian era when the fallen woman had such a dazzling career on the London stage in plays like A Woman of No Importance and The Second Mrs Tanqueray. In this manifestation she survived until the early 1950s. Her final appearance was as Hester Collyer in Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea where she escapes ultimate suicide, the fate of so many of her Victorian sisters. Hester's survival was thanks to some neighbours, one in particular who was a dab-hand at psychotherapy. We have reached the modern period.</p>

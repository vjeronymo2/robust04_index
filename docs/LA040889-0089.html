			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARTNERSHIP TO BUY GARDENA POKER CLUB  </P> <P> The Horseshoe Club, one of Gardena's three poker clubs, is being sold to a  partnership headed by the former president of the Commerce Casino, who said he  plans to close the club temporarily for extensive remodeling.  </P> <P> Herbert Stern, former president of a group of investor-owners at the Commerce  Casino, is a general partner of the newly formed limited partnership that has  made an agreement to purchase the 42-year-old club. Escrow on the property is  scheduled to close in mid-April, Stern said.  </P> <P> Stern said the new owners will spend $4 million on the purchase, which includes  the building and three-acre site at Vermont and Rosecrans avenues. They will  invest another $4 million to modernize the club, which he described as  "well-worn."  </P> <P> Although the group is looking for additional investors, Stern said the  partnership has sufficient financing to complete the purchase and needs only  city and state approval of its applications for gaming licenses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditional Approval  </P> <P> Mike Broderick, manager of the gaming registration program in the state  attorney general's office in Sacramento, said Stern and a partner, Leonard  Baum, have already received conditional approval for a state license to operate  the Horseshoe Club.  </P> <P> Conditional approval is given when applicants have submitted a complete  application and passed a cursory background check, Broderick said. Applicants  must also pass a more thorough investigation, including employment and  financial background checks and Federal Bureau of Investigation checks,  Broderick said.  </P> <P> Before a state license is issued, the prospective owners must receive a permit  from city officials, Broderick said.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth Landau said Gardena is conducting a separate investigation  of the partnership's application for a gambling permit from the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extensive Renovations  </P> <P> If the deal goes through, the Horseshoe will be closed for about three weeks  during expansion and renovation, including removal of walls and redecoration of  the main gaming room as well as the club's coffee shop and dining room, Stern  said. Other decorating changes will be done while the club is open, including  new carpeting, ceilings, chairs and gaming tables, he said. All of the work  should be completed by August, he said.  </P> <P> After the renovations, the buyers plan to expand the club's 250-employee work  force, Stern said.  </P> <P> "We want to give it a face lift," Stern said. The changes "will make it more  comfortable for the players and consequently we hope we can attract more  business."  </P> <P> With monthly revenues averaging about $400,000, the Horseshoe Club is the least  profitable of the city's three clubs, which together earn about $2.3 million a  month, city records indicate.  </P> <P> The Normandie Club is the most profitable, followed by the Eldorado Club.  </P> <P> The three clubs provided $3.7 million in revenue to the city from taxes and  licensing fees in fiscal year 1987-88.  </P> <P> The Horseshoe Club was established in 1947 and has been owned since 1951 by a  limited partnership of about 100 investors, said club spokesman Milt Corwin,  general partner of the selling partnership.  </P> <P> Corwin would not disclose details of the group's original investment or return.  He said the group was "interested in selling because the active partners are up  in years and wanted to step down."  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Travel agent finds tax 'discrepancies' Reiseburo Kuoni, the Swiss travel agency group, is in discussions with the UK Inland Revenue about 'discrepancies' dating back to the late 1970s. Mr Peter Oes, chief executive, said yesterday he expected the investigations to be completed by the autumn. The company is believed to have approached the Inland Revenue and launched its own investigation using an external auditor after discovering the tax problems. A spokesman for Kuoni said no provision had been made for the charge in its 1993 accounts, and any additional tax payments would be shown in the 1994 results. He said the company would probably announce the amount as soon as the investigation was complete, especially if it would have a material effect on the year's results. Mr Oes forecast that net income this year would reach a record. Net income last year slipped to SFr44.7m (Dollars 30.8m) from SFr49.9m in 1992. Kuoni is one of Europe's largest agents with revenues last year of SFr2.4bn. Domestic business accounts for nearly half of company revenue.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Smoke signals emerge on EC tobacco curbs The marketing and advertising world has received an unexpected boost from Jacques Delors, the EC president. In the past, Delors has been associated with threats to impose tight, EC-wide restrictions on many areas of advertising and marketing. But rather a different message came across at a meeting this month between Delors and the European Publishers' Council (EPC), which groups 19 leading newspaper and magazine publishers across Europe. The most sensitive issue is proposed legislation to ban tobacco advertising throughout the EC. Health ministers, meeting in May, are expected to reject the plan although the outcome could be different if Britain has a Labour government by then. Curbs on tobacco promotion were originally expected to be followed by a ban on alcohol advertising. Further legislation, threatening the advertising and marketing of financial services, food labelling, motor vehicles, distance selling, data protection and children's toys, has been pending. But in London, Delors told the EPC: 'There is no question of tobacco today, other areas tomorrow . . . Tobacco is a special case.' Delors added that 'subsidiarity will be used more and more, and the EC will intervene less and less'. The British Advertising Association believes that Delors has been persuaded that self-regulation in line with national and cultural differences within the EC member states is preferable to a blanket drive to harmonise legislation throughout the Community. However, the association remains cautious. Richard Wade, director general, said: 'It will be interesting to see whether the new approach is applied to directives at present being formulated.' Among the most important is the directive on data protection, which as it stands could eliminate many of the direct marketing activities currently conducted in the UK.</p>

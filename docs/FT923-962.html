			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: IBM keeps open mind International Business Machines, acknowledging that some of its big customers are 'downsizing' from mainframe computers to open systems networks, is to make its mainframe- class transaction processing software available for use on high-performance IBM computer workstations. The announcement marks a significant shift for the world's largest mainframe computer maker and reflects the new level of freedom that has been accorded to IBM business units to compete among themselves to provide customers with the best possible computing solutions. Transaction processing involves the use of computer systems to collect, process and update quickly and accurately online information such as customer purchase records or bank account statements. This area is traditionally the stronghold of IBM mainframe computers. However, many IBM mainframe users are now looking to add open systems computing networks, including Unix systems, as a cost-effective alternative to expanding mainframe systems, IBM acknowledged. Previously, according to competitors, IBM has only reluctantly offered its computer workstations to commercial customers, instead proposing mainframe or minicomputer-based systems for 'mission critical' business applications. With computer workstations, originally aimed at scientific and technical applications, now being used increasingly by commercial customers such as airlines, banks and insurance companies, IBM has shifted its stance. 'IBM intends to be a leader in the fast-growing open systems transaction processing market,' said Bill Filip, IBM vice president and president of the advanced workstations division, announcing two additions to the IBM RS/6000 line of workstation that offer performance improvement of more than 20 per cent.</p>

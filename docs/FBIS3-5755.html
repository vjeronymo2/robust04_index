"Reorganization is  an inevitable move facing the industry," said the official at  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined  to be named.    The comment followed a merger accord reached earlier in the  day between Sumitomo Cement Co., the fourth biggest cement maker  in Japan, and the eighth largest Osaka Cement Co., a move that  will create the nation's second largest cement maker with a  market share of about 18 percent.    The merger is expected to speed up the collapse of joint  sales alliances formed among Japan's cement makers a decade ago.  Of the five joint sales entities, two -- one led by Onoda  Cement Co. and the other by Ube Industries Ltd. and Chichibu  Cement Co. -- have already been dissolved. Another, led by  Sumitomo Cement Co., will be disbanded by the end of this month.    The latest move by Sumitomo and Osaka would lead to  extinction of one of the remaining two alliances -- the one led  by Nihon Cement Co. -- because Osaka belongs to the group.    The alliances were established as an exception to the  Antimonopoly Law under the MITI's strong administrative guidance  as part of the cement industry's streamlining efforts. But the  long recession in Japan has prompted business tie-ups beyond the  framework of the original alliances.    Mergers could have more cost-cutting effects than under the  alliances in which cement makers cooperated in such sales fields  as unification of product brands and distribution systems, the  MITI official said.</p>

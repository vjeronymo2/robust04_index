			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Digital introduces new workstations DIGITAL Equipment, the US minicomputer maker, aims to regain its momentum in the Dollars 10bn computer workstation market with new products based on its high-performance Alpha microprocessor that outpace similarly-priced competitors' machines. Digital has been losing ground in the workstation market for the past two years to Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. But analysts say the new products, which fill significant gaps in its Alpha product line launched in November, could represent a turning point. The group unveiled workstations in the Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 10,000 price range as well as a higher-performance model at Dollars 70,000. It also announced what it called 'workstation farms,' in which a series of fast workstations are linked to work on complex supercomputing tasks. The new products were the group's second wave of workstations based on its 64-bit Alpha microprocessor, which has established it as the front-runner in workstation performance. However, Digital still faces the challenge of building a base of software applications to take full advantage of its new computer architecture. Its first Alpha workstations were aimed primarily at software developers. The company claims, however, there are now 'several hundred' applications designed to run on Alpha computers. Digital also has another advantage up its sleeve. Microsoft, the leading computer software company, is developing a version of its soon to be introduced 'Windows NT' software to run on Digital's Alpha workstations.</p>

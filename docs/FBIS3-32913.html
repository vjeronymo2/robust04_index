He is the main suspect in the murder of  Perfecto Gutierrez, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party (PSD), which occurred in Managua last night. According to  police, the suspect, also known by the nickname "Gasparin," is  approximately 16 years old and has a criminal record.    Up to now, neither the government nor the main political  parties in the country, including the Sandinists, have condemned  the murder of Gutierrez, who was 36 years old, married, and had  three children. The politician, who was also an alternate PSD  deputy -- one of the seven parties in the National Opposition  Union -- was hit by two bullets and killed when, while  accompanied by a young woman, he was parking his vehicle near a  school in the center of Managua.    Nicaraguan Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar told  reporters "the crime is being investigated," and advanced the  theory that "everything seems to indicate" it was a common  crime. "It seems the reason for the crime was theft," Deputy  Minister Cesar stated. Cesar also belongs to the PSD, where  Gutierrez was the secretary general.    At noon today, the National Assembly paid posthumous homage  to the alternate legislator who was murdered last night, and  demanded that authorities solve the case. Adolfo Jarquin Ortel,  PSD president and deputy, stated: "We have not dismissed the  possibility that Gutierrez was murdered for political reasons."    Jarquin and Gutierrez assumed the PSD presidency and  secretary general's positions, respectively, after a PSD  disciplinary court suspended Guillermo Potoy and Alfredo Cesar,  respectively, from those posts.    Adolfo Jarquin heads the social democrat sector that favors  constitutional reforms in the parliament. Potoy and Cesar head  the faction that demands a constituent assembly. These  differences in the PSD caused a schism between Nicaraguan social  democrats. Leaflets have even appeared in Managua and other  Nicaraguan cities recently wherein alleged "recontras" (rearmed  former contras) accuse Jarquin's sector of being traitors.</p>

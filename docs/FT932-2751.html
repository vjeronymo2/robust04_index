			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / SE reviews cash settlement on BT THE LONDON Stock Exchange is preparing to back down on a scheme under which marketmakers in the shares of British Telecom would only publicly display dealing prices for those who wished to deal for cash settlement. The move follows an internal review by the stock exchange, which is believed to have been concerned about some of the technical aspects of the arrangement, which is unprecedented. Also, there is concern that its actions may inadvertently lead to the creation of a false market in BT shares. As a result of the internal discussions, the stock exchange has decided to put off until today a decision on whether it should recommend dealing for cash settlement in BT shares. It is believed that the exchange will continue to display the account settlement price on its Seaq screens, but will recommend that participants deal through marketmakers on a cash basis. A stock exchange canvas of the 18 registered marketmakers in BT shares showed that the most favour the move. However, some institutional investors have expressed alarm. Late yesterday, it emerged that the National Association of Pension Funds, the UK's largest shareholder group, is preparing to register its opposition to the move. Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the NAPF, said: 'We are seeking clarification and expressing the concern of our members to the chairman of the stock exchange.' The exchange, following a request from SG Warburg, global co-ordinator in the sale of the third tranche of the government's stake in BT, had earlier circulated a memo to marketmakers asking whether they wanted the stock exchange to recommend that all deals be for cash settlement. The move was intended to help discover quickly who had bought or sold BT shares. Dealings for cash settlement are known within 48 hours while under the account settlement system it takes two weeks. If account settlement prevailed, Warburg, which has said it intends to award higher allocations to those who had increased their BT stakes, could be generous to those who had in fact sold shares before the allocation date. Warburg had wanted the dealing prices placed by marketmakers on the Seaq price display screen to reflect the price for transactions for cash settlement. Those who wanted to deal for account settlement would have to call marketmakers to negotiate a price.</p>

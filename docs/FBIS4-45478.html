			<p>Lacking   <F P=102>   94WD0380A Lisbon PUBLICO in Portuguese 20 May 94 p 55 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0380A </F> <F P=104>  Lisbon PUBLICO </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese </F> CSO     [Text] The seizure of over 17 kg of heroin that occurred on  Tuesday night at the Portela airport in Lisbon prompted the  Criminal Investigations Police [PJ] to issue a communique. The  message deplores "the lack of cooperation on the part of the DGA  (General Customshouse Directorate) employees, who were unwilling  to intervene until PJ agents insisted, and after consultations  between the authorities present in the customs inspection area."    The communique distributed yesterday also notes that, "the  Criminal Investigations Police, after making insistent requests  of DGA personnel, who appeared reluctant to start inspecting  baggage because it was from a flight originating in European  space (Rotterdam)," ended up undertaking the largest heroin  seizure made in Portugal this year (17.380 kg).    After PUBLICO reported the seizure in yesterday's edition,  the heads of the Central Directorate for Narcotics Trafficking  Investigation (DCITE) called a press conference at which,  besides discussing the criticism of the DGA, reported that  another man linked to the trafficking network had been arrested.  The fourth person arrested in the course of the operation,  called "Clean Channels," is an individual from Porto, to whom  the drugs presumably were to be delivered.    The first three taken into custody were aged between 18 and  35 years, natives of Cape Verde, who arrived from Rotterdam, in  the Netherlands. They were supposed to deliver the heroin to  supply the Lisbon and Porto markets, according to a statement  made by the PJ's assistant general director, Gabriel Catarino.  <H5>  Sufficient Heroin for 268,000 Doses </H5>   The same official claimed that the confiscated drugs, with a  high degree of purity, would have been possible to distribute in  268,000 doses (the so-called "quarters," each weighing a quarter  of a gram).    The police expressed concern over the fact that the heroin  arrived "poorly packed," possibly indicating "that the  traffickers were so sure of not being caught that they didn't  even take any great precautions." The drugs, presumably from  Turkey, as was later revealed, were stored in four plastic  containers, some at the bottom of a suitcase, and another  wrapped in a bedspread.    The Criminal Investigations Police officials also commented  that "agents were at the airport since last Wednesday, watching  the flights arriving from Rotterdam," since there had been  indications that the three "couriers," all connected with the  traffic, were due to unload the drugs in Lisbon.    One of the individuals captured at Portela, although he has  a  fixed residence in the Netherlands, also owned a house in the  Lisbon area. A scale with traces of heroin, a grinder, and a  portable phone were found on those premises.    The Porto resident arrested is another person who was  already  under suspicion. All four were presented to the judge of the  Court of Criminal Proceedings yesterday. The Criminal  Investigations Police do not preclude the possibility that  further arrests may be made.</p>

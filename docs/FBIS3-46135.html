			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by unidentified XINHUA commentator: "Criminal </F> Hijackers of Aircraft Must Be Sternly Punished"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sun Xianlu, a criminal  who used violence to hijack a plane, was sentenced to life in  prison and was stripped of his political rights for life. He  deserves such a punishment.    For a while, some criminals have resorted to using violence  and terrorist acts to hijack Chinese civilian passenger aircraft  to Taiwan, thus seriously endangering aircraft passengers' lives  and property, jeopardizing flight safety, and creating  abominable influences on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as well  as throughout the world.    Hijacking civilian aircraft is a terrorist act that  seriously  threatens people's lives and safety. This kind of act is in  violation of Chinese law, and all countries and regions  throughout the world consider it a serious crime and impose  stern punishments on plane hijackers. International conventions  in this regard contain stipulations for dealing with plane  hijackings; all countries and regions of the world have the  obligation to crack down on aircraft hijackings.    Why have aircraft hijackings occurred so frequently across  the Taiwan Strait? By recalling the few aircraft hijackings  over the last few years, any person with a sense of justice and  without political prejudice can see that the reason why plane  hijackings have occurred so frequently is simply because of the  Taiwan authorities' connivance with and giving unprincipled  protection to hijackers. It is simply the Taiwan authorities'  giving unprincipled protection to aircraft hijackers that has  finally resulted in abominable consequences, and these  abominable consequences have not only brought suffering to some  mainland people but have also brought misfortune to some Taiwan  compatriots. On 2 October 1992, Jiang Xiaofeng attempted to  hijack a plane to Taiwan. This resulted in a disaster that  killed 128 people, including 30 Taiwan compatriots; that injured  53 people, and that destroyed three planes. Zhuo Changren and  his partners, who hijacked a plane to Korea in May 1983 and who  were later received by Taiwan, joined the black society in  Taiwan and kidnapped and killed a man, thus posing a danger to  the people in Taiwan. This incident also proves that aircraft  hijackings have also brought misfortune to Taiwan compatriots.    As for the issue of how mainland hijackers of aircraft are  treated, although the Taiwan authorities have changed their  attitude of considering plane hijackers to be "anticommunist  heroes" and have sentenced the criminals Huang Shugang and Liu  Baocai, who hijacked a plane to Taiwan on 6 April 1993, to 10  years in prison and have sentenced the plane hijackers Zhang  Wenlong, Yang Mingde, and Han Fengying to six to nine years in  prison; and although Taiwan's procuratorate has demanded that  some other mainland plane hijackers be sentenced to 12 years or  more in prison, these sentences, as has been pointed out by  Taiwan's media, are too lenient for such serious crimes, even  when using Taiwan's "law" as the criterion.    The Taiwan authorities' arguments for refusing to repatriate  plane hijackers not only cannot not hold water but also are  ridiculous. One of their arguments is the so-called  "humanitarian considerations." In fact, plane hijackers use  passengers as hostages in an attempt to serve their evil  purposes, thus seriously jeopardizing passengers' lives and  flight safety. Therefore, only the stern punishment of criminal  hijackers of aircraft can ensure passengers' safety, which is  truly humanitarian. Another thing is that, in dealing with  plane hijackers, the Taiwan authorities still focus on the  motive for the crime, thinking that, objectively speaking, the  hijackers' cases deserve sympathy. Actually, in a society ruled  by law, the decision concerning any crime should be strictly  based on the facts of the crime. Moreover, according to the  investigations conducted by our departments concerned and by the  Taiwan police, some criminal aircraft hijackers were people who  were on the run for embezzling public funds, some were habitual  gamblers who were on the run because of their inability to pay  their gambling debts, some were people who ran away from paying  their business debts, some were suspects in major burglaries,  and some were people who hoped to go to Taiwan to get rich and  enjoy themselves.    Not only some people with insight and the news media of  Taiwan have denounced all these practices of the Taiwan  authorities. Taiwan's police and procuratorial authorities, who  have handled the various plane hijackings, have also have been  bothered by the frequent hijackings and have openly suggested to  the Taiwan authorities that "plane hijackers be sent back to the  mainland after they are tried," saying that "otherwise, the evil  trend will never be stopped."    Our opinion is that to fundamentally solve the problem of  hijacking planes to Taiwan and to reduce aircraft hijackings to  the minimum or to completely prevent such incidents from  occurring, the most direct and effective way is for the Taiwan  authorities to repatriate and hand over all criminal hijackers  to the mainland. Here is something that is noteworthy: In their  working consultations, the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation have  reached a common understanding -- that is, plane hijackers  across the strait must be repatriated.    We hope that the Taiwan authorities will sincerely put aside  the political and legal problems that cannot be solved for the  time being and, with a pragmatic attitude, find a way that is  acceptable to both sides so that an agreement on repatriating  plane hijackers can be reached at an early date. We hope that  the Taiwan authorities will make practical efforts to thoroughly  prevent plane hijackings across the Taiwan Strait. Only by  doing so can the Taiwan authorities make themselves not guilty  both to history and to compatriots on both sides of the strait.</p>

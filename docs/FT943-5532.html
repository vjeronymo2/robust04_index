			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Pro-unionist MPs flex their muscles: Tory right For the moment they are mainly content to keep a watchful and suspicious eye on the progress of the UK-Irish peace initiative. But if events turn sour - as many of them fear they will - their misgivings could burst damagingly into the open. The large pro-unionist contingent in Conservative ranks will continue to exert a strong influence over Mr John Major in the aftermath of this week's open-ended IRA ceasefire. The need to ensure their tacit acceptance of the direction of government policy will be among the main factors shaping the prime minister's words and deeds in coming weeks. One area in which the views of the pro-unionist grouping could quickly influence the government's strategy is the vexed issue of whether the IRA ceasefire is permanent. Mr Jim Cran, Tory MP for Beverley, yesterday urged the government to take a hard line, saying ministers should insist that Sinn Fein uses the phrase 'a permanent renunciation of violence' in its amplifications of the IRA statement. 'All we have . . . is a sort of armistice,' Mr Cran added. In practice most Conservatives would probably fall into line once Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, let it be known that he was satisfied that the cessation of IRA violence was for good. Many pro-unionists still hold profound reservations about the prospect of government officials holding bilateral talks with Sinn Fein representatives. Earlier this week Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in a pamphlet written before the ceasefire that the country 'should be spared the sight of ministers of the Crown or their representatives sitting around the same table as men who until three months before were bombing our fellow countrymen'. Mr Lamont is expected to return to the subject of Ulster in a newspaper article this weekend. Ms Lisl Biggs-Davison, trustee of the Friends of the Union under whose imprimatur Mr Lamont's pamphlet appeared, said she would be 'terribly reluctant' for the government to talk with Sinn Fein. 'I want to know what will happen to the people who have carried out those terrible crimes,' she said. If pro-unionists do decide to make public their reservations about the course of events, next month's Conservative party conference will provide the perfect opportunity. Not only is there a debate on Northern Ireland, but a series of events is planned on the conference fringe. One pro-unionist said this week that Northern Ireland was destined to be 'the big issue in Bournemouth'. The expectation among most Tories is that unless the peace initiative goes badly off the rails Mr Major and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, are set to be applauded to the rafters for trying to end the violence. But the strength of the Tory pro-unionist faction should not be underestimated. The backbench Northern Ireland committee is firmly in pro-unionist hands, under the low-key but effective chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hunter, the MP for Basingstoke. Its influence in cabinet has also increased markedly with the promotion of Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, and Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief Treasury secretary, in the recent reshuffle.</p>

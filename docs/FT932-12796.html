			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Teachers' plea on testing rejected THE SIX unions representing school teachers in England and Wales yesterday united to urge Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to suspend the controversial national curriculum tests for 1993, John Willman writes. The unions called in a letter for the suspension of the tests pending the review of the national curriculum and testing by Sir Ron Dearing, newly-appointed chairman of the two government advisory bodies on school education. Mr Patten immediately dismissed the appeal as 'an extraordinary suggestion'. He said it would lead to the scrapping of the tests for seven-year-olds, now in their third year, in spite of 'overwhelming evidence that they are helping push up standards'. The appeal brought together the Professional Association of Teachers and the two headteachers' unions with the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers which is boycotting the tests. These were joined by the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, both of which are balloting members over a boycott. The appeal came as the government launched a Pounds 700,000 publicity campaign to win support for the national curriculum tests for schools in England and Wales.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Partners in grime - With western aid, the CIS keeps on smelting MR KARL Wobbe admits he seriously underestimated the ability of the Russian aluminium industry to keep production going against all the odds. 'At the begining of 1992 I thought their industry would collapse because of raw materials shortages,' he recalls. Instead, the Russian smelters managed to produce about 2.7m tonnes of aluminium last year, not too far away from the 1991 level. Traders came to the rescue with barter deals, offering necessary raw materials in exchange for aluminium which poured into western markets at an annual rate of about 1m tonnes. For example, Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals, says his company, which claims to be the biggest trader of CIS aluminium, helped 'kick-start' production at two smelters by providing cash to improve the flow of alumina, an essential raw material. Trans-World also invested in port facilities in the far east of Siberia. The ability of the canny western traders to keep things moving when faced with a variety of obstacles - language barriers, political uncertainties, civil strife and the lack of legal protection and insurance commonly available in the west - is impressive. There is also the problem of theft. 'Whole rail cars are uncoupled at night and simply disappear. A train with five cars might arrive at its destination with only two,' one trader reports. 'And with something like the Trans-Siberian Railway, you have enormous, unpopulated distances involved. It is very easy to offload something, pay off the engineers and sell it privately.' Shortages of spare parts, which weighed heavily on some other CIS industries, caused few problems. Ten of the 14 CIS smelters use outdated Soderberg technology and make their own spares when necessary. Ironically, the modern smelters were hit by spare parts shortages and Tadjikistan's smelter had to reduce output by 40 per cent last year. The influence of international traders on the CIS industry is not entirely to the liking of Mr Wobbe, management board director responsible for aluminium production at VAW of Germany. He says: 'Traders are not the right partners for the Russian aluminium industry. It should be the western aluminium producers. Producers have the know-how to help develop the internal CIS market - for packaging, for transport, for construction. It will take a long time, but the best partners for the Russians would be the western aluminium industry.' He points out that, until demand for aluminium in the CIS domestic market is revitalised, the smelters will go on producing for export and those exports will continue to depress international prices. Last year the CIS smelters delivered only 1.8m tonnes of aluminium to domestic customers, a sharp drop from the 2.6m in 1991. While chaotic conditions in the CIS and the virtual disappearance of military customers cut demand, the market could have taken more metal. The fish canning industries in Russia and the Ukraine complain that there is not enough available. Among other things, the metal is also used for canning caviar, one of the few Russian products that has instant appeal overseas. Aluminium has that same appeal. Russia and some other parts of the CIS can produce top-quality aluminium - much of it used to go into military and aerospace equipment - which is readily convertible into dollars. Smelter managers prefer to export to earn dollars instead of being paid by domestic customers in rapidly depreciating roubles. Their smelters are not just making metal - they provide the sole support for whole communities, including schools and hospitals. Dollars earned provide food, medicine and school books, not just smelter equipment. But the smelters are also tremendous polluters. If Russia actually enforced its environmental regulations, all its smelters would have to close. Yet the cost of moving to state-of-the-art smelting technology is prohibitive. VAW estimates that it would cost Dollars 6bn to install modern technology in just four of the 14 CIS smelters. The money for that kind of project is simply not available. However, another - much less costly - solution is emerging. Western companies have started to help the CIS industry to upgrade its old Soderberg smelters. For example, Kaiser Aluminum of the US is offering intermediate technology that costs only about Dollars 600 per tonne of installed capacity. Kaiser is working on a Dollars 50m project at the Krasnoyarsk smelter, covering 90,000 tonnes of capacity, and Mr Sam Manaktala, director of technical services of Kaiser's primary products division, says this aims to reduce fluoride emissions from 6.7kg a tonne of metal produced to 1.2 kg and to cut carbon emissions from 6 kg a tonne to under 1 kg. The government granted Kranoyarsk an export licence so that it could export free of tariffs enough aluminium to cover the cost. This project is scheduled to be completed in September next year. Kaiser also recently signed a protocol to carry out similar upgrading on one of the four production lines at the Irkutsk smelter in Siberia. Only three years ago there were ambitious plans to build a 130,000 tonnes a year smelter on a greenfield site near the Irkutsk plant which would also be modernised. But this would have cost Dollars 700m and Mr Manaktala says this project has been shelved until metal prices have risen to a level to make it viable and until economic conditions in Russian would make it possible to raise capital. Kaiser Engineers, the UK company which, confusingly, is no longer related to the US group but is part of ICF Kaiser, has been working on studies for the rehabilitation of smelters in Azerbaijan which use modern, pre-bake technology. Reynolds Metals, another US company, also has well-tried technology for improving the performance of Soderberg smelters. This technology is being offered by the Kumera Corporation, a Finnish group, which has five separate projects under way. Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, Kumera's chief executive, says the Reynolds' technology not only cuts pollution substantially - at one smelter 20 kg of emissions a tonne would be reduced to only 2 kg - it also saves energy. Reynolds itself is working with Fata, an Italian industrial group, and a Russian consortium on a downstream project to produce aluminium foil. VAW, meanwhile, has forged what Mr Wobbe describes as 'an excellent relationship' with the Novokuznetsk smelter in Siberia, 'which we will modernise in steps'. VAW is also attempting to set up joint ventures in the CIS to produce dedicated downstream products for dedicated markets. These products will have export potential because, as Mr Wobbe points out, the CIS industry still needs to export in order to earn hard currency for raw materials. 'We have to accept the Russian aluminium industry as an equal partner in the world industry, but this means it has to accept the rules of the free market,' he says. That will not be easy because there are political tensions between Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, and some smelter managers. But there have been recent signs that the CIS industry is willing to discuss with representatives of the European Community, the US and Canada some kind of international rationalisation of production capacity.</p>

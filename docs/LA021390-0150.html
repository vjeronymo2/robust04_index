			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FILOFAX HIT BY SLUMP IN DEMAND  </P> <P> Filofax, the British company that makes personal organizers for yuppies, has  been hit hard by a shopping slump and fading demand from business executives.  </P> <P> The paperback-sized binder, patented over 50 years ago by a shorthand typist,  won commercial success in the 1980s as a vital accessory for "yuppies" -- young  upwardly mobile professionals.  </P> <P> At the height of its success, Filofax Group PLC hailed the files, sold in more  than 30 countries, as "one of the great marketing phenomena of the 1980s."  </P> <P> But poor retail sales in Britain, the firm's biggest market, and a flood of  cheaper imitations have wiped out profits. Filofax Chairman David Collischon  said today that the company expects to record a loss for the second half of  1989.  </P> <P> Collischon said the company is partly a victim of its own success as the  executive market that helped cause the Filofax boom is now well supplied with  the built-to-last binders.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS;  </P> <P> FAILURE OF FLOODGATES TO AFFECT STOCKING OF INYO, MONO LAKES  </P> <P> Floodgates that control the water at the Department of Fish and Game's Black  Rock Hatchery in Mono County failed June 28, killing about 10 tons of  catchable-size rainbow trout, officials announced last Friday.  </P> <P> According to Keith Anderson, the DFG's Inland Fisheries Supervisor for Southern  California, the floodgates gave out, creating a disturbance in the raceways  containing the fish.  </P> <P> As a result, there will be a 10% reduction in the stocking of Inyo and Mono  lakes and streams for the remainder of the 1989 season.  </P> <P> "We will be stocking the same areas as planned, but with less fish," Anderson  said.  </P> <P> The DFG plans to issue a report on the incident next week.  </P> <P> A 165-foot ex-Coast Guard cutter will become Southern California's newest  artificial reef when it is sunk next Wednesday about 1 1/2 miles off the coast  of Mission Bay in San Diego.  </P> <P> The ship will become part of the "15-fathom fleet" of scuttled barges and other  ships comprising what the Department of Fish and Game calls one of the most  unusual artificial reefs in the country.  </P> <P> The DFG has been involved in an ongoing program of utilizing such reefs to  enhance fishing and diving in local waters.  </P> <P> Up to 100 deer hunters will be allowed access to 3,800 acres of Trust for  Public Land property in northwest Mendocino County when deer-hunting season  opens in Zone A.  </P> <P> Access permits will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and allow  hunting for deer with archery equipment and firearms. No cost is involved. Last  year, 87 of 100 available permits were issued to Zone A deer tag holders.  </P> <P> To apply, hunters should send a postcard with their name, return mailing  address, current hunting license number and Zone A deer tag number to: State  Department of Fish and Game, P.O. Box 47, Yountville, Calif., 94599.  </P> <P> All permit holders will be given a map of the area showing boundary lines,  access points and camping sites.  </P> <P> The archery deer-hunting season for Zone A opened last Saturday and runs  through the end of the month. General deer-hunting season begins Aug. 12 and  ends Sept. 24. No more than two bucks, forked horn or better, may be taken by  hunters during the Zone A season.  </P> <P> Today is the grand opening of the Pachmayr International Shooting Sports Park  at the Whittier Narrows Dam and Recreation Area in El Monte.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Pete Schabarum will shoot the first clay target at what is  described as "the premier facility for shooting sports enthusiasts to practice  trap, skeet, archery and Starshot."  </P> <P> Starshot, a 42-foot-tall, semicircular, orange structure, is a new clay target  shooting game.  </P> <P> Other facilities at the park include 14 American trap fields, eight skeet  fields, a 22-target archery practice range and two roving field archery  courses.  </P> <P> The park will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Cabo San Lucas fishing: Green water is still making for poor fishing, with  boats having to travel 10 miles south to reach the more productive blue water,  where dorado to 50 pounds and an occasional striped marlin are comprising most  catches.  </P> <P> According to Didier Van Der Veecken, an International Game Fish Assn.  representative at the Solmar Hotel, there have been several sightings of blue  marlin in the area, but the prized fish have been inactive.  </P> <P> One bright spot in the colder green water -- in the low 70s -- slightly off the  cape has been the showing of swordfish, with most in the 50- to 80-pound range  with one reported at 244 pounds, and small yellowfin tuna.  </P> <P> Dave Denholm of Corona del Mar reportedly caught the season's first striped  marlin in local waters on June 30, but because he tagged-and-released the fish  he estimated at 225 pounds, the official weigh-in of the season's first marlin  at San Diego, Avalon or Balboa Island has yet to take place.  </P> <P> The San Diego Marlin Club reports colder-than-normal water around the local  islands and that there have been very few sightings, but no hookups.  </P> <P> Balboa Angling Club says that one marlin was hooked and lost at the 209-fathom  spot, while a spokesman at Avalon weigh station said off-color water and bad  conditions in general are making for a poor start to the 1989 season.  </P> <P> The Fourth of July weekend typically marks the beginning of marlin fishing off  the Southern California coastline.  </P> <P> Denholm reported that his fish was caught about four miles east of Santa  Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Calendar  </P> <P> The 6th annual American Boating Jubilee '89, July 21-30, Shoreline Village  Marina, Long Beach; Seminar on how to catch tuna, yellowtail and white sea bass  using live baits, Angler's Tackle Box in Seal Beach, July 26 at 7 p.m. Cost:  $10.00.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (1): A sudden change in the landscape - The outlook for the banking sector is positive, but hard economic decisions face the Greek government if it is to close the gap with the rest of the EU The government's unexpected decision this week to liberalise short-term capital movement ahead of the EU deadline of July 1, with the aim of averting a devaluation of the drachma, has suddenly changed Greece's financial landscape. Even if the government succeeds in maintaining confidence in the drachma by keeping interest rates at spectacularly high levels for the next few weeks, some hard economic decisions will now have to be speeded up. Instead of converging, Greece is drifting further away from the rest of the member states in the EU. Recovery is barely visible, with growth in gross domestic product projected at about 1 per cent this year, against 0.2 per cent in 1993. The European Commission has expressed concern over the government's failure to curb a rising public sector deficit, financed mostly through short-term Treasury bills, which is fuelling a public debt already equivalent to 138 per cent of GDP. Yet, there are positive signs too. The black economy - estimated at nearly 40 per cent of GDP - pumps liquidity into capital markets, as a substantial proportion of untaxed earnings is invested in Treasury bills, mutual funds and shares on the Athens stock exchange. And, while the socialist government's latest attempts to address tax evasion include a 15 per cent tax on both mutual fund dividends and 'repos' - fixed-term repurchase agreements - there are no plans to introduce a capital gains tax or to investigate the source of funds entering capital markets. Moreover, larger Greek companies commanding a comfortable market share are weathering the recession successfully, some by expanding into neighbouring Balkan countries where the possibilities of rapid growth in turnover are seen as outweighing political and economic risks. Against the odds, too, Greece's banking and financial services industry has decoupled itself both from gloomy developments in other sectors of the country's economy and from the uncertainty arising from political tension in the Balkans as a result of the violent upheavals in the former Yugoslavia. The 25 domestic banks increased their profits last year by an average 15 per cent, despite the impact of recession on the smaller businesses which dominate Greek manufacturing and services, and the negative effect on balance sheets of the imposition of stricter rules for interest accrual on non-performing loans. The foreign banks which compete mainly for corporate and shipping business are not required to disclose results. But as one foreign banker recently put it: 'The market may be growing tighter but there are more ways of making money than there used to be.' The outlook this year is still positive, although banks will have to increase provisions because of declining loan quality - the result of a projected fall in corporate profits and problems business customers are facing with payments. Last year's drop in private sector lending by the Greek domestic banks, from 5.9 to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product, is attributed as much to increased borrowing abroad by companies keen to take advantage of lower interest rates as to the recession. Both state-controlled and private banks are planning to follow some of their corporate clients into Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, notwithstanding the difficulties according to one banker of 'setting up in a regulatory vacuum.' So far only Xiosbank, a private bank, has started operating, (with a branch in Sofia), but other banks expect to launch Balkan ventures this year. Another encouraging sign is the improved profitability of seven private banks established since 1990. Controlled for the most part by Greek shipowners and insurance companies - and in one case by a Cyprus-based bank  -the new banks have set the pace in consumer lending, most recently in devising products to take advantage of a higher loan ceiling of Dr8m. Although the new banks' combined market share amounts to less than 4 per cent, they have fewer overheads and more flexibility. They are not constrained by having a sizeable percentage of deposits tied up in government bonds, the remnants of the old system of compulsory reserve requirements. Their presence also encourages the two big private banks, Credit Bank and Ergobank, to mount a more aggressive challenge to the four big state banking groups that control 70 per cent of the market. Following last month's Dr31bn capital increase, Credit Bank now ranks ahead of National Bank, the state-controlled giant, in market capitalisation. Its energetic subsidiaries in fund management, investment banking, leasing and brokerage activities underline Credit Bank's aspirations to become a European-sized financial services group. The state-controlled banks are trying to catch up on automation, as the best way of retaining market share. Automated teller machines, formerly the preserve of private and foreign banks, now brighten up the dull facades of the state banks. Upgrading dealing rooms and establishing financial subsidiaries, as well as increasing income, have the additional advantage of providing more jobs under the pervasive patronage system. The state banks have become fiefdoms of the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, following a clean sweep of bank governors after last year's general election. Its conservative predecessor tried to loosen the state's grip on the banking system, by persuading Greek bankers working abroad to return to run state banks, then by abolishing the finance minister's right to a proxy vote for important shareholders such as state insurance companies and pension funds. If, in theory, the shareholders now can choose a board headed by a truly professional banker, there are few signs that the new freedom will be exercised. Nor are the pension funds yet exploiting the opportunities for active management of their portfolios - also introduced by the previous government. It was left to institutional investors from abroad to increase turnover on the Athens stock exchange last year. The market shrugged off political instability in the Balkans, worsening economic indicators and fears that the socialists would abandon privatisation to become one of the world's more stable emerging markets. It is likely to acquire depth, with more than 50 flotations and rights issues expected this year, raising the number of actively traded stocks by about one-third. For growth-minded Greek companies, a listing on the bourse is becoming an attractive alternative to bank borrowing. Privatisation is back on the agenda despite the socialists' initial pledge to cancel the programme of disposals. However, privatisation no longer includes sales of banking subsidiaries. Plans to unload four small state-owned banks through transfers of share packages on the bourse, following the example of the South Korean Hanwha group's purchase of Bank of Athens last year, have been dropped. Even if the socialists oppose dismantling the big state banks, they have nevertheless embraced the idea of creating a broad share-owning public, through partial flotations of public enterprises. The first test will be the flotation of 30 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications company. Scheduled for this autumn, it is projected to raise more than Dr300bn. Even with an international tranche amounting to 15 per cent of the company, the sheer size of the offering will place tremendous strain on the market's capacity to absorb an issue five times larger than any to date, not to mention the underwriting banks' ability to market and distribute shares. But if the OTE flotation comes off, Greece's financial sector can no longer be called immature.</p>

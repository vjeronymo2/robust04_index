The republic has  already received the first $20 million.    According to the agreement reached by the sides, 10.5  million  "greenbacks" from this sum will go into the conversion of three  major Belarusian defense enterprises -- BelOMO, the "Integral"  Plant, and the Minsk "Computer Technology" Production  Association. The remaining funds will be used to build housing  for servicemen and to equip the republic center for retraining  servicemen transferred to the reserve and placing them in jobs.  In the past few days, a consignment of equipment for computer  classes worth $187,000 was supplied from the United States to  the center's branch in Lida. Equipment for setting up a network  of service stations will arrive there mid-January -- it is  specifically for these stations that the Lida branch will be  training specialists.</p>

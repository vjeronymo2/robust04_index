			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS believes that Federal Reserve Board regulations set forth appropriate standards in this area, and is not currently aware of any compelling reasons to use a standard differing from that used by the Federal Reserve Board. Accordingly, the final regulation generally incorporates the standard set forth in the Federal Reserve Board's regulations. OTS believes this approach also will promote regulatory uniformity by applying similar standards to foreign banks that propose to acquire banks and savings associations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS also requested comment regarding the manner in which the OTS should implement this standard,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> whether the OTS should conduct a case-by-case analysis, or adopt some other approach, such as a country-by-country, or regulator-by-regulator approach. The OTS has decided to adopt the approach taken by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that as the standard requires a bank-specific determination, it will address the standard on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Reserve Board has stated that it expects, as it acts on applications, to use information already reviewed regarding comprehensive supervision in particular countries to make judgments without requiring significant input from similar applicants chartered in the same country. See 58 FR 6348, 6349. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS received two comments regarding the proposed amendments, one from a savings association and one from a thrift industry trade association. The savings association expressed general support for the proposed rule. The trade association commenter addressed four issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the commenter requested that the OTS, in defining the term ``principal shareholder,'' consider alternatives to the ten percent threshold, and urged the OTS to address the merits of a 25 percent threshold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS continues to believe that a ten percent threshold is appropriate. Under the OTS acquisition of control regulations, an individual acquiror generally acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company, subject to rebuttal, upon acquiring over ten percent of a class of voting stock and acquiring a ``control factor.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such an acquiror must submit a change of control notice or rebuttal of control prior to exceeding the ten percent threshold. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR 574.4 (b) and (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 CFR 574.3, 574.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the OTS noted in the proposal, the statutory language does not prevent the OTS from considering the extent to which a ``principal shareholder'' or ``controlling shareholder'' is involved in the affairs of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. An underlying purpose of section 211 is to permit the OTS to consider the abilities of the principal shareholders of savings associations and savings and loan holding companies in appropriate situations, including situations where a principal shareholder has or could have a significant effect on the financial and managerial resources, future prospects, or safety and soundness of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. Thus, the OTS, in weighing the shareholder's experience and competence, would give significant consideration to whether the shareholder proposes to be a passive investor. For instance, a principal shareholder who holds a passive investment would not need the same level of experience and competence required of a principal shareholder who could exert significant influence upon the direction of the savings association or savings and loan holding company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS notes that its approach is similar to the approach taken by the Federal Reserve Board. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 58 FR 471, 472 (January 6, 1993), and 58 FR 4073, 4074 (January 13, 1993), in which the Federal Reserve Board defines ``principal shareholder'' using a ten percent threshold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, the commenter responded to the OTS's request for comment as to whether the OTS should seek specific assurances concerning the operations or activities of an acquiror or its affiliates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The commenter urged that the OTS not add requirements regarding such assurances to the proposed regulations. As previously noted, the OTS generally will not require specific assurances regarding these matters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this context, in response to the OTS's request for comment regarding foreign acquiror agreements, the commenter made general observations regarding the enforceability of foreign acquiror agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the commenter responded to the OTS's specific request for comment on the manner in which assurances should be presented to the OTS as to the availability of information on the operations or activities of certain companies. The commenter observed that it is a federal crime to file false statements with the OTS, and, therefore, that the assurances need not take the form of an affidavit or certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS has, under various circumstances, required materials to be submitted in the form of an affidavit or certification. As noted above, the OTS is not generally requiring applicants to provide specific assurances regarding the availability of information. In the event that the OTS requires additional assurances in a particular case, the OTS will determine what form of assurance is appropriate under the circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the commenter addressed the OTS's determination of whether a foreign bank is subject to ``comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the bank's home country.'' The commenter noted that the OTS has not traditionally made determinations regarding this issue, and urged the OTS to consider deferring to or otherwise using the resources of the Federal Reserve Board and other banking agencies. The commenter urged the OTS to take advantage of the expertise of other agencies in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the OTS must act on applications under section 10(e) of the HOLA, it is the OTS's responsibility to determine whether the applicant satisfies the applicable standards. Nevertheless, the OTS intends to consider previous determinations made by the Federal Reserve Board (or other applicable Federal regulatory agency) regarding supervision or regulation of a foreign bank, and applicants should provide such information to the OTS in the application process. The OTS believes that consideration of determinations made by other regulatory agencies decreases the burden on applicants to provide information, and facilitates prompt processing of applications. The OTS recognizes that such determinations may not be available in every case, because the Federal Reserve Board (and the OTS) make their determinations on a case-by-case (rather than,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a country-by-country) basis. In addition, as stated above, the OTS has generally incorporated the Federal Reserve Board's standards in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director of the OTS has determined that this proposal does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Reuters signals rethink on cash pile REUTERS, the international information and news group, is considering ways of returning some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to shareholders - probably through a special dividend or share buy-back scheme. The difference in tax and regulatory regimes between the UK and US - where Reuters has 35 per cent of its shareholders - would pose obstacles to both a cash payment and a share buy-back, a method more commonly used in Wall Street than the UK. Reuters said yesterday: 'We have not yet decided whether we wish to make a distribution. This depends on the pace at which plans for business expansion proceed. There are also significant regulatory and tax issues which we are trying to resolve.' Analysts estimate Reuters could hand back as much as Pounds 400m to shareholders and a buy-back would not be dilutive at about the present share price, and would enhance earnings at a lower level. Reuters shares yesterday closed 4p higher at Pounds 13.59p, giving the group a market capitalisation of nearly Pounds 6bn. The annual report said that if Reuters decided that it had more cash than it required to develop new business, it had the capacity to distribute a proportion of this cash to shareholders without the need to write off unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. Reuters achieved this by paying an increased dividend of Pounds 357m from its main operational company to the holding company in December, thereby preserving a portion of the group's ACT capacity. The main concern for the company is that it will no longer be seen as a growth stock. Having increased profits rapidly during the eighties, 1980s, its performance has slowed as recession has struck the world's financial markets. Reuters increased its capital expenditure by 25 per cent last year to Pounds 200m, but that was overshadowed by strong cash generation. Analysts would prefer to see Reuters hand back some of its cash to shareholders, rather than be tempted to invest it an areas outside its core expertise. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Thefts cost life company Pounds 1m AN INVESTMENTS salesman was jailed for three years yesterday for a fraud that cost his employers about Pounds 1m. Mr Douglas Peet, who earned Pounds 70,000 a year with Confederation Life Assurance Company, admitted 25 theft charges totalling Pounds 350,000. His downfall came when he started using some clients' money to pay off others whose investments were not as profitable as he had promised, Swansea Crown Court heard. Mr Peet of Bryncoch, Neath, West Glamorgan, then began taking money for himself. By secretly juggling accounts, the salesman paid out about Pounds 250,000 - but Pounds 100,000 remains unaccounted for and has not been traced. Mr John Rogers QC, defending, said: 'He stole from one client to pay another. In 1987 when the stock market crashed matters were compounded. He found investments he made were worth much less than he had anticipated.' Sentencing, Judge David Williams told Mr Peet: 'You put clients' investments in jeopardy and Confederation Life has been put to considerable outlay to make matters good - in the region of Pounds 1m.'</p>

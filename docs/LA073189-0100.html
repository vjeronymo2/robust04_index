Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROMANIAN DEFECTORS AWAIT RULING  </P> <P> Three teen-age Romanian paddlers have been secluded in a private home, waiting  for an immigration hearing that will determine whether they can remain in  Canada.  </P> <P> The paddlers -- two males and a female -- flagged down a Halifax police car  Saturday morning and said they wanted to defect. They were competing at the  world junior canoe championships, which wrapped up Sunday on Lake Banook.  </P> <P> Jon Stone, spokesman for the Department of Immigration, said the athletes were  interviewed by immigration officials Saturday. A decision on their status will  be made this week.  </P> <P> "They haven't made a refugee claim in the legal sense of the word," Stone said  in an interview. "But they wish to remain in Canada and don't want to return to  Romania."  </P></p>

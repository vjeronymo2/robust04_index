			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: BCCI payouts are nearer THE LIQUIDATION this week of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International means that the process of compensating depositors can start at last. Under the UK's deposit protection scheme, sterling depositors can claim 75 per cent of their money up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. This means that someone with Pounds 12,000 in his account will receive Pounds 9,000 but those with more than Pounds 20,000 will get no more than Pounds 15,000. Those whose deposits were not in sterling are not covered by the scheme, even if their accounts were held in the UK. Last July, the Deposit Protection Board (DPB) sent 40,000 claim forms to those with sterling deposits held with BCCI in the UK. (In fact, the liquidators later calculated that the number of depositors is 32,000, the higher figure resulting from duplication of accounts). Only 12,500 have been returned so far and 10,000 have been processed. Anyone who has not received the form should telephone the board's helpline on 071-601-3050. Those who have yet to complete it should do so immediately and return it to the board at 19 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8HA. Compensation payments cannot be made until depositors have also registered their debt with the liquidators in accordance with a provision in the Banking Act. This means filling in another form, which will be sent to depositors within a week by the four partners at Touche Ross who have been appointed joint liquidators. They stress that creditors should 'take no action until they receive an official communication.' These forms could not be sent out earlier because Touche Ross acted only as provisional liquidator pending BCCI's formal wind-up. Once the DPB receives confirmation about the eligibility of depositors, compensation payments can start to be made. This could be within a couple of months. Compensation will be paid to individual depositors. If one depositor had seven accounts, he would still be eligible for only 75 per cent of their total. But in the case of a joint account, each individual would be eligible for compensation. Creditors who accepted the Pounds 3,000 emergency payment provided by the Bank of England will find this sum deducted from their compensation. Meanwhile, the liquidators are still negotiating with the government of Abu Dhabi about additional compensation. Touche Ross says the plan is to pay those eligible globally by up to 40 per cent of their deposits. However, the DPB would be entitled first to the amount it had paid out. In other words, if someone in the UK had deposits of Pounds 100,000 in BCCI, he would have received the maximum Pounds 15,000 from the DPB. A further Pounds 40,000 would become available, assuming the talks with the Abu Dhabi government come to fruition. The DPB would be entitled to Pounds 15,000 of this and the customer would receive Pounds 25,000, bringing his total compensation to Pounds 40,000. The liquidators hope to conclude the deal with Abu Dhabi by the end of the month.</p>

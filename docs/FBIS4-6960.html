			<p>BFN     [Text] Okayama, April 24 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei  Kono criticized the ruling coalition Sunday [24 April] for  spending its energy only on trying to maintain the alliance and  for rotating power within the coalition. Kono, president of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), accused the coalition's core  party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] in particular of failing  to take due process under parliamentary democracy. "Never lead  Japan's politics on a wrong path," he said. [sentence as  received]    Kono did not go into specifics, although he was apparently  referring to controversies involving issues such as taxes.    In early February, Hosokawa announced plans to implement a 6  trillion yen tax cut and also to replace the 3 percent  consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax."    The new tax proposal, which was soon scrapped, was widely  criticized as being hastily put out and being done abruptly in a  closed-door meeting.    Kono spoke at an LDP-sponsored fund-raising event in  Okayama,  some 730 kilometers west of Tokyo, on the eve of the Diet's  election Monday of Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata as Japan's new  prime minister.    Hata is foreign minister in the cabinet of outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEWART DISPROVES NOTION THAT HE'S UNWORTHY;  </P> <P> BOXING: HUGE UNDERDOG GIVES UNBEATEN EVANDER HOLYFIELD A REAL BATTLE BEFORE  BOUT IS STOPPED IN THE EIGHTH ROUND.  </P> <P> Boxing's heavyweight division, previously thought to be dominated by only two  men, may have to make room for a third after what transpired Saturday night in  Atlantic City's Convention Hall.  </P> <P> Alex Stewart, a 13-1 underdog and thought to be a near-setup for Evander  Holyfield in his countdown to a bout with champion Mike Tyson, unexpectedly  fought with skill, heart and courage. He also fought from the second round on  with a deep cut on the outside of his right eye, and that cost him the fight.  </P> <P> Holyfield, fighting with great courage himself, preserved a multi-million  dollar payday against Tyson, probably next June. Holyfield (23-0) got a TKO  when the ringside doctor stopped the fight at 2:51 of the eighth round.  </P> <P> It was a brutal fight. Both heavyweights absorbed a tremendous amount of  punishment. Both had to summon strength from deep within, but Holyfield had a  good track record for tough fights. Stewart didn't.  </P> <P> The Jamaican-born and London and Brooklyn-raised Stewart was 24-0 against  mediocre opponents and had stopped each one inside of four rounds.  </P> <P> Holyfield had a tough fight in Las Vegas against Michael Dokes last March. Most  have called that one the heavyweight bout of the eighties.  </P> <P> The fight was watched by a capacity crowd of 6,415 in the Convention Hall's  West Hall.  </P> <P> Holyfield was fighting with a cold, he said later.  </P> <P> "He was taking cold medication two days ago and had a vitamin shot," said his  co-trainer, George Benton. "If I'd suggested we postpone the fight, Holyfield  would have fired me."  </P> <P> Stewart's manager, Mike Jones, came in late to the post-fight news conference  and seemed to be disturbed with talk of a cold. "I think Alex's performance  might have had something to do with Holyfield's performance," he said.  </P> <P> Holyfield's worst moments came in the furious fifth round when Stewart, at  center-ring, rocked Holyfield with a left-right-left combination. Holyfield  wobbled, backed up, dropped his hands and opened his mouth. He took a couple of  more hard rights and a couple of left hooks, but survived the round.  </P> <P> Every judge scored the fifth as Stewart's only round.  </P> <P> Holyfield's manager, Dan Duva, was smirking at the post-fight news conference.  </P> <P> "OK, where are the wise guys who said Alex Stewart couldn't fight?" he said.  "He fought a beautiful fight."  </P> <P> Added Holyfield: "Alex was courageous . . . and a lot quicker than I expected.  I thought he was a two, three-punch combination fighter. He was throwing six,  seven at a time tonight."  </P> <P> Stewart, 223, had never fought a boxer of Holyfield's caliber, and he went to  school over the first two rounds.  </P> <P> Holyfield, 212, came out fast with hard, quick left jabs. When he got inside on  Stewart, he stayed there, throwing short hooks and uppercuts. Thus, he was  neutralizing Stewart's primary weapon -- a long, straight right that had  stopped most of his opponents.  </P> <P> Stewart had a rocky first two rounds. In fact, his face was reddened by the  accumulation of Holyfield's attack before the first round ended. But he never  lost his composure, and never let Holyfield bring in the finishing punch. He  landed with just enough left hooks and short right hands inside to prevent  Holyfield from opening up the throttle all the way.  </P> <P> Stewart, in a news conference before the fight, said, "No one is going to step  all over me."  </P> <P> The cut came midway through the second round, although no one was sure exactly  when. Even Stewart afterward said he didn't know if it was from a head butt or  a punch.  </P> <P> "I'd never been cut before," he said. "I wasn't sure what to do. At certain  times my vision (out of the right eye) was blurry."  </P> <P> The cut was on the outside of the right eye socket, just below the end of the  brow. And it was very deep.  </P> <P> The ringside physician, Dr. Frank Doggett, checked the cut after every round  and let it go because it wasn't bleeding directly into the eye.  </P> <P> Stewart lost the first four rounds, but was by no means out of the fight. He  never stopped throwing punches and landed enough of them to keep Holyfield  honest. Stewart's gallant fifth was an important round for him, since he'd  never gone that far.  </P> <P> But in the sixth, Holyfield backed up Stewart with left hooks and landed two  punishing, short uppercuts on Stewart's chin midway through the round. At this  point, Stewart seemed to be slowing down and losing strength.  </P> <P> Holyfield finished the round by punishing Stewart on the ropes. When the bell  rang, Stewart stumbled and couldn't find his corner.  </P> <P> With Doggett watching, Stewart's seconds battled furiously to stop the blood  flow, but when the bell rang for the eighth, the blood was streaming again even  as he hoisted himself off his stool.  </P> <P> There were no knockdowns. But if this battle turned on one punch, it was  probably a powerful right to Stewart's ribs midway through the eighth. It could  be heard several rows back into the crowd. Stewart never threw another  significant punch.  </P> <P> More important, his face was a bloody mask at that point. When Doggett looked  at him on his stool, he told referee Tony Perez to stop it.  </P> <P> Stewart earned $225,000 Saturday. His previous biggest paycheck was $13,500.  Holyfield made $1.2 million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLER USES MYTHS TO HELP BALANCE LIFE OF MODERN WOMAN  </P> <P> "In Search of the Wise Woman," a daylong outdoor workshop designed to explore  the spirituality of women, will be held from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. June 10 at  Topanga State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> The workshop will include storytelling, guided walks, discussions of feminine  spirituality, exercises in dance and movement, and a concluding ritual, said  Kathleen Zundell, who has been conducting the workshop for the past two years.  </P> <P> "I want women to be in touch with the Earth, their spirits and all that is,"  said Zundell. "We're at a desperate point; we must restore the balance of the  feminine in our lives. As we work to restore ourselves as women, we will heal  the planet."  </P> <P> A woman of wisdom, she said, "is a woman who listens carefully to herself and  the voice of the goddess that comes from within . . . When we stay in touch  with that voice, I think we give birth to the divine."  </P> <P> Zundell's view of the world is not touchy-feely or New Age. First and foremost,  she is a teacher, a creative movement specialist and a storyteller. "To educate  means to draw forth," she said. "As a teacher, I must create an environment  where wisdom comes from the participants. I must pose questions, tell some  stories that evoke feelings, and allow them to share their answers and  feelings. My work as a leader is to be as clear as I possibly can be with my  own truth."  </P> <P> The workshops are held in the oak woodlands and grasslands of the park because,  she said, it's important that women gather together in places other than the  office, the kitchen, the health club or the mall. "In the state park, we can  connect consciously and unconsciously with the Earth Mother. We can get back in  touch with the beauty of the Earth and open spaces."  </P> <P> In her storytelling sessions, Zundell calls on ancient goddess myths to help  reveal universal truths.  </P> <P> "I see the myths as great jewels hidden in treasure chests. There is great  wisdom and truth when we find those stories that can teach and heal us," she  said. "The myths can help us examine our lives and relationships."  </P> <P> Currently, the myth of Demeter and Persephone has captured Zundell's attention,  and forms the basis for part of the workshop. For those who have forgotten  Mythology 101, the myth, briefly interpreted, is the story of Demeter, the  goddess of grain, and her maiden daughter, Persephone, who is abducted into the  underworld by Hades. The grief-stricken Demeter searches in vain for her  daughter and refuses to allow anything to grow on Earth until the girl is  returned. With the help of Hecate, the old crone, Persephone is allowed to come  back, and Demeter restores fertility to the Earth.  </P> <P> This myth, according to Zundell, offers a number of powerful images that are  meaningful to women. Demeter represents the mother archetype, Persephone is the  eternal girl, and Hecate the mysterious, wise woman.  </P> <P> "This myth is about the triple aspect of the goddess," she said. "It's about  the cyclic aspect of nature and -- always -- rebirth. The child, mother and  crone; birth, life and death; the created, the creator and the destroyer."  </P> <P> One of the exercises in Zundell's workshop is an examination of ancient goddess  images. She has compiled a notebook of photographs, postcards and sketches of  ancient stone carvings, marble statues and other art objects, all of which  depict various aspects of divine womanhood.  </P> <P> The archetypal images Zundell shows are profoundly different from the images  that bombard modern women, images that reduce femininity to a commodity.  </P> <P> Flipping through the pages of her notebook, Zundell points to a rounded  figurine from ancient Sparta.  </P> <P> "Look at that -- isn't she centered, strong and powerful? This woman knows who  she is. Put that in front of your face every day. . . ."  </P> <P> Turning to an Egyptian stone carving of a woman with breasts exposed and arms  raised triumphantly, Zundell said: "Think this woman had implants? Was she  afraid of how big or little she was?"  </P> <P> In ancient times, Zundell said, feminine power was not only valued, it was  honored and defined as divine. "These rich, beautiful images that we're sharing  feed the deep subconscious mind in a way that no advertising can. It is  empowering to look at them."  </P> <P> Apparently, many women are looking for -- and finding -- the goddess within.  Each time the Wilderness Institute offers one of Zundell's "In Search of the  Wise Woman" workshops, it's fully booked.  </P> <P> "There's a definite interest in programs just for women," said Institute  spokesperson Chris Imhoff. "This is an outdoors-oriented program that focuses  on the cultural and historical roles of women. We've had a great response."  </P> <P> Zundell thinks the problems and issues of today's world call for women to  gather in nature. "We talk to each other and we create energy," she said. "When  we stand in our own light, we also light the way for other women and men."  </P> <P>  * "In Search of the Wise Woman," outdoor workshop conducted by Kathleen  Zundell, Wilderness Institute, 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. June 10.

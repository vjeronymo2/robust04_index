			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The Long View: Equities beat the gun THERE HAVE been some good days but, overall, the UK stock market has found the going quite tough in the first quarter of 1993. You will have come off worst in the leaders because by yesterday the FT-SE (Footsie) index of the hundred biggest stocks had slipped back to just about where it was at the end of December. Yet, the economic background generally has been favourable. Short-term interest rates have come down a point while retail sales are showing an up-trend and the Confederation of British Industry is confident of a rise in manufacturing output. Company profits are set to jump healthily in 1993 because the misery in the labour market is, to a large extent, the mirror image of rejuvenation in the corporate sector. As it happens, with the focus switching from growth to recovery, Footsie has been restrained by the setbacks of over-priced stars of the recession such as Glaxo and Sainsbury. The stock market picture is the more pleasing, the further down the size spectrum you look. The market as a whole is up 3 per cent, as measured by the All-Share index. Within that, the mid-range stocks have climbed by 9 per cent and the minnows, according to the SmallCap index, are up by about 14 per cent. Increasingly, the big stocks are driven by global capital market trends. A key international influence is the US Treasury long bond yield, which hit a long-term low point on precisely the same day - March 8 - as the prices of the Footsie 100 stocks hit their all-time high. Britain's own long gilt yield has bounced up from 8.23 per cent on March 10 to nearer 8.5 per cent now, which is a good measure of the recent shift in sentiment. It has the effect of raising the yield ratio between gilts and equities, a measure which professional investors watch closely. From a tolerable 2.0 ahead of the Budget, the ratio has jumped to a less comfortable 2.2 if you allow for the damaging effect of the advance corporation tax (ACT) changes on dividends. Fortunately, the prospects for dividend growth are looking a little brighter but, like Wall Street, where the stock market has risen about 4 per cent in the quarter, London has been salivating eagerly over the economic upturn for a long time. The All-Share index has climbed almost 20 per cent over the past year; yet, during that 12 months, the average increase in dividends has been just about zero and reported earnings per share growth around 5 per cent (almost all of it in financials). It is interesting to recall that, late in 1991, many brokers were predicting earnings growth of 15-20 per cent for 1992. This time, projections of 20 per cent growth in 1993 look much better-founded. But a lot of it is in the price. The market could continue to move sideways, or perhaps gently downwards, if the volume of new issues becomes uncomfortable. The Bank of England, after all, is planning monthly auctions of gilt-edged - of between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn - and, in the wake of the Budget's Pounds 50bn borrowing forecast, it will kick off the 1993-94 season next Wednesday with a Pounds 3bn offer of 20-year bonds. As for company share issues, we have already seen about Pounds 2.5bn worth so far in 1993. ICI has promised a Pounds 1.3bn blockbuster for June, while the first instalment of the sale of the government's remaining stake in British Telecom could absorb Pounds 2bn, perhaps in July. Meanwhile, British institutions are pulling in less than Pounds 40bn a year for investment. The sums may add up only if fund managers repatriate some of the Pounds 100bn-plus they have placed in foreign equities and bonds, and if overseas investors come back into gilts on a substantial scale. For these cross-border flows to happen, UK securities must come to look relatively cheap. Even when the stock market is trading sideways, however, it need not be dull. Look at how the performance of individual sectors has changed this year, with food retailing collapsing from near the top of the league table in 1992 to the relegation zone this quarter, but property doing the reverse. Generally speaking, the manufacturing sectors have done well while the cosy domestic monopolies and oligopolies in brewing, retailing and household utilities have lagged behind. This is a healthy sign when the balance of payments needs to be turned around, a feat achieved best by a prosperous manufacturing sector. While profits in general have fallen only slightly over the past two years, they have collapsed by some 60 per cent in the capital goods sectors, according to broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. In 1993, they could more than double although, in many cases, that would only represent the elimination of losses. From a slimmed-down base, the potential for profits recovery can be potent. This year, labour costs will not be a worry - per unit of manufacturing output, they are down slightly. The only small concern is that, so far, manufacturers have not been able to pass on their devaluation-boosted input costs (up 6.9 per cent year-on-year in February). Overseas profits are looking healthy in sterling terms, although the weakness of demand in continental Europe is a threat; and sterling has been looking significantly stronger in the recent past, having recovered 10 pfennigs against the DM in four weeks, for example. Given a couple of years of good profits growth, the average price-earnings ratio on UK equities could be down from its present rather intimidating 20 or so to about 14 on the basis of 1994 earnings. For the leaders this is a supportable, but scarcely bomb-proof, rating. Hence the scramble for better value in the smaller companies sector, where the surge of investment funds into narrow markets is creating its own immediate payoff and where (let us hope, if fingers are not to be burned) those companies which survived through the recession will now earn substantial rewards.</p>

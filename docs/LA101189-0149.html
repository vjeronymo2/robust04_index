			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MURDOCH COOL TO NEW MGM BID  </P> <P> Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said today he was lukewarm about reentering the  race to take control of Hollywood film studio MGM/UA Communications Co., which  terminated a $1.5-billion pact to be bought by Qintex Australia Ltd.  </P> <P> MGM said its deal with the Australian broadcasting conglomerate Qintex failed  because it did not deliver a required $50-million letter of credit. (Section D,  Page 1.)  </P> <P> Murdoch was asked on Australian television if he still wanted MGM/UA after  Qintex Australia's plan fell apart.  </P> <P> "Ah, yes," he said. "But we're not negotiating. We're not in there. We're not  sure about it. . . . We're not lusting after it."  </P> <P> A bid of $1.35 billion by Murdoch's News Corp. was topped by Qintex last month.  </P> <P> "We are certainly not going to pay the price (Qintex head) Mr. (Christopher C.)  Skase was going to pay," Murdoch said.  </P></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: MAS share trading halted as speculation of state sale mounts Speculation about the future of Malaysia Airlines (MAS), increased yesterday with indications that the government is about to sell part of its remaining stake in the airline in a deal worth up to MDollars 2bn (Dollars 770m). Share dealings on the Kuala Lumpur stock market in both MAS and Malaysia Helicopter Services (MHS), a small company specialising in support services for the oil and gas industry, have been suspended. It is widely believed that MHS will be used as the vehicle for the sale of a substantial block of government held MAS shares. After a partial privatisation in 1985, MAS is now 42 per cent owned by Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, and 5 per cent each by the governments in the east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Brunei government holds another 10 per cent. Whether Bank Negara will sell all its MAS shares is still not clear but there are reports of a complex share swap. Analysts say the government is anxious to capitalise on buoyant stock market activity to rid itself of its holding in MAS. The Malaysian state-controlled airline has been flying through financial turbulence. It announced pre-tax profits for the six months ended September, of MDollars 6.4m (Dollars 2.5m), a 96 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Analysts say MAS is paying the price for an ambitious fleet expansion programme launched three years ago just as the worldwide airline industry was heading into recession. In the course of its present five-year plan to 1996-97, MAS has orders for 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn. MHS is controlled by Mr Tajudin Ramli, a leading Malaysian businessmen. Mr Tajudin's main listed company is Technology Resources Industries, a group mainly involved in telecommunications. Mr Tajudin recently announced that through MHS he was taking a 20 per cent stake in World Airways, the US charter carrier. While the Malaysian government appears anxious to make MAS more competitive and less dependent on state funding, analysts feel that the state will ensure it maintains considerable influence over any new fully privatised entity. One of Mr Tajudin's backers is believed to be Mr Daim Zaidnuddin, one of Malaysia's richest businessmen.</p>

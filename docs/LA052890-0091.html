			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL;  </P> <P> CAPIZZI, ENRIGHT TIED BUT TRAIL 'UNDECIDED' FOR D.A.  </P> <P> Appointed incumbent Michael R. Capizzi and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G.  Enright are locked in a near-dead heat for the lead in the four-man district  attorney's race, according to a Times Orange County poll.  </P> <P> But a major factor in the race could be that nearly two-thirds of the  registered voters polled remain undecided about which of the candidates will  get their vote.  </P> <P> Unless one of the candidates can capture a large majority of the undecided  vote, the June 5 election for district attorney will result in a November  runoff between the top two vote-getters. A candidate needs 50% plus one vote to  win an office in June.  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll shows Capizzi and Enright dead even at 12% among  Orange County registered voters. Capizzi holds a slight edge, 16% to Enright's  13%, among those polled who are considered more likely to vote on June 5.  </P> <P> Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, a close ally of Enright, was third in  the polling at 8%, but he drops to 7% among likely voters. Deputy Dist. Atty.  Thomas Avdeef, Capizzi's most vocal critic, was last among the candidates, at  4%, dropping to 3% among likely voters.  </P> <P> The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted May 21 through 23  by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates. The margin of error for a sample of this  size is plus or minus 4%.  </P> <P> Although Capizzi and Enright emerge at the top of the pack in the district  attorney's race, the campaign so far is characterized mainly by the unusual  number of voters who have no strong opinions. Sixty-four percent of the  respondents said they did not know whom they would vote for, and even among  those voters considered more likely to vote, 61% said they are undecided in the  district's attorney's race.  </P> <P> "Capizzi's lead over Enright among likely voters is really insignificant in  view of the high number who haven't decided," said pollster Mark Baldassare.  "Anyone (of the four) can still win this race."  </P> <P> Traditionally in Orange County, the undecided vote has gone overwhelmingly to  the incumbent in nonpartisan elections. But Baldassare said that may not be  true in the district attorney's race because "Capizzi is not, strictly  speaking, the incumbent."  </P> <P> Capizzi was unanimously appointed by the Board of Supervisors on Jan. 2 to  replace his mentor, Cecil Hicks. Hicks had already announced that he would  retire at the end of his term in 1990 but then left early to accept a  judgeship. Hicks gave his endorsement to Capizzi, his chief assistant, to  replace him.  </P> <P> Under the appointment, Capizzi's term of office runs through the end of 1990.  The district attorney elected this year is to take office Jan. 1, 1991.  </P> <P> Avdeef, joined by Enright, tried to block the Capizzi appointment in the  courts, claiming that the county supervisors did not have the authority to  appoint a new district attorney. But the courts upheld the appointment. Avdeef  claims that the appointment was a deliberate setup by Hicks and Capizzi to  influence the outcome of the June 5 election, since the incumbent almost always  has an edge.  </P> <P> Capizzi is allowed to run as the incumbent in the June 5 election but with an  asterisk. Instead of stating on the ballot that he is district attorney, his  ballot designation is "appointed Orange County district attorney." Some of his  supporters fear that the distinction between Capizzi and the others may be lost  in an alphabet soup of titles on the ballot. Enright runs as chief deputy,  Freeman as assistant district attorney and Avdeef as a deputy. The meaning of  those positions can be confusing. An assistant, for example, is higher in the  office than a deputy, but lower than a chief deputy.  </P> <P> Enright, who has made it clear that his realistic goal is to make it to a  runoff with Capizzi, finds himself well-positioned as the campaign enters its  final week. But with his sights set on a runoff, Enright's relationship with  the other two Capizzi challengers has been paradoxical. He needs them to gather  enough votes to make sure Capizzi comes up with less than the 50% that would  win him the election outright in June. But Enright also needs the voters to set  him apart from Freeman and Avdeef, to assure that he does make it to a runoff  election.  </P> <P> For Avdeef, the poll may bolster his contention that Capizzi's high spending --  he will probably pass the $200,000 mark, far more than all the others combined  -- has not helped him much with the voters. But the poll also suggests that  Avdeef's hard-hitting campaign has so far gathered very little strength of its  own.  </P> <P> Avdeef has said in speeches that morale in the office was low under the  Hicks-Capizzi leadership. Yet in an endorsement vote by deputies in the office,  Capizzi came in with 85%, and the other three a combined 5%. Avdeef said the  vote was predetermined because deputies were afraid to buck the boss.  </P> <P> In a recent Bar Assn. poll, Avdeef was the only candidate among the four to  come in with more "unqualified" votes than a combination of "highly qualified"  and "qualified" votes. By comparison, each of the other three candidates  received the "unqualified" rating from less than 7% of the respondents to the  Bar poll. Avdeef points out, however, that only 10% of the lawyers in the  county responded to the survey.  </P> <P> For Avdeef and Freeman to win, or make a runoff, results of the Times Orange  County Poll suggest that they need to carve out a sizable portion of the  undecided vote. But according to pollster Baldassare, any of the four could do  it. "Most people don't even know who these candidates are," Baldassare said.  </P> <P> One of those polled, Ralph L. Sasser of Anaheim, said he will look into the  district attorney's race between now and June 5 before deciding whom to vote  for.  </P> <P> "If someone's been in office a long time, I generally vote to get him out,"  Sasser said. "But if this guy (Capizzi) hasn't been in there long, I probably  wouldn't hold it against him. But I wouldn't necessarily vote for him either."  </P> <P> For Capizzi to win the election outright in June, he has to count on voters  knowing he is the current holder of the office, and then rely on tradition  weighing in his favor, with voters such as R.F. Bosworth of Anaheim, one of  those interviewed in the Times Orange County poll.  </P> <P> "I like someone who keeps a low profile," Bosworth said. "This fellow (Capizzi)  must be doing that because I've never heard of him. In a case like this, as  long as I don't hear anything against him, and as long as he's got his ducks  all lined up in a row, why change anything?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TIMES O.C. POLL  </P> <P> District Attorney  </P> <P> Who would you vote for in the Orange County District Attorney race?  </P> <P> James G. Enright: 12%  </P> <P> Michael R. Capizzi: 12%  </P> <P> Edgar A. Freeman: 8%  </P> <P> Thomas Avdeef: 4%  </P> <P> Don't Know: 64%  </P> <P> Note: The Times Orange County Poll of 600 registered voters was conducted May  21-23 using a random sample of telephone numbers. The margin of error for a  sample of this size is +4% or -4%.  </P> <P> Source: Times Orange County Poll  </P> <P> </P> <P> How the Poll Was Conducted  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates.  The telephone survey of 600 registered voters was conducted over three nights,  ending Wednesday, using a random sample of listed and unlisted telephone  numbers in Orange County. The margin of error for the entire sample is  plus-or-minus 4%. That means it is 95% certain that the results are within 4  percentage points of what they would be if all registered voters in Orange  County were interviewed. For the subsample of 328 Republicans, the margin of  error is 6 points. And for the 212 Democrats, it is 7 points.  </P></p>

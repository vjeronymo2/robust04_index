			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold mine dispute settled A DISPUTE over shareholdings in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea ended yesterday when the government agreed to pay Kina 138.75m (Pounds 98m) to increase its stake from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. The deal will reduce the equity of the three Australian-controlled joint venture partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a subsidiary of MIM Holdings - from 30 per cent each to 25 per cent each. However, the government dropped claims that it had been misled by the joint venturers about the potential profitability of Porgera, the biggest gold mine outside South Africa. Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the government accepted that the joint venture partners did not withhold technical information before the granting of mining approval in 1989. He said the government's decision to seek further equity was taken to meet national priorities and ensure the long-term stability of the project. 'No-one could argue that this is not a good deal for PNG, he said.' The government will pay for the additional 15 per cent stake from its share of profits from the mine, probably over about 15 years. The transaction will be free of tax, and the joint venture partners will be allowed depreciation benefits until the shares are fully paid for. The government will pay interest on the outstanding balance at 5 per cent a year. It has also agreed to resolve separate disputes about town site development, access to the mine and security from attacks by local landowners. The joint venture companies said they had agreed to pay for 75 per cent of a K50m spending package over 10 years to improve infrastructure in Enga province, the isolated region which surrounds the mine. Joint venture officials said that the deal was 'pretty good, under the circumstances'. The sale price of the shares is believed to be close to book value after including the beneficial taxation effects. Porgera, which began production in 1990, is expected to produce 1.4m troy ounces of gold this year, and at least 900,000 ounces a year in the next three years.</p>

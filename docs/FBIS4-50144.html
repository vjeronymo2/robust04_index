			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Construction of Taiwan's  first software industry park got underway Saturday [14 May] as  part of the government's effort to boost Taiwan's role in the  world software industry.    Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Nankang  Software Industry Park, Premier Lien Chan said the park is  expected to provide a good environment for the research and  development of computer software in Taiwan.    The park in suburban Taipei is part of a government  five-year  plan to raise Taiwan's annual computer software production to NT  [New Taiwan] $90 billion (U.S.$3.34 billion) from the current  NT$26 billion (U.S.$98.11 million), Lien said.    "We hope local business groups will invest in the park to  help boost the growth of the promising industry and make Taiwan  one of the world's major software development centers," Lien  said.    Construction of the 4.03-hectare park, scheduled to be  completed in 1995, will cost an estimated NT$9 billion  (U.S.$339.62 million). The land is owned by the state-run Taiwan  Fertilizer Corp., but the Shih Cheng Development Co., a joint  venture of several private business groups, is a major investor  in the project.    Shih Cheng promised to build first-rate plants and other  related facilities in the park, which will be able to  accommodate more than 150 software companies.    The park will be administered by a special committee to be  formed by senior executives from Shih Cheng and companies  investing in the park instead of being managed by government  authorities as the Hsinchu science-based industrial park in  northern Taiwan.    Nevertheless, the government will invest billions of dollars  in constructing transport and telecommunications facilities  inside the park and its surrounding areas to help attract  investors to the park, ranking officials said.</p>

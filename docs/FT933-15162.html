			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Dollars 3bn fund is mostly recycled THE Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) privatisation fund offered to President Boris Yeltsin by Group of Seven leaders yesterday is the latest illustration of the numbers game being played by the west to demonstrate support for Russian reforms without digging too deeply into its pocket. Although G7 leaders successfully dodged questions as to how much of the money was new, the bulk of the Dollars 3bn has been diverted from aid and lending programmes announced earlier. It includes Dollars 1bn in export credits from individual countries, two Dollars 500m loans from the World Bank, Dollars 425m in loans and equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Dollars 100m from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's hard loans arm. Of the additional Dollars 500m in technical assistance only Dollars 125m from the US was openly stated to be new money. Last-minute help from the EBRD enabled the fund to be pushed up to Dollars 3bn. In the multilateral organisation's defence, they have been hard pressed to spend money pledged so far, given the inefficiency of the Russian bureaucracy and the country's lack of market mechanisms for distributing funds to newly privatised companies.</p>

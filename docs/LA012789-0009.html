			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE FOES CONCEDE PAY HIKE VICTORY;  </P> <P> GOP BLOC ACCUSES WRIGHT OF BARRING OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE  </P> <P> Republicans admitted defeat Thursday in their uphill battle to stop a 50% pay  raise for members of Congress, federal judges and top executive branch  officials but vowed to try later this year to cancel the congressional part.  </P> <P> A back-bench bloc of GOP opponents accused Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) of  preventing a vote before the Feb. 8 deadline by scheduling only brief, pro  forma sessions of the House during the next two weeks.  </P> <P> "We have the same chance that a high school team has against the San Francisco  49ers," said Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), alluding to the Super Bowl victors.  "We're down to the two-minute drill, but the defense is strong, and we can't  budge the Speaker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expect Ban on Honorariums  </P> <P> A spokesman for Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) said, however, that GOP leaders in  the House agreed with top Democrats to let the pay raise take effect without a  vote and then follow it up "within days" with legislation to ban honorariums to  members of Congress by special interest groups.  </P> <P> In addition, according to Coelho press aide David Dreyer, a bipartisan group of  four House members is considering how to ban the practice of allowing lawmakers  to convert unspent campaign funds to their personal use when they leave  Congress. Current restrictions on such funds apply only to members who took  office after 1980, and the new measure would be directed at those elected  earlier.  </P> <P> "This would be tough and comprehensive legislation," the aide said.  </P> <P> While the Senate is expected to vote against the pay raise proposed by a White  House commission and endorsed by then-President Ronald Reagan, it will take  effect at 12:01 a.m. Feb. 8 unless the House also turns it down. Under the  system used in setting the raises, they can go into effect without an  affirmative vote.  </P> <P> "For some senators, it's a case of 'vote no but take the dough,' " complained  Rep. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.).  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Force Showdown  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa) said, however, that he and others are determined to  force a showdown in the House later this year on the increase, which boosts  Congress members' salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 a year.  </P> <P> "You can run, but you can't hide from this issue forever," Tauke said. "It's  just devastating to try and deal with the deficit when members of Congress are  the first ones at the public trough."  </P> <P> Since Democrats control the scheduling of legislative business, he said, foes  of the pay raise would have to work out a coordinated strategy to force a vote  on legislation rolling back the increase, at least for members of Congress.  </P> <P> Rep. Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said he was disappointed that Reagan did not  scale back the pay increase recommended last month by a special commission  headed by Lloyd N. Cutler, a Washington attorney.  </P> <P> "A 50% increase is way out of line," Nielson said, adding that only two people  out of thousands who attended meetings in his district are in favor of the pay  raise.  </P> <P> Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said he is concerned that congressional staff  members and federal government workers also would demand large pay raises,  touching off an "inflationary psychology" at the wrong time.  </P> <P> Members of Congress, he said, spend too much time around people with big  incomes. "They lose sight of people barely getting by on $40,000 or $20,000 a  year. It would be a slap in the face to them to take the raise."  </P> <P> An angry Rep. Joe Skeen (R-N.M.) declared that he was not going to accept the  additional $45,500 a year.  </P> <P> "I'm going to give it to my favorite charity, the U.S. Treasury, and hope that  they use it to reduce the deficit," he said. "We haven't earned it."  </P> <P> Despite their collective fury, the protesting Republicans said they are far  outnumbered by their colleagues, both Republican and Democratic, who are  silently going along with the pay raise.  </P> <P> Only 42 members, including 15 Democrats, have signed a resolution of  disapproval and even fewer joined in a letter to Wright demanding that he allow  a vote on the pay increase, Smith said.  </P> <P> A typical stance was taken by the new House Republican Whip Richard Cheney of  Wyoming.  </P> <P> "He has said that if it comes to the floor, he'll vote against it," an aide  said of Cheney. The way it looked Thursday, however, he won't have to redeem  that pledge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE FEDERAL PAY RAISE  </P> <P> Congress is now not expected to block pay hikes that become law on Feb. 8 as a  result of recommendations by a White House commission.

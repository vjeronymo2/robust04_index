			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead Imperial Chemical Industries reports its second quarter results on Thursday, when it is expected to produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 200m-Pounds 240m, down from Pounds 309m for the same quarter last year. One analyst said that if the company cuts the dividend, the results on the market would be cataclysmic. The main points of interest will include the results of the pharmaceuticals division. Analysts will be looking at the extent of the decline in Tenormin sales in the US since the expiry of its patents. The extent to which the new drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan, have made up Tenormin's decline will also be key. Otherwise, agrochemicals are likely to be disappointing, and analysts will be watching the state of the basic chemicals market to see if there has been any sign of an upturn. The chairman's statement about future prospects will be closely examined. Midland Bank becomes the first of the Big Four banks to announce its its half-year results on Thursday. The results are largely of historical interest since Midland was taken over last month by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and will not pay a dividend to its former shareholders. Last time round a poor performance on its UK banking operations drove Midland into a loss of Pounds 71m. This year it should be back in the black. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are predicting pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m, but a possible write-back of sovereign debt could make the figure even higher. Lloyds Bank will report on Friday interim pre-tax profits or around Pounds 355m against Pounds 331m a year earlier. It is likely to increase its interim dividend by about 15 per cent to 6.29 net. The result will underline its performance as the best of the clearing banks.</p>

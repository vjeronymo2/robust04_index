			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Anjan Roy] </F>   [Text] You can hardly open a day's newspaper without coming  to some report or other of proposals for investment in India  from overseas corporations. There are reports of the largest  and most prestigious transnational corporations proposing to  invest in India. There are reports also of smaller firms coming  forward with project proposals. The fact of the matter is that  international investors are now thinking of pumping in funds  into India which had until now shunned the country. The figures  released by the union Industry Ministry of late on foreign  direct investment proposals so far having been cleared by the  government in the last two and a half years show a distinct  spurt. No less than 131.6 billion rupees of investment  proposals have been approved since the reform program was  launched. Of these proposals, the largest amount originated  from the United States, notwithstanding the periodical outburst  of the U.S. Government on various issues touching India and its  concerns. If anything, the pragmatism of the U.S. investors goes  to show the inherent attractiveness of India as the land for  growth.    As such, the growth potentials of the developed countries  are  limited in various sectors and fresh opportunities could be  explored only in the developing third world. Among the Third  World countries almost all agree on the context of being an  oft-repeated cliche, only two countries have growth  opportunities, that is, India and China. The figures released  also indicate that the interest in India is fairly widespread.  If, as the largest economy, U.S. will have a natural interest  in all major markets, smaller countries looking for investment  of their surplus also think it fit to take a go in India. Oman,  for example, has sought approval for investment to the tune of  5.43 billion rupees in various projects in the country. The  Foreign Investment Approval Board has cleared proposals for  investment from United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Netherlands,  Japan, Mexico, Ireland, France, Mauritius, Italy, and Hong Kong.    The willingness of the Non-Resident Indians [NRI's] have  also  changed remarkably. The figures reveal that from a figure of  over 38 billion rupees in 1992, the NRI's have mooted  investments of over 88 billion rupees. Translating these  foreign investment proposals calls for spending up the Indian  bureaucracy to an altogether new mode of functioning. After  all, actual investments could come to pass only if several other  conditions are also fulfilled. The process of liberalization  should make sure that the administration does not sit over small  procedural matters. At the same time,it is imperative on the  authorities to be more vigilant about the flow of such funds.  In the wake of the liberalization process, ardent advocates  have emerged who are lobbying for indiscriminate entry of all.  They have argued that the investments should be allowed  wherever the investments want them to be and then the market  forces will in the long run decide what survives.    There is certainly some logic in allowing funds in. After  all, India does not suffer much and the foreign direct  investment will willy-nilly create assets in this country only.  Hence, investments might be as well allow inactivities which  have so far been considered not core sectors [sentence as  heard]. But, the question arises in the end whether there is  any room for indigenous technology, preferences or entereprise  in this country. Do we have to take hamburgers rather than  samosas [a popular Indian hot dish] or sweetened aerated water  manufactured by multinational corporations exactly in the way  the world does?</p>

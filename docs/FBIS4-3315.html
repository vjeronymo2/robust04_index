			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Shun] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egypt's Foreign Minister  'Amur Musa said today that President Husni Mubarak's forthcoming  visit to China will be of political and economic importance.    China, as a major power, plays a key role in world affairs,  Musa told a press conference on the eve of Mubarak's visit which  takes place from April 21 to 23.    Praising relations between China and Egypt and between  President Mubarak and the Chinese leadership as time-tested and  distinguished, the foreign minister said that intensive  consultations between the two countries over the past 10 years  have laid down a base for further promotion of Sino-Egyptian  relations.    A number of economic agreements will be concluded during  this  visit, Musa said.    He said Egypt and China enjoy close ties. Egypt is the first  Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of  China.    Since 1956, friendly relations have developed on the basis  of  understanding and mutual cooperation.    He said Egypt supports China's joining of the GATT  agreement,  adding China's tremendous development in industry and free zones  calls for enhanced co-operation between the two nations.    Musa voiced hope that the volume of trade between the two  countries will increase. The two-way trade stood at 224 million  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Musa will leave Cairo Wednesday [27 April] and join the  delegation accompanying President Mubarak during his official  visit to China. Mubarak is now in Oman.</p>

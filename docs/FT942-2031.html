			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly details plan for non-core sell-off Eli Lilly yesterday spelt out details of plans to shed its non-pharmaceuticals businesses, including an initial public offering later this year for a new medical devices company with sales of Dollars 800m. In January, the US drugs company had indicated that it planned to group six of its devices businesses into a single company for later sale. Under the plan announced yesterday, though, one of these six, Ivac, would be sold separately. Lilly said this was because the company operated in a different market than the others, and that it would benefit more from being bought by another company. It added that it was in talks for the sale of the business, but refused to name a potential buyer. The remaining five businesses, all of which operate in the area of cardiovascular or minimally invasive systems, will be floated in the fourth quarter of this year, Lilly said. The intention is to sell 20 per cent of the shares in this new company, to be known as Guidant, with the remaining shares being distributed to Lilly shareholders within the following six months. This would either be done by issuing shares in the new company to existing Lilly shareholders, or allowing Lilly shareholders to exchange some of their shares for shares in the new company.</p>

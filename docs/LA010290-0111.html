			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BIG THREE'S SALES SLUMP 22% IN MID-DECEMBER FROM YEAR AGO  </P> <P> Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks by the Big Three slumped 22%  in mid-December from a year earlier, when buyers rushed showrooms to take  advantage of expiring incentives, the companies said today.  </P> <P> General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported that their  vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 25,795 during the Dec. 11-20 period  last year compared with a rate of 33,082 during the same time in 1988.  </P> <P> Car sales dropped 27.4%, while sales of light trucks fell 13.3%.  </P> <P> A year ago, the Big Three had incentive programs in effect and set to expire  Dec. 31. As a result, buyers headed to dealerships to cash in on specials at  the year's end, normally a slow period for car and truck sales.  </P> <P> Since then, consumers have become numbed by incentives, and the market has been  saturated with new cars and trucks.  </P> <P> Among the Big Three, Ford's mid-December combined car and truck sales dropped  the most, falling 25.2% from a year ago. Chrysler's vehicle sales for  mid-December were down 22.8% and GM's sales fell 19.5%.  </P></p>

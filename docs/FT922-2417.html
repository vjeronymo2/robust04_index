			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tax setback for SA cable TV operator TURNOVER at M-Net, the South African cable television company, was up 50 per cent in the year to March. Pre-tax profits climbed 36 per cent. Turnover was R640.7m (Dollars 228.8), and pre-tax profits R62.8m. Operating profits, meanwhile, were 56 per cent higher at R70m, largely due to a growing subscriber base, up to 695,000 at March 31. The figures represent a a 27 per cent penetration of the colour television market. Profits were knocked, however, by a huge jump in tax, to R30.1m from R13.6m in 1991 - previous trading losses were fully absorbed in 1991 and there was a favourable abnormal item which did not recurr. Net profits were unchanged at R32.7m. However, while attributable profits were 18.5 per cent up at R27.8m, profits in 1991 were pulled down by a R9m extraordinary charge. M-Net, the third-largest subscription television service outside the US, has been a star performer on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange since its listing in August 1990 at R1. Last year it peaked at R8.60, but has since declined to R6.20 a share. This gives it a market capitalisation of about R1.22bn. Although management sees opportunities for growth in South Africa, it is looking overseas. M-Net is involved in cable television in Kenya and Namibia, and invested R260m in a consortium to buy FilmNet, a European subscription operation with about 500,000 subscribers in six countries.</p>

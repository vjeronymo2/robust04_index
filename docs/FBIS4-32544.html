			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Financing the  Electoral Campaign: Some Walk, Some Ride in Ferraris," published  on page 17 of the 30 April issue of the Skopje daily NOVA  MAKEDONIJA, journalist Sanja Vasic examines the problem of  election campaign financing in The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia (FYROM). As the autumn parliamentary elections  approach, Vasic writes, some examination of how to finance them  should be made. The parliamentarians, however, have set aside  consideration of the draft law on political parties, which is  supposed to regulate financing, as well as the law on  parliamentary elections, until the very end of their term of  office.    The elections are supposed to take place within six months,  Vasic says, and the issue of financing the electoral campaign is  crucial, especially for the extraparliamentary parties, because  they will not get much help from the state budget. According to  the proposed law, 30 percent of the funds budgeted for the  election are intended for the parties that received at least 3  percent of the votes in the last general election, held during  October-December 1990. The remainder are to be distributed to  the parties currently in parliament according to the number of  seats they hold. It remains to be seen whether the funds will be  available for use before the electoral campaign begins, Vasic  states. He notes that this is not the only "card" the  parliamentary parties can play, since they already have sizeable  funds at their disposal, as well as donations from abroad.  Whether that money will suffice, however, is debatable, Vasic  observes.    According to Vasic, the Social Democratic Alliance of  Macedonia (SDSM) is financed by membership dues, income from the  "Demokratija" publishing house, and donations. This party, which  is in the governing coalition, would like to have the draft law  passed in its current form, without setting spending limits, he  adds. In practice, the SDSM will attempt to respect the  prohibition on money from abroad, says Danco Petrovski, chef de  cabinet of the presidency of the SDSM, writes Vasic.    The VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity)  interprets the lack of progress on the law on political parties  as an indication that the government is intentionally blocking  the resolution of the issue of party financing in order to  restrict political activity by the opposition, reports Vasic. He  cites Dosta Dimovska, the party's deputy chairman, "The parties  in the governing coalition have an extensive source of financing  through the property that they have at their disposal, from dark  recesses in the budget, and from their control over enterprises,  but they block adoption of the law on political parties."  According to Vasic, the VMRO-DPMNE sees limitations on donations  as unnecessary. It considers that enormous amounts are necessary  for campaigns and that there should be a way to equalize  resources. Although the VMRO-DPMNE receives occasional gifts,  the party has no foreign donors. Dimovska also says: "As far as  sympathizers in the business community are concerned, we keep  their identity secret because of government repression."    Vasic reports that the Liberal Party, another member of the  governing coalition, is preparing its strategy and is concerned  that contributions to political parties might lead to certain  groups or individuals having undue influence. Ace Kocevski, the  Liberal Party secretary, says there is a need for a precise law.    Civic Liberal Party Chairman Boris Geraj comments that  extraparliamentary parties do not have a chance in the area of  financing. He believes that budget funds should be distributed  equally or not at all. "Some go on foot, others in Ferraris,"  Geraj points out. In his opinion, business interests are  self-serving and financing from them should be excluded.</p>

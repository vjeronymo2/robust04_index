			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Setback in drugs sector Pharmaceuticals heavyweight Glaxo Holdings led the fall in dollar influenced stocks yesterday. The US currency's two-year low against sterling, combined with bearish sector-related data, saw Glaxo shares marked down 23 before rallying to close 16 1/2 off at 598 1/2 p after 5.4m traded. The drop was accentuated by some slightly disappointing third-quarter figures from US leader Merck. Also, a sharp fall in US sales of SmithKline Beecham's ulcer drug Tagamet, highlighted in the group's third-quarter figures, had prompted fears that Glaxo's headline ulcer product Zantac could be facing stiff competition as well. However, it was pointed out that recent prescription data showed Zantac sales holding up well in the US. SmithKline declined 6 to 429p, while anticipation that Cadbury Schweppes might buy its Ribena and Lucozade arm saw Cadbury firm a penny to 445p. Wellcome receded 9 to finish at 671p.</p>

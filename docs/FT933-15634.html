			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (5): Opportunities with high risks - Direct investment in the Balkans is increasing GREEK businessmen who trade in the Balkans are used to setting up unusual deals. Still, the entrepreneur who was offered a Russian nuclear submarine 'whole or in parts' while in Romania admitted to being surprised. It is widely acknowledged in Athens that doing business in Romania, Bulgaria and Albania offers opportunities not to be found elsewhere, in spite of the high risks. Greek companies have set up more than 1,200 joint ventures in these countries, though only a few hundred are active on a regular basis. Direct investment by Greek companies is gradually increasing, especially in Bulgaria where the framework for foreign investment is less uncertain. A recent study by Ekome, a private Greek research organisation, notes that bureaucracy is a difficulty to be overcome before setting up in Bulgaria but there are few administrative problems once businesses are in operation. It says that contracts are generally respected and distribution networks are adequate. Although Bulgaria's privatisation programme is far behind schedule, foreign companies can take over state-owned enterprises there, with government approval being granted on a case-by-case basis. The experience of Hellenic Bottling Company, the Coca-cola franchise-holder for Greece and Northern Ireland, illustrates how the existing infrastructure can be adapted. HBC holds majority stakes in four joint ventures set up with state-owned bottling plants around Bulgaria to produce Coca-Cola and a minority stake in a similar venture in Sofia. Its total investment is budgeted at Dollars 25m. 'We were going into completely unknown territory, with no idea how long it would take to start up. Our partners are local co-operatives, together with the central co-operative organisation,' says Mr Gerry Reidy, managing director. HBC found there was a 'critical mass on which to build a business' with soft drink consumption at the same per capita level as in Greece in 1981, he adds. The company's investment covers upgrading and extension of buildings, machinery and distribution vehicles. With four in operation from the start of this year, the joint venture has started to show a return, with pre-tax profits totalling Dollars 600,000 by last month. The main difficulty, according to Mr Reidy, lay in changing the attitudes of a workforce indifferent to how the business was being run. Language was also a problem, with comparatively few English-speakers available. HBC intends to avoid these problems in Romania, where it plans a similar-sized investment, by starting production of Coca-Cola on two greenfield sites. The company has a franchise covering more than one third of the country. The other high-profile Greek investor in Romania and Bulgaria is Intralot, a subsidiary of Intracom, the telecommunications and software equipment producer in which Ericsson of Sweden has a 12 per cent stake. Intralot will launch an electronic lottery game, based on one developed for the Russian market, in Romania next month. The company is providing systems and equipment for Ralps, the state lottery organisation to operate the 'lotto' game. It has made a similar deal with Bulgaria's state lottery, the Bulgarian Sports Totalizator, due to start up by the end of this year. The lottery games are the first stage in Intracom's efforts to position itself in what it sees as a promising market for telecommunications and informatics. Mr Costas Tsoukalidis, technical director of Intracom, says: 'We feel the big international telecoms operators have the edge in winning public sector contracts funded through aid programmes to eastern Europe. But there will be plenty of other opportunities developing.' In the wake of the businessmen, Greek banks are also entering the Balkan market. Credit Bank, the largest Greek private bank, is setting up a bank in Bucharest in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has taken a 25 per cent equity stake. Xiosbank, a private bank controlled by the Vardinoyannis shipping and oil group, has been given a licence to set up the first foreign bank branch in Sofia. Its main task will be to back up the group's rapidly expanding operations in Bulgaria. These range from a network of petrol stations and car dealerships to hotels and even a fashionable hairdressing establishment in Sofia. The bank also expects to attract business from Greek-Bulgarian joint ventures and Bulgarian exporters. 'The Bulgarian central bank is trying hard to comply with European Community banking requirements. There are few problems with repatriation of funds. The main problem we have is finding staff because there are so few real bankers,' says Mr Christos Katsanis of Xiosbank. There is less activity in Albania because of the small market and the absence of even basic infrastructure. However, that has not deterred Greek businessmen from setting up small-scale projects, mainly in textile production and food processing, with the help of an extension of Greece's investment incentives law to cover much of Albania. In addition, trade with Albania can now be handled in drachmas rather than hard currency under a special dispensation from the Bank of Greece. With more than 200,000 Albanian migrant workers in Greece sending cash home regularly, drachmas are widely available in Albania. Mr Spyros Patseas, managing director of a trading company, says: 'Being able to work with drachmas in Albania makes it possible to build more solid relationships there.'</p>

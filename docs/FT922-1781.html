			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Claremont in Pounds 27m expansion CLAREMONT Garment (Holdings), which last year demerged from Alexon, the women's wear retailer, is set to become one of the top six women's clothing suppliers to Marks and Spencer following its acquisition of rival supplier J&amp;J Fashions. Claremont is paying Pounds 27m for J&amp;J, a private company. Some Pounds 16.5m of the consideration will be paid in cash and convertible loan notes to J&amp;J's founders, Jennifer and Ian Rosenburg. Claremont will also take on Pounds 10.5m of J&amp;J's debts. To finance the purchase and pay back some of the enlarged group's borrowings Claremont is calling for Pounds 22.4m via a 2-for-5 rights issue at 205p. The timing of the acquisition was welcomed by analysts and the company's shares closed down only 1p at 255p. Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said the combined group would supply about 8 per cent of M and S's ladies' clothing. 'This gives us the flexibility to supply Marks and Spencer over a range of ladies wear. They know about the deal and are pleased to see us do it,' he said. Claremont, which is based in County Durham, is stronger on classic designs with emphasis on blouses, suits and children's wear. J&amp;J is more fashion-orientated and mainly supplies dresses, skirts and leisure wear. Nearly 93 per cent of the combined group's sales of Pounds 108m will be supplied to Marks and Spencer. 'It's a very exciting prospect for us. It's a good fit,' Mr Wiegand said. Claremont made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m from turnover of Pounds 47.8m in the eleven months to December 28. That compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 300,000 from sales of Pounds 55.8m for J&amp;J last year. Mr Wiegand said the expanded group's gearing, taking the Pounds 9m of convertible loan notes as debt, would increase to 25-30 per cent from Claremont's present level of 15 per cent. The acquisition would be 'broadly earnings neutral' this year, but would contribute next, the company said. Mrs Rosenburg will join Claremont as an executive director with a two-year service contract at Pounds 100,000 per year. Claremont said it expected some benefits from merging the companies, although there would be Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m of rationalisation costs in the next 18 months.</p>

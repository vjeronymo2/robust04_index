			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Books: No hero needed: Fiction RUM PUNCH Elmore Leonard Viking Pounds 14.99, 297 pages AT THE start, Elmore Leonard puts you right there: 'Chris Mankowski's last day on the job, two in the afternoon, two hours to go, he got a call to dispose of a bomb'; or, 'Dale Crowe Junior told Kathy Baker, his probation officer, he didn't see where he had done anything wrong.' Those are from Freaky Deaky and Maximum Bob, Leonard's best to date. Rum Punch, Leonard's 30th and latest, opens with a sentence that gives you who's doing what to whom, and where: 'Sunday morning, Ordell took Louis to watch the white-power demonstration in downtown Palm Beach.' Perfect. This new one is par for Leonard. Jackie is a flight attendant caught with Dollars 50,000 out of Grand Bahama into Miami. She does a deal with the cops and finds herself in a Bahamian triangle consisting of an arms dealer called Ordell, a bail bondsman (business card, 'Gentlemen Prefer Bonds') called Max, and an ex-con called Louis Gara. She promises to hand Ordell to the cops, and fixes with Max to walk off with Dollars 500,000 of Ordell's arms money while he's doing time in Club Fed. This is typical of the Leonard genre. But how good is Leonard? Or as he says in Get Shorty, 'Guy thinks he's mean. I wouldn't mind you ran into him. See if he's real.' Leonard began writing professionally at 42 in 1967; he had been in advertising, and turned his pen to sharp Westerns and a series of beautifully messy, unpretentious thrillers. He has few heroes; his characters are often confused middle-intelligence low-lifers on the make, trying to pull some modest scam that invariably goes wrong. There are three things, all connected with the changing shape of Leonard's America, that set him apart from his forbears in the 1940s and 1950s, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Ross Macdonald. First, Leonard writes provincial thrillers, sets them in LA, Miami, Detroit; he avoids the big-city image just as he avoids industry knowledge (racing, diamonds). He writes about cities the way Randy Newman sings about them: messy and bleak. Second, Leonard has no narrator, no Lew Archer or Philip Marlowe; the scene follows the viewpoint of whoever Leonard is writing about: 'Now it was the hip place to be in South Florida. Guys with sunglasses in their hair posed skinny girls on the beach and photographed them. There was no place to park any more on ocean drive.' His characters are diverse, seeing the world in terms of their own prejudice: white trash, niggers, Hispanics. Third, Leonard writes dialogue like film, straight from Damon Runyon and David Mamet, 'You understand how this woman thinks? You do, huh? It even makes sense to you.' Where a Chandler or Macdonald character will lurk in the shadow, light a cigarette, a Leonard character will introduce himself with a statement-question: 'the fock's goin' on.' The verbal energy comes from either doing or saying: 'He racked the slide and stuck the gun inside his coveralls, saying to Louis, 'You ready? Let's shake and bake.'' Leonard is unremittingly direct and precise, the action only as complicated as it needs to be. Each scene starts as close to the end as possible. There are no fancy murders, the victims are shot five times or thrown off a fifteen-floor building. In Rum Punch, Ordell visits a suspect out on bail: 'He shot him in his bare chest. He seemed to cave in like the air was let out of him and Ordell put one in his head. Loud. Man, but it was a nasty gun the way it jumped and felt like it stung your hand . . .' The Leonard genre is not the classic detective novel. He avoids designer crime, and grafts the casual violence onto the local stock. These are never whodunits, they never involve big conspiracies, just local difficulty of the worst kind. The other Leonard trademarks, alongside the muscular dialogues and tricksy shifts of narrative, are an encyclopedic interest in light arms (Rum Punch reels with Uzis, AK-47s, Smith &amp; Wessons), cars ('Olds Ninety-Eight, 12-gauge in the trunk'), and drugs. He peoples the action with colourful dead-ends, like Zorro, the Puerto Rican burglar with swords, hyper women and partners called pistolocos. The genre, especially the recent novels, can be kind to women. There is little exploitative sex, even if it goes with sun and sea in Florida. His women are assertive, if not in charge. He rewrites the cliches for them. At the end of Rum Punch, Jackie has got away with the Dollars 500,000 and Max the bail bondsman has helped her. Will they split? 'She walked around to the other side and looked across the low black Mercedes at him. 'Come on, Max. I'll take you away from all this.''</p>

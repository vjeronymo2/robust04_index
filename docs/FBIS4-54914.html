			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Statement by Alliance of Free </F> Democrats Professionals: Insolvency Is Out of Question"]    [Text] SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] Representatives  Gyula Gaal, Karoly Attila Soos, and Marton Tardos had this to  say: "At a news conference on 19 April, Gyula Horn and Laszlo  Bekesi (...) mentioned that a threat of insolvency exists in  Hungary. We regard this supposition as unfortunate and  groundless, the same way as we regard the shrill sound of the  government's success propaganda coming from the other side. The  fact is that the MNB [Hungarian National Bank] is successful in  floating bonds in the international market place, and this  fact--indicating confidence in our country--has not been changed  even by the extraordinarily grave deterioration of our  international balance of payments last year. (...) There is no  basis for leaders of a party that prepares itself to play a role  in governance, and to direct long-term processes, to make the  above-quoted, oddly pessimistic statement."</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Court to rule on councils The High Court will decide tomorrow on applications by three local authorities for judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposals for council reorganisation in north-east England. A government decision on the area has already been delayed. The commission said it had failed to consider about 500 letters from local interests that were sent before the closing date for consultation. As a result an unprecedented supplementary report on the area will be published. It seems unlikely, however, that the supplementary report will make significant changes to the recommendations. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, must wait until the commission's reports are complete before announcing any decisions on the area. If the appeal for judicial review is successful the process could be further delayed. Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils, and Ryedale, a district in North Yorkshire, are all dissatisfied with recommendations which would see the creation of five all-purpose unitary councils north of the Humber in place of the current two-tier system. They say the commission failed to consider properly the possibility of maintaining the two-tier status quo, and to carry out proper consultations.</p>

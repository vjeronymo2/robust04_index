			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez  announced during a news conference on 7 January stricter  security measures for all of Mexico City's public services.    [Begin Aguilera recording] Additional measures will be taken  on a provisional basis. They are aimed at guaranteeing the  safety of all government facilities in the city. Given their  characteristics, some of these preventive measures might cause  some discomfort to the individuals who approach those public  offices, but we believe it is worthwhile to take a few minutes  and allow a careful search. [end recording]    Aguilera said the electric pylons downed by a group of  people in Michoacan and Puebla were intended to interrupt Mexico  City's electricity supply, but this did not happen, thanks to  the Federal Electricity Commission's intervention, he added.    [Begin Aguilera recording] They did not achieve their goal,  thanks to the timely and efficient intervention of the Federal  Electricity Commission, and the damage caused to the electric  pylons did not interrupt the city's electricity supply. [end  recording]    The federal district mayor also said the permanent revision  and inspection of public facilities will be performed by the  public offices' own security personnel and will not require the  Army's support. The federal district mayor said there are still  no reports that people involved with the armed group, which  operates in Chiapas State, are in Mexico City. He added:  Nevertheless, authorities have located some pamphlets and  printed matter which refer to that armed group.    Mr. Manuel Aguilera Gomez said the life of Mexico City's  residents is continuing as normal, and these security measures  in public facilities will be of a provisional nature.</p>

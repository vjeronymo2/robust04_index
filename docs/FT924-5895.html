			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BZW lifts profits from dealing in sterling bonds THE sterling bond business of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of the UK clearing bank, last year made profits of Pounds 25.7m (Dollars 39m), or more than half of total profits reported by gilt-edged market makers for 1991. BZW's results, up from Pounds 13.4m the year before, were particularly notable given the decline in profits at several of the other highly profitable gilts firms. Most marketmakers contacted yesterday said that results for 1992 would be significantly better than last year, suggesting that their overall profits would be well up on the Pounds 49m they made between them in 1991. The profit figures are not directly comparable: taken from official returns to Companies House made by Gilt-Edged Market Makers, which operate as separately capitalised companies, some of the results include activity in Eurosterling and even marketmaking in Ecu. It is thought that most banks include Eurosterling in these companies, given the lighter capital regime under which they operate. Mr Stephen Rumsey, of BZW's gilts business, said the increase reflected an upturn in business across the board, and not the effect of substantial position-taking. 'We're not a house that goes for really big swings in the market,' he said. Of this year, which has seen greater issuing activity in sterling, he said: 'We're very happy with 1992.' Other houses to record an upturn in profits included UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which returned Pounds 7.5m after a loss of Pounds 0.8m the year before, and Goldman Sachs, where profits were up from Pounds 0.6m to Pounds 5.3m. NatWest, meanwhile, turned a loss of Pounds 3.2m into a profit of Pounds 1.7m. Some of the most profitable houses in 1990, meanwhile, recorded a sharp fall in profits in the following year. Greenwell Montagu, one of the biggest gilt marketmakers, recorded a fall in profits from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 3.5m. Mr Mike Higgins, head of Greenwell, said: 'Profits fluctuate all the time. We are marketmakers to a lot of large institutions all day, every day, all year. That leads to fluctuations in our profits.' He said that Greenwell had been profitable every year since Big Bang apart from one, adding: 'Our profit for 1992 is substantially more than 1991.' Lehman Brothers recorded a fall from Pounds 9.3m to around Pounds 3m in 1991.</p>

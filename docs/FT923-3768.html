			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Increased costs behind 20% shortfall at Nurdin NURDIN &amp; PEACOCK, the cash and carry wholesaler, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall in interim profits mainly due to one-off items. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 5.89m in the six months to June 28. This followed profits of Pounds 29.3m last year. Turnover increased 8.8 per cent to Pounds 704.1m, in spite of what the company described as 'exceptionally difficult' trading conditions. Two new stores were opened during the period, in Manchester and Leeds, which lifted group sales. Further stores are due to open in Glasgow and Brighton before the year end. Mr Richard Fulford, chairman, said the performance was 'creditable' given conditions on the high street. The company, which is increasing sales of own-brand labels such as Happy Chef and has almost competed the introduction of laser scanning, intends to continue to concentrate on controlling costs. The new store openings contributed to a sharp increase in the cost of sales to Pounds 693.5m (Pounds 636.4m), and reduced gross profits to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 11m). Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.3m and losses on property disposals of Pounds 419,000 also depressed profits. Lower interest rates led to a fall in interest earnings to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.39m). Rental income also fell slightly to Pounds 385,000 (Pounds 425,000). Earnings slipped to 3.08p (3.87p) but the dividend is maintained at 1.96p.</p>

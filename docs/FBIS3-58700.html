They  agreed that the organizational work should be speeded up in view  of the official opening. In this respect, the Spanish  Government will provide the offices until a new building be  built. While awaiting the meeting of the management committee  and of the budget committee -- the two management bodies of the  office, which will open in the second half of March -- the  initial staffing for this year will be limited to 20  individuals. This figure could rise to 50 next year and reach  220 to 260 when the office is fully operational.    Given the numerous preparatory tasks for setting up of the  office, it is estimated that the first application for a  Community trademark can only be made at the office 18 to 24  months after the regulations have come into force.    The Council adopted the regulations at its 20 December 1993  meeting, 13 years after the first proposal on Community  trademarks was made.    An important step has been made on the way to the full  materialization of the internal market. For the first time, a  new title of industrial property on a European scale has been  created. This title, which will be good for 10 years and will  be renewable, will be delivered by the office established by the  regulations, the headquarters of which will be in Alicante,  Spain.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "AIST Plans Large-Scale Review of JIS </F> Including Environment and Consumer"]    [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology  (AIST), Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has  established a new long-term plan as a part of a large-scale  review of Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) which are the  domestic standards for mining and manufacturing industrial  products. The existing standards, which were created from the  viewpoint of manufacturers and suppliers, will incorporate with  the objective of promoting products that are kind to the elderly  and environment. The new long-term plan will be completed by the  summer of 1995 and will be the focus of "The 8th Industrial  Standardization Promotion Project" which will start in fiscal  1996.    The Japan Industrial Standards Investigation Committee  (JISC)  (Kozo Iizuka, acting chairman), which is the JIS consulting  organ, soon will set up a special subcommittee for establishment  of the new program and begin specific deliberations. The  subcommittee will review details of existing standards and how  they are defined with an eye toward the arrival of an aging  society and a growing awareness of environmental preservation  will deliberate on the creation of domestic standards that are  consistent with international standards, and compile proposals  by next year.    Consumer goods such as daily necessities account for about  20  percent of JIS certified products, but many of the existing  standards were created for quality control and to reduce costs  on the manufacturer's side, and there often has been criticism  that they lack consideration for consumer protection. For this  reason, the JISC is proceeding withits review of standards by  revising JIS definition guidelines to include considerations for  the elderlyp.</p>

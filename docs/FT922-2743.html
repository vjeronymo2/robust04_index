			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Britain to keep tough law against rabies BRITISH Farm Minister John Gummer said yesterday the UK would be able to keep tough anti-rabies laws when the European Community completes its single market after 1992, Reuter reports from Luxembourg. 'We have ensured that Britain will remain rabies-free,' he said during a meeting of European Community farm ministers. Britain, keen to keep the island free of the disease, had been worried that pets and other animals would be able to get into the country without going into quarantine first. Now ministers have agreed that dealers will be able to import dogs and cats to Britain without quarantine provided the animals fulfil strict health criteria and pass blood tests to show they are rabies-free on entering the country. But when the Commission gets round to drafting proposals for pets travelling with their owners, Britain has been promised legislation that would be at least as tough as its current quarantine laws, Mr Gummer said. The Commission had floated the idea of 'pet passports' certifying animals as disease-free, but Mr Gummer said the plan agreed yesterday ruled this out.</p>

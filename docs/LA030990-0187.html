			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FAMILY TIES;  </P> <P> MAYO SCION GETS FINE, REBUKE  </P> <P> The grandson of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic has been fined $4,000 by  the Minnesota Board of Medical Examiners for not diagnosing illnesses in his  patients.  </P> <P> During his 16 years with Group Health in the Twin Cities, Dr. Charles H. Mayo  II failed to diagnosis lung cancer in one patient, leukemia in another, skin  cancer in a third, and a broken forearm in a fourth, according to a document  signed by Mayo and Dr. George B. Martin, chairman of the board's discipline  committee.  </P> <P> The four cases were among nine on which the board criticized the 59-year-old  family doctor, citing records provided by the health maintenance organization.  Group Health submitted copies of its internal review of Mayo to the board in  1987, about the time Mayo left to go into private practice.  </P> <P> "It wasn't like he had nothing but problems," Group Health spokeswoman Pam  Effertz said. "He was getting good results with many patients. As a matter of  fact, some people will tell you what a caring doctor he was, and how he would  give some elderly patients a ride home himself."  </P> <P> Mayo said he felt "put upon," and that his famous name was a factor in the  review.  </P></p>

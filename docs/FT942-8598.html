			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed as fresh trading range sought US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday as the market sought to establish a fresh trading range in the wake of the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 87 21/32 , with the yield rising to 7.268 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note gained  3/16 to 99 15/32 , to yield 5.773 per cent. The pull-back at the long end of the maturity range reflected a modest adjustment after the previous session's powerful rally. On Tuesday, prices on the 30-year issue jumped nearly 2 points when the central bank announced a decision to lift the Federal Funds and the discount rate by 50 basis points each, to 4.25 per cent and 3.50 per cent respectively. In addition to easing traders' concern over inflation, the Fed removed the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market by strongly suggesting that no further rate increases were likely until the end of the summer. Although the market was generally encouraged by the Fed's action, there was fresh concern over the continued weakness of the dollar, which failed to gather strength against the yen and fell against D-mark on the foreign exchange markets. Traders are worried about the failure of the currency to respond to the Fed's rate increases because a weak dollar discourages investment in US-denominated securities. As a result the long bond failed to extend Tuesday's gains but finished well off its lows reached in early afternoon. UK gilts held on to initial gains despite a sharp fall early in the day triggered by data showing an unexpected increase in average earnings. Gilts rallied initially, fuelled by overnight gains in the US market following the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates. But they fell back after the publication of a raft of economic data and the minutes of the March 30 meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. Average earnings rose at an annual rate of 4 per cent in March, higher than expected, and a sign of growing inflationary pressures. The Bank of England has highlighted wage growth as one of the main risks to the UK inflation outlook. Other data however pointed to a more optimistic prospect for inflation. Headline inflation increased at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in April  - which was below expectations - and the minutes of the meeting showed no serious disagreement between the chancellor and the governor. Analysts said it was significant that they had discussed the possibility of cutting interest rates further and that neither had even mentioned raising rates. This information caused the market to recover before it eased slightly in later trading on profit-taking. The long gilt future was up  1/2 point at 105 29/32 in late trading. French bonds put on a strong performance, boosted by hopes of an interest rate cut at today's meeting of the central bank's monetary policy council. Traders are hoping for a 10 basis points reduction in its 5 1/2 per cent intervention rate. Switching out of German into French bonds continued, causing the yield spread of the benchmark 10-year OAT over its German counterpart to narrow further to around 33 basis points, from 41 on Tuesday. The June notional bond contract on Matif rose 1.12 point to 122.22. Italian bonds also shone, spurred by hopes that the confidence vote in the Senate for prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government would pass successfully. While some traders said a positive vote for the government would push prices even higher, Mr Andre de Silva, bond strategist at PaineWebber in London, said such an outcome 'was already reflected in (yesterday's) price action' and would lead to a knee-jerk reaction, at best. The June BTP futures contract on Liffe rose about 0.90 point on the day to 113.40. German bonds put on a lacklustre performance, despite the Bundesbank's 12-basis-point cut in its securities repurchase rate to 5.23 per cent. Traders reported continued switching out of bunds into French, UK and US bonds. Mr Carl Haeling, head of the futures and options group at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, recommends short-term trading strategies, rather than longer-term commitments. 'We still see upside potential, but just as many downside risks - any rallies we'll get are more likely to be a continuation of the overall sideways pattern rather than any sustained upwards trend in prices.'</p>

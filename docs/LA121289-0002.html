			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING PEACE WORK  </P> <P> The spirit, if not the mortar, of the Berlin Wall has crumbled, pulling down  the Iron Curtain with it. President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev have  surveyed Europe from their Mediterranean summit, certified the presence of  Peace in Progress and tightened the deadline for sharp cuts in both nuclear  missiles and European battle forces.  </P> <P> Times columnist James Flanigan wrote recently that the meltdown of communism in  East Europe that led to the Malta summit will have a profound effect on the  world economy, comparable to"the opening of the New Worlds in the 16th  Century."  </P> <P> Nowhere in the United States will the implications of sweeping changes in  Europe be more important than in Southern California, home of 12 of every 100  people whose jobs depend on defense-related activities.  </P> <P> But dodging the dislocations in defense industries and seizing the  opportunities of change in Europe will require Washington to move faster than  it has so far.  </P> <P> The President's tentative decision to trim about $12 billion from defense next  fiscal year seems not to be based on any serious guidance about future defense  needs from the Pentagon. Aviation Week magazine said in a recent editorial that  the Pentagon's generals and colonels are charting future forces "with a blind  eye to the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> That is difficult to understand. After all, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  declares that the chances of a Soviet attack in Europe are smaller than at any  time since World War II -- a threat that few analysts took seriously in recent  years anyway.  </P> <P> If it is difficult to understand, it is impossible to tolerate. Unless the  Pentagon gives the White House a detailed account of the forces it needs to  adapt to change soon, Bush should create a national commission and staff to do  the job. A commission should be asked to analyze both military requirements and  trade opportunities with the detachment of global thinkers rather than the  front-line mentality that has dominated Pentagon policy for 10 years.  </P> <P> It should consist of creative thinkers in finance like Felix Rohatyn and former  Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson and any, or all, of the five living former  Defense secretaries. It should include leaders from the defense complex itself,  leaders with the broad view of Donald R. Beall, chairman of Rockwell  International, for example.  </P> <P> Flanigan also wrote that the United States could be a big winner in the New  World of the 20th Century. But will the winners include the companies that  out-built the Soviets in bombers, missiles, high-tech communications networks  and other weapons during 40 years of the Cold War?  </P> <P> In the short term, for example, a low threat of war in Europe means a need for  fewer troops.This may well mean that there is no role for a giant new C-17  troop transport now being built by McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach to airlift  American infantry to Europe on short notice.  </P> <P> It probably means that West Germany will continue to resist deploying  modernized short-range nuclear missiles. In these and other cases, would the  companies that would have built the transports and modernized the missiles be  the big losers in peace?  </P> <P> The answers to that question surely will turn up in Southern California first  because it not only has more jobs at stake than other parts of the country but  also is the leading region in aerospace.  </P> <P> The only available study of the consequences for the region of severe defense  cuts concludes that massive layoffs, plant closings and collapses of defense  companies are not likely. A five-year examination by the Southern California  Assn. of Governments concludes that even defense rollbacks on a scale  considered unthinkable a few short months ago might make life uncomfortable for  some companies but probably would leave the region's economy generally  unscathed.  </P> <P> For Southern California, as for the rest of the nation, economists say that  benefits of lower defense spending would include falling interest rates as  reduced defense spending takes pressure off the federal budget and defense  firms shift some of their resources into producing for the expanding global  economy.  </P> <P> The way we see the future, Southern California need not and should not simply  be grateful that the best economic projection says it will scrape through an  outbreak of peace. This area has devoted 50 years providing the industrial  creativity and energy that made certain that wars the nation could not avoid --  first World War II and then the Cold War -- worked in ways that protected  Americans and their freedoms. It can make peace work, too.  </P> <P> But this region cannot do it alone. California can get itself ready to roll  with almost any punch and to lend a hand where needed in conversion, as  Assemblymen John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) and Sam Farr (D-Carmel) will urge  this morning. But the state cannot set its own defense policy. That must come  from Washington. The President must demand straight answers immediately on how  many troops, ships, tanks and planes the nation really needs in the evolving  New World, and Congress must back him to the hilt. Southern California can take  it from there.  </P></p>

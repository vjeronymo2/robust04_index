			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THIS EARTH, THIS RELM, THIS ENGLAND  </P> <P> England seems to be in a beastly stew over the teaching of English in their  schools. Since I have not read of it in our paper, this tempest seems not to  have crossed the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Perhaps we are so concerned with the problem in our own schools that we have  little interest in England's.  </P> <P> It has reached such a pitch, however, that the Prince of Wales himself stunned  educators and titillated the island kingdom by complaining that English was  taught "so bloody badly" he had to correct all the letters produced by his own  staff.  </P> <P> I have been brought up to date on this heroic conflict by a batch of English  newspaper clippings on the subject sent to me by Herb Lucas of Lompoc on his  return from an English holiday.  </P> <P> Angered by certain academics who had argued that English could not be taught by  rote and drilling, Prince Charles thundered: "All the people in my office can't  speak properly, can't write properly and can't punctuate. I have to correct all  the letters myself. English is taught so bloody badly.  </P> <P> "I do not believe English is being taught properly. You cannot educate people  properly unless you do it on a basic framework and drilling system."  </P> <P> The prince's frustration suggests a fascinating picture of him sitting at his  desk in exasperation, correcting a misspelled word here, adding a semicolon  there, excising a misplaced apostrophe, scratching out a solecism, while his  ensemble of secretaries tremble in the background.  </P> <P> What makes the prince's outburst so shocking, of course, is that one would  naturally suppose that the very best secretarial help would be available to the  future king. If the prince's own secretaries can't spell, what shape must the  rest of the nation's secretarial pool be in!  </P> <P> There are so many dissident factions in the debate -- educators at various  levels, committees, teachers unions, editors, the secretary of education and a  National Curriculum Council charged with making recommendations for revising  the system.  </P> <P> The clippings reflect the gist of that august body's final report, a report so  tentative, equivocal and fantastical that it might be a sequel to "Alice in  Wonderland."  </P> <P> Its circumlocutions are not easy to understand, but its main thrust seems to be  that "listening and talking" are more important than "reading and writing," and  that students should not be taught standard English at the expense of their  individual dialects.  </P> <P> It holds that non-standard phrases such as "We was," "He ain't," "She come here  yesterday," "They never saw nobody," and "Theirselves" should be treated as  "objects of interest and value, and not ridiculed."  </P> <P> Such locutions are not errors, it held, and are not likely to be misunderstood.  It is "historically inaccurate and conceptually confused," the report said, to  think of non-standard English as "a distortion or deviation from the purity of  Standard English."  </P> <P> It recommended that Standard English should not be introduced "at too early a  stage." It should supplement a pupil's dialect, not replace it. Also, parsing  sentences, drills and meaningless exercises labeling parts of speech were  condemned as mechanical and uninteresting.  </P> <P> As for reading, its teaching should be based on "the pleasure principal."  Secondary pupils might be introduced to such classics as the Authorized Version  of the Bible, Wordsworth's poems and the novels of Dickens; maybe even  Shakespeare. However, that did not mean they had to read Shakespeare.  </P> <P> "The once-traditional method where desk-bound pupils read the text has been  advantageously replaced by exciting, enjoyable approaches that are social,  imaginative and physical." These might include films, videotapes, songs and  dances and dramatic improvisations. Pupils could read books later if they  wanted to.  </P> <P> The Daily Telegraph, in an editorial, took a dim view of this liberal approach.  "Any school wishing to equip its pupils well for modern life must know that  eradicating their non-standard forms and solecisms, and imparting to them a  command of language, are the best means to this end. . . ."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Nigel de Gruchy, deputy general secretary of the National Assn. of  Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, suggested that Prince Charles  probably did not pay his help enough to get people who could spell.  </P> <P> "If he has to swear," de Gruchy said, "he is proving that the public schools  are as bad as the state ones. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle  black."  </P> <P> Professor Higgins, where are you when they need you?  </P></p>

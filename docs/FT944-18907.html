			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Singh predicts growth of 7% through the 1990s India's economy has overcome the crisis of 1991 and can look forward to sustainable growth of 6 to 7 per cent in the second half of the 1990s, Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said in London yesterday. 'We have been essentially in the business of crisis management. This year that phase is broadly over,' he said. Mr Singh, in Europe for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, was at pains to rebut charges that the pace of economic reform was slowing. Except for a setback in curbing the fiscal deficit, reform had gone 'broadly at the pace that we said we would go.' For example central government would continue with its privatisation effort. The so-called Rangarajan report of a committee set up by the government and the Reserve Bank had recommended central government should reduce its stake in public sector companies to as low as 26 per cent in some cases. Current rules call on the government to maintain a 49 per cent stake in companies which are privatised. Mr Singh said this report had not yet been discussed by the cabinet, but he sympathised with its conclusions. 'We need a bolder programme of disinvestment in order to reduce the burden of interest charges.' India also expected to introduce legislation on trade union reform within two years and make the rupee convertible on the capital account by 1996 or 1997. It would stand by its plans to remove quantitative restrictions on imports of consumer goods within the next three years. Such protection encourages excess domestic production of consumer goods as opposed to investment goods and diverts foreign investment to the wrong sectors, he said. Mr Singh acknowledged that his medium term expectations were for a growth rate no higher than India achieved in the 1980s and lower than that anticipated for China. But he said India's earlier growth had been unsustainable because it depended too heavily on borrowing. As for China, its economic statistics needed greater scrutiny. There was a possibility that they overstated growth while China could manage with a higher rate of inflation than India. This year the Indian economy should grow at more than 5 per cent. The inflation rate should fall back to about 7 per cent from more than 8 per cent at present. Though export growth had slowed, the current account deficit would remain small and the budget deficit should be held to 6 per cent of gross domestic product. India's exports in August were Dollars 2.11bn, some 24.6 per cent higher than the same month last year. This followed four months of sluggish performance which gave rise to concern about future prospects. Figures published yesterday by the commerce ministry showed exports in the five months to August were 10.6 per cent up, compared with 8.3 per cent for the four months to July. But the growth rate is still below the annual target of 15 per cent or more.</p>

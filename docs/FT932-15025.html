			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: General Electric climbs 10% in quarter GENERAL Electric of the US has reported a 10 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to Dollars 1.16bn after tax, helped by strong earnings advances in most divisions other than aircraft engines and technical products and services. The improvement translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.36, up by 11 per cent on Dollars 1.23 reported for the first quarter of 1992. If the discontinued aerospace operations are excluded from the comparisons, after-tax profits from continuing businesses would have risen by 13 per cent, to Dollars 1.08bn. First-quarter revenues from the continuing interests increased by 3 per cent, to Dollars 12.9bn, year-on-year. Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, said the earnings growth was 'broad-based as double-digit increases were reported by GE Capital Services, transportation systems, motors, NBC, power systems, appliances and plastics'. The lower profits in the aircraft engines division, which produces Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, 'reflected an increase in product development costs and restructuring costs necessary to meet market conditions', he said. Mr Welch also suggested that the first-quarter results 'positioned the company for another strong year of earnings growth'. Within its various operating divisions, GE said that GE Capital Services had seen net earnings advance by 22 per cent, with the sharpest advances coming in its speciality insurance and speciality financing units. Mr Michael Goldstein, vice-chairman of Toys R Us, said he was pleased with business so far this year. He said sales had been particularly strong in computer games, although bad weather had hurt sales of warm-weather products.</p>

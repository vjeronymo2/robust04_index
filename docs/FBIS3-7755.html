			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Presidency member Ejup Ganic by Ratka </F> Tenjovic in Sarajevo on 28 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Tenjovic] Professor Ganic, how did the Presidency  assess this morning's downing of four enemy planes?    [Ganic] This has restored credibility to the United Nations.  To put it briefly, this [word indistinct] is beginning to act  more efficiently. This is not only good news for our state but  also for other, even smaller states in the world, which have  always seen the United Nations as a savior and have expected the  organization's collective protection. Of course, this is a  positive operation and proof that the United Nations -- once it  decides to do something -- has the technology to implement (?its  decisions).    [Tenjovic] One of the two UN resolutions was implemented  this morning. It was said yesterday that from now on, UN  convoys would be setting out without previous notice and would  be travelling with an armed escort throughout the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Can we expect that in the future, the  United Nations will have a more active attitude toward its own  documents on Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ganic] Yes, we can because the UN's credibility and  historical responsibility was extremely threatened. Moreover,  the carnage is immense and, therefore, the [UN] course has  changed. The Serbian regime in Bosnia is actually using weapons  that are killing civilians -- women and children -- destroying  private houses, yet it does not possess a technology that could  be a challenge to NATO planes or other NATO equipment.  Therefore, the only real, effective force on Bosnia-Herzegovina  territory -- in terms of intervention from the air and on the  ground -- is the UN force, since we are observing the  cease-fire. I expect that the Serbian regime, following an old  recipe, will try to proclaim this to be another of its  victories, and perhaps (?more significant breakthroughs) will  occur. Perhaps these planes will be shot down not only over  Banja Luka but also in places where they are maintained and  where they prepare for their sorties.    [Tenjovic] The message for the aggressor is clear. There  can be no more joking with the United Nations. What would be  the message for the Bosnia-Herzegovina citizens?    [Ganic] Better times are coming -- Tuzla airport will soon  be opened and convoys will come more often to (?encircled)  territories. We cannot relax, however, because the aggressor  will try [changes thought], you know that crimes against the  civilian population are (?still going on) in all areas, the  [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army must be alert, it must defend its  positions at all times, it must do everything to help things  function on the ground, iron out problems between communes, in  traffic.... However, we must also fight back with our  efficiency in the sense [words indistinct] of the United  Nations. Therefore, the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  borders are again on the international (?map), and the world  realizes that partitioning a state, handing over a state to the  aggressor whose objective is expansionism, simply leads to  instability not only in these regions but to chaos in  international diplomacy. Owing primarily to our Army's [word  indistinct] on the ground, and partly owing to our political  activity, we have succeeded in channeling many things. [sentence  as heard] Things will now be somewhat easier, but you must know  that we cannot afford to relax, [words indistinct].</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Even by their own wobbly standards, Eurotunnel shares are behaving nervously ahead of next Friday's preliminary results. Having drifted back steadily but uneventfully since mid-January, the price fell a full 6 per cent this week on renewed fears that the long-rumoured refinancing is about to be be announced. After last month's ruling from the independent disputes panel that Eurotunnel must triple its monthly payments to the 10 Anglo-French contractors, it would be unwise to expect convincing reassurances from Sir Alastair Morton. However, stories that the company delayed its results because of an immediate financial crisis, and that the cash call is imminent, belong to wilder reaches of the market's imagination. The chances are that the Eurotunnel chief executive will want to tough it out; and though the odds may seem tilted against him, he may just have the cards to succeed. The only certainty is that the 1996 peak financing requirement of Pounds 8.05bn will be increased in the light of lower GDP forecasts, changed duty free assumptions and the delay in the opening of the tunnel until autumn 1993. Even factoring in the most disadvantageous settlement of the claims dispute, the eagerly awaited revised figure might still be Pounds 200m short of Eurotunnel's overall financial limits. While that leaves little room for anything else to go wrong, the rights issue - if it comes - at least ought to be relatively small. The risk of the banks foreclosing looks politically negligible, and they might even be persuaded to permit a small overrun in the hope that the traffic forecasts ultimately prove conservative. The shares hardly seem worth selling.</p>

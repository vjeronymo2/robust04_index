			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hazlewood lower after exceptional A Pounds 2.3m exceptional write-off from the sale of a Dutch subsidiary caused pre-tax profits at Hazlewood Foods to dip 5.7 per cent to Pounds 23.3m in the six months to October 2. The shares fell 7p to 141p. Stripping out the effects of June's Pounds 14.2 sale of Luijckx, profits grew to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 24.7m). Turnover rose 11 per cent to Pounds 403.9m (Pounds 364.8m) and gross profits advanced 6 per cent to Pounds 88.1m (Pounds 83m). Mr Peter Barr, chairman, said that the refocusing of the group was largely complete. With the past few years' heavy investment now in place, the board's next challenges were to promote 'volume-led' organic growth, and increase productivity levels, using the now under-utilised capacity in many of its upgraded plants. He said that the drive for organic growth meant having 'a coherent strategy', stating that the short-term situation could not affect the long-term view. The slippage in group margins, from 8.3 to 7.8 per cent, was in part due to commissioning and general restructuring costs of about Pounds 1m in the half, especially in convenience foods and ready meals. Restrictions by supermarket chains, which were rejecting higher prices while demanding no loss of quality, also contributed. Another aim was to exploit the immaturity of the European market in added value foods, principally in the ready meals and convenience foods sectors. This type of food product accounted for more than half group sales for the first time and the proportion is set to increase. By division, grocery and non-food lifted operating profits to Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 7.4m) on lower turnover of Pounds 78m (Pounds 80.2m). Frozen foods profits at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11m) were held back by flatfish which was down at Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m) and ready meals which were flat at Pounds 5m. Shellfish were up at Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.5m). Reduced profits of Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 6m) in convenience foods meant that profits at fresh foods slipped to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 11.1m), though produce rose to Pounds 2.5m from Pounds 1.6m. Earnings per share fell to 6.94p (7.62p). The interim dividend is lifted to 2.4p (2.3p). COMMENT Since September the food industry has come under the retailers' cosh and it is unfortunate that Hazlewood's refit has come on stream in a period of pricing uncertainty. Some might say that the management could have started the investment earlier, in a stable price environment. And there is a feeling that in its drive for higher volumes, the group might be a little too amenable to the retailers' as yet unknowable price demands. That said, there is plenty of scope for productivity gains and, using the Dutch manufacturing and distribution operations, continental Europe seems ripe for the taking. With between Pounds 52.5m and Pounds 55m pencilled in for the current year, against last year's Pounds 55m, the p/e hovers round the mid-8s. The shares look cheap, though the wary market will want to see the group deliver.</p>

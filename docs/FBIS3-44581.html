The Russian Presidential Press Office issued a statement  today, saying that President Boris Yeltsin was worried by the  trend toward expanding the NATO bloc.    Such a trend contradicted the "declared intentions to build  mutual relations on principles of trust, partnership and  equilibrium," the statement said.    NATO's expansion by admitting Russia's neighbors will  "provoke a negative response" and "contribute to the development  of negative sentiments within civilian and military circles."    The statement added that Yeltsin believed that such a haste  extension will in the long run "destabilize political and  military situation" in the region.    Yeltsin expected that heads of NATO member states and the  alliance will desert dual stances in dealing with those issues  vital to the fate of the whole world and the interest of Russian  people.    After disintegrations of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact,  some East European countries and members of the Commonwealth of  Independent States wanted to join in NATO to seek protection of  security. But Russia strongly opposes these attempts, which, it  says, is against Russia's interest.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: N Brown beats Pounds 7m aided by core growth N BROWN, the mail order company which specialises in clothing for older women, yesterday announced a 23 per cent profits rise due to growth in both core and new business. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.03m to Pounds 7.44m in the six months to August 29. Turnover was 14 per cent up at Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 69.5m), helped by Pounds 3.79m of sales from Odhams, the video and compact disc order company acquired from the receiver last November. Operating profits increased only 2.4 per cent to Pounds 9.4m. They were held back by spending to improve customer service and low operating margins at Odhams of 3 per cent, against 13.1 per cent for Brown's established business. Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said Brown's emphasis on selling to older women offered protection from the recession. Orders had increased strongly since August, although the situation had worsened following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. Interest costs declined to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 2.28m) helped by the proceeds of last year's Pounds 16.4m placing and open offer. Income from listed investments, mainly referring to a stake in Coats Viyella, increased to Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 93,000). Brown's small financial and property arm incurred an operating loss of Pounds 33,000. As part of the focus on customer service, products are being brought into Brown's warehouse earlier, reducing delays between orders and delivery. However, this lead to a 14 per cent increase in stocks on a like-for-like basis to Pounds 27.3m. Net borrowings in the period increased to Pounds 32.8m (Pounds 31.7m). But gearing fell from 56 per cent to 49 per cent due to a 12 per cent increase in shareholders' funds to Pounds 67.1m. Earnings rose 14 per cent to 6.84p (5.99p). The interim dividend is lifted to 1.95p (1.75p). COMMENT Brown and its products may be short on glamour, but the company has solid support in the stock market, which respects its defensive nature and ability to grow profits from a niche market. Its emphasis on improving customer service may constrain growth this year but should begin to pay dividends next year. Customer queries, which have fallen 18 per cent in a year due to an improved billing system, should continue to drop along with the proportion of goods returned. Meanwhile, Odhams' full-year contribution should top Pounds 400,000 and provide a useful side line. Despite yesterday's 7p rise in the shares to 288p, Brown's price has been fairly flat following a 41 per cent increase last year. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 18m put the shares on 17 times earnings, which is below the sector average, suggesting that they can go a little higher yet.</p>

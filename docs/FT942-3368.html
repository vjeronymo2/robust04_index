			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / People: In-house or boutique? Pundits swap Roger Nightingale, 49, an early pioneer of global stock market strategy in London, has decided that working for a broker is more rewarding than running one's own investment research boutique. Four years after setting up Roger Nightingale &amp; Associates, Nightingale and his firm are joining WI Carr (Far East), part of France's Banque Indosuez. Nightingale's decision to throw in his lot with Indosuez comes only a month after David Roche, 47, Morgan Stanley's stock market strategist, decided to set up his own London research boutique. The two moves highlight the contrasting views of the viability of independent research firms in London. Roche, whose old employer is one of his biggest clients, says that it is absurd to think all research should be conducted in-house. However, Nightingale's experience raises the question of whether institutional investors are prepared to pay for research which they can get free from the big brokerage firms. Nightingale, who spent 20 years with Hoare Govett and is a non-executive director of M &amp; G Investment Management, says that it's virtually impossible to make a business out of UK research on its own. By contrast, overseas clients in the Far East and the US were more prepared to pay for independent research. He says that everybody is 'digging in the same pot of gold' but many clients prefer to get subsidised research from a broker rather than pay for it directly. He believes that the weakness of the big US brokers, which make most of their money from primary business, is that their research can 'become a little less frank'. Although his new employer is heavily biased towards Far Eastern business, Nightingale will continue to offer a worldwide investment view. He hasn't forgotten the advice of an old boss who told him always to make sure he competes in an area where the competition is weak.</p>

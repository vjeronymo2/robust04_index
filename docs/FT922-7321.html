			<p>920519 FT  19 MAY 92 / Another Taurus delay A FURTHER delay in the launch of Taurus, the long-awaited paperless settlement system for the London stock market, seems likely after a failure to meet the current development timetable, Richard Waters writes. The project, originally scheduled for last autumn, is now planned for next April, but it is thought likely to fall behind again.

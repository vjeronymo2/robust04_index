			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / BAe chief to visit Taiwan in move to clinch jet deal MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, is expected in Taiwan next week in an attempt to resolve differences with Taiwan Aerospace (TAC) on setting up a Pounds 250m joint venture between the two companies. The trip follows comments yesterday from Mr Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the state development Chiao Tung Bank, a big shareholder in TAC, that the issue of collateral for loans to the joint venture remained the obstacle to concluding the deal. The venture, called Avro, is intended to make BAe's RJ series of regional jet aircraft in the UK and Taiwan. It is vital to BAe's recovery strategy and offers Taiwan a route into the aviation industry. BAe said: 'Public discussion of the state of talks in Taiwan would damage the future of Avro.' It would not confirm Mr Cahill's visit. Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president, said Mr Cahill would arrive by August 23 and added that differences could be resolved 'if there is a will'. Mr Liang said he would also be meeting Mr Cahill and other BAe executives next week to discuss the issue. The disagreement between the two sides centres on collateral for loans that Taiwanese banks need to make to Avro. BAe's 50 per cent share in Avro is in the form of land, plant and machinery in the UK, whereas TAC and Taiwanese banks are committed to putting up the remainder in cash. The state-owned Chiao Tung Bank leads the consortium of lender banks and plans to own 10 per cent of Avro. But under article 32 of Taiwan's banking law, a bank cannot offer unsecured financing to any company in which it holds more than a 3 per cent interest. Mr Liang said 'something concrete' was needed as collateral before the consortium would agree to the financing. Behind the dispute lie concerns among some Taiwanese private investors that the enterprise will not make money. One of the reasons that BAe wants a partner is that the RJ series of aircraft has been selling slowly. On July 27, Taiwan's premier, Mr Lien Chan, declared the government's support for the venture. At the same time, government involvement in Avro, through its Chiao Tung bank, was increased.</p>

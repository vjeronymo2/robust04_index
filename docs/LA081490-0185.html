			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEDLEY DONOVAN; EDITOR LED TIME INC. PUBLISHING EMPIRE  </P> <P> Hedley Donovan, Henry Luce's hand-chosen successor as editor-in-chief of the  Time Inc. publishing empire, died Monday in New York Hospital after what a  company spokesman described only as a long illness.  </P> <P> Donovan, dubbed "Pope Moses II" by Time staffers after succeeding Luce, was 76,  and had lived in Manhattan and Sands Point, Long Island. More recently, he had  served from 1979-80 as personal adviser to President Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> As the company's top editor from 1964 to 1979, Donovan continued the evolution  of Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Time magazines while presiding over the  demise of Life magazine as a weekly publication.  </P> <P> During his tenure, Time Inc. also introduced two magazines, People and Money.  </P> <P> Donovan commanded an editorial staff of 1,400 people. In his 1989  autobiography, "Right Places, Right Times: 40 Years In Journalism, Not Counting  My Paper Route," Donovan wrote: "I managed them -- to the extent . . . that  such people can be managed at all -- by appointing their bosses, and managing  them. To the extent they can be managed."  </P> <P> A self-described "political independent with conservative leanings," Donovan  oversaw an editorial policy shift in Time Inc.'s magazines from the orthodox  Republican views of Luce to a more independent stance.  </P> <P> Initially a staunch advocate of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam policy,  Donovan eventually came to agree with his correspondents and senior editors who  had grown increasingly pessimistic that the war could be won.  </P> <P> A longtime supporter of Richard M. Nixon, Time -- in a post-Watergate editorial  in 1973 -- demanded the President's resignation.  </P> <P> Donovan graduated magna cum laude from the University of Minnesota in 1934 and  was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He won a Rhodes scholarship and took a second  bachelor's degree in history at Oxford's Hertford College in 1936.  </P> <P> Donovan began his career in 1937, as a reporter for the Washington Post, and  covered the State Department, Capitol Hill and the White House. Entering the  Navy in 1942, he served as an intelligence officer and rose to the rank of  lieutenant commander.  </P> <P> When the war ended, Donovan joined Fortune as a writer, rose to managing editor  in 1953, and then was handpicked by Luce to become editorial director of Time  Inc., now Time Warner Inc., and Luce's heir apparent.  </P></p>

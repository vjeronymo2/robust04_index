He discussed the fact that the director of the Army  Intelligence Department filed a lawsuit against General Vang  Pao, head of the Lao National Liberation Front. He said that,  in essence, the Thai armed forces only want to officially record  the charge regarding his illegal acts, so that it can be used as  evidence if this man is arrested when he enters Thailand in the  future. This is because a group of people has carried out  activities along the Thai border and caused trouble for Thai  people in the area. Their recruiting activities have created  conflicts between Thailand and other friendly countries. They  have also caused trouble for people in other countries by  collecting money from Lao immigrants in the United States and  claiming the money will be used to support Lao national  liberation activities, using Thai territory. The Thai armed  forces cannot allow this. As to whether any Thais have joined  this movement, the Thai Army chief said he did not think so.  However, some Hmong living along the border may have, he said.    On purchasing weapons from our trading partners by bartering  Thai agricultural goods, Gen. Wimon said that an understanding  has been reached by all parties concerned. Press reports,  however, have indicated that the military does not understand  the barter system. In fact, once a decision is made by the  cabinet, it should be regarded as law. Therefore it must be  practiced as long as clear explanations are provided regarding  the amount of money required and methods to be followed. Then  there would be no problems. Personally, he said, he agrees with  anything that benefits poor people.</p>

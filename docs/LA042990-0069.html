			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: MAIN LINE WASP BY W. THACHER LONGSTRETH WITH DAN  ROTTENBERG (W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 310 PP.)  </P> <P> Some biographies are instructive not so much because of the particular  achievements of the subject but because the subject represents a type or class.  Thacher Longstreth acknowledges his representative importance by calling his  autobiography not "My Life" but "Main Line WASP."  </P> <P> The autobiography of the Princeton All-American football player turned top Life  magazine salesman and contender for the mayorship of Philadelphia defines the  stereotype of WASP, and while his title clearly states the fact, not all of it  can possibly be conscious. A photograph of the young Longstreth with his bride  in 1941, strategically paired with a shot taken on their return to the very  same spot in 1966, attest to the graceful aging of the strong WASP bone  structure -- aided, it is subtly implied in the book, by honest living.  </P> <P> WASPs may play the wimp (the terrible epithet George Bush had to live down in  his presidential campaign), but they know how to play it to uncanny advantage.  Longstreth tells the story of a rival who applied all sorts of unflattering  epithets to him, the least of which was ineffectual. Longstreth, when contacted  by the Philadelphia Inquirer to respond, admitted that he had failed his  colleague in a certain matter, and that the man had every right to be  disappointed. Asked by the Inquirer whether the language in which the colleague  expressed his disappointment was not a little strong, Longstreth replied, for  publication: "No. Ed and I have been friends for a long time, and we'll be  friends for a long time to come. There's nothing to be upset about."  </P> <P> The bad-mouther was on the phone to Longstreth as soon as the article appeared.  "Goddammit, you have me so embarrassed," he complained. "My wife is so angry at  me. All of a sudden you're the good guy and I'm the villain. You've taught me a  lesson, Thacher. I'm never going to say a mean word publicly about anyone  again."  </P> <P> Take this species of killer-innocence (notice the charitable inclusion of the  rival's promise never to sin again), coupled with the absolute confidence that  comes from belonging to a strong network of like individuals, and the nice-guy  approach can be wielded like a club. Longstreth's colorful stories of business  and politics, including the tale of his unintended selection as middleman  between Philadelphia Teamsters and Jimmy Hoffa, make enlightening reading, and  belie his contention that the WASP's day was over in the 1930s.

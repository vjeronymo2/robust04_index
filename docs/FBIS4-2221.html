			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Vincent (name indistinct): "Nightmare on Lake Qiandao"] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- It started off as a spring  holiday for the 24 visitors from Taiwan, some in Mainland China  for the first time to catch a glimpse on the land of their  ancestors. It ended in tragedy in a cramped, lower-deck cabin  aboard the Hai Rui while the boat crossed Lake Qiandao, or  Thousand Island Lake. The bodies were found one piled on top of  another, burned beyond recognition.    Seven days later, when by Taiwanese custom the spirits of  the  dead return to earth, the victim's relatives were still at the  scene near the lake, seeking answers to the questions they have  been asking since arriving in the mainland on Sunday [3 April].    Qiandao Lake is in Mainland China's Zhejiang Province about  200 kilometers west of Hangzhou and is a popular tourist  destination.    The relatives and representatives of the Taipei Association  of Travel Agents [TATA] were able to view the boat and the  charred bodies on Sunday and Monday, before mainland authorities  roped off the scene, barred reporters from the area, and  detained the relatives in a hotel. One thing seems certain:  the deaths of the tourists and eight mainland crew members and  tour guides could hardly have been accidental.    An unnamed Zhejiang official said the boat's gas tank had  not  exploded in the fire. Unless those aboard the ship had gathered  below to escape a rainy day and were struck by a bolt of  lightning, or all had been asleep at 5:30 p.m. when a freak  accident occurred, then [word indistinct] and murder seems the  only explanation.    Yao Ta-kuang, a TATA representative at Lake Qiandao on  Saturday, said that some gold rings, expensive watches, and cash  were found along with the bodies, some of the relatives insisted  that the belongings of the victims were notably short of  possessions the victims had carried with them from Taiwan and  had on the boat with them. Some of the relatives also claimed  they found bullet holes in the boat before they were shepherded  away to the hotel by the mainland authorities. The Hai Rui was  ferrying the tourists across the lake to their hotel, which they  had yet to check into.    The Zhejiang officials began stonewalling immediately.  Taiwan officials were not informed of the incident until about  30 hours after it occurred. When Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation, or SEF, insisted on sending an official to the  mainland to find out what happened and to see what steps could  be taken on behalf of the victims' relatives, mainland officials  turned down the request. The Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Strait, or ARATS, the mainland agency authorized  [word indistinct] to handle cross- strait affairs, claimed it  was "not necessary" for SEF officials to be at the site. "We are  very concerned about the accident and will provide help to the  victim's relatives," ARATS Deputy Secretary- General Zhao  Zhengyu added.    Meanwhile, the relatives, who had flown to the mainland with  the hope of repatriating the remains of their loved ones, were  also spurned by mainland officials, who had taken it upon  themselves to perform autopsies on the bodies. No results of  the autopsies were made available.    In addition to not letting the relatives gather evidence at  the site -- taking photographs, for example -- mainland  officials also refused to let the relatives take the bodies to  Hangzhou, a nearby city, either for cremation or to fly the  bodies back to Taiwan. Zhejiang Lieutenant Governor Liu Xirong  told the relatives Tuesday that the bodies could not be shipped  out of the mainland because their decomposition posed a health  threat, while other local authorities said that allowing the  corpses to be shipped to Taiwan would severely affect the  mainland's security. On Thursday, officials informed the  relatives that the bodies would be incinerated at Tonglu on  Friday. Tonglu is between Lake Qiandao and Hangzhou.    Despite the relatives pleas to the ROC Government for help,  officials and commentators here could only criticize the  mainland's handling of the matter. "The denial of the relatives'  demands is consistent with the Chinese Communists' ignorance of  human rights," Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong said  on Tuesday. Kuomintang Cultural Affairs Department Director  Chien Han-sheng said that the actions taken by mainland  officials over the past few days have been "muddleheaded and  careless."    SEF Chairman Ku Chen-fu, long involved in trying to reach  agreements with the mainland over several issues, said relations  between the two sides had definitely been harmed, and at least  one scholar agreed with him. Chu Hsin-min, a foreign diplomacy  professor at National Chengchi University, said the incident  would likely be a "drawback" to Taiwan-mainland relations.    On Wednesday, Taiwan legislators vented their ire at the  Beijing regime. Li Ching-hua, a Kuomintang legislator formerly  in favor or reunification with the mainland, said the  cross-strait relationship had entirely failed because of the  incident, while Chiu Lien-hui, of the opposition Democratic  Progressive Party, demanded that ROC Premier Lien Chan pronounce  Mainland China "a tourist area of uncivilized people."    Now, a Taiwan boycott of travel to Mainland China seems  likely, unless Beijing meets a list of demands the ROC  Transportation and Communications Ministry will present,  outlining the steps it can take to keep the mainland a favorite  destination of Taiwan tourists.    The boycott will do nothing for the 24 unfortunate tourists  who spent their final minutes faced with a terror that may  remain a mystery until cross-strait ties are unfrozen.</p>

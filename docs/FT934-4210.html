			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Freed from VAT - The Budget and You Potentially the most immediate benefit for smaller companies from the Budget is the change to the rules governing VAT registration. By raising the threshold from companies with sales of Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000 with immediate effect, the chancellor says some 75,000 companies will no longer need to register. This threshold has almost doubled over the last three years, removing a raft of companies from a net believed to be earning the Customs and Excise little or nothing. 'This relieves an awful administrative burden and makes smaller companies more competitive with larger companies', says Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. But business owners would be well advised to hurry slowly before celebrating by burning VAT returns. The first danger is that a business's sales may unexpectedly jump above the registration threshold. A business would have stopped charging VAT once it de-registered. But once the threshold was breached, Customs and Excise could assume VAT had been charged on all cash received by the business and might demand repayment, said Loughlin Hickey, partner at KPMG Tax Advisers. Before de-registering, businesses should consider with their accountants where sales are likely to be in the medium term. There is another consideration. While filling in VAT forms is a harrowing experience, businesses may be enjoying an indirect benefit. 'One of the disciplines of VAT is it makes people keep accurate records,' says Hickey. These might become increasingly important given the move towards self-assessment of income tax. From 1996, individual taxpayers will have to calculate their own tax liability. Many smaller businesses which are unincorporated and with sales below the VAT threshold will also have to adopt self-assessment. The Inland Revenue will almost certainly make sporadic audits of individuals who will, therefore, need good records to support what they have declared.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEERING IS ONE THING, DELIBERATE NOISE ANOTHER  </P> <P> The outcome of a football game should not be determined by mob rule.  </P> <P> Cheering is an integral part of the game, but the deliberate deafening of the  opposing team is unsportsmanlike conduct of the lowest order. The new  crowd-noise rule is a good one, it just isn't strong enough.  </P> <P> Something has to be done to quiet the egomaniacs in the stands who seem to  think that the ticket they bought is a license to kill a drive and to  eventually kill the game of football.  </P> <P> WENDALL KINNEY, Bakersfield  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Talks to resume soon over HK airport TALKS ARE to resume between Britain and China soon - possibly next week - in a final attempt to break the deadlock over Hong Kong's plans to construct a HKDollars 100bn (Pounds 7.5bn) airport, which would be opened soon after the colony returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. There is no sign of any new initiative from either side, but both countries favour a resumption. If the talks fail it is likely Hong Kong businessmen will quickly submit a private sector-led plan as a catalyst to save the project, possibly by creating a consortium that could include the Hong Kong and Chinese governments. This might enable the two governments to move away from entrenched positions. Several of the colony's top business names - including Mr Li Ka-shing and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - are holding private talks. But no plan will be proposed unless there is deadlock at a diplomatic level. Mr Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, held discussions in Peking 10 days ago with senior officials about plans he has been promoting for five years. This infuriated the Hong Kong government, which has secured pledges from Mr Wu and other local businessmen that they will not make further moves for the time being. China has been demanding since early last year a say over the airport for a mixture of political and economic reasons. It is concerned about the size of the project and the extent to which it will drain Hong Kong's HKDollars 72bn fiscal reserves and build up debt repayments after 1997. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is believed to have reviewed the current impasse at the end of last week with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who failed to reach agreement during talks in Peking early last month. Mr Hurd warned then that the project might be shelved if China demanded an unacceptably large degree of control. The diplomatic initiative has passed from Hong Kong to London because China's right to interfere in the territory's affairs is limited by a 1984 Sino-British joint declaration on the 1997 handover. Britain and Hong Kong argue that China is attempting to breach the declaration by demanding effective control over the airport development. It is also believed to be using the airport to establish a precedent to gain power over other key government decisions, ranging from fiscal policy to the appointment of judges on a new court of final appeal.</p>

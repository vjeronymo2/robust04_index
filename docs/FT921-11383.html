			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Electrical safety plugged THE PECULIARLY British custom of requiring consumers to attach their own plugs to electrical appliances is coming to an end. Soon there will be no more fiddling with tiny screws and trying to discern which terminal takes which coloured lead. The government yesterday bowed to five years of lobbying from safety groups and said it would insist that electrical appliances be sold with plugs attached. At present, almost all of the 60m plugs sold each year are fitted at home. Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, said domestic appliances should be supplied fitted with a correctly fused 13 amp plug. 'Too many people are injured every year because of incorrectly wired electric plugs,' he said. The regulation is expected to take effect within about 18 months, although no date has been set. Welcoming the move, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa) said: 'It is common practice everywhere else in the world to sell electrical goods with a plug attached.' Rospa said the requirement should eliminate the 200 hospital visits a year by people injured at home by electric shocks due to faulty plugs. Last year a woman was electrocuted when the live wire in the plug of a washing machine became detached. The Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Electrical Appliances said the change 'would add 10 per cent to the cost of a Pounds 15-Pounds 20 appliance' such as a toaster or iron. 'It is painful for us to see all these costs piling on,' said Mr Richard Lines of Hornby Hobbies, which makes model railways and the Scalextric electric car racing circuits. But Sony, which has made televisions fitted with plugs at its plant in South Wales for a year, said the extra cost was 'a few pence' per unit on a production run of hundreds of thousands. British Home Stores, the retailer which began to sell all its lighting with plugs attached in October 1991, said sales had soared by 60 per cent. Many companies had dragged their feet over a voluntary agreement to fit plugs, according to Rospa. Industry associations concede that they pressed for legislation to forestall imports of plugless devices from the Far East.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africa's Impala Platinum hit again by labour unrest IMPALA PLATINUM, the world's second largest producer, has again had production disrupted by labour unrest at its Bophuthatswana operations. Impala said about 10,000 employees did not turn out for Wednesday's night shift, nor for yesterday's day shift, at the Bafokeng South mine. The stay-away affects about a quarter of Impala's production of 20,000 troy ounces a week. Labour relations at Impala have been fairly quiet during the past six months; a company official says the last strike was in March. This compares with the second half of 1991 when labour difficulties caused shaft closures and lower productivity, resulting in about 100,000 ounces of lost production. Mr Jerry Matjatladi, spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), says workers had stayed away in protest at an attack by mine security on workers attending a meeting to report back on wages and conditions of work. It is ironic that Impala should again be at the receiving end of worker displeasure in a week when it emerged that it has been having indirect talks with the NUM. Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general secretary of the union, confirmed that two rounds of talks had been held between Impala management and the 'central council' of Impala's worker's, assisted by the NUM. The reason for much of the labour troubles last year was that the government of Bophuthatswana, the homeland where all Impala's mines are found, refused to allow the South African-based NUM to represent Impala's workers, because it was a foreign union. The NUM, despite the fact that about 60 per cent of Impala's workers are its members, refused to register because it did not want to recognise the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana, which it regards as an illegitimate creation of apartheid. The NUM has subsequently applied for registration in Bophuthatswana, but this has not yet been granted. The current talks are apparently an attempt to circumvent the legal restrictions. Although the recent spike in the platinum price, which rose in a short period from Dollars 360 to over Dollars 380, has been attributed to concern about the impact of mass action on South Africa's platinum production, analysts dispute this analysis. Mr Kevin Kartun, mining analyst at stockbrokers Frankel, Max Pollak says it has more to do with dealers short of metal covering positions than concern about industrial action. He adds that both Impala and Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer, have enjoyed relative industrial harmony in recent months. Mr Kartun says the last large stay-away hardly touched the mining industry, and given difficult economic conditions, and given the relative affluence of platinum miners, he does not expect much disruption to platinum production from industrial action.</p>

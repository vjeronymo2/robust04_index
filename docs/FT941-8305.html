			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Labour to urge broader role for private finance The Labour party will today argue that private finance should be extended beyond transport and infrastructure in a consultative paper on public-private partnerships. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor and one of the authors of the new plan, said the party had 'stolen a march on the Tories' by calling for an extension of private finance to hospitals, education and inner-city projects. The plan is set out in a Labour document called Financing Infrastructure Investment - Promoting a Partnership between Public and Private Finance. Labour has long called for private investment for transport infrastructure projects. Its latest policy for a public-private partnership is intended to replace its traditional stance of support for the remaining state-owned corporations.

He will argue today that the government must lead in promoting partnership between public and private sectors. The document says: 'We are consulting on a way of setting appropriate profit performance measures for such bodies.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary and another of the document's authors, said: 'What the paper does is take Treasury rules by the scruff of the neck and give them a very firm shake in order to open up the possibility of much greater investment in public enterprise and public services.' The document was criticised by Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, who accused Labour of joining the Tories in hoping that private finance would rescue them from tough decisions on tax and spending. Everyone, including the Liberal Democrats, wanted more private capital to go into public transport, schools and hospitals, Mr Beith said. 'But at the end of the day you cannot duck the need for significant public finance, because many of the vital projects cannot produce a commercial return, and others require a Treasury guarantee because the private sector simply does not want the level of risk involved.'</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Apple to widen lawsuit over Windows program MICROSOFT, the personal computer software publisher, said Apple Computer intends broaden its legal action to include claims that its Windows 3.0 program infringes upon Apple copyrights. Windows 3.0, the latest version of a Microsoft program which gives IBM-compatible computers ease-of-use features similar to those of Apple Computer's Macintosh, is one of Microsoft's most successful products. Close to 3m copies have been sold since it was introduced last May. A spokesman for Apple said, however, that there had been no new filings in the case and Apple has not made any formal changes to its complaint, which also names Hewlett-Packard. In its original suit, Apple claimed an earlier version of Windows 'and all derivative works' infringed its copyrights. 'We consider Windows 3.0 to be a derivative work,' Apple said. At issue in the case are Apple's claims that computer screen graphics produced by Microsoft's Windows duplicate the screen images of its Macintosh personal computers. Microsoft maintains it has not infringed any Apple copyrights.</p>

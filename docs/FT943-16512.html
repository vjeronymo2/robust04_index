			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Concern grows over Swedish bond sale Concern is growing over today's auction by the Swedish government of SKr6bn of new government bonds. This follows turmoil in the country's financial markets on Friday sparked by worries over the continuing rise in state debt. The turmoil began after remarks made by Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of Skandia, one of Sweden's two leading insurance groups and one of the country's largest institutional investors, that the company had stopped buying government bonds in protest at the state of the country's finances. Mr Wolrath said: 'We are not going to buy a single government bond as long as the Swedish politicians do not have a trustworthy policy for reducing the budget deficit.' Bond yields rose sharply on Friday to almost 10 per cent, the Stockholm stock exchange fell 2 per cent and the Swedish krona fell against leading currencies. Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS in London, said: 'Sweden has the highest real yields in the world, along with Canada. Such high real interest rates imply an ever-increasing burden of financing and it is this combination of high real rates and a rapidly rising debt to income ratio which has the potential for a buyers' strike, which seems to be taking place.' Other insurance groups have said they would continue to trade in government bonds and senior officials at the Finance Ministry said they did not expect any short-term problems. It is feared, however, that the government will have difficulty in meeting its financing needs as a result of Skandia's move. Sweden has the fastest growing debt among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries, standing at about 80 per cent of gross national product at the end of last year, and a budget deficit of 13 per cent of GNP.</p>

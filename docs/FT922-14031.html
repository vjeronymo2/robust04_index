			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: MCC administrators win delay THE court-appointed administrators of Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC), the UK-based company once controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, were last night granted a 60-day extension of their exclusive right to file a reorganisation plan for the company. The delay was granted by Ms Tina Brozman, the New York bankruptcy court judge who has overseen the running of MCC since last December, when the company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. At present MCC is operating under a complex arrangement that permits the Macmillan publishing company and Official Airline Guide, both MCC subsidiaries, to function in the US and requires co-ordination between New York and UK court admin-istrators of the Maxwell empire. Judge Brozman granted the extension, to June 15, saying the complexity and time-consuming research required to ascertain the disposition of assets warranted the ruling. The MCC administrators said in February they hoped to sell most of the company's minor holdings outside the US within two months. Time Warner, the US entertainment and media group, has agreed to buy Maxwell's British publishing business, Macdonald and Co, for an undisclosed price. Mr John Gellene, a US lawyer for the administrators, gave no indication of the disposition of MCC assets, but said in court that 'all parties have made remarkable progress in setting a common agenda'.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Frost seeks Pounds 21.3m to repay bank borrowings FROST GROUP, the UK's largest independent petrol retailer, yesterday launched a cash call to raise Pounds 21.3m to repay bank debt and clear the way for further acquisitions. The 5-for-1 rights issue of 11.7m new shares at 187p apiece is fully underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Frost's shares slipped 1p to 224p. Without the issue the company believed debt would reach some Pounds 18.4m by its December year-end which would mean gearing of 60 per cent of balance sheet values. After the issue Frost will have about Pounds 3m in cash and the company will be ungeared. Mr James Frost, chairman, said: 'This leaves us in a similar position to two years ago when we floated. The difference is two years ago we had 79 sites and by the year end we expect to have 180. 'The long term target at the time of the float was to get to 250 sites. Because we have purchased at an accelerated rate we now expect to reach that target in the short term with a new long term target of 500 sites.' The company expects to have invested Pounds 32.6m in the acquisition and redevelopment of petrol retailing sites by the end of 1993. 'We believe that, in the near future, there will be many further opportunities to acquire sites on advantageous terms, provided that the group has the balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to be able to act quickly.'</p>

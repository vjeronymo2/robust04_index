			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Economics Notebook: Mr Lamont's headache over public borrowing For Britain's embattled chancellor, last week's big jump in UK unemployment and the average 6.5 per cent pay awards for 1.5m public sector workers were yet another reminder of the growing pressures on the state's finances. Even before the recent rash of bad economic news, the public sector borrowing requirement, or deficit, was expected to total around Pounds 12bn in 1991-92 and the government's hope of keeping the 1992-93 PSBR down to 3 per cent of GDP or around Pounds 18bn was looking steadily more fragile. Forecasters have also been making increasingly pessimistic medium-term projections about the PSBR since the big public spending increases announced in last November's Autumn Statement. Last week, Oxford Economic Forecasting predicted that the PSBR would still be around Pounds 20bn by the middle of the 1990s. The rather more optimistic 'Green Budget' produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs International a couple of weeks earlier projected a deficit of Pounds 6.4bn, or 0.8 per cent of GDP, as late as 1996-97. Such projections have cast doubt on the government's ability to return to a balanced budget over the course of the current economic cycle: an objective that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, described as 'paramount' in his New Year interview with the FT. At first sight this is bad news. The balanced budget commitment has reassured financial markets that the present lurch from the public sector surpluses of the late 1980s to substantial deficit is no more than a justified and temporary response to a protracted and damaging recession. But would abandoning the balanced Budget really matter? The markets don't seem to think so. They have so far shrugged off mounting speculation that the chancellor might unveil a generous tax-cutting Budget as well as the consequent back-of-the-envelope calculations that the PSBR could leap to around Pounds 24bn or 4 per cent of GDP next year. Many economists would argue that the markets are right not to worry, and that a balanced budget is just mumbo-jumbo. In the mid-1980s, the appropriate size of the PSBR was a subject of long and earnest debate in the Treasury and among outside economists. But despite employing some of Britain's best economic brains - including Mr Alan Budd, now the government's chief economic adviser - the issue came nowhere near a clear conclusion. The upshot, according to Mr Peter Spencer, then a Treasury economist and now chief UK economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, is that there is simply no objective guide to the right level of government borrowing. However, the UK experience has not prevented European Community leaders adopting specific borrowing limits among the criteria to determine whether an EC member state will be eligible for moving to the third and final stage of economic and monetary union around the end of this decade. The Maastricht agreement states that government deficits must be either at or near 3 per cent of GDP and that a country's ratio of debt to GDP must not exceed 60 per cent for a country to move to Emu. According to officials who helped prepare the treaty, these criteria were not simply plucked out of the air. They are underpinned by an assessment of the growth potential of the community in a time of near-price stability (when inflation would be between zero and 2 per cent) and intended to yield an improvement in the debt ratios of the member states over time. So why should not Mr Lamont just tell the House of Commons on Budget Day that the balanced budget rule has gone, to be replaced by the Maastricht criteria? After all, the chancellor, for all his Euro-scepticism, is a strong supporter of the European Monetary System as a weapon against inflation. If he acquiesces in the Europeanisation of monetary policy, should he not do the same when determining the UK's fiscal stance? The temptation to adopt the Maastricht criteria must be all the greater because the UK's government debt position is far more favourable than that of its EC partners. Thanks to the budget surpluses of the late 1980s, Britain's net public sector debt fell to around 27.25 per cent of GDP by the end of 1990-91 from 47 per cent at the end of 1985-85. The UK net debt ratio is well below the EC average of 42 per cent and, according to the IFS-Goldman Sachs Green Budget team, would remain so, even if Britain's PSBR were to stay at 3 per cent of GDP for five years. The bad news for Mr Lamont is that the Maastricht debt criteria could prove too disruptive for the UK economy once it has emerged from recession. The UK has continued to run a substantial current account balance of payments deficit in spite of a sharp fall in demand in the recession. To some economists this is a sign that the UK cannot afford to run as large a budget deficit as other EC nations with a better trade performance. Any substantial and sustained increase in government borrowing would risk fuelling further growth in the current account deficit, particularly if the savings ratio declines as recovery comes and consumer confidence returns. There is also concern that a return to persistent deficits would undermine the supply side economic reforms of the 1980s that have boosted the underlying efficiency of the economy. Another worry - which, one hopes, would be of a temporary nature - surrounds the implications for the Maastricht criteria of the very high real interest rates that currently prevail in Britain. Bank base rates at 10.5 per cent are very high when compared with 4.1 per cent retail price inflation in the 12 months to January. The Maastricht criteria apparently were not crafted with such high inflation-adjusted interest rates in mind. It is therefore doubtful whether a 3 per cent PSBR-to-GDP ratio would be sustainable with such real rates and low inflation. Servicing the debt would become an ever-greater burden to the state. Mr Lamont will therefore have some explaining to do, if he bows to reality and abandons the concept of a balanced budget over the cycle on Budget Day, March 10. To embrace fully the fiscal provisions of Maastricht could be long-term fiscal folly. But if financial markets are to be kept sweet, the chancellor will have to find a credible middle way of defining a sustainable borrowing requirement. It will not be easy, if only because the British economic establishment has tried before and failed to produce an answer.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Black's bid to raise Fairfax stake is delayed THE Australian government yesterday deferred for 90 days a decision on whether to allow Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group to increase its stake in the Fairfax newspaper chain from 14.33 per cent to 25 per cent. The deferral means the government may not have to rule on the politically-sensitive application until after the next federal election, which is likely to be called within three months. The application is believed to have support from some ministers, although it is unclear whether Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, is sympathetic to Mr Black's claim that Fairfax requires a strong main shareholder. There is strong opposition in the ruling Labor party's parliamentary caucus to any relaxation of the existing foreign investment guidelines, which limit overseas ownership of newspapers to 20 per cent. The guidelines were imposed by the caucus before the sale of Fairfax to a consortium led by the Telegraph in December 1991. Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank, owns 5 per cent of Fairfax. Mr Dawkins is expected to produce a report to the federal Cabinet arguing that ministers should put their collective weight behind a request to the caucus to relax the rules. But Mr Neil O'Keefe, chairman of the caucus transport and communications committee, said the government would have difficulty in winning backbench support. 'There certainly would be substantial opposition to it,' he said. Mr Barry Jones, federal president of the Labor party, urged Mr Dawkins to take into account the 'broader issue' of the need to reduce the concentration of media ownership in Australia. Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and the Australian Financial Review, is responsible for about 20 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. About 70 per cent is controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.</p>

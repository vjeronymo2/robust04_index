			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'RECLUSIVE' REDFORD WILL GET 'REAL' IN TV SPECIAL DEC. 9  </P> <P> ROBERT REDFORD, so often described as "elusive, "reclusive" and "intensely  private," will finally lift that veil of secrecy -- a bit -- and reveal a side  of him never caught on camera before.  </P> <P> Producers Mark Cowen and Paul Hall are putting the final touches on a TV  special for NBC, set to air Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. This will focus on the "real"  Robert Redford and also his working relationship with Sydney Pollack. The  seventh Redford/Pollack movie collaboration, "Havana," opens, not so  coincidentally, on Dec. 10.  </P> <P> Redford has apparently decided to let his vast public finally "meet" him. And  to that end he sat for several candid, wide-ranging interviews with Cowen and  Hall. The two producers obtained rare film and early TV clips of Redford,  including some blooper-type material that shows Redford's seldom seen funny  side.  </P> <P> Executives at Universal, who have screened portions of the upcoming special are  happy and convinced that it will add not only to Redford's already vast legion  of fans, but also to the box-office of "Havana," too.  </P> <P> Oh, yes, Redford will escort his leading lady, Lena Olin, to the premiere of  "Havana" in New York. "Please don't read anything into that," my source said.  "They are just both in town at the same time and they are starring in the movie  together. It's just convenient. OK?" OK.  </P> <P> WAIT TILL you see it!! I'm talking about the eagerly awaited Fox TV special  "Marilyn: Something's Got to Give." Finally Marilyn's fans will view some of  the fabulous footage from her last, aborted film. And they will be stunned! Not  just by her beauty and the superb quality of her performing, but with the  inside story of what led up to 20th Century Fox's firing MM, denouncing her to  the press and suing her, before her death in August, 1962. (And, eventually,  quietly rehiring her at twice her salary. She was set to resume filming in  September.)  </P></p>

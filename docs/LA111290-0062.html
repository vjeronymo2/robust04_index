			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW WATER PRESSURE HURT EFFORT IN APARTMENT BLAZE;  </P> <P> FIRE: BURSTING PIPES -- NOT DISCONNECTED HYDRANTS -- ARE BLAMED. DAMAGE IN  THOUSAND OAKS COMPLEX RISES TO $12 MILLION.  </P> <P> Fire officials investigating a Saturday blaze that destroyed 21 apartment  buildings under construction in Thousand Oaks raised the damage estimate to $12  million Sunday and said firefighters were hindered by low water pressure in the  nine hydrants serving the complex.  </P> <P> The investigators said they had no evidence that any of the hydrants were  disconnected, as officials had said during the blaze Saturday. Instead, they  said some hydrants were rendered useless as bursting pipes in the burning  buildings caused water pressure to drop dramatically.  </P> <P> All units being built at The Knolls complex on Avenida de los Arboles had water  connections, said Ventura County Fire Investigator Bill Hager. As the buildings  collapsed, broken water pipes sent about 1,000 gallons of water a minute  flowing down the streets, he said.  </P> <P> Hager said the investigation is continuing, but he speculated that officials on  Saturday "jumped to a conclusion" that someone had disconnected the hydrants.  </P> <P> All the hydrants had been inspected by the Ventura County Fire Department  before construction began to make sure they were operational, said John Wade,  Fire Department spokesman.  </P> <P> Don Nelson, the city's director of utilities, said that the water system  provided twice as much water as required by fire codes but that the hydrant  system is designed to fight individual fires, not groups of buildings burning  simultaneously.  </P> <P> "It was an inferno," Nelson said. He said city officials and the county Fire  Department will meet to discuss whether changes are warranted.  </P> <P> Firefighters said they were beset by other problems during the fire that  destroyed 330 of the 544 apartments at the complex. High winds, low humidity  and the close proximity of buildings, coupled with the fact that the complex  was in "the most volatile stage of construction," contributed to the severity  of the blaze, Wade said.  </P> <P> "It's just a real dangerous, critical point of a construction job," he said,  noting that exposed wood building frames did not have the tile roofs that might  have slowed the fire.  </P> <P> Some of the buildings were only 12 feet apart, Wade said. Wind gusts were  clocked at 25 m.p.h.  </P> <P> On Sunday, gawkers climbed a nearby hill to gaze at the piles of rubble and  watch the efforts of 86 firefighters. Clouds of smoke continued to billow  through the area as bulldozers ripped down ruined buildings in search of  smoldering embers.  </P> <P> The blaze was ignited about 3 p.m. Saturday by a plumber using a torch to  solder a pipe, fire officials said. It destroyed 21 buildings and damaged  another for a loss of about $10 million, Wade said. Another $2 million in  construction equipment was destroyed. Wade said the loss is covered by  insurance. The first damage estimates were placed at $7 million.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of work the developers are going to have to do before they start  back into rebuilding," Wade said.  </P> <P> Officials of Newport Beach-based Regis Homes Corp., the project's co-owner,  declined to comment Sunday.  </P> <P> Officials at the Ventura headquarters of Interstate Plumbing Inc., which  employed the plumber who accidentally started the fire, and at the Thousand  Oaks offices of Lang Ranch Co., the project's co-owner and developer, could not  be reached.  </P> <P> About 250 firefighters from throughout the area fought the blaze at its height.  Units came from Ventura County, the city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County,  Oxnard, Camarillo State Hospital, Point Mugu and state forestry and fire  facilities.  </P> <P> Four firefighters suffered minor injuries.  </P> <P> "With the magnitude of destruction, we were fortunate to have only four  injuries," Wade said.  </P> <P> The fire was contained by 9 p.m. Saturday, but buildings continued to smolder  through the night.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Aaron Curtiss and Philipp Gollner and correspondent  Stephanie Stassel contributed to this article.  </P></p>

New research conducted in East Sussex indicates that the  level of knowledge displayed by young people in the country is  generally comparable to those in provincial towns.    The finding comes two months after Government statistics  revealed that the biggest increases in drug offences are now  taking place in rural areas.    Researchers surveyed 26 secondary schools in urban parts of  East Sussex and the rural district of North Wealden.    They found that the majority of schoolchildren claimed never  to have tried drugs. But three quarters of the teenagers said  they knew someone who used cannabis, ecstasy or amphetamines.    A third said they had been offered those drugs and of those,  two thirds had tried either cannabis, amphetamines, solvents and  hallucinogenic substances.    Boys were more likely to be offered drugs and most often  agreed to take them.    Researchers assessed the level of drug use among East Sussex  14 and 15-year-olds as 20-23 per cent. The level for North  Wealden was 17-23 per cent.    They concluded the level of "drug involvement" for the East  Sussex teenagers was lower than the same age group in the large  inner cities.    But they said they are "generally higher than those found in  samples in comparable areas elsewhere in the country."</p>

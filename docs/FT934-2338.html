			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Premiums on the key December futures contract on the FT-SE Index hit zero for the first time yesterday and gave a welcome relief to dealers struggling to roll out their positions ahead of Friday's all-important expiry of the December contract on the FT-SE 100, writes Peter John. December futures opened strongly on a brief rush of hopes that the Bundesbank would lower rates at its fortnightly council meeting on Thursday and pave the way for a further cut in UK rates. Unlike the underlying cash market the futures contract was unfettered by the effect of dividend payments and spiked up to a high of 3,278. Then, profit-taking took the contract back and by the afternoon it came back to its estimated fair value premium and matched the underlying market for the first tine. This gave the arbitrageurs a chance to unwind their short positions by buying the futures and selling the cash market. Much of the turnover represented investors rolling out their holdings to the March contract, which saw 5,255 lots traded by the close compared with 11,800 for December. But the spread between March and December remained far higher than most analysts estimates - it was at 20 by the close against fair value calculations of a 15-point premium - and restrained some institutional investors from making their move. December hit 3,259 by the official close and rose again in after hours dealing. Traded options turnover was down at only 25,600 contracts against 38,900 on Friday, with Glaxo the most heavily traded stock option, having 2,202 lots dealt. Asda was active on 1287 contracts.</p>

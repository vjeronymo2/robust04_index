Texas Eastern wants to expand and modify its facilities to transport an additional 105,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day (Dthd) to CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG) and wants Commission authorization to construct and operate the following facilities needed to transport those volumes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;13.9 miles of 36-inch-diameter replacement pipeline in two segments in Pennsylvania:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniontown Discharge mileposts (Mps) 1048.47 to 1058.18 for 9.7 miles in Fayette and Somerset Counties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bedford Discharge Mps 1106.65 to 1110.87 for 4.2 miles in Bedford County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;6,500 horsepower (hp) of compression at its existing Uniontown Compressor Station in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Texas Eastern pipeline facilities were originally proposed as part of the Liberty Pipeline Project in Docket Nos. CP92&hyph;720&hyph;000 and CP92&hyph;720&hyph;001. These facilities were discussed in our Notices of Intent dated January 22 and December 22, 1993. The Liberty Project applications were dismissed by the Commission without prejudice on August 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG wants to provide transportation of 105,000 Dthd from Texas Eastern to three utilities, an electric generation plant, and a cogeneration developer. To provide this transportation, CNG wants Commission authorization to construct and operate about 8,000 hp of compression (two 4,000-hp electric motor-driven compressor units) at a new station to be known as CNG's Chambersburg Compressor Station, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 1. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Room, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20246, or call (202) 208&hyph;1371.

Texas Eastern intends to use an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way. About 60 feet of the planned 85-foot width would use existing right-of-way. Consequently, about 25 feet of new clearing would be required in most areas. Following construction, the disturbed area would be restored and the 25 feet of new clearing would be allowed to revert to its former land use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at areas of steep side slopes, and in most areas where topsoil would be segregated (agricultural and residential areas). Additional working space would also be required adjacent to road and stream crossings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The EA Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are considered during the preparation of the EA. State and local government representatives are encouraged to notify their constituents of this proposed action and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Geology and soils  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Vegetation and wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Endangered and threatened species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Land use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Cultural resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Hazardous waste <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air quality and noise <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currently Identified Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by Texas Eastern and CNG. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues may be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The proposed pipelines would cross five perennial waterbodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

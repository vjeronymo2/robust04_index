			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Since I do not have children, I seldom watch the Charlie Brown TV specials.  </P> <P> Fortunately, however, I read in the newspaper of the unique nature of the show  aired on March 16, "Why, Charlie Brown, Why?" And special it was indeed! How  thankful I am that I did not miss it. The sensitivity, compassion and  tenderness conveyed through the story of little Janice, the leukemia patient,  was almost overwhelming. I found myself falling in love with these characters  and am not at all embarrassed to admit that they moved me to tears.  </P> <P> This was a shining example of television at its finest and is one program that  should be replayed many times.  </P> <P> Ann Latham Agreda, Los Angeles  </P></p>

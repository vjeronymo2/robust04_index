			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has  called for the involvement of Panchayats [rural bodies] to  disseminate information about developmental activities.  Inaugurating the 21st conference of state ministers of  information and cinematography in New Delhi today, he said  Panchayat leaders should form part of a vital link in the two  way communicational structure that should be established. This,  he said, is very essential as a large number of beneficiaries of  social welfare schemes are ignorant of them. Drawing attention  to the revolution that is taking place in the field of  information technology, Mr. Rao said we should preserve our  cultural identity to prevent our society from becoming  directionless.    Ruling out banning of satellite television channels, the  prime minister said that Doordarshan [Indian Television] and All  India Radio have a lot to learn from foreign media though they  should not emulate them. He called for more attention to  developing the programs that will be presented to the people.    In his keynote address, the information and broadcasting  minister, Mr. K.P. Singh Deo, called for better coordination  between the central and state governments to make mass  communication more effective. He said his ministry is having a  fresh look at the composition and terms of inter-media publicity  coordination committees that are already working at the state  level.    The meeting is discussing in three sessions the subjects of  entertainment tax and films, interpersonal media, and the  electronic media.</p>

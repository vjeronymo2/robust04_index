			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kunick in black with Pounds 4.8m KUNICK, the amusement machines and care homes group, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m for the year to September 25, against losses of Pounds 11.8m last time. The swing was achieved both through a Pounds 1.2m contribution from the nursing homes business jointly owned with County NatWest Ventures, compared with a loss of Pounds 55,000 last time, and the absence of Pounds 12.2m in exceptional charges for restructuring. Profits were also helped by a sharp fall in interest charges from Pounds 5.99m to Pounds 2.1m. This was partly the result of the Pounds 12.5m sale of 50 per cent of Goldsborough Holdings, the nursing homes division, last year. At the operating level, profits were 7 per cent lower at Pounds 6m, due to the sales of the visitor attractions business. Sales were 14 per cent down to Pounds 94.1m. Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said the group intended to float Goldsborough in the first half of next year, if conditions were appropriate. The division was expected to double profits in the current year, he said. The proceeds of flotation would be used to help Kunick increase its exposure to the amusement machine-linked leisure market. In the UK, Kunick's amusement machine business surged ahead due to restructuring and the increased Pounds 6 payout which had proved 'tremendously popular' with players. Operating profits rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 3.2m, on sales 9 per cent lower. In France, where Kunick supplies amusement machines and runs a franchised retail chain, operating profits increased by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.5m. The care services division doubled to Pounds 850,000. The dividend is passed for the second consecutive year. Earnings per share were 0.02p, against losses of 7.34p.</p>

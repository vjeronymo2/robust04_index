			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: ATLANTA LOSS WAS SICKENING SEQUEL FOR PADRES  </P> <P> Turn the scriptwriters loose. This is perfect for a made-for-television movie.  Studios will be fighting for the rights.  </P> <P> Call it "Back to the Past."  </P> <P> And this isn't exactly a blast from the past. This is a bummer revisited.  </P> <P> Michael J. Fox won't get a role in this one. This is no comedy. This is a spot  for Vincent Price or Boris Karloff. This one will be rated R, not for violence  but rather for being downright gruesome.  </P> <P> What we are talking about is the Padres and the ways they find to lose baseball  games.  </P> <P> Back to the past?  </P> <P> Remember Houston?  </P> <P> That's right, Houston. It was early June of 1989, and the Padres were about to  turn the Astrodome into a House of Horrors.  </P> <P> Let's grimace and reminisce . . .  </P> <P> June 6 -- Padres lead, 7-4, with no one on and two out in the ninth. Suddenly,  the bases are loaded and the score is 7-6. Mark Davis throws strike three past  a swinging Alex Trevino. Whew! Whew? The ball is in the dirt, skipping to  Benito Santiago's left. He retrieves it and tags Ken Caminiti charging home  from third, but the ball pops loose again, and the tying run scores.  </P> <P> Houston wins in the 10th when Bip Roberts bobbles Glenn Davis' single and Bill  Doran scores from first. It is Mark Davis' first loss.  </P> <P> Final: 8-7, Houston.  </P> <P> June 8 -- Padres lead, 5-1, going into the ninth, but neither Eric Show nor  Mark Davis can close it out. However, the Padres score in the 10th to take a  6-5 lead. But . . . Glenn Davis hits a two-run homer -- off Mark Davis -- in  the bottom of the 10th.  </P> <P> Final: 7-6, Houston.  </P> <P> When the Padres were so close and yet too far from San Francisco in the final  days of the season, we kept hearing "what if" they had won those games in  Houston. Those two games haunted them all summer long and into fall and through  the winter.  </P> <P> You don't lament the 7-2 losses or 5-1 losses or even 3-2 losses. You lament  the wins that take horribly unexpected twists and turn instead into losses.  </P> <P> Houston can now be put to rest. That was last year's nightmare.  </P> <P> Anyone who had the misfortune of tuning into Channel 51 on Sunday afternoon  knows where I am coming from and where I am going.  </P> <P> That was Stupor Sunday. That was the day the Padres went back to the past.  </P> <P> This was a game the Padres at first had no business winning and then no  business losing. This was a day in which they went from heroes to goats and  from geniuses to dunces in almost the length of time it takes to run one of  their silly promotional commercials . . . Comprende?  </P> <P> Yes, it might well have been a Sunday to celebrate.  </P> <P> After all, Atlanta had a 7-6 lead with two out in the ninth, only to have the  Padres draw even when Jack Clark walked and Mike Pagliarulo doubled.  </P> <P> Given new life, the Padres put together an inning fit for a highlight film.  Actually, it wasn't a whole inning. It was a swing. Dennis Rasmussen, of all  people, pinch-hit and drove a three-run double to right-center in the 10th.  </P> <P> Things were downright giddy in the dugout. This struggling little crew had  seemingly been hit by an industrial strength jolt of adrenaline. A victory like  this could pick things up and turn them around.  </P> <P> Except . . .  </P> <P> Jeff Blauser hit a three-run home run off Craig Lefferts in the bottom of the  10th to tie the game. This was a little bit like fighting off a pack of wolves  and then dying of a flea bite. Jeff Blauser?  </P> <P> Still, the Padres would have a chance to survive, but for an umpire who could  not see and a base-runner who could not count.  </P> <P> Bip Roberts was on first in the 12th when Robbie Alomar hit a ground ball to  Atlanta shortstop Andres Thomas. Hesitant at first, Thomas double-pumped and  threw too late to second to get Roberts. The only problem was that umpire  Charlie Reliford called him out.  </P> <P> When Tony Gwynn followed with a single, Roberts would have scored the  tie-breaking run. As it turned out, Gwynn's single succeeded only in advancing  Alomar to second.  </P> <P> It was at this point that Alomar lost track of where he was and what the  situation was. When Joe Carter flied deep to center, Alomar loped around third  as if two were out . . . rather than one. When his screaming teammates awakened  him, he took a shortcut back to second and was ultimately called out for  failing to re-cross third base.  </P> <P> End of inning.  </P> <P> One swing later, one swing into the Braves' 12th, the game was over.  </P> <P> Andres Thomas hit a home run off Lefferts to give the Braves an 11-10 victory .  . . and the Padres an 11-10 loss. Andres Thomas?  </P> <P> This was every bit as shattering as Houston '89. What was more frightening this  time was that this game was almost a microcosm of what 1990 has been thus far  to the Padres. This game was up and down and in and out and ultimately  determined by yet more home run pitches and yet another embarrassing mental  lapse.  </P> <P> Stupor Sunday won't cost the Padres the pennant, but what it represents will.  </P></p>

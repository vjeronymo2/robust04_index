			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT BATTLE MAY SHIFT TO BALLOT  </P> <P> It's not clear when a special election might happen in Seal Beach, but people  on both sides of a controversial proposal to develop the old Hellman Ranch are  already gearing up for it.  </P> <P> First, supporters of Mola Development Corp.'s $200-million plan to build 329  homes started an initiative drive to have the voters approve it.  </P> <P> The new City Council majority has rejected the plan but will have to approve it  or call a special election if Mola's supporters -- Seal Beach Citizens for  Parks, Open Space and Responsible Government -- gather signatures from 2,700 of  the city's registered voters.  </P> <P> But the measure would probably not be alone on the ballot.  </P> <P> On a 3-2 vote, the City Council on Tuesday ordered a 15-member residents'  committee to draft an alternative plan by Dec. 1 that could serve as a rival  ballot measure.  </P> <P> Frank Laszlo, who introduced the idea and drew support from council members  Gwen Forsythe and Marilyn Bruce Hastings, said he thinks voters should be able  to choose between two plans.  </P> <P> Mayor Edna Wilson and Councilman Joe Hunt dissented, saying that giving voters  a choice of "yes or no" is sufficient. Wilson and Hunt support the current  initiative drive.  </P> <P> Critics of Laszlo's proposal called it an attempt to cloud the issue and said  that a comprehensive plan could not be assembled in such a short time. The Mola  plan took more than four years to develop and includes input from the Coastal  Commission, the state Department of Fish and Game and various city boards and  committees.  </P> <P> A third measure might land on the ballot as well if the Wetlands Restoration  Society has its way. Don May, secretary for the environmental group, urged the  City Council on Tuesday to declare the Hellman Ranch property a hazardous zone  because the council's rejection of the Mola plan was based partly on reports  that the ground was unstable.  </P> <P> No serious alternative plan can be offered until Mola is out of the way, he  said.  </P> <P> May suggested that the council put the issue before the voters, but the council  took no action on the idea and it was clear that the suggestion did not have  enough support to pass.  </P> <P> Former Councilman Victor Grgas, who supports the initiative drive by Seal Beach  Citizens, said the Wetlands Restoration Society should be required to gather  signatures if it wants to put a measure on the ballot.  </P> <P> Tim Roberts, director of finance and operations for Mola, criticized the  Wetlands Restoration proposal, calling it an attempt to get the city to help  undermine Mola's plan. Wetlands Restoration and Mola Development Corp. have  both sued the city.SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Although offerings in Australia this week are the lowest of any week so far this season, prices have continued to ease gradually. The market indicator up to March 24 was 8 cents lower than at the end of last week, the national basis being 434 cents. a kg., a new low point for the season. The slide downwards continued despite continuing heavy withdrawals during or prior to each sale, as growers attempt to resist lower prices and hope for better conditions later. All statistical evidence at present makes a forecast of wool market strength highly tentative.</p>

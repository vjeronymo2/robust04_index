			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Mexican boost as Laser-Scan hits Pounds 45,000 Following the return to profit in the second half of 1992, Laser-Scan Holdings, computer software group, produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 45,000 for the first six months of 1993, compared with a Pounds 408,000 loss. Turnover for the period expanded by 45 per cent from Pounds 3.99m to Pounds 5.78m. The directors said that much of the improvement could be attributed to the final deliveries against the Mexican contract. The substantial amounts of third party hardware involved, although at relatively low margins, 'made a useful contribution to profit' they said. The second half is not expected to produce the same level of profit as last year - Pounds 488,000 for the six months - although the directors believed there was the potential ' to grow and to improve its profitability.' Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 2.5p).</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: European Leisure in the black - Financial restructuring will enable company to continue trading European Leisure, the debt- laden discotheque and snooker hall operator, has agreed a financial restructuring with its banking syndicate. Mr Clive Bastin, chairman, warned yesterday that failure to obtain shareholder approval for the proposals would seriously jeopardise the ability of the company to continue trading. The group also announced a return to the black for the year to the end of June. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 221,000 were struck on turnover of Pounds 68.4m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 54.9m on turnover of Pounds 75.1m. Existing bank facilities of Pounds 79m are almost fully utilised. Under the restructuring the banks, led by Barclays, would convert Pounds 20m of the debt into new ordinary and preference shares. The remaining Pounds 59m would be put on a four-year term, with Pounds 3m of interest rolled up into a convertible loan note over three years. At the same time convertible unsecured loan stock worth Pounds 1.6m would be converted into new ordinary shares, along with 26m convertible preference shares. In addition an open offer of 175m new ordinary shares would be made to all existing shareholders at 1p. Yesterday the shares closed at 2 1/4 p. After the completion of the plan in four years there would be 1.6bn ordinary shares in issue. The banks would own between 64 and 71 per cent of the company, depending on the take up of the open offer. If the open offer were not taken up, existing shareholders would have 9.9 per cent of the share capital, preference shareholders 9.5 per cent and convertible unsecured loan stock holders 4.8 per cent. Management share option schemes account for the remaining 4.8 per cent. Under the plan, gearing at the year end would have been 101 per cent, compared with an actual level of 218 per cent. The proposals will be put to shareholders on December 21 in Dublin. About 30 per cent of the company is now held by Irish institutions. European Leisure, which runs the Hippodrome in Leicester Square and the Camden Palace, ran into trouble in the late 1980s following rapid expansion through acquisitions. Mr Michael Ward, former chairman and chief executive, and two former directors, Mr Jeremy Howarth and Mr George Hendry, were charged in October with conspiracy to defraud, conspiring to create a false market in the company's shares, and theft. Mr Ian Rock, chief executive since 1991, said yesterday that the group had virtually completed its withdrawal from continental Europe and sold its non-performing UK units. Mr Bastin said the group now had a good core business - 'but clearly we are in the survival business still'. The group operates discotheques and pubs aimed at the youth market, owns the Riley snooker clubs, and designs and manufactures Maygay amusement arcade machines. Operating profits were Pounds 8.43m, up from a previous Pounds 7.66m. Losses per share were 1.21p (34.57p).</p>

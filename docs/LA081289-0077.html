			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE MUSEUMS GIVE WINGS TO THE FLIGHT FANS' FANCY  </P> <P> David G. Price says his fascination with airplanes started when he was 7 years  old. He lived half a block from what was then known as Clover Field and today  is Santa Monica Airport.  </P> <P> "It was during World War II and I used to go over to the field and watch the  airplanes take off," says Price, 56, president of the new Museum of Flying.  </P> <P> "My parents were from England and as a little boy, I'd dream of flying  Spitfires," he recalls. His dream came true: He eventually became a Navy pilot,  and four years ago, he flew a Spitfire over the hedgerows and green fields of  England. He purchased that Spitfire and another and brought them to Santa  Monica Airport, where, after talks with Donald Douglas Jr., the idea of a new  Museum of Flying was conceived.  </P> <P> On the same site where Donald Douglas Sr. once built airplanes, the museum is  part of an ultramodern complex adjoining the DC-3 restaurant and Supermarine, a  fixed-base operator that services private aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport.  </P> <P> The Museum of Flying is one of five major air/aerospace museums in Southern  California, where aerospace is a key part of the economy. Although operating  independently, the museums are united in their reverence for vintage aircraft  and frequently cooperate on restoration projects or loan planes to each other.  </P> <P> Two museums, the Aerospace Hall at the California Museum of Science and  Industry in Los Angeles and the Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego, trace  flight from its beginnings into the Space Age. A fourth, the March Field Museum  at the Air Force base near Riverside, is a military museum as well as a flying  museum. And a fifth, Planes of Fame in Chino, offers a nostalgic look at famous  "Warbirds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Douglas Artifacts Used  </P> <P> Many artifacts from the Donald Douglas Museum were incorporated into the Museum  of Flying, including furnishings from Douglas' boardroom with more than 60  models of Douglas aircraft. Also, there is the drafting table where he created  the likes of the New Orleans, a Douglas World Cruiser now hanging from the  museum's ceiling, along with several other aircraft.  </P> <P> Other Douglas planes on display include a DC-2, a DC-3 (widely acclaimed as one  of the greatest aircraft ever built), a 1951 Navy AD-6 Skyraider bomber, an  A-26 Invader bomber and a Douglas A-4 combat aircraft.  </P> <P> Price's British Spitfires also are on display. His Mk XIV served in the Indian  Air Force and was rescued derelict from an Indian airfield in 1978. His Mk IX  was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Force in Casablanca and may be the last  surviving Spitfire that flew with American colors.  </P> <P> A Curtiss JN-4D "Jenny" hangs over a display and video exhibit on wing-walkers  of the post-World War I era when many Americans were introduced to airplanes  through barnstormers at carnival-type air shows.  </P> <P> Early air exhibits at the Aerospace Hall of the California Museum of Science  and Industry include an airworthy replica of the Wright Brothers' Model B  aircraft. The craft was used in a 1978 television movie, "Winds of Kitty Hawk."  Later aircraft include a T-38 on loan from the Air Force, a DC-3, a DC-8 and a  police helicopter.  </P> <P> However, a major emphasis at this museum is space exploration. From Aug. 21 to  Aug. 29, for instance, the Aerospace Hall will present live photos broadcast  from Voyager II as it passes Neptune before leaving the solar system.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pictures Relayed to Museum  </P> <P> "These will be the first close-up pictures we have of Neptune," says Eugene  Harrison Ph.D., aerospace curator. "The satellite will transmit the data back  to Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will turn around  and broadcast what it is receiving via satellite. . . . Visitors to the museum  will be seeing Neptune at the same time as the scientists at JPL."  </P> <P> Special exhibits through Sept. 4 include "Visions of Space," 25 years of the  space-probe photos recorded by JPL, and "Apollo 11 Revisited," a special  tribute to the July 20, 1969, moon landing.  </P> <P> The Aerospace Historical Center in San Diego also has space exhibits, including  mock-ups of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space capsules.  </P> <P> Exhibits are arranged chronologically and start with a replica of a Wright  Brothers plane, followed by World War I-era planes and a replica of Charles  Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Mail to War  </P> <P> "We have an excellent exhibit on early airmail," says William Immenschuh,  president of the San Diego museum board, "a barnstorming exhibit and airplanes  of the '30s." These are followed by planes for sport flying and a special  exhibit honoring the Flying Tigers for their activities in China during World  War II.  </P> <P> Military buffs may enjoy a mock-up of a portion of the deck of the U.S.  aircraft carrier Yorktown, a 1940s-era ship.  </P> <P> "You walk onto the deck of the carrier and there are some American airplanes  and a Japanese Zero and the ready room and the bridge of the carrier,"  Immenschuh says.  </P> <P> Military buffs will also enjoy a trip to the March Field Museum. Originally a  pilot training base, March later was a base for combat-unit training, a World  War II fighter and bomber crew training base and a Strategic Air Command  installation. It is now home for the 15th Air Force and SAC bomber and tanker  units.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Survey of Eras  </P> <P> The museum reflects these various eras, from inside exhibits like the trainer  "Jennies" to a U-2 spy plane out on the flight line.  </P> <P> Exhibits inside include a P-59 (one of the first military jets), a B-1 jet  engine split in half and positioned on opposite sides of the aisle, a ball  turret that carried the belly gunner on a B-17 bomber, models of planes and  missiles, cut-aways of engines, flight suits and other uniforms and other  vintage planes.  </P> <P> A full-size, cut-away cockpit of a B-47 used in the movie "Strategic Air  Command" offers an inside view of this plane that was based at March through  the early 1960s.  </P> <P> From the museum, visitors can take a bus out to the "flight line" and see 31  vintage aircraft, including the F-4, F-105, F-89, B-52, B-24, B-17, T-38, 0-2,  B-47 and KC-97.  </P> <P> "The majority of all those airplanes are tied into March Air Force Base in one  way or another," says Senior Master Sgt. Stephen P. Condos, director of the  museum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Planes in Chino  </P> <P> Military planes are also the foundation of the Planes of Fame at the Chino  Airport. Sixty rare planes are crowded into two hangars, one additional  building and surrounding grounds.  </P> <P> A special exhibit of World War II Japanese aircraft includes a Mitsubishi  A6M5-Zero, believed to be the only flying Zero fighter left, and a rare  kamikaze suicide device, the OHKA-11, which was basically a piloted bomb. The  OHKA-11 used rocket fuel and was carried by a mother plane and released a few  miles short of the target.  </P> <P> German warplanes include the Stormbird, a 1942 jet-powered ME-262A-1a Luftwaffe  Messerschmitt and the Volksjager (People's Fighter), a Heinkel HE-162A-1 jet  flown in the last days of World War II.  </P> <P> The museum's Soviet planes -- a MIG-15 and a MIG-17, which were acquired  through a broker from Poland, and a 1947 biplane -- currently are the center of  a controversy.  </P> <P> The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says the planes must be  surrendered to Customs or sold to a U.S. military facility because they were  purchased in violation of regulations forbidding transportation of military  equipment from certain countries. Museum officials believe they have not done  anything wrong and have negotiated a five-month reprieve to resolve the  problem, according to John Maloney, a vice president of the museum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> American Planes  </P> <P> American planes displayed include a 1944 Ryan FR-1 Fireball -- with a  combination of reciprocating (piston) and jet-power plants -- and an RB-26C  Invader used in Korea. The Invader sports a Black Birds emblem lettered with  the motto of reconnaissance crews: "Alone! Unarmed! Unafraid!"  </P> <P> Fighter Rebuilders, a private company that restores the museum's planes in  addition to private planes, works on the premises, and visitors can peer into  the hangar.  </P> <P> Locating parts is sometimes a challenge and often expensive, according to  Maloney, who is also the restoration foreman.  </P> <P> David Price says his Spitfires were "in pretty good shape" when he bought them,  but previous owners had spent thousands of staff hours building them from  "rusting hulks."  </P> <P> But Price feels the end result is well worth the effort.  </P> <P> "Our prime hope is that (people) get excited about what their predecessors  created," Price says, "so when they leave they can say, 'You know, maybe I can  do something like that too.'

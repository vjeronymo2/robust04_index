			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Technology: High hopes in the venture stakes - Louise Kehoe introduces a rare breed of risk takers whose 'can do' attitude is paying off handsomely / British entrepreneurs 'I JUST love building businesses,' Michael Skok declares. At 'almost 31' he is a veteran entrepreneur with two successful computer software enterprises to his name and ambitions to exploit the 'almost limitless opportunities of the European software market'. Skok's latest venture is European Software Publishing (ESP), based in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Formed in 1988, the company licenses personal computer software products, mostly from US publishers, and markets them in Europe. 'We recognised a problem and set about building a solution,' says Skok. The 'problem' is the difficulty that many US software companies face when trying to enter the European market. 'They see the opportunities in Europe, but they do not have the resources to do it right,' says Skok. He formed ESP to provide marketing, distribution and customer support services for selected software products, initially in the UK and now also in France and Germany. By taking on several software products ESP can achieve economies of scale that elude most individual software publishers. 'It is a simple idea,' Skok acknowledges, but one that has proven lucrative. At the end of last year, ESP had monthly retail revenues of Pounds 2m. Among the first products taken on by ESP were those of Symantec, a California software house best known for its 'Norton's Utilities' programs. Having increased Symantec's UK monthly sales 50-fold over a period of three years, in April ESP sold UK publishing rights for the products back to Symantec for Pounds 15m in shares. This year, ESP has signed exclusive UK marketing agreements with two other US software companies: ON Technology, the company formed in 1987 by Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development, which specialises in communications tools for the Apple Macintosh; and Beyond, which publishes an advance electronic mail system. Skok describes ESP as a software nursery: 'We provide the environment that allows good personal computer products to take root and flourish in Europe,' he says. An unusual aspect of ESP's strategy is its reliance upon international alliances. Too many British companies fail to 'think globally' in the early stages, Skok maintains. He is also convinced that to be successful software companies need to prove their products in the US market to establish credibility. Skok speaks from experience with his first software venture, Skok Systems, based in Boston, which he co-founded with his brother David. They developed a computer-aided design and manufacturing system designed to run on Hewlett-Packard minicomputers and earned the business annual revenues of Dollars 15m before licensing the program to HP. He went on to spend two years at Invent, a British venture capital group, before forming ESP four years ago. While he recognises the opportunities of the US market, Skok is intent upon building up his British-based company. 'We are combining US software expertise with UK management,' he says. Yet the UK business environment and culture do not favour entrepreneurial ventures, he feels. The biggest cultural barrier is a fear of failure. 'The British school system is highly competitive, but it does not allow for failure,' he says. 'You have got to be able to take risks, knowing that some of them won't pay off and that you will learn from things that go wrong,' he adds. Also lacking in the UK, he suggests, is a 'Can do attitude', a degree of confidence and enthusiasm for solving problems that is the hallmark of US entrepreneurs. However, the European software market is complex, he acknowledges. Attitudes to software purchases vary widely in different countries. 'The Germans test every minute feature of a program. In France the user interface is very important so programs have to look pretty. The UK buyer combines a bit of both approaches.' Unlike the US, where corporate software purchases are frequently influenced by end users who badger their data processing departments into acquiring new technology, the European market is 'corporate driven', Skok notes. 'The individual influence isn't there. We don't have technology junkies]' More seriously, he notes that too few business people 'see it as part of their job to understand computing'. On the reluctance of senior managers in Europe to make use of PCs, Skok is unequivocal. 'It is disgraceful. Surely they must recognise that technology is going to have a big impact on their businesses in the next five years. How can any senior manager not include it on the agenda?' His vision of the potential of computing is, however, tempered with down-to-earth pragmatism. New software must work with existing systems and provide a tangible business advantage, he says. IT investments must also be cost-justified. 'We cannot afford a software revolution, we are not looking for wizzy products, we are looking for business tools.' The series will continue next week.</p>

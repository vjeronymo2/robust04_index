			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: India Fund to convert to open-ended status THE India Fund, one of the largest country funds, with net assets of more than Pounds 240m, is to be converted into an open-ended fund to reduce the substantial discount to net asset value at which the shares have been trading. The fund, created in 1986, traded at a premium to NAV until 1990 but moved to a discount in 1991. A week ago, before the plan was announced, the shares were trading at a 16 per cent discount, or 9 per cent taking withholding tax into account. Political troubles, the opening of other investment avenues in Indian equities and the perception that the Bombay market was overvalued all contributed to the discount, said Mr Charles Lillis, of fund managers Merrill Lynch International Capital Markets (Guernsey). Subject to approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 28, shareholders can redeem shares at net asset value less India's 10 per cent capital gains tax and the fund will be free to issue shares. Since the plan was announced, the share price has risen from 214p on May 5 to 228p, giving a market value of Pounds 215m. The price compares with a net asset value of 235p per share after allowing for Indian withholding tax. The NAV of the fund in local currency terms had risen from Rs48.7 per share at launch to Rs126.48 by April 29 this year. In sterling terms, the rise was from 100p per share to 255p.</p>

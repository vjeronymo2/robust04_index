			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Arts: Free speech impersonated - Television By rights British television ought to be declaring tonight a gala occasion: BBC2 is screening a new programme by Kenneth Griffith, an actor familiar from dozens of British movies who, in the latter half of his life, has turned himself into a maker of unique documentaries. Instead, tonight's programme, 'Roger Casement - Heart Of Darkness', is tucked away in the Timewatch slot without so much as a promotional picture in Radio Times. Still, better that it should go out quietly than not at all. Griffith has been known to call himself, with some justification, 'Britain's most suppressed film maker', and the most famous of those suppressions occurred in 1973 when his programme Hang Out Your Brightest Colours, about the IRA leader Michael Collins, was banned. Now, nearly 20 years later, Griffith is finally managing to bring to our screens some idea of the Irish nationalist case which, in this country so proud of its tradition of free speech, has so rarely been expressed on television. Today when even the comments of an officially legitimate organisation such as Sinn Fein are suppressed by the British government (confirming for so many naive Americans the belief that what they see in Ireland is the last grinding of the British imperialist jackboot) Griffith's achievement is all the more remarkable. He has done it by spending the first half of his programme detailing Casement's work in Africa and South America where he championed the cause of enslaved black people, only turning to the championship of Irish nationalism in the latter part of his life. In what has become his trademark Griffith plays not only the role of his central character, but all the others too: Joseph Conrad (who, it seems, was inspired to write 'Heart Of Darkness' by meeting Casement in the Congo), King Leopold of Belgium, Lord Lansdowne, and so on. As is also his firm habit, Griffith takes all the historical parts of his script from original documents, a practice which makes his programmes closer to true 'documentaries' than most, but his own feelings are also allowed full rein. Since he is a passionate, committed, and deeply opinionated man this makes for powerful programmes, full of the strong flavours we expect in print, which are so rarely tolerated in broadcasting. With his willingness to express contrary views of people ranging from Napoleon to the Afrikaners, and his fervent attachment to the cause of personal freedom, Griffith has become the Celtic conscience of British television. He is now 71, but today's programme is a splendid addition to an already impressive CV. May there be many more.                             *      *      * The increase in cheap populist rubbish on British television, noted so often in this column over the last few months, shows every sign of continuing and even intensifying. Dial Midnight which describes itself as 'a live late-night phone-in' is screened by ITV in London and northern Scotland on Friday nights in time to catch people coming in from the pubs. Its young female presenters, Samantha Norman (yes, Barry's daughter) and Anastasia Cooke specialise in items about the sexually bizarre. Two weeks ago they brought us Nikki who, we were told, was born with both a penis and a vagina but was now pregnant. Last week they interviewed an American surgeon whose speciality is penis enlargement. In the studio was a heavily disguised person who claimed to have had the treatment. Every weekday morning BBC1 is now running Good Morning With Anne And Nick, a classic example of increased competition producing not variety but more of the same: the BBC is responding to ITV's ratings success This Morning which is presented by husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. The BBC version has a daily reading from Barbara Cartland, beauty hints, a medical phone-in, and much pouring of tea as Nick grins at Anne and Anne smiles distantly at Nick. Furthermore it has been announced that in January, when the new ITV franchises finally come into effect and the scramble down market gets going in earnest, BBC1 will launch an early evening magazine programme called Entertainment Express dealing with Hollywood gossip, prime time television, mass-market music, best-selling books, Nintendo and home entertainment. It sounds like a classic example of media howl-round with television feeding increasingly off its own regurgitated material. In this new world of television if series such as The South Bank Show are to be preserved, and to continue transmission at a reasonable hour, we should no doubt take more trouble to express our admiration. Melvyn Bragg's series succeeded Aquarius 15 years ago as ITV's flagship arts programme, and the standard has been consistently high for so long that it is hard not to take it for granted. This week's programme on the Royal Ballet's comparatively young ballerinas, Darcey Bussell and Viviana Durante, was typical in many ways. Technically well made, it provided insights which must have been new to all but the specialist, and though there was a smattering of 'home life' detail (taking the Jeep to the garage, wandering in the market) the programme concentrated on what the SBS has always done best: analysing and illustrating for the lay viewer the path to success in whichever art form happens to be the week's subject.                             *      *      * Michael Palin's greatest asset is his Mr Nice Guy persona. Even in Monty Python's Flying Circus, while the others were being outrageous or manic, he tended to be the more reasonable one, or the fall guy. The same was true of his role in A Fish Called Wanda, and it was surely his unaffected charm, verging occasionally on diffidence, which made his 1989 travel series Around The World In 80 Days so popular. That said, charm alone may not always be enough. There were nice moments in the opening episode of his new travel series, Pole To Pole, as when, panning for gold in a Lapland river, he shouted at his film crew 'Go away, go away, leave me here, I don't need you any more', or found himself being propositioned by a lonely lighthouse keeper. But that episode which felt like such a long hour turned out to be only 50 minutes. Perhaps matters will improve today as he travels through Russia.                             *      *      * Mention of Wanda brings to mind this week's 'Screen One' production, Trust Me, in which Alfred Molina played a pathological fantasist/liar who comes unstuck when he tries to sell the story of his life as a contract killer to a publisher and is promptly hired to bump off the publisher's wife. Both works are comedy thrillers, a form in which there is such a strong British tradition, but while most people who have watched Wanda would happily watch it again it is hard to imagine anyone bothering to watch Trust Me twice. Why? Perhaps because the laughs in the television film are fewer and milder than those in Cleese's film. But more important, surely, is Cleese's willingness to re-work and polish his material almost obsessively, a habit which paid off in Fawlty Towers as well as Wanda. No doubt lots of hard work went into Trust Me, but that much more effort might have turned it into an endlessly repeatable classic.</p>

The survey will, for the first time, collect comprehensive information on trade in financial services between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons. It is intended to cover the universe of such transactions by type and by country. The information is needed to support trade policy initiatives, including trade negotiations, on financial services and to compile the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts. The survey will be conducted once every 5 years under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The first survey will cover 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on these proposed rules will receive consideration if submitted in writing on or before September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be mailed to the Office of the Chief, International Investment Division (BE&hyph;50), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, or hand delivered to Room M&hyph;100, 1441 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005.

The survey will be conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce, under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (P.L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended) and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100&hyph;418, 15 U.S.C. 4908(b)). Section 4(a) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act provides that ``The President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and feasible_.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;(4) conduct&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;benchmark surveys with respect to trade in services between unaffiliated United States persons and foreign persons&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Order 12518, the President delegated the authority under the Act as concerns international trade in services to the Secretary of Commerce, who has redelegated it to BEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs that ``The Secretary (of Commerce) shall ensure that&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;there is included in the Data Bank information on service sector activity that is as complete and timely as information on economic activity in the merchandise sector. The Secretary shall undertake a new benchmark survey of services transactions, including transactions with respect to&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;banking services; (and) brokerage services.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major purposes of the survey are to provide the information on financial services needed in monitoring U.S. services trade, analyzing its effects on the U.S. economy, formulating U.S. international trade policy, supporting bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations, compiling the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts, developing U.S. international price indexes for services, assessing U.S. competitiveness in international trade in services, and improving the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, the BE&hyph;80 survey will be conducted once every 5 years, and the first survey will be for 1994. The survey is intended to cover the universe of financial services transactions between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons. Reporting is required from U.S. financial services providers who have sales to or purchases from unaffiliated foreign persons in all covered financial services combined in excess of $1 million during the reporting year. Those financial services providers meeting this criteria must supply data on the amount of their sales or purchases of each covered type of service, disaggregated by country. U.S. financial services providers that have covered transactions of less than $1 million during the reporting year are asked to provide, on a voluntary basis, estimates only of their total sales or purchases of each type of financial service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that the information from the benchmark survey will be updated in nonbenchmark years by an annual follow-on survey that is more limited in scope and that will cover only a sample of companies reporting in the BE&hyph;80 survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed rules do not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed rules contain a collection of information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. A request for review of the forms has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 4 to 150 hours, with an overall average burden of 7.5 hours. This includes time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments from the public regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information should be addressed to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE&hyph;1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of Commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that this proposed rulemaking, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level for the survey excludes most small businesses from mandatory reporting. Reporting is required only if total sales or total purchases transactions in financial services with unaffiliated foreign persons by U.S. persons who are financial services providers, or by U.S. persons whose consolidated enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial services provider, exceed $1 million during the year. In addition, international business tends to be conducted mainly by the larger companies in a given industry; in the financial services industry, this is particularly true, because of the high degrees of consolidation occurring in that industry in the United States during the past several years. In any event, small businesses tend to have specialized operations and activities, so those with reportable transactions will likely not have significant amounts of data to report; therefore, the burden on them will be relatively small. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 801 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Economic statistics, Balance of payments, Foreign trade, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol S.

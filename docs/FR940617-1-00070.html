			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Two comments objected to the proposed warning statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;333.92(c)(6) for concentrated products containing quaternary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ammonium compounds, which states, ``Dilute with distilled water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before use because acidic or hard water may render the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inactive.'' One comment contended that this proposed warning is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prejudicial to the quaternary ammonium products that can act in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acidic or hard water and noted that the existence of quaternary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ammonium compounds that can act as antimicrobials in acidic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hard water was recognized in the tentative final monograph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (43 FR 1210 at 1219). The comment recommended that the labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of products containing quaternary ammonium compounds include a statement, based on appropriate laboratory tests, about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability of the product to perform in acidic solutions and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of water hardness (described as parts per million (ppm)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calcium carbonate) in which the product will continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other comment stated that several concentrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 50 percent benzalkonium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloride, U.S.P.) registered with the Environmental Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency (EPA) conform with the hard-water tolerance requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and therefore can maintain activity at a water-hardness level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 600 ppm. The comment also stated that pH must be reduced below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.5 before the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreased to any significant extent (Ref. 1). The comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that, because normal potable water supplies do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach these levels for either hardness or acidity, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in proposed &sect;333.92(c)(6) for diluting only with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled water is inappropriate and needless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the tentative final monograph, the agency acknowledged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that hard water and acidity reduce the antimicrobial activity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quaternary ammonium compounds, but that there are some newer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthesized quaternary ammonium compounds that are not adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by hard water and acidity (43 FR 1210 at 1218, 1219, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1236). However, these newer quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a mixture of three benzalkonium halide compounds with varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain lengths), while structurally related to benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium chloride  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the quaternary ammonium compounds which the Antimicrobial I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel reviewed and which the agency proposed as Category III),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were not reviewed or categorized by the Panel or the agency and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not included in this rulemaking. (See comment 58, 43 FR 1210  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1219.) Further, the agency notes that the 50 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quaternary ammonium concentrates that conform with EPA standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are intended for germicidal uses and not for the antiseptic uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are being considered in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is aware that studies have shown that effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acidic water on quaternary ammonium compounds occur only at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilutions containing less than the dosage concentration proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the tentative final monograph (Ref. 2). Higher concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize quaternary ammonium compound inactivation due to pH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change (Ref. 3). However, it is well known that natural water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies in different areas differ in acidity and hardness. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precautionary measure, FDA believes that concentrates of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients considered in this rulemaking should be diluted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled water by consumers and health-care professionals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because information about water pH or hardness in any given area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not usually known. Diluting the concentrated quaternary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ammonium compound products addressed in this rulemaking with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distilled water ensures that inactivating factors are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encountered. Therefore, the agency proposes to retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning statement, ``Dilute with distilled water before use because acidic or hard water may render the product inactive,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for diluting any Category I quaternary ammonium concentrate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because all the quaternary ammonium compounds remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category III at this time, the warning statement is not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in this tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Lawrence, C.

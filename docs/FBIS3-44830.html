			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by Zhou Zongmin and Yao Datian] </F>   [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- China has made  remarkable progress in importing advanced technology and  equipment for 210 key state projects involving such major areas  as transport, telecommunications and raw materials.    This was announced by Zhang Xiaoqiang, deputy director of  the  foreign funds department under the State Planning Commission  (SPC), in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here today.    Zhang said that so far contracts have been worked out or  signed to import technology, equipment and key materials for 47  projects. And 20 more projects are in the process of bidding or  business negotiations.    China announced the huge import package for the last seven  years of the 1990s in June 1993, with a total fund expected to  reach 30 billion U.S. dollars.    The package covers 23 sectors and trades including  agriculture, energy, transport, telecommunications, machinery,  electronics, chemicals, metallurgy, light industry and textiles.  A majority of the 210 major technology projects are in  infrastructures and basic industries, areas that the Chinese  Government has decided to give priority in their development.    According to Zhang, on the import bills will be complete  sets  of equipment, key facilities, accessory meters and instruments,  as well as state-of-the art technologies. Financial sources for  the purchases include state foreign exchange reserves,  fund-raising by departments and local governments concerned,  international commercial loans and loans provided by foreign  governments or international lending institutions.    The SPC official said all these projects have been approved  by the government and have been listed in the state plan.    The 47 contracts that have been concluded include a  120-million-U.S. dollar order of manufacturing equipment from  the Japanese Sanyo Company for the "Nylon 66 Salt Project" in  Henan Province, central China, and a 17-million-dollar order to  import key equipment from the United States for a forestry  project in north China's Hebei province.    Also included is an agreement between China and the Siemens  Company of Germany on importing locomotives and equipment worth  400 million U.S. dollars for the Guangzhou Subway Project.    The publicity of major technology importing projects has  aroused wide interest among foreign businessmen, who said that  the move helped them know better about China's foreign trade  policy and offered authoritative and practical information on  trading with China, especially on major technology purchases.    The move will also facilitate China's technical renovation  and infrastructural building, said Zhang.    According to a 10-year development blueprint for the period  from 1991 to 2000, China's gross domestic product (GDP) will  maintain an eight to nine percent annual growth rate in the  years.    To this end, Chinese leaders said the country should more  effectively cash in on the international market, capital,  technology and resources to keep the growth rate of foreign  trade higher than that of GDP.    The government has decided to rationally readjust the import  structure so that more will be spent on introducing advanced  technology and key equipment for basic industries and  infrastructures.    Zhang said that China's domestic market is huge. Imports  have kept expanding and legal guarantee is being improved.    The Chinese Government is ready to create a more favorable  environment for foreign businessmen and continue to give details  about technology import projects, he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GAS PRICES FUEL SLIGHT INCREASE IN RETAIL SALES;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: EXCLUDING PRICES AT THE PUMP, BUSINESS WAS OFF 0.1% AMID SIGNS OF  FADING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.  </P> <P> Retail sales inched up 0.1% in October, fueled for the third straight month by  the high cost of gasoline, the government said today. Excluding gasoline, sales  fell 0.1% amid continuing signs of fading consumer confidence.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $152.3  billion, up from $152.1 billion in September.  </P> <P> The revised 1.3% gain in September was a bit stronger than the 1.1% increase  originally reported. But excluding the gasoline impact, sales were up only 0.9%  that month.  </P> <P> Many analysts now believe that the U.S. economy is in a recession that could be  intensified by a drop in personal consumption. Retail sales represent about  half of all consumer spending, which itself accounts for two-thirds of the  nation's economic activity.  </P> <P> The department said retail sales since August have been artificially inflated  by gasoline prices that surged after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and  disrupted world petroleum markets -- not by increased sales volume.  </P> <P> Analysts say consumers have become cautious in their spending in recent months  after fears of war in the Persian Gulf added to their anxiety over the  weakening economy.  </P> <P> The Conference Board, a New York business research organization, reported that  consumer confidence in the economy plunged in October to the lowest level since  the 1981-82 recession.  </P> <P> Sales at department stores, a key barometer of consumer sentiment, were off  0.6% after falling 1.1% in September.  </P> <P> Automobile sales, which have been choppy through much of the year, slowed to a  0.7% gain from a 2.9% advance the previous month.  </P> <P> Excluding the automobile category, sales were unchanged from the previous  month.  </P> <P> Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items expected to last  more than three years, were up 0.7% after a 1.4% increase in September.  </P> <P> Besides autos, other components of the durable category were mixed. Sales of  furniture and other home furnishings fell 0.3%, while building materials jumped  1.5%.  </P> <P> Non-durable goods, which include food and gasoline, slipped 0.2% after a 1.2%  gain a month earlier.  </P> <P> Except for a 1.6% increase in drugstore sales, all other categories dropped --  grocery stores down 0.5%, clothing stores down 1% and restaurants and bars off  0.3%.  </P></p>

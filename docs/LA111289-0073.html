			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN FROM THE COLD, BUT WHERE TO GO?;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: ONE PROSPECT IS THAT, AFTER SOME AGONIZING, THE COUNTRY WILL FIND  AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM AND LIBERAL CAPITALISM.  </P> <P> "We are the people." When demonstrators shouted those words, it was an ironic  and bitter indictment of 40 years of the German Democratic Republic.  </P> <P> So far, mass demonstrations have been acted out with a subtlety and finesse  that flatly contradicted all speculations that after 12 years of totalitarian  Nazism and 44 years of totalitarian communism, the human mind would be utterly  deformed. A great chapter of history is taking place right at our doorstep. The  German question, instead of being posed in terms of power politics, is  translated into human rights and the pursuit of happiness. Finally, the East  Europeans refuse to go on losing World War II. The nations of Eastern Europe  are coming in from the cold. This is not only a human concern. It is also a  question of what kind of Europe we want in the 21st Century.  </P> <P> East Germany, situated in mid-stage, is going through a crisis that can only be  described in terms of a revolution. Economic decline, so far conspicuous only  in other Communist countries, is now dramatically exposed -- the infrastructure  run down, inner cities crumbling. The environment is in a ruined state. A loss  of legitimacy has caused part of the Politburo and the entire cabinet to  resign. The petty bureaucrats and functionaries of the ruling party are mending  their ways and finding out that it is better to side with reform. Institutions  no longer perform as expected. East German television has suddenly become part  of the drama, no longer the drab ritual of party rhetoric but a scene where  anything can take place, including indictment of the Socialist Unity, or  Communist, Party. Unless a new social contract can be formulated, indeed a new  political constitution framed, East Germany is not going to last.  </P> <P> The independent variable is, of course, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. There was no love  lost between today's men in the Soviet Union and yesterday's men in East  Germany. Both sides suspected each other of wanting to bring the other side  down. Gorbachev, when visiting East Berlin in early October, had a few things  to say to Erich Honecker, then still East Germany's No. 1. Although this was  done in the closet, the message was sensed by everybody, and it had two parts:  You had better get on with a German version of glasnost and perestroika; and if  you don't, our troops will not save you.  </P> <P> Egon Krenz, when looking for reassurance in Moscow four weeks later, must have  received a revised version. It could have read as follows: You must go ahead  with reform, and we will not put relations with the West at risk if you go  astray; however, if the very existence of East Germany is at stake, we will be  on your side. This is indeed the ambiguity that has left Krenz in a tense and  difficult situation. What he did would have been extravagant only two months  ago. Now he is behind the psychological schedule of the country, and even the  Communist Party faithful tell him so.  </P> <P> Why did Krenz not anticipate the inevitable and announce on nationwide TV that,  as the border with Czechoslovakia and from there into West Germany was open  anyway, the Berlin Wall would be taken down? Why did he not say that the  planning bureaucracy would be sacked and service industries would be freely  admitted in the form of private enterprise? Why did he not invite foreign  investment into East Germany, where it would find a first-rate work force and  -- sooner or later -- healthy returns? Why did he not say, right away, that  authentic political parties would be admitted, following Hungary's example, and  that unrigged elections would follow in the next six months -- with an apology  for fumbling the last elections? Why did he not add that a constitutional court  would be set up to make sure the East German constitution, the United Nations  charter and the Helsinki final act are respected by the authorities? Why did he  not close by saying that legislation would follow soon to restore the historic  parts of what is now East Germany?  </P> <P> He could have added a patriotic appeal that, given the challenge of the future  and the admission of failure on the part of the Communist Party, would the  people not, please, reconsider and give him a fair chance to preside over the  transition to democracy? He would have gone down in history not only as a man  of Realpolitik, but probably as the man who saved the existence of East Germany  for the time being and helped to stabilize the Central European chessboard.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Krenz did almost none of the above. And what he did was received  by the subsequent mass demonstration with a devastating comment: "Too late, too  late."  </P> <P> What is to come next? If there is no evolutionary transition between  yesterday's neo-Stalinism and tomorrow's liberal democracy, East Germany may  glide into limbo for awhile, with the revolution from below conspicuously  lacking bite, vision and credibility. Return to the status quo is no option --  an explosion would be the answer. So we are in for a long period of unrest,  turmoil and uneasy compromise.  </P> <P> The security framework of the Warsaw Pact will have to stay in place, but -- as  the Hungarians insist -- it must be transformed from a military into a  politico-military alliance. The North Atlantic alliance is going in that  direction anyway. The notion of cooperative security will have to graduate from  being a slogan to becoming a process. Most important of all, the two nuclear  superpowers will have to agree on a formula that would help to prevent a  pre-1914 situation from arising. Summitry will not be enough. The East-West  Helsinki process, which has taken on so many roles during the past 16 years,  would have to provide the arena for face-saving solutions, retreats and  compromises.  </P> <P> But what would be a sustainable, long-term solution for so much drama and so  dangerous a place like Central Europe? Every successor to Egon Krenz must try  to regain the initiative and will probably have to go even beyond what Krenz  failed to say on TV. Otherwise, East Germany will not overcome the state of  turmoil it is in. The exodus of the young generation will not be halted, and a  major East-West crisis will ensue, putting at risk not only the reform of East  Germany but East-West detente and perestroika in Moscow as well. Some big  thinking is needed.  </P> <P> It has not sufficiently been appreciated so far that the consequence of deep  cuts in conventional arms, now being discussed in Vienna, will be a different  strategic architecture in Eastern Europe. Soviet troops, if they are indeed  reduced in large quantities, will no longer bolster Communist oligarchies, now  mostly out of office anyway (witness the resignation Friday of Bulgaria's Todor  Zhivkov), or hold the West hostage. What will remain in place in Eastern Europe  will, however, still be enough to keep the glacis for the motherland. But the  stabilizing role for Communist regimes will have gone, perhaps forever. This in  itself will be a major force for change.  </P> <P> As to the West, the excitement about instant reunification of Germany is  premature. It is much more important to think about Western teamwork for  associating the East Europeans with cooperative efforts in Western Europe.  After the silent demise of the East European trading bloc and the gradual  decline of the Warsaw Pact, together with the conspicuous weakening of Soviet  hegemonial will and muscle, what structure is there to keep Eastern Europe in  balance? At present, it is a collection of poor houses in a super-rust belt  stretching from the Baltic to the Danube Valley, with a host of bitter  conflicts ranging from the suppression of minorities to environmental feuds. No  one except the European Community offers any chance of being the federateur of  Eastern Europe, through tailor-made forms of long-term association. A Marshall  Plan has often been advocated. What is needed now is something on an even  grander scale, a political design of peaceful change through economic means and  political encouragement.  </P> <P> The perennial German question will be at the center of all this, and this is at  the same time part of the problem and part of the solution. Two countries, one  the size of Ireland, the other one the size of Britain, 16 million and 60  million Germans respectively, are in search of a very special relationship  whose shape, nature and name will affect all of Europe and, for that matter,  Canada and the United States.  </P> <P> The Federal Republic is firmly anchored in the West, NATO and the European  Community, and the firmer the better. It needs both the confidence of its  partners and the negotiating power offered through the Atlantic alliance to  handle a problem that is potentially fraught with strategic imbalances and  dangerous misunderstandings. The integration of West Germany in the European  Community is, incidentally, also to be seen as an element of reassurance for  the East Europeans.  </P> <P> If the East German government, despite its reform and its willingness to open  the Brandenburg Gate, cannot regain the initiative, the place could slide into  an unmanageable state and be deeply destabilizing for its strategic environment  as well as for the East-West relationship. An unmanageable state is at present  the most undesirable scenario.  </P> <P> A more likely outcome is that, after a period of agonizing reform, the country  will emerge at the other end of the crisis in a different shape, perhaps having  found a new equilibrium between democratic socialism and liberal capitalism,  between its Western heart and its Eastern raison d'etat, and perhaps even  arrive at an identity that is not entirely dependent on rejection or imitation  of the Federal Republic of Germany.  </P></p>

The BAI will focus its investigative might on evils such as  shoddy construction of public facilities and irregularities in  public welfare, and relax administrative regulations to remove  public inconvenience and insecurity, Yi pledged in his New Year  speech.    He warned wrongdoers and idlers in public service that he  will punish them mercilessly, but promised creative and active  public servants that they will be rewarded.    Yi, spelling out the New Year's tasks of the independent  investigative agency, said he will step up efforts to establish  strict discipline in public service.    Instead of correcting wrong government policies, the BAI  will  concentrate on strengthening its power to prevent mistakes and  to raise the efficiency and appropriateness of policies in 1994,  Yi said.    It will establish an around-the-clock investigative  structure  and carry out future-minded inspections to expand the authority  of the BAI, Yi said.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURF WEAR FIRM HOPES TO APPEAL TO THE MASSES;  </P> <P> CATCHIT RIDES BIG WAVE TO THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Catchit -- once one of the hippest surf wear companies on the West Coast -- has  moved its surf trunks and body shorts to the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The move from Tustin to Van Nuys this week was part of a shake-up by Van Nuys  Surf Co., which became Catchit's sole owner last month when it bought the 50%  interest of founder and former President Ian Foreman.  </P> <P> Now Van Nuys Surf Co. hopes to revive sales by selling Catchit's surf trunks  and board shorts to more than just surfers. The company hopes to market its  merchandise through Mervyn's and J. C. Penney.  </P> <P> "We want to have our clothing on the masses, as opposed to the few," said Mitch  Fine, president. "Catchit itself has a big name . . . and we want to  merchandise to as many folks as we can."  </P> <P> While Fine and his partner, Bill Snyder, have not yet signed agreements with  Mervyn's and Penney's, Fine said both have been contacted and "they're  receptive to seeing us."  </P> <P> The sale of Catchit -- whose worth was estimated by industry sources at $1  million -- is the latest sign of a shakeout in the $1-billion surf wear  industry. Since late 1987, several one-time industry leaders have experienced  financial trouble.  </P> <P> Catchit was founded eight years ago by Foreman. A native of South Africa and a  former distributor of rival Gotcha, Foreman was a self-described "one-man  band," who began by manufacturing a line of five stretch trunks, two walk  shorts and a T-shirt out of his beach house.  </P> <P> From an investment of $5,000, Foreman's sales hit $250,000 in his first season.  Over the next seven years, the company expanded into sportswear for boys and  toddlers and created a juniors line. Later, it added SK8 (pronounced "skate")  and Skatehardware to appeal to a new group of customers who ride skateboards  instead of waves.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times in early 1987, Foreman predicted sales that year  of $20 million. But at the same time, Catchit -- along with 300 to 400  competitors -- began struggling in a surf market that was no longer laid back.  </P> <P> "It's no secret that Catchit's business had been off considerably before this  time," said Steve MacBaisey, president of Cycle Industries, Catchit's T-shirt  licensee.  </P> <P> Foreman said he left Catchit because he got a good offer. "The timing, the  price, the conditions -- everything was right," he said. "Sometimes the  best-laid plans of men and mice change. . . . It was time to move on."  </P> <P> Darrin Donaho, a Catchit salesman, said the split came because "Ian wanted to  stay real hard-core surf and it's past our time. It's time to go to the  department stores."  </P> <P> That time may have come because Catchit had wiped out in trendy surf shops.  </P> <P> "Catchit ran its course about 3 years ago. It's bad news," said Tom Noble,  manager of Newport Surf and Sport in Newport Beach. "Most retailers like us  wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole."  </P></p>

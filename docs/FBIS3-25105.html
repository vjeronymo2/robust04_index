The Democratic  Party called on the TEC to bring into effect a section of the  Abolition of Restriction on Free Political Activities Act which  provides for the scrapping of detention without trial. This  follows the TEC's controversial decision to provisionally retain  Section 29 of the Internal Security Act.</p>

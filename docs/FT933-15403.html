			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Russian bank's missing millions: Coopers &amp; Lybrand report highly critical of accounts A REPORT on the Russian central bank by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, highlights 'distortions, mistakes. . . and possible abuses' which may run into thousands of millions of roubles. The report, commissioned by the Russian parliament for presentation with the central bank's accounts for the past year, is frank in its assessment of the bank's shortcomings. It states that, as a matter of urgency, the bank needs to improve the information it receives from its branches and from within its operations. The report says that information has been so scanty in some areas that 'we cannot give a final opinion on whether the accounts. . . reflect all payments coming in and going out of the bank'. The analysis of the accounts does not conform to international auditing standards because of the historic lack of such standards in Russian banks and companies. Coopers &amp; Lybrand staff found they could not reconcile the accounts of 1991 with those of 1992 in many instances. The report says the unexplained gaps in figures for many transactions could be explained by mistakes 'and also abuses connected with a very high level of unexplained sums, both for accounts within Russia and between members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in roubles and in hard currency'. The accounts for 1991 are viewed by Coopers as incomplete because of many 'secret' accounts, usually military, which were not disclosed. However, Mr Jeremy Foster, a senior Coopers executive in Moscow, said yesterday he now believed the 1992 accounts had no such secrets. He said that funds from the formerly banned Soviet Communist party which had been allegedly spirited abroad might have passed through the central bank but there was now no means of tracing these movements. Mr Foster said: 'The management of the bank has been trying to concentrate its efforts in the main areas where there are problems, for example, in the clearing systems. We believe that in order to fulfil its role fully it must strengthen its internal reporting functions, for example, making it clear what is the status of its loans.' He said that part of the burden on Russia's central bank was the legacy of the former Soviet Gosbank, with its responsibility for the Soviet debts of more than Dollars 80bn and an expectation by many politicians that it would continue its practice of automatically advancing credit to industries. Commercial banks and enterprises are now loud in their criticism of the central bank, saying that clearing can take months and that interest rates charged to commercial banks are too high. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman, is expected to appear before parliament today to present the accounts for 1992.</p>

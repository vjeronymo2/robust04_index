			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (1): Divided by inequalities - Industrially and geographically the county is divided by the M4 motorway, with greater prosperity to the south. The valleys are coping with structural change, and progess has been made on the back of better road and rail systems AT THE southern entrance to Merthyr Tydfil, across the road from Hoover's European headquarters, Maya Sakata, a Singapore company, has just begun production of electrical cord assemblies. When it gears up to full production, the company expects to turn out 120,000 parts a week. 'We chose Merthyr in preference to sites in the north-east of England or the republic of Ireland,' says Mr Melvyn Mitchell, its managing director, 'for two reasons: the excellent communications; and the close proximity of other companies in the Far East, such as Malaysia.' One of those companies is within sight. Sekisui was only the second Japanese company to invest in Wales when it arrived in Britain nearly 20 years ago. Across the industrial park in Merthyr from Maya Sakata is another recent arrival: R-TEK, a joint Japanese-French joint venture making car door panels for Honda and Rover. There is nothing exceptional about these new investments in Mid Glamorgan. In the past 18 months British Airways has announced a Pounds 23m avionics workshop at Llantrisant which will create 400 jobs; Robertson Associates, an American-German company, is spending Pounds 13.5m on a plant at Nantgarw to produce aluminium can ends for brewers; and two companies have gone to Hengoed, outside Caerphilly - Valeo Wipers Systems and Jones Chromatography. In addition, existing employers such as Ford at Bridgend and Treforest, EMMS at Caerphilly, Gooding-Sanken at Abercynon and Purolite International at Pontyclun have set in motion investment plans totalling over Pounds 150m. These are investment decisions for which most parts of Britain would mortgage half their future. Yet Mid Glamorgan remains one of the poorest counties in Britain, afflicted by low gross domestic product, poor housing, bad health, inadequate further education and social deprivation. It is a paradox that in the middle of investment success there exist some of the worst housing estates, such as Penrhys in Rhondda, Gurnos in Merthyr and Penywaun in Aberdare. Mid Glamorgan is two counties socially just as it is two counties geographically; the M4 motorway corridor divides it into unequal parts. To the south of the motorway, and within a band of four or five miles to its north, lies a county of prosperous farming, a short but attractive coastline with a holiday industry, and settled industry, especially around Bridgend. The M4 has been a magnet, sucking industry in. Income levels, house prices, school facilities and transport links here are good. Most new arrivals, including those in nearby South Glamorgan such as Bosch and British Airways at Cardiff airport, mentioned the motorway as a deciding factor when they chose south Wales. Further north, the steep-sided valleys make it much more difficult to attract new industry. Some has come, but with the exception of Hoover in Merthyr - which arrived in the town more than 40 years ago as a result of the then government's direction of industry to the distressed areas - Gooding in Aberdare, AB Electronics at Abercynon and a few others, most of the newcomers have been small employers. Closures, such as in the mining industry, have cost large numbers of jobs; the arrivals have not made up the losses. The valleys have had to come to terms with massive structural change. They were built on coal and iron. The latter went early in this century but coal remained a big employer until the 1984-5 strike. There were still 28 collieries in south Wales, most of them in Mid Glamorgan, in 1985, when the men drifted back to work; today, two of the three left in south Wales are in the county. Yet the county's industrial heritage lingers on. Mid Glamorgan has proportionately more employed in metal manufacturing, engineering, electronics and general manufacturing than the UK as a whole. With coal went jobs for men. With the new industries came jobs for women. Many of them were part-time and low paid. Almost half the workforce (49 per cent) are women and a quarter part-time. Service industries, according to Martyn Thomas and Tim Peppin in a report for Mid Glamorgan county council, account for 58 per cent of employees; 10 years ago the proportion was 43 per cent. Many of the plants pay lower wages than elsewhere, a factor which has helped bring in the newcomers. The average weekly wage for men in Mid Glamorgan last year, according to the government's New Earnings Survey, was Pounds 302, only 88.8 per cent of the British figure of Pounds 340.1. This disparity has been widening. Fourteen years ago rates were more or less in parity with those in Britain, according to Thomas and Peppin. Women, too, have suffered, though not so severely, dropping to 93 per cent of the British average. Other indicators are equally bad. Unemployment at 14.9 per cent is the highest in Wales. Long-term unemployment and that among the very young is high. In some of the valleys a quarter of the people live alone, many of them in single-parent families. According to the county's economic research unit, 'the health of the people compares unfavourably with that of other areas of Wales. One in five people claims to suffer from a 'limiting long-term' illness. In the Rhondda the figure is one in four.' Car ownership, another indicator of prosperity, is also low. Some 37 per cent of households, according to the survey, are without a car, the highest figure for any of Wales's eight counties. The figure is particularly high by British standards in the Rhondda, at 45 per cent. Not all the indicators are depressing. 'There is enormous vitality in the valleys,' says Mr Tony Roberts, chief executive of the Cynon Valley council. 'With the partnership between local authorities, government, Welsh Development Agency and other bodies such as the Wales Tourist Board which is now taking place, the foundations are being laid for advances as the century ends.' On the up-side there have been big improvements in housing, more jobs for women, more young people in continuing education and the highest population of working age among the Welsh counties. A lot of these improvements have been made on the back of an improved infrastructure. The motorway is the core of the road system and few places within the county are more than 25 minutes from it. The government has improved the spine roads linking the valleys to the motorway. Merthyr, the Rhondda, Llantrisant, Ystrad Mynach and Maesteg are all now connected in part or whole to the M4 by dual-carriageway or three-lane roads. The black spot remains the heads of the valleys road, the A465, which runs across the north of the industrial belt and which links it to the English Midlands. Local authorities, MPs, the CBI and the Institute of Directors have repeatedly called for this road to be widened from three lanes. Two years ago the government conceded the case - both on grounds of economic efficiency and safety - for improving the road between Abergavenny in the east and Aberdare to dual-carriageway at a cost of Pounds 145m. Sadly, it took two more years for the Welsh Office to commission a study, which itself will take three years to complete, and the improved road is not likely to be completed before the end of the century. Improvements in the rail network have also been undertaken, and passenger growth on British Rail's services from the valleys into Cardiff and Newport has been one of the largest in Britain. 'The days when we all worked independently have gone,' says Mr Roberts. 'Partnership is at the heart of the new economy. If we get our towns right, as in the urban schemes being undertaken by the local authorities and the Welsh Development Agency, then new investment will come. 'Five years ago the first private housing since the war was undertaken in the Rhondda by the Barratt group. The Welsh Office had to offer an inducement through an urban grant to bring the company in. Today builders such as Redrow and Bailey are putting up houses in a number of places.' It is that indicator, more than any other, that points the way to the future. The WDA provides free sites and advance factories have been put up. In the middle of the recession, builders built houses and sold them, many to first-time buyers - a significant indicator of the underlying strength of the economy.</p>

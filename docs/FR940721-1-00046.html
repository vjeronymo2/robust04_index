			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Allowing passengers to choose to disembark at ``inaccessible'' locations may create safety hazards, Metro asserts. Passengers with disabilities should not be allowed to decide it is safe to use a particular stop, in Metro's view, particularly since the visual or cognitive disabilities of some passengers could impair their ability to make an adequate assessment of the situation and since a visual inspection might not, in any event, reveal the problems of a site. Metro is concerned about tort liability in such situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With its petition, Metro provided a brief videotape, which we have made part of the docket. It shows wheelchair users leaving or entering buses in locations where narrowness of the sidewalk (i.e., next to a retaining wall, adjacent to a grassy knoll) or other conditions (e.g., an eroded, broken sidewalk) make it difficult (but not necessarily impossible) to get on or off the bus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metro has petitioned the Department to amend &sect;37.167(g) in two ways. First, Metro would permit transit providers to refuse to allow persons with disabilities to use stops available to other passengers if ``the lift, when fully deployed, would leave inadequate space at the stop for the passenger to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.'' Second, Metro would add a sentence saying that ``A stop which does not meet the specifications set forth in &sect;10.2.1(1) of appendix A to 49 CFR part 37 shall be deemed to provide inadequate space for passengers using common wheelchairs to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.'' For information of potential commenters, the bus stop standards in Appendix A that Metro references are the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> 10.2.1&blank;New Construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Where new bus stop pads are constructed at bus stops, bays, or other areas where a lift or ramp is to be deployed, they shall have a firm, stable surface; minimum clear length of 96 inches (measured from the curb or roadway vehicle edge) and a minimum clear width of 60 inches (measured parallel to the vehicle roadway) to the maximum extent allowed by legal or site constraints; and shall be connected to streets, sidewalks, or pedestrian paths by an accessible route complying with 4.3 and 4.4. The slope of the pad parallel to the roadway shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as the roadway. For water drainage, a maximum slope of 1:50 (2%) perpendicular to the roadway is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that Metro's proposal would apply this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> new construction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  standard to make judgments about allowing wheelchair users to use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> existing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  bus stops. Also, the standard refers to ``bus stop pads,'' not to bus stops in general. In addition, the standard's minimum clear width and length requirements are required ``to the extent allowed by legal or site constraints.'' Site constraints would appear to include the kinds of conditions of which Metro's petition speaks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effect of its proposed amendment, Metro says, would be to allow transit providers to refuse to serve wheelchair passengers at stops that did not meet Access Board standards. According to Metro, this would place an additional 702 stops (8 percent of the total number of stops in the system) off limits to wheelchair users. However, other passengers with disabilities (e.g., standees) and passengers without disabilities would be served at these stops. While Metro's petition does not specify how service to origins and destinations served by these stops (or the other 19 percent of stops at which lifts will not deploy at all) would be made available to wheelchair users, the Department assumes individuals who need accessible service to those destinations would be eligible for paratransit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Requirements for Private School Transportation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress exempted ``public school transportation'' from the transportation requirements of the ADA, by defining such transportation not to be ``designated public transportation.'' The House Public Works Committee Report on the legislation says that it is the intent of Congress that the same exemption should apply to private elementary and secondary school transportation if the school receives Federal financial assistance, is covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and provides equivalent transportation service to students with disabilities (see H. Rept. 101&hyph;485, Pt. 1, at 36). In addition, religiously-affiliated schools are exempt from the ADA altogether, based on the ADA's exemption for religious organizations. Section 37.27 of the Department's ADA regulation implements these exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As pointed out in the petition of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), schools that are private, not religiously affiliated, and not recipients of Federal funds do not benefit from any of these exemptions. As private entities not primarily in the business of transporting people providing (usually) fixed route transportation with vehicles with a passenger capacity exceeding 16 persons, they are subject to a requirement to purchase all new accessible school buses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAIS says ``[t]he cost of this requirement is enormous, and in relation to the cost the benefit to disabled students is minimal, because there is no need that every vehicle purchased be accessible; all disabled students may be served as long as a sufficient number of the vehicles are accessible.'' The NAIS petition seeks a modification of the current regulation to place its members on the same footing as other schools, saying that ``independent schools which do not receive federal financial assistance are the only schools who are required to purchase accessible vehicles even when the school already has sufficient such vehicles to provide adequate services to students with disabilities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requested modification would amend &sect;37.27 to apply the same requirement to private schools that do not receive Federal assistance as to other private schools, i.e. a requirement to provide equivalent transportation services to students with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

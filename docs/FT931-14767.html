			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / CBI seeks tax exemption on redundancy counselling EMPLOYEES who are made redundant should be exempt from tax on the cost of counselling provided by their employers, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The recommendation, in the CBI's proposals to the government about the Budget, is directed at managers and higher paid workers whose redundancy packages exceed Pounds 30,000, the point at which tax begins to bite on such packages. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general, says that the effect of the tax is to make it more likely that employees decline the offer of outplacement counselling - advice on obtaining a new job. 'That is to their disadvantage because those who receive the counselling usually find new employment more quickly than those who do not,' said Mr Davies. 'It is also to the disadvantage of the economy as a whole not to have these employees back in jobs as quickly as possible,' he added. The CBI's suggestion is one of 40 contained in its tax proposals sent to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Others include a proposal to allow the costs of 'green' measures to be tax deductible; proper recognition for tax purposes of the gains and losses from foreign exchange transactions; and harmonisation between the treatment of incidental costs arising from the raising of equity finance, which are not allowable against tax, and those from raising loan capital, which are allowable.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRWINDALE, CRIPPLED BY LEGAL BILLS, SEEKS TO SETTLE LAWSUITS  </P> <P> Bogged down with $2.5 million in legal bills and the collapse of its bid to  land the Los Angeles Raiders, Irwindale officials say they are ready to settle  several lawsuits against them in order to minimize financial losses and  political embarrassment to the city.  </P> <P> Mayor Richard Chico said this week that the new settlement efforts were spurred  by last month's elections. Though Chico said he has wanted to end the  litigation "for quite a while . . . I was more passive knowing I wasn't going  to change anything until the council changed. Now we have to take corrective  steps."  </P> <P> Referring to a closed council session held last week, City Atty. Charles Martin  said: "We were directed to settle as many as we can so we will try. Our legal  fees each month have been $30,000, $40,000. No city can endure spending that  kind of money."  </P> <P> In the closed-door meeting last week, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to make  good-faith efforts to settle:  </P> <P> * Two suits against former redevelopment consultant Frederick P. Lyte, who  spearheaded the Raiders deal but was fired in 1988 after a falling-out with  Councilman Patricio Miranda. Irwindale claims Lyte illegally received  commissions on projects he recommended to the city and should pay $2 million in  damages. In a countersuit, Lyte claims the city owes him $1.2 million in back  wages. Martin and two other city officials met with Lyte Tuesday to discuss a  settlement.  </P> <P> * A suit against Irwindale by newly elected Councilman Frederick Barbosa. The  suit claims the $10 million in good-faith money that Irwindale paid to Raiders  owner Al Davis was an illegal gift of public money. A second Barbosa suit  resulted in an injunction barring Irwindale from negotiating with the team  until it completed an environmental impact report on the stadium.  </P> <P> * A suit against Miranda by Brenda Marin, a resident who claims the councilman  violated conflict-of-interest laws in a redevelopment agency project involving  land that Marin owns. Irwindale is paying for his defense.  </P> <P> Miranda and Councilman Salvador Hernandez voted against the settlement talks.  Hernandez said he believes Irwindale would win the Lyte suit if it went to  trial.  </P> <P> Lyte said Tuesday he has tried to settle with the city but was opposed by  Miranda, Hernandez and former Councilman Joseph Breceda, who lost his seat  April 10. Barbosa, Chico and Councilman Robert Diaz voted for the latest  settlement effort.  </P></p>

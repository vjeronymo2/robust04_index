			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BOMB' AT IRANIAN RESTAURANT FORCES ORANGE EVACUATION  </P> <P> About five homes and 10 businesses in Orange had to be evacuated Sunday morning  when a device believed to be a pipe bomb was found propped against an Iranian  restaurant, police reported.  </P> <P> After about three anxious hours, police dismantled the device and found it was  a cleverly made fake bomb, said Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne.  </P> <P> "There was no explosive in it. But it was rigged to look like a bomb if it were  X-rayed," he said.  </P> <P> No one was injured, and the evacuation was orderly and without incident, Browne  said. The scene of the bomb scare was a shopping center on North Tustin Avenue  near Taft Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Real Concern  </P> <P> "There have been no threats received by anyone (about a possible bomb), and no  one has come forward to claim responsibility," Browne added. "There was concern  that this was a real pipe bomb, and there was some speculation that someone  might have placed it (at an Iranian-owned restaurant) in retaliation for the  San Diego van-bombing incident."  </P> <P> On Friday, the wife of the skipper of the Navy ship Vincennes, escaped injury  when a bomb ripped apart the van she was driving.  </P> <P> The Vincennes, commanded by Capt. Will Rogers III, last July mistakenly shot  down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 aboard the  plane.  </P></p>

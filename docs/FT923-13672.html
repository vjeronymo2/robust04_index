			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Lamont says ERM will remain at centre of strategy Extracts from the speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to the European Policy Forum yesterday: Today's inflation figures marked another important milestone on Britain's long road to permanently low inflation. For the first time since 1986, our inflation, measured on a comparable basis, is lower than the European Community average. But just beating the average, when most of our competitors are seeking to reduce inflation further, should not be good enough. Two thirds of our exports go to countries with inflation rates lower than our own. For almost two years, the government's counter-inflationary strategy has been based on sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism. The ERM is not an optional extra, an add-on to be jettisoned at the first hint of trouble. It is and will remain at the very centre of our macroeconomic strategy. Retail price inflation has fallen from nearly 11 per cent at the time of entry to less than 4 per cent today. As inflation has come down, we have been able to cut interest rates nine times from 15 per cent to 10 per cent today - below the average of the last 10 years. Both management and unions are getting the message that if we want to compete with the rest of Europe, we must not award ourselves pay increases far in excess of their levels. Britain's trade performance has confounded the pessimists. Exports are at a record level. I cannot believe we could have achieved all this outside the ERM. But despite these achievements, and the progress we are making towards our medium-term objectives, there are those who try to blame the present difficult economic situation on our membership of the ERM. As soon as the going gets rough, the quest begins for the easy way out. They cast around for a painless, cost-free route to higher growth with low inflation. I would be the last person to say that - to coin a phrase - there is no alternative to our present policy. Plenty of alternatives are suggested. But in my view, they are all illusory or destined to fail. They would not deliver low inflation. Let me deal with each in turn: Cut interest rates immediately. If any country within the ERM is to have lower interest rates than Germany, the markets must expect its currency to appreciate against the D-Mark. But the D-Mark has never been devalued in the history of the ERM. So it is scarcely surprising that foreign exchange markets are just not prepared to hold ERM currencies yielding substantially less than the D-Mark. Nevertheless, some suggest that Britain has more flexibility; that by allowing the pound to fall to the bottom of its wider band, we would create the scope for a subsequent appreciation, and hence our interest rates could be much lower than Germany's. This is theoretically ingenious, but wholly unrealistic. If it were true, it would be the weakest currencies in the ERM that had the lowest interest rates. But foreign exchange markets do not expect a weak and falling currency, with low interest rates, to bounce back up again. They expect it to carry on falling, and they sell it, forcing interest rates up. So even with the extra flexibility afforded by the wide bands, I know of no serious economic commentator or analyst who believes that sharp interest rate cuts - from our current position, with rates just above those in Germany - are a serious option within the ERM. A German realignment. There are those who argue that Germany has been hit by an exceptional, inflationary shock - that of reunification - and that the rest of Europe is being forced to bear the consequences. The D-Mark should therefore be realigned upwards. No country in the ERM is look-ing in that direction. The issue is simply not on the agenda. Devaluation within the ERM. It is patently absurd to suggest that this would allow interest-rate cuts. When currencies devalue against the D-Mark, the markets do not expect them to be revalued back up again. They expect a further devaluation, and demand higher, not lower, interest rates to compensate for that risk. So currencies that devalue pay an interest-rate premium. A realignment could only put interest rates up, not down. Leave the ERM, cut interest rates and let the pound find its own level. It sounds simple. After all, the US floats its currency; why shouldn't we do so too? The British economy is far more dependent on international trade. More than a third of our national output is exported, compared to just a tenth for the US. For Britain, the threat of imported inflation is very real. Many who advocate floating intend a devaluation of the pound. And they would certainly achieve it. The result of leaving the ERM, combined with large cuts in interest rates, would be a fall in the pound probably unprecedented in the last 40 years. It's the cut-and-run option; cut interest rates and a run on the pound. We know from bitter experience that devaluation just does not work for Britain. The devaluations of the past yielded not booming exports but a steadily falling share of world markets. Outside the ERM, we would still have to compete with the ERM countries. Markets would see that, unlike all our major European competitors, Britain lacked the will to pursue the goal of permanently low inflation. And they would be right. We would have given up after less than two years. They would conclude that we were back to our bad old ways; that, given the chance, we would always delude ourselves by thinking that with a little more inflation we could get a little more growth. The credibility of our anti-inflationary strategy with businesses and employees would be in tatters. And quite soon interest rates would have to go back up again - to much higher levels than they are today. Leave the ERM and set interest rates according to domestic monetary targets. There are those who also seek a return to floating, but think we can control inflation by fixing monetary targets and setting interest rates accordingly. We have been here before. In the 1980s we fixed domestic monetary targets and attempted to meet them by setting interest rates accordingly. But the money supply figures often provided a poor guide to interest rate policy. The government could not remain indifferent to the level of the exchange rate. It is no surprise that most interest rate changes in the 1980s were associated with movements in the exchange rate. So there is no reason to believe that a floating exchange rate regime would lead to lower interest rates. The experience of the 1980s suggests quite the opposite. Those who advocate a return to floating sometimes dress up their arguments in free-market language. They say that the exchange rate is simply a price like any other, and that it is wrong, in a market economy, to try to fix prices. But if - as I believe - it is the responsibility of government not to debauch the currency but to ensure that money retains its value, the question we must ask is how we can best attain this objective. The evidence of the last few years demonstrates that it is the ERM that is most likely to deliver price stability in Britain. So we have five options - five ways we could try to change the current monetary policy. What they all have in common is that each is a plea for a free lunch. Sadly, there is no such thing. As the Russians say, only mousetraps have free cheese. The result of attempting to implement any of them would be either higher interest rates, higher inflation, or most likely both.</p>

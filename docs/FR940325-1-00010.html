			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 4, 1991, the National Archives and Records Administration released a group of Nixon White House tape recordings. The release consisted of approximately 60 hours of tape recordings previously subpoenaed by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force (``WSPF'') during its investigations, as well as tape transcripts located among the records of the WSPF. Approximately 121/2 hours of these tape recordings had previously been played in open court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Connelly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mitchell  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and released, 45 FR 26823 (April 21, 1980); however, the balance of approximately 471/2 hours had not been released previously. This 1991 release of tape recordings and accompanying transcripts, processed in accordance with the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ricchio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Klein,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 773 F.2d 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1985) was not challenged by any party in federal court. 56 FR 12400 (March 25, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Archives and Records Administration decided that the best way to proceed with the release of the body of the 4,000 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings was to release Watergate-related segments of the tape recordings in small monthly groupings on an ongoing basis. The first of these releases was noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 2, 1993, 58 FR 17433, and took place on May 17, 1993, without any objections from affected parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second and third releases were noticed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 3, 1993, and July 2, 1993, to take place on July 15, 1993, and August 26, 1993, respectively. 58 FR 31548 (June 3, 1993); 58 FR 35983 (July 2, 1993). Former President Nixon raised certain procedural objections to these proposed releases. When the National Archives and Records Administration rejected former President Nixon's contention that those releases should not go forward, he sought relief in the courts. On August 9, 1993, Judge Royce Lamberth of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order preliminarily enjoining the National Archives and Records Administration from carrying out the releases of allegedly Watergate-related tape recordings scheduled for August 13 and 26, 1993, pending (1) Segregation and return to former President Nixon of all private or personal conversations on the tape recordings; and (2) processing of the tape recordings before release to the public as a single ``integral file segment.'' The Court's ruling relied on the terms of the current PRMPA regulations, and on the terms of a draft processing manual which the National Archives and Records Administration's Nixon Presidential Materials Project (``Nixon Project'') has used in preparing Nixon Presidential materials for public disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In several respects, which will be discussed in greater detail below, the current regulations and the Nixon Project draft processing manual, especially as interpreted preliminarily by the court in the context of the preliminary injunction, do not reflect what the National Archives and Records Administration has come to recognize as the most appropriate fashion in which to process and release the Nixon White House tape recordings. Therefore, the National Archives and Records Administration proposes certain amendments to the current regulations (which will have the effect of altering the draft processing manual) to balance the National Archives and Records Administration's responsibility to provide public access to the tape recordings, including those segments relating to Watergate, at the earliest reasonable date, with the need to protect the rights of former President Nixon and other affected parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1275.16(b) is amended to make clear that no physical portion of the original tape recordings shall constitute private or personal material, and therefore no portion of those original recordings is to be returned to former President Nixon or to any other affected party. The PRMPA requires the Archivist to maintain those original tape recordings, whether or not they contain personal conversations; as a result, the amendment to &sect;1275.16(b) states that the original tape recordings constitute Presidential historical materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Energy Council </F> Definitively Adopts Directive on Hydro-Fuels"]    [Text] The "Energy" Council adopted without debate on  Wednesday [25 May] the directive on the conditions for granting  and exercising authorizations to prospect, explore, and produce  hydrofuels.    The main aim of this directive (adopted under the  co-decision  procedure with the EP) is to assure nondiscriminatory access to  activities and thus promote competition in the sector. The  principle adopted is that Member States own the sovereignty and  sovereign rights to their hydrofuels resources (situated on  their territory); national authorities consequently retain the  right to designate those parts of their territories where  prospection and exploitation can take place. But, each time an  area is opened to the exercise of these activities, the Member  State will be held responsible for ensuring that there is no  discrimination between the different operators interested in  access. The States will, however, be allowed to refuse, for  "national security" reasons, access to operators which are  effectively controlled by third countries or nationals of third  countries. The States will have to conform to this directive at  latest by 1 January 1995; the new authorizations granted by  Denmark before 31 December 2012 are the subject of certain  exemptions.</p>

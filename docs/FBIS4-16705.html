			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] At a meeting with foreign reporters, foreign  diplomats, and foreign businessmen, DPRK President Kim Il-song  declared that the DPRK would not accept the inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of two undeclared  nuclear facilities. Station commentator (Aleksey Kontrachev)  indicates that the DPRK president once more made clear the  DPRK's position regarding the inspection of the radiochemical  laboratory and another nuclear site in Yongbyon.    According to the IAEA's opinion, the two sites are producing  plutonium needed for nuclear weapons. Other countries, as well,  have the same suspicion. Neighboring countries, in particular,  harbor such suspicion.    However, President Kim Il-song said: Pyongyang has nothing  to  hide from the world. It is natural that the DPRK has its own  military secrets as other countries do, he added.    However, can the DPRK president's remarks alleviate the  international community's concerns?    The IAEA holds that all nuclear sites should accept the  IAEA's inspection without exception. Pyongyang's refusal to  accept the IAEA's inspection has further aggravated tension on  the peninsula, let alone creating suspicion of the nuclear  facilities.    It has been reported that the UN Security Council will  actively discuss the issue of imposing international economic  sanctions on the DPRK in early May.    Now, how can the present stalemate be settled? Pyongyang  believes that this stalemate can be settled through direct  dialogue between the DPRK and the United States.    (?The international community) is seeking other ways.  Washington has set some preconditions for its direct dialogue  with the DPRK. Pyongyang is refuting some of these  preconditions. It seems that Moscow's proposal will be able to  settle the stalemate. Moscow proposes that an international  conference be held to discuss the issue on the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula.    Seoul and some other countries support Moscow's proposal.</p>

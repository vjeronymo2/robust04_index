			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS--The press service of the State  Duma (lower chamber of the Russian parliament) today released  the following statement by Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin:    "The exact number of victims of NATO air strikes at Serb  positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde is still unknown.  The military losses and the number or existence of civilian  casualties have not been reported. But the new facts,  testifying to attempts to again fan up the conflict by means of  armed force, have resounded with pain in the hearts of the  Russian people.    The arising situation gives food for various aspects of  alarm: NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia, but  also the achieved agreements; this threatens to ruin the process  of the peaceful political settlement of the bloody knot of  problems in Europe, begun with such hard efforts by the world  community. Moreover, preventive blows, when people are killed on  the grounds that a dangerous situation could have otherwise  arisen, can far from always be justified from the moral point of  view.    The State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly, vested with  the people's trust and expressing the view of the majority of  the Russian nation, does not intend to assume the stand of a  passive onlooker in the situation, which has arisen on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia.    We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned  use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to  actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful  political settlement of the Yugoslavian crisis.    [signed] Ivan Rybkin    [dated] April 12, 1994"</p>

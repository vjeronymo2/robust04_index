			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABB improves 23.7% to Dollars 266m ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 266m for the third quarter. This was a 23.7 per cent advance from the same period last year and was mainly due to cost-cutting. New orders jumped 33 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn, continuing the strong trend established in the first half. At the end of September, the group's order backlog stood at Dollars 33.3bn, 17 per cent higher than a year earlier. Revenues in the third quarter were up 5 per cent to Dollars 6.9bn, reflecting improving conditions in many markets. For the nine months, revenues were up 1.2 per cent to Dollars 20.04bn and operating profits advanced 16 per cent to Dollars 1.65bn. Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said he was pleased the group had been able to raise its operating margin in the first nine months from 7.2 per cent to 8.2 per cent in spite of flat sales. Personnel costs continued to be driven down by the shift of operations to low labour cost countries. Pre-tax profits for the nine months were ahead 21 per cent to Dollars 874m. The group said demand for standard products improved steadily, but investment goods sales grew more slowly. The first signs of an upswing in the order intake from continental European markets were visible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Political sources report that the crisis, unleashed  in the Dominican Republic in the wake of general elections  Monday, 16 May, which are considered fraudulent by the  opposition, has begun to escalate.    The Central Electoral Board's [JEC] credibility was once  again contested when candidate for senator (Ministro Castillo),  of the Dominican Liberation Party [PLD] led by Juan Bosch, the  third political force in the country, announced that he was  considering the possibility of rejecting the elections because  some 300,000 Haitians had reportedly voted in them.    The elections were also protested yesterday by the  opposition  Dominican Revolutionary Party, which accused the JEC and two JEC  justices of planning a fraud.    Moreover, the JEC decided to recount the votes one by one,  beginning today, and to stop the release of bulletins with  election results.</p>

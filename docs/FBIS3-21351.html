			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yusif al-Zaman, 'Ali al-Shahri, and Husayn </F> Bilharith in Dammam; Ahmad al-Daws in al-Madinah; Khalid  al-Juhaymi and Mani' al-'Asari in Riyadh; 'Abd-al-Khaliq  al-Ghamdi in al-Bahah; Ibrahim al-Dubaysi in Yanbu'; and  'Abdallah al-Rowayli and 'Ali Badir in Tabuk: "Noted Economists  and Businessmen: The Budget Confirms That Our Economy Is Capable  of Meeting its Challenges"]    [Text] Senior economists and businessmen continue to  express their views and impressions of the Kingdom's budget for  the 1414/15H [Hijra] [1993/94] fiscal year.    They emphasized that the new budget confirms that the Saudi  economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present  and of adapting to new developments.    They say that the budget allows the private sector an  opportunity to contribute effectively to the process of  development. Following are the views they expressed to 'UKAZ  AL-IQTISADI.  <H5>  Facing Reality </H5>   'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, chairman of the Council of Saudi  Chambers [of Commerce] and chairman of the board of the Riyadh  Chamber of Commerce and Industry, began by emphasizing that the  budget for the new 1414/15H fiscal year confirms that the Saudi  economy is capable of facing up to the realities of the present  and of adapting to new developments. The Custodian of the Two  Holy Mosques, may God save him, has enunciated, concisely and  with great clarity, the economy's current state of affairs and  its correlation to world developments leading to softening oil  prices, especially the increase in oil supply and the depressed  value of the dollar, which is the major currency in which oil  transactions are denominated.    Al-Juraysi added that the new budget entails important  economic indicators, such as:     -  The acumen of the Kingdom's economic policy, which focuses  on the diversification of the sources of national income as the  main thrust of all past, present, and future development plans.  This policy has been a complete success. Thanks to rising GDP in  all oil and non-oil economic sectors, the rate of GDP growth in  non-oil sectors has been five times higher than its rate of  growth in the oil sector over the past 20 years. The rate of GDP  growth was 377 percent in non-oil sectors compared with only  about 75 percent in the oil sector.    -  The solidity and strength of the Saudi economy and its  continued growth, despite adverse world economic conditions that  have impacted most countries of the world, including the  advanced nations. For instance, the rate of economic growth  declined in the 24 OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development] states from 1.5 percent in 1992 to 1.1 percent  in 1993; in the United States from 2.4 percent to 1.5 percent;  and in Japan from 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent.    -  Confirm, at the highest official level, the stable value of  the  national currency, the Saudi riyal, which the state has not  devalued as several other nations have. That Royal Majestic  confirmation by the King will play a fundamental role in  strengthening the national economy and in maintaining the  confidence it has earned over the year.    -  Underscore confidence in the private sector and its growing  role in attaining development plan objectives. By casting it  into the leading role to carry out projects, the private sector  will be inspired to attain more objectives, especially as the  state's appreciation of and confidence in businessmen begets  more giving and loyalty to the motherland.    -  Continued state support of development projects. In contrast  with other budgetary appropriations, allocations for development  funds were only very imperceptibly lowered this year by no more  than 2.5 percent. They stand at 7.8 billion riyals [R] compared  with R8 billion in last year's budget. This is a fundamental  factor and a strong incentive for the continued blossoming of  the private sector and for encouraging citizens to invest in  development projects with soft loans they secure from those  funds.    -  The stability of prices in the Kingdom, despite the increase  in  world prices, means that the standard of living will continue at  its high level. The cost of living in the final month of 1993  was only 1.8 percent higher than the same month a year  earlier--a very small increase.    The chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers and of the  Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry emphasized that the  Saudi economy, with all its sectors and segments, is capable of  persevering; nay, of taking off to achieve more growth. There is  no better proof of that than its success in competently and  efficiently handling the crises it has encountered, especially  the oil price crisis in the early eighties and the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait crisis and its aftermath in the early  nineties.  <H5>  Less Dependence on Oil </H5>   Dr. 'Abdallah al-Hamad, managing-director of the Arab  Institute for City Development, said that the three royal  decrees, the remarks of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,  and the Ministry of Finance statement that detailed state budget  revenues and expenses for FY 1414/15H (1994), confirm existing  confidence in the Saudi national economy and bring all the facts  to the fore amidst changing world and regional developments,  especially the decline in oil prices and budget shrinkage to  R160 billion. This is 30 percent below the previous budget, but  it also means that the deficit gap has been bridged. It is proof  positive that the state, represented by the Ministry of Finance  and Economy and all other relevant agencies, under the  leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, constantly  monitors the course of the national economy.    He pointed out that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  emphasized two points in his brief remarks on that historic  occasion: the importance of safeguarding the strength of the  national economy within the limitations of available financial  resources, and commitment to preserve the current value of the  riyal without revaluation.    He added that those who examine the budget will find that it  has taken all oil market swings and price fluctuations into  consideration.    The Ministry of Finance statement made it clear that there  was some tangible decline in dependence on oil, which now  accounts for 75 percent of revenues. This will be the focus of  the sixth development plan. It also made it clear that the  private sector has realized tangible growth of 5.1 percent.    The budget set aside R43 billion for expenditure on  management contracts and previously authorized construction  projects. The lending funds, be they agricultural, industrial,  or real estate, and the Lending Bank, were allotted 7.8 billion  [as published]. All of that would bolster confidence in the  national economy.    The great significance of issuing this year's budget on time  will be apparent once we realize that several countries have  actually taken to monthly or extended budgets.    He emphasized that the timely announcement of the detailed  state budget underscores the Kingdom's ability to adapt to  developments, despite the extraordinary difficulties encountered  by the world and by the region, of which the Kingdom is a part.  The Kingdom has confronted the greatest crisis in history during  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and has shouldered the greatest of  burdens as a result. Difficult times continued with the  substantial softening of oil prices as they set record lows, in  addition to fluctuations in the world economy, the outcome of  the GATT agreement, etc. And yet, the Kingdom was able to  overcome those obstacles and to support the price of the riyal  without revaluation. The Kingdom will continue on its course of  security, safety, and stability and will persevere in adopting a  market economy, economic diversification, and in expanding the  private sector and boosting its effectiveness.  <H5>  Balanced Revenues and Expenditures </H5>   Dr. Faysal Bin 'Abdallah, vice chancellor of King Sa'ud  University's College of Engineering in Riyadh, believes that the  Kingdom's budget, at R160 billion, is of substantial size,  considering that the Kingdom has already completed big chunks of  the country's infrastructure.    The budget this year is differentiated by balanced revenues  and expenditures, which means that the state has no need to  borrow. This is an important indicator of the Saudi economy's  strength and solidity.    He added that, despite the state's financial burdens  resulting from the Gulf war and from oil prices at record lows,  budgets in previous years, and the new budget as well, have  pledged continued effective and rational expenditures on  building, development, and modernization. They have also been  keen on maintaining subsidies to development funds, which remain  the effective player in that respect.  <H5>  Indications of Riyal Stability </H5>   Dr. Ibrahim Muhammad al-Qahti, professor of economics at  King  Fahd's University of Petroleum and Metallurgy in Dhahran,  believes that emphasis by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  on guaranteeing the stability of the Saudi riyal dinar [as  published] as it now stands without revaluation is a positive  indicator of our economy's stability in all domestic and  international respects and is a most eloquent response to the  skepticism raised by some doubters. That, he added, gives strong  impetus to both domestic and foreign investors.    On how the private sector can contribute to GDP growth,  lessen dependence on oil revenues, and diversify sources of  national income, he said that now is the best time to enter into  foreign partnerships, especially with Europeans.  <H5>  Private Sector Growth </H5>   Salih Bin 'Ali al-Humaydan, deputy secretary general of  Sharqiyyah Chamber [of Commerce], believes that the most  outstanding characteristic of the new budget is the substantial  growth achieved by the private sector at the rate of 5.1 percent  last year. That rate of growth is expected to go even higher,  indicating that the state pays great attention to the private  sector in order that it may perform its targeted role.    Al-Humaydan anticipates higher private sector contribution  to  the enrichment of our great country. We might perhaps notice  that the state has lessened dependence on a single source of  revenues. Oil is only 75 percent; other sources account for the  remaining 25 percent.    The state, as a service to citizens, will carry some R4.5  billion in subsidies to municipalities and water utilities. The  state diligently avoids [reducing] projects that would  contribute to the citizenry's quality of life.  <H5>  The Deficit Disappears </H5>   Yusif 'Abd-al-Sattar Maymani, councilman of the al-Madinah  region; businessman Muhammad As'ad Sharbini, managing director  of al-Madinah Company for Investment; engineer Mustafa Muhammad  Balul, managing director of Agriculture and Water in the  al-Madinah region, businessman Sharif Nayif Bin Jaddum, and  Tarif Husayn Hashim, secretary general of al-Madinah  Chamber--all agree that the absence of a budget deficit this  year is a positive factor that embodies our economy's ability to  meet all developments and difficult challenges.</p>

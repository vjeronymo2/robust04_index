			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Iran must 'curb oil revenue hopes' The Iranian parliament yesterday told the government to scale down its hopes for oil revenue to Dollars 10.15bn in the year starting March 21, Reuter reports from Tehran. The figure compares with a government estimate of Dollars 11.84bn next year, actual oil sales of about Dollars 14bn in the current year and a 1993-94 target of Dollars 17bn. The government has warned deputies that reducing the estimate may force it to cut oil industry development. The deputies' calculation was based on sales 10 per cent below present levels. Their price estimate was not spelled out but some said in debate that Dollars 12 a barrel was more likely than the government's hopes for Dollars 14. 'We set the ceiling of oil revenues at Dollars 10.15bn,' Mr Kazem Mirvalad, secretary of the joint budget and planning, economy and commerce committees, said. 'Considering the situation of the world oil market, among various alternatives we chose the most realistic,' he said. 'We reduced oil exports by 5 per cent of the present level. We allowed another 5 per cent reduction for the likelihood of resumption of Iraqi exports.' Mr Mirvalad was speaking on the second day of a debate on the budget for the Iranian year beginning March 21. Deputies have also called for the government's estimate for next year's total state revenues to be cut to Dollars 17.6bn from Dollars 19.3bn, to take account of a fall in oil prices. Mr Masoud Rowghani Zanjani, an adviser to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, yesterday told parliament that deputies would jeopardise oil development if they cut projected revenues in the new budget, the official news agency IRNA reported. The government had drafted the budget so that 'most of the country's expenditures could be earned through tax revenues'. This year, parliament is debating the budget in two stages for the first time since the 1979 revolution. It will discuss revenues over three days. Two weeks later it will discuss expenditure. Iran's Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) production quota under the current accord which runs until March 31 is 3.6m barrels per day. Iran earned Dollars 11.4bn from crude oil exports and Dollars 346m from exports of oil products in the past 10 months, Iranian television reported. Iran's budget for the year ending March 1994 anticipated oil revenues of Dollars 17bn. World oil prices have fallen about 30 per cent since the budget was drawn up.</p>

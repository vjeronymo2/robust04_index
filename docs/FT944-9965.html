			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Why antifreeze worked wonders What German wine needs is a real humdinger of a scandal - widespread addition of antifreeze perhaps - and the will to take it seriously. The diethylene glycol debacle has certainly worked wonders for Austrian wine. Nearly 10 years on, with fundamentally revised legislation and painstaking quality control systems, the Austrian wine industry is so freshly scrubbed and cloaked in virtue it is almost blindingly bright, while the German wine business is stil shrouded in the grey mists of compromise and rampant commercialism. Fastidious American importers such as Vin DiVino, of Chicago, and Terry Theise, of Milton S Kronheim &amp; Co, Washington DC, are fighting over Austria's top wine producers, blasting their customers with phrases such as: 'I gotta warn you: prepare to be surprised, 'cause you ain't never tasted stuff like dis.' The British wine trade is proceeding rather more sedately, as is its wont. If it does not act soon it will find that the Americans, the Germans and even the Japanese (who import almost as much Austrian wine as the British) will have snapped up all the top wines. Austria suffers from the reverse problem to, say, Chile. It has ample evidence of producing some of the world's finest wines: dry Rieslings, from the Wachau and (often better value) neighbouring Kremstal and Kamptal; Styrian varietals of Collio-like purity; and the most luscious botrytised sweet wines from Burgenland. What it does not have is an ocean of seriously cheap plonk to lap at the shores of the supermarkets  - except for an extraordinary new product called Servus. Very much designed, to sell at about Pounds 3 a bottle on British high streets, it is an attempt by the new governor of Burgenland to shape some of his state's surplus supply of basic white into something that will sustain commercially viable viticulture in Burgenland, and tempt new wine drinkers to try Austria. Producer Lenz Moser, one of the few big merchants to have survived the scandal, is gambling on its success, marketing it defiantly in a clear bordeaux bottle. It tastes crisp and unobjectionable - if undistinguished. The economy and geography of Austria, however, are probably best suited to titillating connoisseurs. British wine drinkers prepared to spend Pounds 7 to Pounds 40 a bottle can find proof of Austria's uniquely dedicated new generation of wine producers at the addresses listed below. The parallel between Austrian and German wine is obvious, not just because the label language and many of the grape varieties grown are the same, but because the German wine industry today faces many of the same problems faced by its Austrian counterpart in the early 1980s just before the glycol scandal enforced a clean sweep. Large commercial bottlers have forced Germany's grape prices down to such an extent that German wines, which were prized above classed- growth bordeaux at the turn of the century, are viewed by many as the lowest of the vinous low. We enthusiasts continue to wave a flag for the quality-conscious producing elite, but the country's reputation continues to be damaged by the lax controls on what officially constitutes 'quality wine' (about 95 per cent of production). In fact the so-called anti-freeze scandal of 1985 reflected just as badly on Germany as Austria. This harmless additive was used exclusively by a limited number of Austrian merchants (not growers) to add body to sweet Austrian wine and was subsequently found in many bottles of supposedly 'German' wine. But the questions raised by this were never properly answered. The Germans had a chance last year to reform their wine laws and they blew it. Enormously high yields are still permitted, and there was no radical reform of the complicated and often misleading nomenclature or the minimum ripeness levels required for each category. It is left to the better producers, such as (but by no means exclusively) those who belong to the VDP group, to impose their own higher standards. For the moment, the consumer is left at the end of the queue - but the future is bleak for any wine producer which ignores the consumer in today's market. Some Austrian importers: Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk and T &amp; W Wines, of Thetford, Norfolk (0842-765646) for Willy Opitz' crazy half-bottlings; Noel Young, of Trumpington, Cambridgeshire (0223-844744) for Kracher sweet wines and Pockl reds; Richard Nurick, of Pangbourne, Berkshire (0734-842565) for Stiegelmar and Sonnhof; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, for some fine Styrian and Burgenland bottles; Richard Spiers Wines, of Guildford, Surrey (0483-37605) for a small Kremstal and Burgunland selection; Forth Wines of Milnathort, central Scotland (0577-862513) for some of Lenz Moser's estate bottlings; The Wine Treasury of London SW6 (071-371 7131) for Skoff's Styrians; The Grape Shop of London SW11 (071-924 3638) for Kolbl, Bauer and Prechtl wines; and Penistone Court Wine Cellars, of Sheffield (0226-766037). Important wholesalers of fine Austrian wine include Caxton Tower, of Brentford, London, for Loiben, Fritz Salomon et al; and for some top quality dry Rieslings FWW Wines, of Banstead, Surrey (081-786 8161) the new UK arm of the excellent co-operative at Durnstein in the Wachau.

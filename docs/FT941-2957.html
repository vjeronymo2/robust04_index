			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Truck output rise of 7% gives little cause for joy Statistics yesterday showing a 7 per cent year-on-year rise in commercial vehicle production in February - only the third monthly increase to be recorded since mid-1992 - brought little comfort yesterday to an industry seeking to recover from its steepest recession on record. The apparent improvement mainly reflects a sharp fall in production in the previous February, as a result of the collapse into receivership that month of the Anglo-Dutch Daf trucks and vans group. Yesterday's statistics, issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office, showed car production to be higher last month than a year ago, but only by 2.73 per cent. Both sectors have been affected by last year's severe slump in continental European car and commercial vehicle sales, which have shown only faint signs of revival. The statistics show that February commercial vehicle output totalled 19,557, a rise of 7.02 per cent from the previous February's 18,275. This brought output for the first two months of this year to 36,048, a decline of 2.80 per cent on the year-ago period's 37,088. Production for export last month was 15.47 per cent lower, at 8,704, compared with the previous February's 10,297. A strengthening recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market, as well as Daf's problems last year, was is reflected in output for the domestic market. It totalled 10,853 last month, a 36 per cent rise from the previous February's 7,978. Car output last month was 114,121, compared with the previous February's 111,091. Output for export was down 10.22 per cent on the previous year, at 44,188. But for the domestic market it was 13.02 per cent higher at 69,933. Sales of vans and other light commercial vehicles bought on hire purchase or other forms of finance leapt by more than half last month. Finance sales of new light commercial vehicles rose 51.2 per cent and finance sales of used commercials jumped 52.6 per cent. Statistics from HPI, the vehicle credit information organisation, show a 47.8 per cent rise in finance sales of used heavy commercial vehicles, and a rise of 22 per cent in finance sales of new heavy commercial vehicles.</p>

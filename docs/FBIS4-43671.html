			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Irish Eyes That Fail To Smile"] </F>   [Text] Tonight at least, and for as long as it lasts, we  are all Irish. Jack Charlton's football team, the only  surviving World Cup contender from these islands, has achieved a  breakthrough in cross-border relations through sport which the  politicians, meeting again in Dublin yesterday, have been  painfully unable to emulate. After the latest round of talks,  Sir Patrick Mayhew -- memo to PM, don't reshuffle this one --  said he was "optimistic but not expectant." Come to think of  it, that's about right for the Italy game, too.    Football apart, there is not much to be expectant about on  the Irish front. The long awaited European elections have been  and gone. The doomsters were proved wrong. Ian Paisley's  Democratic Unionists topped the poll and Paisley immediately  claimed a mandate against Dublin "interference." But he topped  the poll last time too, and his share of the vote was slightly  down this week, the only one of the big three candidates to fall  compared with 1989. In the generally unchanging pattern of  Northern Irish elections, the new features were John Hume's  sharply increased vote -- he came within 1,300 votes of pushing  Paisley into second place -- and the less spectacular hike in  the Unionist share. With Sinn Fein staying very much where it  generally is -- at 9.9 per cent in the north, and 3 per cent in  the Republic -- the election's advance bark was notably worse  than its actual bite.    Contrary to the pessimistic pre-election talk, the Irish  equation has emerged largely unaltered and, if anything,  slightly improved. But the surrounding atmosphere of random  tit-for-tat sectarian killings this week is a reminder that the  constraints of the grim, dull truth are almost as powerful as  they have always been. Anyone hoping for a breakthrough when  Sinn Fein finally deigns to give its reply to the Anglo-Irish  Declaration early next month is still entitled to look  tentatively on the bright side; but the probability is now  overwhelmingly that this will be yet another false dawn for any  peace process.    Sinn Fein's response increasingly seems as if it will not be  a straight yes or no, not least because Sinn Fein, all the signs  suggest, remains so divided. The only consistencies in its  position are the discordant signals which continue to emerge and  which equally continue to cloud the possibilities of real  progress. Last month the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams,  talked of the "reality of conflict" as the background against  which the search for solutions must take place, which was taken  as meaning that he expected the violence to continue. A few  days later he listed a further series of demands which could  help produce his movement's compliance, some of which might be  negotiable while others might not.    But the most fundamental questions of all on this territory  still have to do with consent. Everything turns in the end on  whether Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA accept the right of  the people of Northern Ireland to determine their future. If  they do accept it, what possible justification can there be for  continuing violence? If they don't, how can any agreement be  reached consistent with the repeatedly stated aims of the  British and Irish governments?    Unless or until Sinn Fein can plainly accept consent, not  coercion, as the basis for unification one day, its manoeuvrings  over clarification and its programmes of demand are irrelevant  to the outcome. And though it still doesn't say so directly,  there seems little chance of it reaching such a conclusion. A  peace process with Sinn Fein aboard would clearly be much more  credible than one which excludes it. But the European elections  showed once again that Sinn Fein's support, North and South, is  far too thin on the ground for anyone to accept its right to  dictate what should happen.</p>

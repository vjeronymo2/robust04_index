			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUGARS BEAT DUCKS IN OFFENSIVE SHOW  </P> <P> It was just another one of those crazy Washington State-Oregon football games.  </P> <P> In a series known for its high scores, another memorable chapter was written  Saturday.  </P> <P> The 21st-ranked Cougars beat the No. 23 Ducks, 51-38, in a Pacific 10 game that  featured 905 yards total offense, a blocked punt for a touchdown, an 89-yard  kickoff return and a line-drive kickoff that bounced off a stunned Washington  State defensive lineman and was recovered by Oregon.  </P> <P> The two teams averaged 67 points in their five previous meetings. Last year,  Oregon won, 43-28. That was a defensive struggle compared with Saturday's  contest, the second-highest scoring game in Autzen Stadium history.  </P> <P> The highest was in 1984, when WSU's Rueben Mayes rushed for an NCAA-record 357  yards in a 50-41 Cougar victory. That was the last time Washington State had  beaten the Ducks.  </P> <P> Steve Broussard did a pretty good Mayes impersonation Saturday, rushing for a  career-high 205 yards in 41 carries and scoring three touchdowns as the Cougars  amassed 503 total yards.  </P> <P> The Cougars scored early on a blocked punt and jumped to a 20-6 halftime lead,  then withstood a second-half rally and added 24 fourth-quarter points to  improve their record to 5-1 and 2-1.  </P> <P> Ron Ricard intercepted two passes by Bill Musgrave in the fourth quarter,  returning one of them 74 yards for a score, to thwart the Ducks' comeback  attempt.  </P> <P> Playing in front of 44,963, the second-largest crowd in Autzen's 22-year  history, Musgrave completed 29 of 49 passes for a career-high 347 yards and two  touchdowns. His passing yardage total was the fourth-best ever at Oregon. Only  Dan Fouts and Chris Miller have done better.  </P> <P> The game marked the first time Oregon (3-2 and 2-2) has lost at home when  Musgrave gone all the way.  </P> <P> The Cougars lost star receiver Tim Stallworth in the second quarter because of  torn knee ligaments.  </P></p>

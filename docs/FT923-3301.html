			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: Gadgets and gizmos for the techno-freak - The latest electronic offerings to make the most of a push-button life THE GARDEN parasol is back in the shed, the photographs from Paradise Isle have long been filed, or stuffed into boxes, and many people will be in low spirits as they come to grips with post-holiday blues. Not to despair. This autumn promises a number of sophisticated electronic gadgets to carry anyone away on a flight of fantasy, or at the least, to inject a buzz into the routine of everyday life. In all sectors of consumer electronics, manufacturers have been inventing gadgets to rekindle some spark in demand after what has been, for them, a lacklustre few years. In the months to come we can expect to see a number of exciting new products, as well as a range of improvements to familiar ones that will make life a lot more entertaining . . . AUDIO Top of the list must be the range of portable audio products being introduced by Philips and Sony this autumn. These will feature compact disc quality hi-fi sound and have caused something of a stir in the industry. Digital Compact Cassette - or DCC, as it is more commonly known - is a digital audio cassette developed by Philips which should replace conventional analogue cassette tape recorders. The rival to DCC being launched by Sony in November is the MiniDisc, best described as a small CD. Both formats will enable CD enthusiasts to carry the crisp and clear sound of CDs with them when they are out and about without worrying about 'sound skipping', the jogs and jumps that can occur with conventional portable CD players. They can also be used to record CD-quality sound. The DCC tape will be enclosed in a protective case, so those with children need not worry about little sticky fingers pulling their favourite Mozart tape out all over your living room floor. The MiniDisc is also in a protective case for easier portability. The benefit of DCC is that it will also play conventional analogue cassettes, as well as the new digital ones. As for MiniDisc, the biggest advantage it has over DCC is that it offers random access - the ability to skip from any one track to another. The crucial question for both, however, is whether there will be sufficient recorded music to play on the new equipment when it is launched, although both Philips and Sony are confident that there will be 'hundreds' of titles available on each format at the launch date. The digital tapes and MiniDiscs are expected to retail at prices similar to CDs but Philips and Sony have not announced European prices for the portable units. For the home-based audio enthusiast, the most exciting product on offer in the coming season is the wide-imaging stereo loudspeaker manufactured by Canon. Unlike conventional stereo speakers, Canon's WIS speakers provide stereo sound regardless of where you physically are in the room. With conventional speakers, the stereo effect is only available within a limited area, known as the 'hot spot,' where sounds from each speaker overlap. Anywhere else, what you hear sounds as if it were coming only from the closest speaker. Canon says that its wide-imaging speakers give a stereo effect over an area at least six times larger than conventional box loudspeakers. It is introducing a new consumer model at the consumer, rather than professional, price of Pounds 149.95. Those who are perfectly happy with their existing CD player might however fall for a useful little accessory: a CD lens cleaner. CD players are fitted with tiny lenses which focus the laser beam that reads the signals off a compact disc. When the CD player begins skipping or stuttering most people assume that something is wrong with the machine, but it is more likely that the CD lens has become dirty. A lens cleaner can solve the problem. The latest product offering from a Japanese company called Tarsun an ordinary CD, but with what looks rather like a tiny brush on one side of the disc. It is known affectionately by its UK distributors, Strong UK, as the 'rens creaner.' When played, a sweet female voice explains how it should be used. The language, which is undeniably English, sounds strangely like Japanese. TELEVISIONS Portable TVs have proved very popular among those who want to watch their favourite football match while en route to the next meeting. Citizen, the Japanese company better known for its watches, will launch a portable colour TV and video monitor with a 4 in liquid crystal display (LCD) screen later this month in the UK. Citizen's model will have a built-in hood to keep light - either sunlight or artificial - from reflecting off the screen, which can make it impossible to see anything. It will retail for Pounds 249.99. Another handy portable TV is Toshiba's multi-standard LCD TV, due to hit UK stores next month. This handsome portable can receive pictures in almost any country except France, which has a unique TV broadcasting system called SECAM-L. Although at Pounds 599.99, more expensive than the Citizen, the Toshiba will be attractive to the business executive who travels outside the UK. CAMCORDERS TV compatability problems aside, the French, like many of us, have taken to home movie making in a big way - as anyone who spent the summer on a French beach will have noticed. For the coming season Akai, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, is bringing out a camcorder - or rather a palmcorder, since it fits your palm - that is even more intelligent than the hi-tech models already on the market. Akai's new model has a horizontal shape which makes it easier to use with both hands in order to minimise picture shake. An auto-chase focus function focuses the camera on the chosen subject even if it strays out of the centre of the viewfinder. It is priced at Pounds 599. Meanwhile, Sony has taken the amateur moving-making industry a step further with the introduction of its colour video printer, which can take still photographs from a home movie. The printer, which will produce pictures from a camcorder, video recorder or even a TV broadcast, is perfect for sending Granny those wonderful shots of the new baby wrecking her cot, although at a cost of Pounds 999.99 in the UK it is largely for the enthusiast. CD SPINOFFS One of the most promising growth areas in consumer electronics is in the field of CD spinoffs. To most of us, compact discs are merely a music recording medium. But manufacturers have been busy finding different applications for the versatile discs which can hold vast amounts of information, from sound, text and graphics to video. Sony created the Data man, essentially an electronic book, which was launched in the UK this summer. The Data Discman gives the user instant access to a vast quantity of visual information stored on a CD-sized disc. So, if you are travelling on business to Tokyo, do not burden yourself with a phrase book, a book on Japanese table manners, a guide to Japanese restaurants and another on Japanese country spas. Just take a Data Discman and a few slim discs, each capable of holding the equivalent information contained in 200 telephone directories, which should provide you with all the information you will need. The Discman, which costs Pounds 349, can also play ordinary audio CDs. Philips's offering is the CD-I, a heftier machine which resembles a computer games machine, electronic book CD-player and computer all rolled into one. The CD-I, which hooks up to the TV and audio set, allows users to manipulate material on screen, ranging from text, animation and video. The UK price of Pounds 599 is likely to fall since Philips has recently reduced the price from Dollars 900 to Dollars 600 in the US. Kodak, meanwhile, has its photo-CD machine which allows you to store your pictures on a CD-disc and look at them on television. It may be about time to say good-bye to all those boxes full of old, crumpled photographs. The Photo-CD costs Pounds 299. MOBILE PHONES If greater convenience, rather than enhanced entertainment, is your goal, consider Sony's new mobile phone handset, due to be launched for use on Cellnet's consumer cellular phone service this autumn for Pounds 299.99. The first handset targeted at consumers, rather than business users, it is an attractive, easy-to-use mobile phone that would fit easily into a handbag, It will be sold by high street retailers rather than through specialist service providers which currently handle all mobile phone sales. PERSONAL ORGANISERS At the more business-oriented end of the market, or for those who just like to keep things organised, electronic personal organisers are just the thing. Sharp's IQ range, for example, with its choice of software from the Bible to video games, is an attractive product. Sharp's range costs from Pounds 179.99 for a standard model which can take 1,070 telephone numbers to Pounds 259.99 for a more powerful one that can hold over 5,500 telephone However, unless you are the organising type to begin with, and unless you are happy to deal with a tiny keyboard, it might be best to wait until the much-publicised personal organisers that will allow you to use a pen, rather than a keyboard, become available next year.</p>

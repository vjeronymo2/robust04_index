			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Baltic states hit troop pull-out snag THE NEWLY-CREATED 10-nation Council of Baltic Sea States ran into difficulties yesterday when Estonia and Latvia raised the controversial issue of the delay in Soviet troop withdrawals from their territories. The problem arose despite the insistence by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister and conference co-chairman, that the council, set up to bridge the gap between western Europe and the former communist states bordering the Baltic, should not duplicate the work of existing international organisations. Security matters fell outside the scope of the new organisation, he stressed. That did nothing to deter the Estonian and Latvian foreign ministers, Mr Lennart Meri and Mr Janis Jurkans, from protesting against what the former described as the 'illegal stationing' of Soviet troops on their territories. They did so in the presence of Mr Andrej Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, whose country is among the founder-members of the Baltic Sea grouping. 'At a time when the cold war, or rather, the third world war, is approaching its end, Estonia is still fighting her last battle of the Second World War,' Mr Meri said. He did not see why Soviet forces, redeployed from Germany and other central European states, were now concentrated on the Estonian border, in Karelia and the Kola Peninsula. At a time when Estonia was rebuilding its democratic institutions, Mr Meri said: 'It is not a comfortable situation when our parliament can be reached in less than 15 minutes by Soviet paratroopers'. After the meeting, Mr Kozyrev tried to turn the discussion to his advantage by stressing that Soviet troop withdrawals from the Baltic states and elsewhere were as much a social and economic problem as a political and military one. The resettlement of soldiers' families was worthy of financial aid from the council's member countries, he suggested. Another Russian-backed proposal, to appoint a special commissioner for national minorities and human rights in the Baltic Sea region, aimed specifically at protecting Russian minorities there, also appeared to trespass on work already undertaken by the 48-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Even protection of the marine environment, in which the Baltic Sea states have a special interest, is already covered by an existing organisation, the Helsinki Commission, grouping most of the states making up the new Council. The Baltic Council, which will meet at foreign minister-level once a year, and be run by officials in the intervening period, will not be given a specific aid budget. The aim is to identify common projects to help transform Russia, the east European states and the Baltic republics into free-market societies and prepare them for closer relations with the EC, but aid will continue to be given bilaterally or channelled through existing international bodies.</p>

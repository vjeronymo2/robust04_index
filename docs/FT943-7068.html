			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Vocational students win higher rate of university places The first wave of students completing the government's new sixth-form vocational qualifications were more successful in winning offers of university places this year than A-level candidates. The results published today for advanced general national vocational qualifications (GNVQs), introduced as a pilot scheme two years ago, were welcomed by the government as a crucial boost to its attempts to improve the UK training base. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said the results were 'an historic step towards giving the country the vocational skills we need for the future'. She added that they had given 16-year-olds 'the freedom to choose a path where they can best prove their talents'. The government hopes that by 1996 a quarter of all 16-year-olds will embark on the courses. Of the 900 GNVQ candidates who applied for university, 85 per cent were offered places, compared with 76 per cent of applicants taking A-levels. In total, 1,236 passed the advanced GNVQ, while 15,587 passed the intermediate GNVQ, designed to be equivalent to the GCSE exams taken mainly by 16-year-olds. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the employment department quango responsible for the new qualifications, hailed the results as evidence that they had earned the respect of universities and employers. The council also said fewer than a third of the 3,800 students who registered for the first year of GNVQs had completed the qualifications within the recommended two years, suggesting that the courses were not an 'easy option'. At least 50,000 applications are expected for advanced GNVQs, starting next month, but some educationalists remain critical of the qualifications, which involve assessing skills through a series of units, rather than taking traditional written exams. Professor Alan Smithers, of Manchester University, said: 'The fact that lots have not completed the course is neither good news nor bad. Students are working through courses at their own pace but they are still being judged at the end by low and unreliable standards.' The advanced GNVQs offered this year covered five broad vocational subjects  -art and design; business studies; health and social care; leisure and tourism; and manufacturing. From next month, they will also be available in built environment, hospitality and catering, and science. Mrs Shephard also welcomed results from this year's GCSE examinations showing increased interest in maths and science. Exams under pressure to make the grade, Page 7</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRONG CHALLENGER FOR YAROSLAVSKY'S 5TH DISTRICT SEAT DROPS OUT OF RACE  </P> <P> Steve Saltzman, one of Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's strongest  challengers for the 5th District council seat, dropped out of the race  Wednesday, leaving the councilman with four opponents leading up to the April  11 election.  </P> <P> The strongest remaining challenger now appears to be Laura Lake, a slow-growth  candidate who is receiving support from some of the people who helped Ruth  Galanter defeat 18-year veteran council member Pat Russell two years ago.  </P> <P> Saltzman's withdrawal from the campaign was the latest development in a race  that took an unusual turn when Yaroslavsky decided not to run against Mayor Tom  Bradley, believing him to be unbeatable. On Jan. 6, he announced instead that  he would seek reelection to the council.  </P> <P> Before he made that decision, 5th District candidates had expected a  competitive race for a seat that Yaroslavsky would have had to give up to run  for mayor. Now, Yaroslavsky is favored to win another term.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Jack McGrath, who had been helping run Saltzman's campaign,  entered the race. McGrath, who managed Yaroslavsky's first successful campaign  in 1975 and served as the councilman's chief deputy, enters the race with  little money. Also running are urban planner Ryan Snyder and artist Henry Hill.  </P> <P> The 5th District includes the Beverly-Fairfax area, Century City, Bel-Air,  Westwood, West Los Angeles and parts of Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Van  Nuys.  </P> <P> Saltzman, a former co-chairman of Yaroslavsky's 1985 reelection campaign and a  former Westside deputy to Bradley, had vowed to stay in the race after  Yaroslavsky decided to seek reelection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed His Mind  </P> <P> But after assessing his chances, he changed his mind Wednesday and endorsed  Yaroslavsky for reelection. "I came to the conclusion that I would have to  raise an extraordinary amount of money and run a highly negative campaign," he  said. "That's not why I went into public service."  </P> <P> Some of Saltzman's support also began to erode when Yaroslavsky decided to run  for reelection.  </P> <P> Lake, on leave from her job as a UCLA professor of environmental sciences to  campaign full time, contends that Yaroslavsky is vulnerable because he has been  "on the wrong side" of several important growth battles in his district. She  kicked off her campaign earlier this week with a press conference at the  Westside Pavilion shopping mall, where traffic problems and a proposed  expansion have generated controversy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Difference'  </P> <P> She said Wednesday that Saltzman's withdrawal from the race "makes no  difference."  </P> <P> "The race has always been about whether we will have a council person who is  willing to fight for the neighborhoods that are crowded with growth and traffic  congestion and threatened with crime or a council person who is marking time  until he has a safe race for mayor," she said.  </P> <P> Lake's campaign has been bolstered by a cadre of people who helped Galanter  defeat Russell on a wave of homeowner discontent over Russell's pro-development  record. Among those working for Lake are Marcela Howell, who was Galanter's  campaign manager; Ben Goddard, who handled political mailings for Galanter, and  Don May, a California League of Conservation Voters activist who helped  organize a door-to-door campaign for Galanter, said Rick Ruiz, Galanter's press  aide who is also a volunteer on the Lake campaign.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Concerned'  </P> <P> Galanter endorsed Lake when Yaroslavsky was expected to run for mayor. Aides to  the councilwoman, who will not return from a trip to Antarctic until Monday,  said they do not know if she will continue to back Lake against a council  colleague.  </P> <P> "I'm not concerned," Yaroslavsky said about his reelection Wednesday, adding  that he plans to wage an all-out campaign nonetheless.  </P> <P> "The people of the 5th District, the people of the city, know me. . . . I  co-authored the most comprehensive land-use initiative, Proposition U, ever  written in this country.  </P></p>

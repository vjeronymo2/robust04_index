			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Trial sought over Milan contracts An Italian prosecutor has applied for a trial on corruption charges of 41 people, including two ex-mayors of Milan and two former executives of Fiat, judicial sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Milan. A senior judge must now rule whether there is enough evidence to try the defendants. Milan prosecutor Mr Paolo Ielo sought the trial at the end of an inquiry into alleged bribes paid to political parties to win business from Milan's public transport authority. The investigation into corrupt practices over the distribution of contracts for the Milan metro was one of the first big investigations by Milan magistrates begun two years ago. The two ex-Fiat executives are former finance director Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli and Mr Antonio Mosconi, former vice-chairman of its Cogefar Impresit building subsidiary. Mr Ielo has asked for them to be tried on corruption charges. Mr Ielo alleges that bribes worth four to five per cent of the contracts to buy buses for Milan's public transport network were paid to political parties between 1978 and 1992. He also applied for former Milan mayors Mr Carlo Tognoli and Mr Paolo Pilliteri and 37 other politicians and businessmen to be tried on charges of paying and taking bribes. Mr Pilliteri, a member of the Socialist party, is the brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former prime minister sentenced in absentia last Friday to eight and a half years in jail in another corruption case. A Rome judge last week dropped charges against Mr Mattioli, ruling there was insufficient evidence to try him on charges of corruption in the building of the capital's metro railway. In another development, judicial sources said an aide to Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the country's best-known anti-corruption magistrate, was arrested at the weekend as part of Mr Di Pietro's latest inquiries. Mr Giuliano Montanari, a finance police officer, was detained as part of an investigation into bribes paid by businessmen to the force in return for easy treatment, the sources said.</p>

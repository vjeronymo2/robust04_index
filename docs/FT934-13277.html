			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Hedda Gabler - Theatre Hedda Gabler reached London in 1891 via Munich, Helsinki, Berlin, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Gothenburg. The Munich opening was a flop, but Ibsen shrugged: 'The public likes to laugh.' There is awkward laughter at the end of Hedda at the Manchester Royal Exchange, a sign that the production still lacks focus and seriousness. Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) is the most domestic of playwrights, closest to Chekhov, but without his expansive melancholy and without the calm centre which every Chekhov play has. At the centre of Ibsen lies the dramatic version of Soren Kierkegaard, even if he claims to have read little of the philosopher. But all Ibsen comes down to this: 'What is healthy is the happiness one acquires through one's own will.' This is as true of Nora in The Doll's House as of Hedda. Hedda's suicide should be the end of expectation and the end of the play. At Manchester, the direction (Joseph Blatchley) is too frenetic and flighty to allow the issues, let alone the characters, to settle. Keeping actors on the move in the all-round auditorium at Manchester dispels the claustrophobia of Ibsen's play and makes Hedda's suicide into a random event rather than the outcome of her circumstances. Geraldine James as Hedda gradually bends her imperiousness to her surroundings ('I suppose a butler is out of the question'), and sets about manipulating her pliant husband, Jorgen. Ibsen writes short speeches, always clear about the distribution of power in each exchange. These are adult conversations. Hedda: 'Did you enjoy yourself?' Jorgen: 'Were you worried about me?' Hedda: 'No, I asked whether you enjoyed yourself.' James plays Hedda at full throttle, never finding quiet, never concentrating the action. Her best scenes are with Dave Hill as Judge Brack, who locates a tone of level menace, and who does keep still on stage. Alongside her, Phillip Joseph is far too ineffectual as Jorgen, the stupid, soppy academic specialising in 'The cottage industries in the Brabant in the Middle Ages'; he marries Hedda and falls short of her demands; it is, admittedly, a hard part, for Joseph has to represent feebleness without being feeble. Hilton McRae as Eilert Lovberg, Hedda's former suitor and Jorgen's present rival, fails to find the necessary charisma. The whole production should be more like Middlemarch and he should be just like Will Ladislaw. The weak women, well played by Marlene Sidaway (Jorgen's aunt) and Cecily Hobbs (Lovberg's devotee) balance the excesses of Hedda's behaviour and James's acting. The production needs to find pitch and purpose. Ibsen is a strong willed writer and requires tough treatment from the director. There is director's wisdom in Ibsen's remark to a friend: 'It always strikes me as comical when people tell me that something they wanted did not work out. They have merely desired or longed for something, not willed it.' Royal Exchange, Manchester (061 833 9833) until November 13</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Contentious issues remain unresolved - Services THE Quad statement on market-opening measures for services makes clear that in this key area of the Uruguay Round negotiations the most contentious issues remain unresolved. In particular, the US has not given ground on maritime services - which it wants to exempt from commitments granting equal access to allcomers. Nor have the US and the European Community yet found a way of resolving their differences over audio-visual services, where the EC is seeking exemptions on 'cultural' grounds. In both areas the Quad statement says merely that 'we will continue to work toward satisfactory solutions'. This is bound to disappoint many countries taking part in the world trade talks in Geneva, notably the Nordic nations and others with important shipping interests. Elsewhere, the Quad participants report 'progress' in liberalising financial services, where Japan's banking, insurance and securities markets have been a target for both the US and EC. However, the statement adds, in an implied reference to east Asian countries such as South Korea and Singapore, that the four are seeking 'a greater level of commitment from other participants'. In basic telecommunications, the Quad nations have drawn up a 'common detailed agenda' for multilateral liberalisation talks involving big suppliers and customers. The talks will begin as soon as possible.</p>

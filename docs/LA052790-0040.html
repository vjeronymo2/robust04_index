			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REELING FROM INVASION BY HOLLYWOOD CREWS  </P> <P> Cliff Roseman, a location manager for some film company, is dead wrong. I, and  many others, will not say "damn" when the film crews are gone.  </P> <P> Good riddance is more like it.  </P> <P> My neighborhood, with its old houses, was one of many favorites of the film  companies. I haven't seen much of them lately, perhaps because of letters to  Charles Weisenberg, director of the city's motion picture and television  affairs office, and tactics such as asking for the crew's film permits. These  permits have a definite ending time, and if they aren't cleaned up and out of  there by that time, my neighbors and I let Weisenberg know.  </P> <P> As for Weisenberg's assertion that the industry generates $5 billion a year for  California, I ask for whom? Does $5 billion go into the coffers of the state or  cities of California? I bet most of it ends up in the pockets of the producers  and stars, those people who don't allow filming in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> If more companies were like Avnet/Kerner, which helped the community and  improved the area instead of trashing it, maybe I'd sing a different tune. But  they are not. Most just go for the bucks, everyone else be damned. It is time  the production companies shape up or ship out. ANDREW CARRILLO, Los Angeles  </P></p>

President Hafiz al-Asad held telephone contacts with King  Husayn of Jordan and Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. He  received a telephone call from President Clinton in which the  peace process and the Security Council resolution were  discussed. A meeting of the Arab parties in the Washington  talks is expected to be held soon in order to discuss the  resumption of these talks. This is in light of international  developments and the conviction of the peace process cosponsors  and the entire international community about the importance of  carrying out intensive efforts to implement the Security Council  resolution and achieve peace in the region.    This is not the first time that Syria has taken the  initiative and contributed to the rescuing of the peace process.  It has done so several times, because it sensed, as it senses  now, a serious international trend to see a just and  comprehensive solution in the Middle East, based on the  resolutions of international legitimacy, and leading to a real  and lasting peace.    Security Council Resolution 904 was unanimously adopted. It  stands as a clear and strong condemnation of Israel and its  practices. For the first time in the history of the  Arab-Israeli conflict, the resolution calls for international  protection for our kinsfolk under occupation. Prominent  Security Council members demanded that the protection be real  and broad, and include our kinsfolk in occupied Jerusalem. For  his part, President Clinton announced that peace with Syria is  of the utmost importance, and hailed Syria's sincere peaceful  trends.    It is natural that Syria works to employ this international  trend in the interest of the just and comprehensive peace for  which it is calling, and in a way that puts Israel to the test.  Israel should either bow to the will of international peace or  drop its last mask and face the world's strong criticism and  whatever measures the international community might take.    Undoubtedly, the peace process -- despite Israel's  intransigence and procrastination -- took an important step  forward in the adoption of Security Council Resolution 904. Tel  Aviv's rulers have no excuse for evading the requirements of the  peace process, especially exchanging land for peace. Israel's  rulers will no longer be able to use the Arab desires for peace  as a pretext, because they are the most sincere desires. The  international community, especially the United States, has felt  Arab eagerness for peace and Syria's serious contribution to  repeatedly salvaging of the peace process from collapse as a  result of Israel's practices and the designs of its rulers.    As all admit, peace cannot be made in vacuum, but should be  based on the resolutions and the objective bases represented in  Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and the  principle of land for peace. In other words, Israel has no  choice but to return the occupied Arab territories and recognize  the Palestinian people's national rights. These stand as the  essence of the Security Council resolutions. Any Israeli delay  and procrastination designed to evade these resolutions will  only increase tension in the region, and may lead to new brutal  actions by Zionist settlers that will be firmly and decisively  rejected by the international community.    If Resolution 904 asks Israel to disarm its settlers, then  any new criminal action by settlers will surely lead to broad  international protection in the occupied territories. However,  Israel is skillful in the arts of procrastination and  maneuvering. It has been carrying out a large-scale policy of  deception since 1948. It has always shown a disdain for the  principles and resolutions of the international community. For  more than two years, it has been aborting the peace talks in  Washington. If these talks are expected to produce a just and  comprehensive solution in the Middle East, the international  community should place its full weight behind efforts to  implement its resolutions, support its credibility, and end the  Israeli occupation.    It is important for the international community to double  its  efforts so it will not face new Israeli massacres that may  destroy the whole peace process.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE SHOCK THERAPY;  </P> <P> PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION ISSUES GUIDELINES  </P> <P> The country's largest professional group of psychiatrists announced elaborate  guidelines Thursday for the use of electroshock therapy, the controversial  treatment for severe depression that is experiencing a resurgence in medical  practice.  </P> <P> The guidelines drawn up by the American Psychiatric Assn. were described as  among the most detailed ever issued to explain how a therapy should be used --  testament to rapid advances in the science of shock therapy and to public  pressure for accountability.  </P> <P> "There is no intent to increase or decrease . . . use (of electroshock)," Dr.  Richard Weiner, an author of the report, said. "The intent is to maximize the  efficacy and safety with which it is provided, to make sure it's used in the  proper fashion."  </P> <P> Electroshock therapy, also known as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, uses an  electric shock to induce a seizure as a form of psychiatric treatment. By  changing the balance of chemicals in the brain, it is used to treat severe  depressive illness and mania, usually after drug therapy has failed.  </P> <P> Discovered in the late 1930s, shock therapy was used and abused widely in the  1940s and 1950s. Some patients received dozens of treatments. Its excesses  became a subject of Sylvia Plath's novel, "The Bell Jar," and Ken Kesey's "One  Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."  </P> <P> With the discovery of effective antidepressant drugs in the early 1960s, use of  electroconvulsive therapy dwindled. After several decades of quiescence,  interest was rekindled in the 1980s as a result of research that showed how the  therapy could be better used.  </P> <P> "ECT's effectiveness in rescuing severely ill patients from the despairing  depths of depression or the perilous heights of uncontrolled mania is well  accepted by psychiatrists," Dr. Herbert Pardes, president of the APA, said at a  news conference Thursday. "However, ECT, like treatments for every other  illness, is not 100% effective, it is not a cure and it does have some adverse  effects," he added.  </P> <P> The APA guidelines -- filling more than 200 pages and scheduled for publication  in book form -- cover, among many other things, situations in which ECT may be  appropriate or inappropriate and precisely how it should be used.  </P> <P> The guidelines also explore the issue of patient consent, an especially  contentious issue in the case of shock therapy. They emphasize the importance  of informed consent from all patients capable of giving it and the fact that  consent may be revoked at any time.  </P> <P> "You have to give the patient the benefit of the doubt, concerning their right  to agree or disagree," said Weiner, chairman of the APA's task force on ECT. He  said the physician "should express how they feel about it, but it's up to the  patient to decide."  </P> <P> The report recommends that the primary uses of ECT should be against major  depression, mania and some cases of schizophrenia and psychosis. It also might  be used in some medical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.  </P> <P> The typical course of ECT is six to 12 treatments, administered two to three  times a week. The patient receives a mild current that, specialists believe,  causes alterations in the brain's chemistry not dissimilar to those caused by  drugs that treat depression.  </P> <P> The APA, which counts its membership at 36,000, spent two years preparing its  ECT study. Weiner's task force sought input from numerous medical professional  groups, regulators, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and lay mental health  groups.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vitaliy Cherkasov report: "Cossack Draft...After 75 Years"] </F>   [Text] Volgograd -- In accordance with an order by Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and a General Staff directive the  drafting of new recruits into our Army's Cossack units has  begun. In all the re-created Cossack troop districts -- the Don,  Astrakhan, Volga, Kuban, Terek, Orenburg, Amur, Ussuri, Yenisey,  Irkutsk, Transbaykal, and Siberian districts -- lists of young  boys who will serve in their own Cossack details, divisions, and  battalions as well as protecting the border, have been handed  over to the military commissariats.    Clearly, following the 75-year-long enforced disbandment of  the Cossacks, it is hard to organize new combat-ready units.  There are also a lot of other problems which Vladimir Naumov,  field ataman of the Council of Russian Cossacks, spoke about in  an interview which he gave in Volgograd.    "All our proposals concerning the organization of the first  Cossack draft were accepted by the military department, approved  by Minister Grachev, and submitted to the State Duma Committee  for Matters of Defense and Security. Unfortunately, I cannot  say when this question will be examined by deputies. Time is  passing, the spring sowing is ending, but the hearing of the  question keeps being delayed.    "Taking the Cossacks' wishes into account, the military  department approved the uniform which the Cossacks had in 1914  -- khaki soldier's shirts and pants made of blue cloth with  stripes in the traditional colors for Cossack troops -- crimson  for the Don, yellow for Astrakhan, and so on. Sleeve chevrons  will also be introduced.    "The Ministry of Defense is examining whether commanders of  Cossack details and battalions should be Cossack officers from  the same areas as the new recruits. For this reason, the  recruitment of students from Cossack regions to the military  schools is being announced. Naturally, `The History of the  Cossacks' must be an indispensable educational discipline in  these training institutes.    "If they are really going to be organized, why should the  Cossack regiments not be given back the names which they bore  before the Revolution? For instance, the Don regiment named for  Ataman Platov, or the Yermak Timofeyevich regiment. This would  discipline the young Cossacks, cement their ranks, and make them  honor the traditions of their ancestors. The fact that  information to the effect that a draftee is a Cossack can be put  into his military registration documents at his own wish is a  source of joy to the Cossack. In that case, the entry  `Cossack' will be made in the `Special Notes' section."    Aleksandr Kotenkov, Russian Federation deputy minister for  nationalities affairs and regional policy, comments on the  report by our Volgograd correspondent:    "It is true that the spring draft for the Army in Russia's  Cossack regions has been announced, but, within the framework of  existing legislation, it has been on general principles. There  is no specific Cossack form of recruitment for military units or  large units, as the law on Cossack military service has not been  adopted yet.    "The elaboration of a draft law to this effect is currently  being concluded in our ministry, and it will be submitted to the  Russian Government for agreement and conclusion next week.    "With the adoption of this document, the formation of  Cossack  units will really develop. The Cossack servicemen's full dress  will be traditional, depending on which Cossack group they  belong to, and the everyday uniform will remain the same as it  is in the entire Russian Army. This is natural. It is hard to  imagine a member of the tank crew, for example, in a Circassian  coat and Astrakhan hat and with a dagger.    "It is no secret that today the Army draft is proceeding  with  difficulty for a whole number of reasons. But, according to our  calculations, with the introduction of the Cossack model for  forming military units, the number of draftees in Cossack  regions will increase at least tenfold."</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Hotel development near Paris airport ARCADIAN INTERNATIONAL has concluded all the financing arrangements necessary for the development of the Hotel Grande Ferme at Gressy-en-France near Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris. The development comprises a 92-room four star hotel in the style of the 18th-century pressoir which, until recently, stood upon the site and will contain conference, seminar and leisure facilities. The total project cost will be about FFr105m (Pounds 10.59m) and will be financed by a combination of equity, long-term debt and leasing. Arcadian has signed an agreement with W Finance, a subsidiary of Athena and part of the Worms et Cie Group for the provision of the required equity for the project of FF40m. W Finance will take 62 per cent and Arcadian will take 38 per cent. Agreement has also been reached with COPARC, an insurance subsidiary within the Worms et Cie Group for the provision of the required long-term debt. The demolition to enable construction to begin was started on February 20 and the construction phase starts this month. The hotel, which is due to open in September 1993, will be built north-east of Paris between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Euro Disney.</p>

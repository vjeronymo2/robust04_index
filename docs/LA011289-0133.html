			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: PEOPLE ASKING WRONG REID FOR NBA ANSWER  </P> <P> Many people are assuming that 6-foot 11-inch All-American forward J.R. Reid of  North Carolina will forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and make  himself available in the National Basketball Assn. draft this year.  </P> <P> Reid has been asked over and over about it, but Anthony Cotton of the  Washington Post says the questions have been directed at the wrong person. The  opinion of Reid's father, Herman, a former NFL player for the Baltimore Colts  and now a schoolteacher in Virginia Beach, Va., figures to carry plenty of  weight when the decision is made.  </P> <P> "In our family, we push education. We don't talk about pro ball," Herman Reid  said. "As parents, you want your son to stay in school for 4 years. Right now,  if we have anything to do with it, he will. His family isn't rich, but he's got  nice things. We want him to enjoy college."  </P> <P> Says J.R., "I can't recall the last time I did anything without his consent."  </P> <P> Add Reid: "I remember when it was time to pick a college," J.R. said. "Maryland  was the first place I visited and when I got back I wanted to go there. My mom  said to wait, and sure enough I decided that Carolina would be better for me.  </P> <P> "People forget that about college athletes. I'm only 20 years old. I'm young,  still learning about life. I've watched others and learned and benefited from  their mistakes.  </P> <P> "The NBA's been there a long time, I'm sure it'll be there without me for  another year."  </P> <P> Wayne Gretzky of the Kings probably is still the best all-around player in the  National Hockey League, but Mario Lemieux may lead the league in intimidation.  </P> <P> Said goalie Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders after Lemieux had scored 3  goals to lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 5-3 victory Tuesday night: "There  has to be something involved with the height of the man (6 feet 4 inches) and  the weight behind the shot (200 pounds), because when he one-times a shot, when  he gets all of it . . . I'm not going to concede a goal, but it's the next best  thing to a sure one."  </P> <P> A reference Wednesday to Cazzie Russell being the last Laker to wear No. 32  before Magic Johnson arrived was a digit off.  </P> <P> Russell, who played on the 1974-75 Laker team that had lost 8 straight road  games, was the last Laker to wear No. 33 before Kareem Abdul-Jabbar arrived the  next season. Bill Bridges wore No. 32 on that '74-'75 team.  </P> <P> Darrell Christian of the Associated Press offers this quickie Super Bowl quiz:  </P> <P> What was the highest-rated Super Bowl telecast?  </P> <P> What was the last Super Bowl decided by a touchdown or less?  </P> <P> What was the only Super Bowl played in the North?  </P> <P> What was the only Super Bowl in which the loser had more yards than the winner?  </P> <P> A hint: One answer fits all.  </P> <P> Answer: It was Super Bowl XVI at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., which  matched the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals, who will play in Super  Bowl XXIII at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami on Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Quarterback Boomer Esiason of the Cincinnati Bengals, who throws his passes  left-handed: "Dan Marino has the greatest right arm in football."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting intensified in  Kigali early Tuesday [19 April], with "heavy shelling and lots  of gunfire" as rebels battled government forces for control of  the body-strewn Rwandan capital, a United Nations official said.  The increase in fighting followed an admission by Army  commanders Monday that 1,000 rebel reinforcements had entered  Kigali. Acting Armed Forces chief of staff General Marcel  Gatsinzi said the military was prepared to consider all rebel  conditions for a ceasefire. But UN officials contacted by  telephone in Kigali said the two sides had failed to meet to  negotiate a ceasefire because they had rejected each other's  demands.    The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front wants the disbanding of  the  interim government proclaimed after the death of President  Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious April 6 plane crash.  Habyarimana's death triggered a frenzied bloodbath as  hardliners from his majority Hutu tribe, led by the presidential  guard which accused the rebels of shooting down the president's  plane, massacred members of the minority Tutsi group that  dominates the rebel movement.    The Red Cross said tens of thousands of people had been  killed in the past 12 days of frenzied ethnic carnage in the  capital and around the small central African highland nation.  Most of those killed were Tutsis or people accused of  supporting the rebels, though some witnesses have reported  revenge killings by rebel guerrillas or Tutsi civilians. The  massacres triggered an exodus of tens of thousands of refugees  to neighbouring countries, the Red Cross said.</p>

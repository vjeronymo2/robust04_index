			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] Henry Ruiz, member of the Sandinist National  Liberation Front [FSLN], yesterday agreed to run for the  position of Secretary General of the FSLN. He said he is  willing "to work for the FSLN's cohesion, to work with his best  fellow party members as a team to encourage the rank and file,  and to create a group that can lead us and the people to  office." This would be the first time in the FSLN's history  that the organization's top leader is elected by a secret and  direct vote from among several candidates.    In an extensive public letter, Ruiz said he decided to run  for several reasons, including that "there is excessive  polarization of opinion" in the FSLN and unity is needed for an  essential renovation "to determine the new strategy to take  office."    Ruiz, who for the first time was publicly proposed as  candidate by Doris Tijerino, an experienced FSLN member, had  said he would consider whether or not his candidacy contributes  to the party's unity. He did not accept the candidacy  explicitly, however.    In addition, Ruiz said: "Most of my fellow National  Sandinist  Directorate members favor a particular trend, an action that  impairs their fairness in the debate and their objectiveness in  political communication." He also argued: "The new  office-taking strategy requires people's consensus to be on our  side. The strategy demands a new political approach."    "The 1996 victory implies restoring the lost confidence in  the people. This restoration starts right at our homes," he  said in his letter. He added: "Our people's democratic process  demands changes in Sandinism's traditional perception."  <H5>  I Have No Personal Ambitions </H5>   The current FSLN treasurer also said: "The truth is that I  do  not covet power. Such ambitions, even if they are legitimate,  frequently prevent people from assessing the scenario in its  true perspective."    Over the weekend, Daniel Ortega, current FSLN secretary  general, said the fact that several members run for the position  could cause division in the party. In his letter, Ruiz  disagreed with this view: "Such a remark runs against the  variables that encompass the FSLN's modernization."    In addition to expressing his reasons for agreeing to run,  Ruiz assessed the FSLN's situation. Among other things, Ruiz  said that division in the FSLN could be caused, not by a  measured debate, but by "intolerance, inflexibility, fanaticism,  the use of pejorative terms, the negation of criticism as a  method of investigation, and bias as a tool to bend wills."    "Sandinism's present problem is not whether or not leftists,  centrists, or rightists coexist in the FSLN, or whether we are  right on course or have strayed from ideological parameters," he  said.    According to Ruiz, the challenge the FSLN must meet is this:  "To uphold principles and to enforce practical ways to heal the  wounds that war left on our people. To undertake, with all the  forces of the country, the lofty task of raising society's  material foundation to improve people's standard of living." He  also said that his problem has been "to be member of a party  that had a consistent political position in the past but that no  longer has this position."  <H5>  Only One Way Out: Victory </H5>   "Sandinism requires a clear-cut strategy at present. Today's  strategy is defined by the popular consensus as established  through the direct and secret vote at the ballot boxes," Ruiz  said. Therefore, "1996 is decisive for the future of  Sandinism. If we win, Sandinism will survive. There is no  dilemma, only one way out: Victory."    Ruiz sternly warned his fellow party members: "There is no  time to choose a course according to political inclinations. The  Sandinists of today are in the presence of the Sphinx' enigma:  Either we succeed or we are sentenced to oblivion." About the  leadership crisis in his party, Ruiz said: "The current  leadership is in crisis. Today's National Directorate is not  different from the one we knew, from the one I knew. It is not  the one that the lowliest people conceived and became familiar  with. We are surrounded by facts and fantasy."    Ruiz' candidacy has been supported, by among others, deputy  Doris Tijerino, Col Javier Pichardo, retired, and Luis Enrique  Figueroa, FSLN political secretary in Chontales department.</p>

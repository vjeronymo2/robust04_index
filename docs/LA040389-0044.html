			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLO GIVES ARAFAT NEW TITLE: PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Not everyone may be ready to accept it, but as far as the Palestine Liberation  Organization is concerned, it's now President Arafat.  </P> <P> The PLO Executive Committee, meeting throughout the night, voted Sunday morning  in Tunis to elect PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat president of the yet unborn  Palestinian state, whose "independence" was proclaimed at a meeting of the  Palestine National Council last November.  </P> <P> Abdel-Hamid Sayegh, chairman of the council, which serves as the PLO's  parliament in exile, said in Tunis that the vote for Arafat, who ran unopposed,  was unanimous.  </P> <P> The PLO leader, he said, will retain his position and duties as chairman of the  guerrilla organization but will henceforth also be considered president of the  yet-to-be formed Palestinian provisional government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than a Symbol  </P> <P> While Palestinian sources conceded that Arafat's election as head of a still  hypothetical Palestinian state was of little practical consequence at the  moment, they said its significance is still more than merely symbolic.  </P> <P> One aim of the maneuver, they said, was to overcome protocol difficulties  arising from the PNC's decision in November to declare an independent  Palestinian state. The decision implied that this state should be established  in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but left the question of  borders open, pending their negotiation at a U.N.-sponsored peace conference  that the PLO hopes Israel will agree to attend.  </P> <P> More than 100 countries have recognized the Palestinian state and upgraded the  status of the PLO missions in their capitals to embassies. This has created  protocol problems, however, in the absence of a government to appoint the PLO's  new "ambassadors." Palestinian sources said the decision to name Arafat  president was taken to overcome these problems, as well as to make it easier  for the PLO leader to communicate with heads of state on a diplomatically more  equal footing.  </P> <P> The sources said they hope the decision will also help bolster the PLO's claim  to set up an independent state at a time when its diplomatic drive to gain  wider recognition seems to be flagging.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arafat-Mitterrand Talks  </P> <P> Crucial to the efforts to maintain this momentum, begun in December when Arafat  renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist, are the  negotiations that are currently under way for a meeting between Arafat and  French President Francois Mitterrand, the sources added. If that meeting comes  off, it will be Arafat's first with a major Western head of state.  </P> <P> Arab diplomats in Cairo noted that efforts are also under way to try to upgrade  the dialogue that the United States opened with the PLO last December by  arranging a meeting between Arafat and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  The prospects for that meeting are slimmer, however.  </P> <P> The Palestine National Council, when it met in Algiers in November, empowered  the 77-member Central Council to establish a "provisional government" for the  newly declared Palestinian state on paper. But subsequent attempts to do so  have been stymied by differences within the PLO's rival factions over  representation in the government.  </P> <P> These rivalries were apparent at the latest Executive Committee meeting, where  PLO sources said the debate was heated, with two hard-line groups, the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, criticizing Arafat for offering what they consider to  be unacceptable concessions.  </P> <P> The sources said the two groups particularly objected to Arafat's offer, made  last month, to go to Jerusalem to negotiate directly with the Israeli  leadership. The offer was rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,  who refuses to negotiate with the PLO and who said that Arafat would be  arrested and sent to prison as a terrorist if he set foot in Israel.  </P></p>

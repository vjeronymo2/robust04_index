			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Ruhr offers a challenge to Disney Mickey Mouse may be in trouble in the cultural fortress of France, but Bugs Bunny isn't bothered - he is planning to hit the ground running in neighbouring Germany, in the unlikely surroundings of the industrial Ruhr region. Warner Brothers, the US entertainment arm of the Time-Warner media empire, and the Nixdorf family, who made their money from Germany's leading computer company, yesterday announced plans to open a DM350m (Pounds 138m) 'film leisure park' and studio complex at Bottrop, once the heart of a thriving coal mining industry. Now Bugs Bunny, Batman, and the Gremlins, not to mention the stars of Germany's biggest international war film spectacular, The Boat, will seek to bring some good cheer - and jobs  - back to the depressed industrial area. The leisure park will be on a smaller scale than the troubled Euro Disney theme park outside Paris, but it still amounts to Germany's biggest film industry investment ever, according to the delighted state government of North Rhine-Westphalia. The idea is to combine both a leisure park, with roundabouts, shows and a funfair, with a studio complex for both film and television productions, on the lines of Warner Brothers' Movie World complex in Australia. The venture is intended to provide 900 jobs in a region badly hit by the collapse of coal mining. Unemployment at Bottrop alone is 12.3 per cent. Mr Kurt Schmitz, mayor of the town, greeted yesterday's announcement of 'provisional agreement' on the investment with enthusiasm. The North Rhine-Westphalia government, hit by rounds of redundancies in coal mining and steel, has promised big subsidies to promote the project. Money will come from the state's mining industry development fund, says Economics Minister Gunther Einert.</p>

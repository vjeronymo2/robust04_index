			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb -- Russia and Germany may lead the  way in ensuring European and world security. The prospects for  bilateral military and political cooperation reveal such a  possibility, it was stressed today at a meeting between Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and General Klaus Naumann, the  inspector general of the German Bundeswehr.    The Russian Defense Ministry, Grachev said at the meeting,  supports the Partnership for Peace program. However, the  Russian minister noted, there are different approaches to the  implementation of the program. He believes that it is necessary  to develop a mechanism for joining the partnership program.  This requires an intermediate plan that would envisage the  unification of European countries into political unions, with  the CSCE playing the leading role both in the regions and on a  bilateral basis.    The program of Naumann's visit to Russia is an intensive  one.  Tomorrow he will meet Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of  staff for the coordination of military cooperation of the CIS  member-states. During the visit, which ends on 18 February, he  will also have meetings with First Deputy Defense Minister  Andrey Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff  of the Russian Armed Forces. The German guest is to address  students and instructors of the General Staff's military  academy. He will visit troop units stationed on the outskirts  of Moscow, the 27th Guards Division of Russian peace-keeping  forces in the Volga military district, and also Volgograd and  St. Petersburg.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hiroshi Yamazaki of the Political News Department] </F>   [Text] At his speech to the Japanese Diet, ROK President  Kim Yong-sam solemnly suggested "putting an end to the history  of strife between Japan and South Korea." He took an  epoch-making step toward establishing "future-oriented"  relations between the two countries during his visit to Japan.    However, tension is extremely high on the Korean peninsula  over the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected development of nuclear  arms. How to deal with this nuclear issue has become the focal  issue for Japan and the ROK at the moment. The most amount of  time was devoted to this issue during President Kim's summit  meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Kim was  determined to pursue "future-oriented" bilateral relations even  in the face of the serious problem of nuclear arms. In light of  such a stance, Japan has to exert serious efforts toward a new  relationship between the two countries.    A top Foreign Ministry official commented that the Diet  speech "clearly attached importance to future-oriented bilateral  relations, rather than to the nuclear issue."    In his Diet speech, Kim said firmly, "We have to eliminate  completely all ill-feelings in the past. The South Korean  people do not hesitate to set their eyes on the bright future."    According to a Foreign Ministry source, Japanese officials  were very touched by President Kim's remark. They believe "this  is a very welcome statement for Japan." However, it is also  true that "this is the ROK president and government's position.  We still have to see what the South Koreans think," (according  to a top Foreign Ministry official).    The Japanese assessment of this visit is: "Through this  round of talks, we feel that we have climbed one, two, or even  three mountains in the Japan-ROK relations," (according to a  Foreign Ministry source). Therefore, Japan, in turn, has to  take immediate concrete measures to deal with the nuclear issue  and bilateral problems.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Hemingway did drink martinis here - Appetisers When rich and famous, Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, walked the salons at Madrid's Palace Hotel leading an ocelot and surrounded by admirers. Writer Ernest Hemingway drank his famous martinis there and film stars Orson Welles, Ava Gardner and the spy Mata Hari are among the celebrities who have slept, eaten, drunk or made love there during its 80 years. Bullfighters would leave the front door of the Palace dressed in full costume ready for the fray. Belmonte, El Gallo Manolete . . . the great names of the corrida were cheered from its portals. I did not glimpse an ocelot or a matador when visiting earlier this summer but, by way of drab compensation, the hotel was packed with Americans, Japanese and Italians in town for the festival of Madrid's patron saint, San Isidro. It was nearly impossible to get a table in La Cupola, the hotel's Italian restaurant, currently one of the most popular places in town for being seen. Curiously, for such a public venue, it is also where Spanish politicians meet to plot. The atmosphere is refined yet intimate and the impression is of more than lamb chops being cooked up there. The Palace plans to host chefs for four to six-month periods from different areas of Italy to cook with Paco Rubio, the hotel's executive chef. And although it may seem odd to eat Italian food in the Spanish capital, food is available there from almost every country in the world - in addition to every Spanish region. When in Madrid it is usually advisable to order fish - some of the freshest and the best finds its way to the capital - and the poached fillets of sole with a salsa capricciosa were elegantly presented and competently cooked. Milk-fed lamb and veal are especially recommended and desserts include tiramisu, carrot cake with cinnamon ice-cream, apple tart with poppy seeds and blancmange with fresh fruit coulis. The average price of a three-course meal is Pta6,000 (Pounds 30) to Pta6,500, plus tax. If that sounds too high a price then opt for breakfast. Anyone who is anyone can be seen power-broking over the yellow tablecloths between 7.15am and 10am. There are splendid croissants, breads, fruits, cold meats, smoked salmon, and compotes available and two chefs will cook, in the dining room, almost anything to order - even bacon and scrambled eggs. You can enjoy a glass of cava if you can face sparkling wine before 10am in the morning - and, it seems, many can. Breakfast costs from Pta2,150. Information: The Palace Hotel, Plaza de las Cortes, 28014 Madrid, is a member of Leading Hotels of the World. Reservations can be made in the UK by dialling 0800 181 123 toll free. The dowdy, buy-it-once-a-year-for-the-in-laws-at-Christ mas image which sherry has in Britain is in stark contrast to the way it is seen in Spain. Dry fino sherries, served well chilled, are immensely popular with the moneyed Spanish young who appreciate the wine's adaptability, especially with tapas. For a characteristic bone-dry fino, try Lustau's Puerto Fino, around Pounds 7.25 from Gateway, Oddbins or Thresher; or the ever-popular Tio Pepe which is sold for about Pounds 7.50 from most off-licences and supermarkets. An alternative to fino is manzanilla, which is basically the same dry sherry which has been aged near the sea at Sanlucar de Barrameda. To be authentic, manzanilla should have a sea-salt tang coupled with the dryness of green olives. Barbadillo, Pounds 4.99 from branches of Arthur Rackham and The Vintner, is a good example. Amontillado is old fino. As it gets older it gets increasingly nutty in flavour. Naturally, amontillado is bone-dry, dark from age and higher in alcoholic strength than fino. It used to be the tradition to sweeten up amontillados for the British market and Harvey's 1796 is a monument to this old style. If you want to try an uncompromising old amontillado try Valdespino's Coloseo (Lea &amp; Sandeman, 071-376 4767, Pounds 19.95). Anyone looking for something a little less intense might prefer Alcazar from Bobadilla (Pounds 7.25 from Moreno Wines of Paddington 071-723 6897). Olorosos are generally softer than amontillados. Oloroso means fragrant and the wines are marked by a more immediately appealing, sweet, nutty bouquet. A superb unadulterated oloroso is Apostoles from Gonzalez Byass (Pounds 15.99 from Oddbins). The best oloroso I have drunk is the finest dry oloroso vintage 1963 from Gonzalez Byass, which costs a hefty Pounds 65 at Harrods and Selfridges. A bold attempt to bring Madrid chic to a world familiar only with tapas is the restaurant Albero and Grana at 89 Sloane Avenue, London, SW3. (Tel: 071-225 1048/9). Sadly, only the tapas wing of the enterprise seems to flourish and the few diners in the restaurant are obliged to put up with the booming bass of the music from the bar. Albero &amp; Grana is well worth a look, not least for its lasagna of black pudding; olla gitana (stew in the gipsy-style); veal liver and kidney with black olive sauce; and milk-fed lamb. Assume about Pounds 40 a head. Finally, a little book to help you sort out your bocadillos from your platos combinados. The Traveller's Food and Wine Guide to Spain and Portugal, by Christine Boyle and Chris Nawrat, costs Pounds 6.95 from Carbery Press. Tel: 0264-860368.</p>

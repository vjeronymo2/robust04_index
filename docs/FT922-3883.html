			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Williams Holdings taps US institutions WILLIAMS Holdings, the UK industrial group, has raised Dollars 175m long-term debt from a placing of bonds with US investment institutions. The placing is the latest in a series by UK companies keen to tap sources of debt finance away from the syndicated bank credits market. Other companies to have raised funds from US institutions this year include Pilkington, Lucas Industries and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield. Last month, British Aerospace raised Dollars 200m five-year funding from an issue of bonds under SEC rule 144a, which created a hybrid public/private debt market. The rule allows borrowers to place tradeable bonds with recognised investment institutions and exempts them from many of the reporting requirements applied to issuers of public securities. The BAe bonds were priced to yield 104 basis points over US Treasury paper and were placed with a group of more than 20 institutional investors. The issue, made under the issuer's medium-term note programme, was lead-managed by Goldman Sachs. Like most other UK corporations, Williams Holdings opted not to use rule 144a. The group placed bonds privately with seven institutional investors in a deal lead-managed by Wertheim Schroder. The debt is structured in four tranches, with maturities between 10 and 20 years. At the shortest maturity, the paper was priced to yield 110 basis points more than US Treasury paper. The 20-year bonds yield around 145 basis points more than long-dated treasuries. 'We see this as an alternative to equity funding rather than short-term bank debt,' commented Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive. 'This style of long-term funding allows us to plan ahead.' Mr McGowan said the proceeds of the issue would be used for expansion, probably to fund small acquisitions in the US and Canada.</p>

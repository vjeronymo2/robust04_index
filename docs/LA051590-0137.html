			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> INTERACTIVE DATA CREATES TRANSLATION SOFTWARE PROGRAM  </P> <P> Interactive Data Systems, an Irvine software company, said Monday that it has  created a software program that translates proprietary programs run on  computers made by MAI Basic Four into a standard language compatible with most  business computers.  </P> <P> Bill Tsumpes, president of Interactive Data, said the company's new software  translates Business Basic software, which runs on MAI's business-oriented  minicomputers, to the "C" language that can run on Unix-based computers.  </P> <P> "The beneficiary is the Business Basic user because it allows him to use MAI's  software on computers made by other manufacturers," Tsumpes said. "This gives  flexibility to users" by making MAI systems compatible with software programs  written in languages other than Business Basic.  </P> <P> Interactive Data, founded in 1984, has 11 employees and reported $2 million in  sales in 1989. Officials of MAI Basic Four of Tustin did not return calls for  comment.  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (1): A bewildering variety of options - Corporate data processing is going through some of the most radical changes since electronic computers were first used in business in the 1950s The confusion and uncertainty which has characterised the computer industry over the past five years is mirrored among its customers. There has never been a greater need for sound consultancy and advice as technological advances provide a bewildering variety of options for companies looking for greater economies and better information. At the same time, a new and technologically-aware cadre of managers is beginning to make its presence felt in many companies. According to the Price Waterhouse Information Technology Review, which monitors change in the data processing business: 'The good news is that the days when IT directors joined the board for a title and little else may be gone. They are now in the inner sanctum of policy makers. . . It is the rumoured convergence of the IT director and the chief executive officer that is the really exciting idea'. Well, perhaps. The fact remains that corporate data processing is going through some of the most radical changes since electronic computers were first used in business in the 1950s. To some extent this is the result of developments in computer technology which are making possible new ways of doing business. But it is also a consequence of a disaffection among customers with the high-handed attitude during the 1980s of computer manufacturers who attempted to dictate data processing strategies to their customers. As a consequence, data processing was one of the first capital spending areas to be cut back when recession hit both in the US and Europe. International Data Corporation, the business consultancy says: 'Both corporate results and market trends confirm that 1993 was the worst year in the history of information technology in Europe, with a growth of only 2 per cent following five consecutive years of decline.' It adds: 'The information technology business is starting to bottom out from this negative cycle with signs that recovery is finally on its way.' IDC estimates that growth across Europe is likely to be about 4 per cent this year. What sort of data processing business is likely to emerge, however? The apparent recovery begs a number of important questions. First, are suppliers of data processing equipment truly listening to their customers' requirements or are they still intent merely on selling the latest technology, relevant or not? The shift from mainframes to networks of personal computers and mid-range computers (client-server systems) is a case in point. The basic proposition is simple: because microprocessor-based, distributed systems cost less than central mainframes it makes economic sense to move from mainframes to client server networks. A result has been a steady decline in mainframe revenues which has hurt all the large computer manufacturers while generating business for PC and workstation makers. According to an Economist research report: 'An extraordinary feature of the recession of the early 1990s has been the propensity for European customers to keep buying (personal) computers. There have been cut-backs, budget freezes and huge numbers of bankruptcies and redundancies yet the PC market has grown by 12.5 per cent in units terms in 1992 and by around 14 per cent in 1993. Projections for 1994 are that demand will continued to rise and that unit growth could increase by more than 20 per cent on 1993.' But purchase of machinery does not automatically translate into savings. An important point is that client-server computing is different in kind to traditional data processing. It seeks to spread computing power throughout the organisation, giving a broader range of personnel access to information and processing power. One indication of this is the way the expression 'executive information system'  - a way of extracting and consolidating essential information from a company's database  - has fallen into disuse. Today, the aim is to provide the appropriate information to people at all levels in a company. There is a cost associated with all this. According to the Gartner Group, which assesses business data processing strategies, client server systems are expensive and labour consuming. For a hypothetical large organisation it estimated a total cost of ownership over five years at Dollars 241.8m of which less than 20 per cent was the cost of hardware. An analysis published by International Business Machines, which has a vested interest in mainframe sales, suggests that the cost per user per year of a PC network is Dollars 6,445 while the comparable cost for a mainframe user is only Dollars 2,282. It goes on to suggest the average cost per transaction for a PC network is 43 cents but only three cents for a mainframe-based system. What cannot yet be factored into the equation is the business benefits of either approach. In general, client-server computing would seem to offer greater flexibility and applicability than mainframe systems but it is still in an early state in its development. The pros and cons of moving to client-server computing need to be weighed carefully. A second question concerns business process re-engineering (BPR), an essentially simple idea which has established itself quickly in the canon of management jargon. BPR involves changing the way a company carries out its business operations to make them more effective rather than automating what already exists. It is a little like redesigning an aircraft in flight. Great skill is required to prevent a crash before the process is complete. Nevertheless, a majority of the world's largest companies claim to be re-engineering all or part of their business as they move from the large, centralised operations with hierarchical chains of command focused on products which were typical of the 1980s to dispersed partnerships conferring local autonomy on their managers with a sensitivity to consumer requirements. The Price Waterhouse review notes that there are now two distinct types of BPR. First, where a business process is transformed, but the business remains the same. It gives as an example a chemicals company which eliminated 42 kinds of invoice and its order office by switching to electronic data interchange. Second, where the business itself is transformed with new objectives and a new organisational structure. A building society, for example, reconstituted its branches as customer service centres staffed by salespeople with automated cash machines for deposit and dispensing. The key is that technology is used to implement change rather than the other way about. Mr Thomas Davenport of Ernst &amp; Young in his book Process Innovation makes the need for continuous development plain: 'A company that does not institute continuous improvement after implementing process innovation is likely to revert to old ways of doing business'. A third question about the new data processing environment concerns outsourcing. Many large companies are beginning to treat data processing as if it were a commodity such as gas or electricity, contracting with a third party for its supply at an agreed service level for an agreed price. The UK government's 'market testing' programme for services including tax and vehicle registration has highlighted what is for many companies a controversial area. Outsourcing can be seen alternatively as giving away the company's crown jewels or giving up a non-core activity. The key is the quality of the deal. Business Intelligence, a marketing consultancy, noted earlier this year that many companies have been tempted by substantial apparent cost savings into poorly thought out contracts that may cost them more than maintaining their data processing in-house. This survey deals in depth with these and other issues vital to companies as they move into the new era of business data processing. The indications are that they must remain on their guard. Suppliers may pay lip service to customer power but may have little intention of letting them exercise it.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS  </P> <P> For years I have been reading how our environmentalists have been prodding  Brazil and other Third World countries to save the rain forests because of the  damaging effect this destruction would have on global climate, to say nothing  of air for breathing.  </P> <P> Yet we have a constant battle to preserve our national parks, as well as our  coastlines (regarding oil) from exploitation.  </P> <P> Isn't our country strong enough to afford these "luxuries?" What are we going  to leave for our descendants? Bare bones and ravaged earth?  </P> <P> And if we are ever in such desperate straits that we're forced to use them,  they will still be there. If we use them up now, what then?  </P> <P> If lumber companies want trees, why do they not plant them? If they had done  this in the past, there would have been plenty available. And it is not too  late to start now. (Apologies to any company which has been doing this.)  </P> <P> SAM BARON  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

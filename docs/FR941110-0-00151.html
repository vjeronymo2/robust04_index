			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter indicated that States should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to develop and implement additional or alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies unless HCFA can demonstrate that the States'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies are not as effective as the HCFA remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We cannot adopt this comment. The Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides, at section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii), that the State must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative or additional remedies it proposes are as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance as those included in the Act. To shift the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden of proof to HCFA would be contrary to the Act's clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter indicated that any State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies approved as alternative or additional remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should apply to SNF/NFs as well as NFs, unless HCFA takes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different action based on a validation survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination of whose remedies prevail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a dually participating facility is made in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act and codified at &sect;488.452  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter indicated that the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should clarify and refer to the relationship of these rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the sanctions available under section 1128 of the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to how the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) actions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an impact on enforcement actions taken under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of sections 1819(h) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h) of the Act, for which HCFA takes action, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of section 1128 of the Act, for which the OIG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes action, are two independent sources of enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority that are triggered by separate considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1128 of the Act contains mandatory and permissive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusions which are, for the most part, applied in cases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and entities who have been charged with or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convicted of certain types of behavior (such as fraud and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuse, and obstruction of investigation) under Federal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State law. Section 1128 does not generally apply to cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of facility noncompliance, which are covered under sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819 and 1919 of the Act that specify survey and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions. Section 1128A is cited in sections 1819 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919 to give guidance on the imposition of civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties which will be imposed in accordance with common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory provisions by HCFA and OIG for their respective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes. If a case happens to involve both noncompliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fraud, abuse or obstruction of investigation, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has the authority to take separate action,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independently of the other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters from several States indicated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their States had effective remedies that should be adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without change. One commenter stated that HCFA approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative or additional remedies should not be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act gives the States the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting that HCFA authorize the adoption of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State remedies. The regulation follows the Act, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leaves the decision to request the adoption of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies up to each State. However, the Act provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA approval is necessary and that the State must bear the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden of proof that any alternative or additional remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are as effective as the remedies specified in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's ability to impose alternative remedies instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination was impaired by the proposed provision that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require the repayment of the Federal share of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid payment (FFP) if the correction of the deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not made in accordance with the approved plan and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timetable. These commenters said that the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should allow States to enter into agreements under which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would agree to repay States, which would then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repay the Federal government FFP if compliance was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved according to the approved plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neither the Act nor the proposed or final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations prevent the States from entering into agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with facilities to repay States if the facility fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhere to its plan of correction. The Act is silent on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. Therefore, it follows that the States have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option to consider such agreements with facilities. Many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities may find such agreements preferable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Professor Le Dien Hong, deputy chairman of the  National Committee for Preventing HIV/AIDS, reported that during  the first three months of 1994, a total of 197 HIV cases were  discovered. During the same period, 46 were admitted as AIDS  patients and 14 died.    Thus far, the number of HIV cases in Vietnam has reached  1,321, among them 1,242 Vietnamese in 29 provinces and  municipalities. Professor Le Dien Hong said, however, that the  number of HIV infected persons in Vietnam is dramatically higher  than the number made public. This is because we have not  conducted surveys on certain groups of people such as  prostitutes and drug addicts who are vulnerable to HIV.</p>

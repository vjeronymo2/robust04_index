			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- China's only maritime  signal satellite ground station passed acceptance tests today.  Its successful establishment has filled another blank in  China's high- technology field.    It has been learned that during its trial operation, the  station connected for various mobile consumers nearly 200,000  domestic phone (including fax) calls and telexes, and nearly  100,000 international calls.    The maritime signal satellite ground station is a link  between the satellite and the ground via telecommunications  systems. The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station  can provide telecommunications links between mobile  telecommunications systems users in the Pacific and Indian  Oceans and users of stationary equipment on land, and supply  reliable and mobile satellite telecommunications services to  users at sea and on land.    The construction project of the maritime signal satellite  ground station was completed in two phases. The first phase's  station type-A can provide telecommunications links between  mobile telecommunications systems users at sea and on land  whereby they can exchange phone calls, telexes, facsimiles, and  data. At present, most of China's oceangoing vessels have been  equiped with terminal facilities. Once certain buttons are  pressed during a shipwreck, distress signals will be transmitted  directly via the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground  Station to China's maritime search and rescue centers. Such a  connection has provided a safe and reliable guarantee for  vessels in distress. Mobile terminal systems on land can  provide mobile users with convenient services for remote border  areas, news coverage, and geological exploration. The second  phase's station type-C, smaller in size than station type-A, can  provide global telecommunications services relaying messages and  data, including weather reports and stock quotations. It also  has stronger signals. It is favorably termed as a "mobile  office."    The Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite Ground Station was  built by the Ministry of Communications with loans from the  Norwegian Government. According to Wang Jialin [3769 1367  7792], deputy director of the Beijing Maritime Signal Satellite  Ground Station, the station has plans to develop future digital  systems types-B and M.</p>

If this assessment is right, when drawing up  macroeconomic policies, we will have to act on the principle of  seizing opportunities for a great leap in reform and  development, while avoiding too sharp risks.    We say that China now has better opportunities than other  countries because 15 years of reform and development have  established certain economic-system, material, and technological  grounds for much future development, enabling the current  bursting forth of the long-suppressed potential vitality of our  ancient civilization. In particular, the long-awaited reform  assault decided on by the 14th CPC Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has made it  possible for the Chinese economy, through market economy  development and operation, to overcome certain deeper conflicts  still troubling it. If the program of the 14th CPC Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee is  implemented successfully, the Chinese economy will be able in  the near future to get onto a path of sustained, valid, and  rapid growth.    But our path to an economic takeoff and a new upsurge will  not be smooth. While the change in tactics as a refuge from  past storms that we have adopted through reform in the past  dozen or so years had its positive aspects, it has also left  blind spots in certain crucial sectors of our national economy,  accumulating a number of deeprooted conflicts that are  obstructing the smooth progress of reform and development.    In particular, the two conflicts of inflation and the lack  of  vitality of state enterprises, not only are causing many public  complaints but, if not dealt with promptly, could easily affect  our economic and social stability.    Faced with this situation, some economists are advocating  the  adoption of tactics that could be called "curbing recession with  inflation." They say that while inflation is harmful, the losses  created by currency devaluation are the same for everyone and,  while everyone will complain about them, noone will be  particularly discontented, nor will anyone take the lead in  making trouble about them. But recession differs in that if  factories operate under capacity, causing lower wages or  unemployment, it will be hard to avoid a negative impact on  social stability. So they favor the adoption of a "loose"  monetary policy, by providing plenty of funds and market demands  to state enterprises that are now in trouble, to maintain their  operations and worker employment. But while those in favor of an  expansionary monetary policy based on protection of state  enterprises argue it plausibly and at length, it is certainly  hard for me to agree with such an argument for the following  reasons: 1) It is wrong to say that inflation does not have  severe social consequences. While overall price rises certainly  create the same devaluation losses for every yuan of money, the  harm they cause to various individuals is absolutely different.  In an inflationary state, commerce is better than industry,  with hoarding and profiteering in turn being better than  commerce. The group most negatively affected is the  wage-earning and salaried strata, while profiteers on the other  hand can fish in the troubled waters to get very rich by foul  means. These not only are facts that we all know, but even  more so are history that we of this generation have experienced  personally. 2) Using monetary expansion to alleviate the  difficulties of state enterprises is like drinking poison to  quench one's thirst. While the current difficult plight of  state enterprises has many causes, the main one is system  factors. The only way to ensure that they essentially overcome  these difficulties to recover their glory is by determining to  reform our enterprise system and overall economic climate.  While enterprises of course need help out of their immediate  difficulties, if they need subsidized relief, then it should  come through "open subsidies," not the "large-scale irrigation"  method of universally providing low-interest loans (actually  negative-interest loans). This is because that can only lower  fund-use efficiency, forming a vicious cycle of inflation--lower  efficiency--worse inflation, even evolving into a difficult and  complicated case of macroeconomic inflation coexisting with  microeconomic enterprise recession. 3) The theoretical grounds  of the abovementioned policy proposal, the theory that low  unemployment can be maintained only at the cost of high  inflation, have long since been debunked by Western economics as  a misapplication of the "Phillips curve." All modern economics  textbooks say that even based on the Phillips theory of a  negative correlation between unemployment and inflation, a  society's unemployment depends not only on inflation, but even  more importantly on its place in the Phillips curve. In some  economies, the maintenance of zero inflation comes only at the  cost of very high unemployment, while in others, zero inflation  is not accompanied by too high unemployment, which is absolutely  possible to keep within socially sustainable limits. So  Western economists seem to have learned a lesson from the  disastrous effect of "stagnant expansion" caused by the use of a  macroeconomic policy of displacing unemployment with inflation.  Noone any more regards an inflationary policy as a panacea for  curing recession and unemployment, seeking rather for remedies  in areas such as promoting technical advances, optimizing  economic structures, enhancing competitive capability, and  paying attention to human resources development. As to China,  in addition to striving to upgrade our own modern economics  knowledge, we had best assimilate certain lessons from the  ultimate consequences of the 1987 plan to ease difficulties by  the "flooding-of-the-pump method."    In light of this, our current strategy should be to reassert  the consensus reached in mid-1992, that to overcome immediate  difficulties and avoid greater risks, the basic way is through  reform. In this respect, a currently very popular viewpoint  seems to be wrong. This viewpoint sums up the cause of the  severe inflation danger as the many reform measures taking  effect in 1994, correspondingly holding that a valid means to  prevent severe inflation is to slow reform. This viewpoint is  wrong primarily because it does not conform to the facts. We  know that there is a 10-month process of inflationary pressures  from excess monetary accumulation to release through price  rises. Once inflationary pressures begin to be released, they  accelerate steadily. China's current round of inflationary  pressures has accumulated in the course of our early-1990 reform  delay and growth acceleration. These pressures began to be  released in the last half of 1992, being somewhat eased through  the tighter macroeconomic control of July and August 1993, but  then reaccelerating due to the loosened monetary policy of  September through November 1993. Market economoy operating  principles tell us that the direct cause of inflation, or  steadily rising overall prices, is invariably an excess money  supply causing an imbalance between overall supply and demand.  Without this condition, rising prices for any particular  commodity cannot cause a steady rise in overall prices. But with  it, certain reasons (such as tax rate adjustments and interest  rate changes) can always be found to raise prices. Moreover,  as prices have been essentially deregulated, even without  excuses, sellers' higher prices can always be accepted by some  buyers. So the attempt to slow reform to curb inflation and  ease enterprise difficulties basically cannot achieve its  objectives. On the contrary, as China's economic inflationary  pressures and enterprise difficulties are created essentially by  lagging reform in crucial sectors and the coexistence of dual  systems, adopting such a roundabout method to overcome  difficulties could result only in just the opposite of what we  wished.    The basic thinking of the "Resolution" by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on proceeding with  overall reform in all areas was right. While the application  plans for reforms in all areas drawn up in the spirit of this  programmatic document still contain certain flaws and loopholes,  they are still generally right. The current issue is whether  these reform measures can be genuinely implemented.    Organizing the implementation of such major reform actions  in  1994 will be a very difficult task.    On one hand, as our economic system is an overall system,  with mutual ties and restraints among its various systems and  system links, all reform actions need to be closely coordinated.    Particularly in launching such a large-scale  reform-offensive  campaign as in 1994, coordination among all front armies will be  decisive. For whatever reason, if the actions of a front army  or even a small platoon are obstructed, so that it cannot reach  its scheduled position at the designated time, this will check  the actions of other units, even causing the whole campaign to  fail. As to the reforms that are taking effect in 1994 in  areas, such as tax revenue, banking, foreign exchange,  enterprises, and social security system, in whatever aspect or  link that does not keep pace, the economic system cannot work  effectively in that area. If reform does not occur in one  area, the whole market economy system cannot operate  effectively. Taking banking reform for instance, its basic  substance is to upgrade our investment system on planned economy  terms to a financing system in a market economy, including  items, such as making sound central bank functions,  commercializing specialized banks, establishing financing  markets, marketizing deposit and loan interest rates, and  setting up a policy financing agency. If only one of these  reforms does not occur, none of the others can achieve the  expected results. For instance, while various new financial  institutions have been established in line with banking-reform  application plans, as long as deposit and loan interest rates  remain under hard regulation by administrative organs, retaining  the low and even negative interest rates on planned economy  terms, the newly established financial institutions may be  called "commercial banks," but can only be old wine in new  bottles, meaning that the effort was in vain. This is because  artificially prescribed low-rate terms can mean only an open or  covert rationing system, not commodity circulation through free  market exchange. This is an unchangeable rule. With man-made  maintenance of real negative-interest rates for bank loans,  funds can be distributed only with certain administrative  authority. At which time, if the planned investment system has  been abolished, things can turn even worse. This is because on  planned-economy terms, administrative fund distribution has to  occur in principle through certain plans formulated to achieve  balance while, with neither money markets or investment  planning, all is dependent merely on "patting the heads" of the  administrative officials who make the examination and approval  decisions. When the public financing system cannot work  effectively, this makes it hard for all reforms in other areas  to succeed, as well as having a severe impact on economic  operations, including normal enterprise operations.    On the other hand, as there are so many uncertain factors in  economic activities, we need to pay close attention to the  development of events, responding promptly to changing  circumstances. Especially when carrying out such a reform  offensive as in 1994, as there are not precedents to follow, we  can neither require all measures to to be designed flawlessly in  advance, or expect their execution to be exactly right or  perfectly done. Moreover, in the course of implementing  predetermined measures, misunderstandings or conflicts of  interests may produce deformities and distortions. And when  there are new situations, issues, and flaws that had not been  considered in advance, there is even more need for prompt  adoption of forceful emergency steps to resolve them.    All of this shows that the key to seizing opportunities and  avoiding risks is earnestly implementing all reform measures  that have been put into effect. In this respect, firm command,  oversight, and coordination are the most decisive factors. If  this is done well, our overall reforms will have won their first  victory, laying real ground for the smooth growth of the Chinese  economy.</p>

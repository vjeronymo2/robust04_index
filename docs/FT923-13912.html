			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Saudi bank ordered to close US branch FEDERAL US banking author-ities have accused the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia of violating 'significant provisions' of US banking laws. The bank, which is Saudi Arabia's biggest and has members of the Saudi ruling family among its customers, has been ordered to shut its New York branch within 30 days. The order comes two months after NCB closed its London branch 'in an effort to rationalise operations and cut costs' following consultations with the Bank of England. The Bank of England has declined to comment on the circumstances of the London closure. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal bank regulatory agency, said it acted in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Board, which has filed charges against Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, who resigned this week as NCB's chief operating officer. Sheikh Khalid was indicted last week in New York on charges of having schemed to defraud investors and depositors in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International of more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m). In Jeddah, the NCB said it was 'greatly surprised' by the Fed and OCC actions and denied 'in the strongest terms all charges as being devoid of any substance'. NCB claimed 'the curious timing of the announcements clearly indicates they were the result of political pressure' following last week's indictments in New York. A federal judge in New York yesterday ordered the US assets of Sheikh Khalid to be frozen after it was disclosed that the Federal Reserve had levied a Dollars 170m fine against the Saudi banker and a Dollars 6m fine against Mr Haroon Kahlon, an associate also indicted last week. In its enforcement order, the Fed alleged that Sheikh Khalid, with the assistance of Mr Kahlon and through the facilities of NCB, violated US law by acquiring control of 28.7 per cent of the shares of the parent company of First American Bank of Washington without first obtaining Fed approval. NCB denied the charge, saying it never bought the shares. First American is one of four US banks that was secretly and illegally acquired by shareholders accused by the Fed of being front men acting for BCCI. The OCC said it viewed the allegations pertaining to NCB and Sheikh Khalid to be 'extremely serious'. The federal agency said: 'NCB is alleged to have violated significant provisions of the federal banking laws applicable to federal branches and their parent foreign banks.' The OCC said NCB's New York branch had 'not supplied current and accurate financial statements regarding the condition of its parent', raising serious questions about the operations and liquidity of the branch. Sheikh Khalid yesterday termed the Federal Reserve Board charges 'unwarranted and ill-advised'. Mark Nicholson in London adds: The bank yesterday also denied reports that its sale earlier this week of very large quantities of silver - a sale bullion traders reckoned to be as much as 50m ounces, but which NCB says was less than 20m - was related in any way to the resignation of Sheikh Khalid or the charges against him.

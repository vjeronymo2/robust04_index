			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROM THE SYNAGOGUE TO A 'CRUSH' THAT TURNED WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE INTO AN  OBSESSION  </P> <P> What's a nice Jewish boy like Ben Donenberg doing with a crush on William  Shakespeare?  </P> <P> "Shakespeare is my obsession," admits the actor-turned-entrepreneur. "I don't  care if he really existed or not; I just love his plays." Under Donenberg's  artistic directorship, Shakespeare Festival/LA has set out to spread that  sentiment throughout Los Angeles; this weekend it launches a fifth season of  free performances beginning at Hollywood's John Anson Ford Amphitheater  (through July 14), followed by a July 18 to 28 run at Citicorp Plaza downtown.  </P> <P> "It started around eight years ago," recalled Donenberg, 33, who trained as an  actor at Juilliard. "I was playing a valet in 'Amadeus' on Broadway, and after  about four months of moving furniture, I started needing a creative outlet."  The idea of a community theater company was still bubbling in 1983 when he  moved to Los Angeles to pursue a master's degree in philosophy at USC.  </P> <P> "I was looking back at the Greeks -- 2,500 years ago, when Athens was a lot  like Los Angeles," he said. "All the fields were just starting to develop --  business, commerce, art, mathematics -- and I think as people began to  individuate themselves in these pursuits, they looked for ways to connect, to  create community: 'Although we have different interests, we're still alike.'  That's what the original Greek theater festivals must have been like: free,  outdoors, and everybody attended."  </P> <P> For Donenberg (whose space-age spoof "Starship Shakespeare" was a 1985 hit at  Al's Bar downtown), that sense of community began in his native Skokie, Ill.  </P> <P> "I hung out a lot at the synagogue as a child," he said. "My father died when I  was very young, so becoming religious, was, I guess, a way of repairing the  damage. I used to sit in the synagogue listening to the rabbi give his sermons  and think, 'This is great.' But even though it was a noble thing -- to raise  people's ethical and moral way of living -- there's a whole world out there  that isn't Jewish; there should be a way of doing it that cuts across  religion."  </P> <P> The step into theater was a short one. "I was in the Hebrew school plays; I  played Queen Esther with a wig on," he said with a chuckle, remembering an  all-male production. "One time, we were given an extra credit assignment if we  watched Olivier's 'Hamlet' on TV and wrote a report about it. I didn't  understand much except that Hamlet's father died and came back as a ghost. I  said, 'Hey, I can identify with that.' "  </P> <P> Although he pursued acting steadily (including two summers at the National  Shakespeare Conservatory in Woodstock, N.Y.), "It gradually became apparent to  me that, although I had talent, the world didn't really need another great  actor. What it needed was more people to create playgrounds for them to play  in." Intuitively, he turned to Ira Gershwin's widow (for whom he'd been editing  George and Ira's scrapbooks) and asked for her help in starting a community  Shakespeare festival.  </P> <P> "It was like a Cinderella story," he said happily. Recalling that Citicorp had  sponsored New York's Shakespeare in the Park, he picked up the phone book and  called Citicorp. "I said, 'I have a little bit of help from Mrs. Gershwin, will  you help?' and they said, 'Sure.' You know how people scramble around to raise  money? Citicorp said, 'Come in right now, we want to talk to you.' They were  new in town and wanted something they could be identified with -- and they've  been a major funder ever since."  </P> <P> Donenberg's first festival site was Pershing Square in the heart of downtown.  At his urging, the Community Redevelopment Agency got on board -- as did Actors  Equity, with whom he negotiated special contracts for his players, "because I  don't think anybody should work for free." Shakespeare Festival/LA now also  boasts a full-time, 14-member board of directors, additional corporate  sponsorship and a new educational program for children.  </P> <P> This year, "Shakespearience!" has traveled to elementary schools with a puppet  adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." "We also send out a dance instructor  who teaches the kids the Elizabethan Washerwoman's Brawl -- expose them to  music and dance, costumes, Shakespeare's words. An actor pretends he's  Shakespeare and talks about what it was like to live then."  </P> <P> This summer, the main stage fare is "Much Ado About Nothing," a comedy, said  the show's director Kevin Kelley, "that's very much about appearances -- very  appropriate today in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Many of the plots in the play have to do with the danger of denying true  feelings for appearance's sake," added Kelley, who believes that "Much Ado's"  inherent seriousness is often overlooked. "People wear masks of wit, social  decorum, egotism. It's also about the privileged segments of society and the  quality of language." He has set the play on a tony American island retreat in  1932, and scored it with jazz of the day.  </P> <P> Despite quality production values and professional actors, all plays are  presented free. (Attendees are asked to bring a can of non-perishable goods for  the needy; last year, a matching gift from Vons netted $40,000 worth of donated  foodstuff.) "We want to be accessible and available to whoever wants to  attend," Donenberg says.  </P> <P> Proud though he is of the rapid rise of the Festival (no relation to the  now-defunct L.A. Free Shakespeare Festival), Donenberg is still hustling for  bigger and better. He's negotiating with USC for its 1,600-seat Embassy Theatre  downtown; just this year, he began drawing a regular paycheck. All that  activity leaves little time for a personal life. Even mom has stopped praying  for him to find the perfect wife: "At this point, she says, 'Will you just find  someone, please?"  </P> <P> "Establishing a theatrical tradition is very difficult," he acknowledged. "It  is an uphill battle. The paper work is oppressive; we're understaffed,  overworked. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing -- really. It's more like I'm  trading off. The trade-off is personal comforts for the feeling that comes from  knowing you've helped culturally enrich your community, created a place where  people from all walks of life can sit and breathe and laugh and cry together.  When you see the reward, it's always worth it."  </P> <P>  "Much Ado About Nothing" plays at 7:30 tonight, Friday and Saturday at the  John Anson Ford Amphitheater, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East in Hollywood, and at  Citicorp Plaza, 725 S. Figueroa Ave., at 6:45 p.m. July 18 to 28 (free  parking). In lieu of an admission charge, donations of canned food for the  needy will be accepted. General admission tickets are available at all Music  Plus outlets and Ticketmaster locations in May Co. department stores. For  membership information: (213) 489-1121.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Flow of Western Weapons Does Not Serve the </F> Peace Process"]    [Text] Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign and  commonwealth affairs, has justified the British Government's  decision to lift the arms embargo of Israel as a result of the  encouraging developments in the peace process. To hide the  reality of its bias toward Israel in making this decision, Hurd  suggested that Britain is ready to reconsider the arms embargo  the European Union has imposed on Syria, but only if the  Syrian-Israeli negotiations make progress.    The British decision is strange in more ways than one. It is  clearly biased toward Israel, since it provides that country  with the chance to stockpile more weapons within the framework  of what is called qualitative military superiority, which the  West in general and the United States in particular have tried  to secure for Israel over the years in confronting the Arab  World. It is also strange because this decision is wrapped in  the slogan of peace. Everyone knows that weapons are the exact  opposite of true peace and that any progress toward peace  requires a real decrease in armaments and strict supervision of  the weapons in the region. These topics are supposed to be  handled by the multilateral armament supervision committee,  which came out of the Madrid conference.    In fact, the British decision was not the only one that  contradicts the spirit and goals of the peace process in the  region. Since the convention of the Madrid peace conference, the  United States has provided Israel with many guarantees that it  will enable that country to continue its military superiority  and will continue to provide it with huge military aid. France  also agreed with Israel recently to terminate the freeze on  military cooperation between the two sides.    Thus, at a time when the West is hoisting the banner of  bolstering the peace process in the region, in practice it is  bolstering Israel's military power, which contradicts the  objectives of the peace process and the roles the United States  and Europe are supposed to play. This also strengthens the  existing doubts that the talk about peace is contrary to real  intentions. Who needs weapons during the age of peace? Who  will these arms be directed against?    The essential question posed to Britain and other countries  that are hastening to change their previous stances that were  based on the major causes of the conflict, foremost of which is  the Israeli occupation, is: Has the Israeli occupation of  Palestinian and Arab territories ended? And does taking new  stances really contribute toward ending this occupation and  eliminating the reasons for the Arab-Israeli conflict, or are  they a new contribution by the West to strengthen Israel's  adherence to the stances that it still proposes to this day and  that are the major obstacles to a just peace?</p>

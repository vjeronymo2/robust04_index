			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Colgate to pay Dollars 670m for US toiletries manufacturer COLGATE-PALMOLIVE, the large US household products company, is to buy Mennen Company, a privately-owned personal care products manufacturer, for around Dollars 670m. News of the deal came as Colgate unveiled after-tax profits of Dollars 124.9m for the year. This compares with Dollars 321m in 1990, but the 1991 total was struck after a Dollars 243m restructuring charge in the third quarter. Mennen is based in New Jersey and involved in the US deodorant and anti-perspirant market, where its sells under the Mennen Speed Stick, Mennen Lady Speedstick and Mennen Teen Spirit brand names. It also makes baby products - under the Baby Magic name - and men's toiletries. In addition, the company sells in the Latin American and European markets, and its total annual turnover is said to be in excess of Dollars 550m. No profit figures were disclosed. Colgate, which maintains that the Mennen product lines should complete its personal care products - which range from toothpaste to soaps - will meet around 80 per cent of the purchase price in stock and the remainder in cash. In the final quarter of 1991, Colgate saw sales rise from Dollars 1.48bn to Dollars 1.57bn, with after-tax earnings advancing from Dollars 73.5m to Dollars 86.9m. Colgate said Mennen's share of the US deodorant market was about 16 per cent, making it a market leader. Of the total Dollars 550m-plus sales, around Dollars 275m derived from the US. However, the purchaser stressed that it was Mennen's exposure to less developed markets outside the US, particularly in Latin America, that made it especially attractive. For the year overall, Colgate sales rose from Dollars 5.69bn to Dollars 6.06bn, with annual volume growth reaching 5 per cent. The company said that, with the third-quarter restructuring charge omitted, profits showed a 15 per cent increase. Colgate shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48.</p>

We are making this change because we have determined that certain dry-cured pork products, if processed in accordance with the regulatory requirements, can be imported into the United States without presenting a significant risk of introducing these specified diseases. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  December 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. John H.

We received four comments by that date. They were from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Nutrition of the Kingdom of Spain, a Spanish meat exporters association, and two organizations representing U.S. meat industries. We carefully considered all the comments we received. These comments are discussed below in detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the comments, APHIS is making several changes to the proposed requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposal would have amended various paragraphs of &sect;94.17 by adding the term ``dry-cured'' before ``ham'' or ``hams.'' The term ``dry cured'' was incorrectly added in several places where the hams referred to would not yet have finished the curing process. The term ``dry cured'' should not be added before ``ham'' or ``hams'' in &sect;94.17, paragraphs (a) through (g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree, and are making the suggested change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the current regulations, &sect;94.17(a) requires that hams subject to the regulations must come from ``a swine that was never out of the country in which the ham was processed.'' Because the proposal did not propose to amend this country of origin requirement, only hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins that originated in the country in which they were processed would be eligible to be imported under the proposed regulations. For example, products processed in accordance with the regulations in Spain could not be imported if they were derived from swine from other countries. However, the proposed processing would render the articles safe to import regardless of the country in which the swine originated. Paragraph (a) of &sect;94.17 should be amended to allow hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins derived from swine from any country to be eligible for importation, if the products are processed in accordance with the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

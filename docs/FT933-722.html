			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / College leavers find work prospects still gloomy ONLY a third of students funded by Lancashire County Council who left university or college last year have found jobs related to the subjects they studied, and one in eight were still unemployed after nearly a year. Most who found jobs went into large public-sector organisations such as schools, colleges, the health service, the Civil Service and councils. Few employers were small or medium-sized companies, a survey of people who received student grants from Lancashire and sat final examinations in 1991 and 1992 has found. The students went to universities or colleges throughout Britain. Unemployment was 7.5 per cent among those who qualified in 1991. Holders of Higher National Diplomas were almost twice as likely to be unemployed as those with bachelor degrees. A quarter of final-year students in 1992 went back to full-time study, many to enhance qualifications and improve job prospects after failing to find work. Upgrading HNDs to bachelor degrees was common. The survey by East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council analysed responses from 4,118 people - 39 per cent of those who received funding for their higher education from the county council. Those who graduated in medicine, science, law and business administration found work fastest. Unemployment was highest among those who took art and design, mass communications, construction or the humanities. Students with first-class honours were four times less likely to be unemployed than those with thirds. Job chances were poorest for mature students and those from ethnic minorities. Personal and family contacts were important for finding work, the survey indicated, so that those from more affluent districts tended to do better because of parental networks.</p>

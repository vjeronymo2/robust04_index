			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday [28 April]  proposed that a new peace agreement be made with the U.S. to  replace a 40-year old armistice agreement.    The proposal was declared by Pak Kil-yon, DPRK permanent  representative to the UN, when reading out an official statement  of the DPRK Foreign Ministry.    The statement said the recent move by the U.S. to ship  "Patriot" missiles and a squadron of "Apache" helicopters  constitute severe violation of the Korean armistice, which  required non-introduction of any operational material from  abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean peninsula.    "Now that they have failed to live up to their  responsibility  for stabilizing the situation on the Korean peninsula and  curbing military buildup there and they have been used for  covering up the United States' policy of strangling DPRK," the  statement said, "there is an absolute necessity for establishing  a peace arrangment."    The statement added that such a new agreement could "prevent  arms buildup or recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and  reliably guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean  peninsula on a practical basis." It called on the UN to respond  to the proposal.</p>

The  elegant, one-story eatery may be bulldozed to make way for a high-rise  building. . . . Longtime wine steward John (Hans) Stahler is working on a  history of the restaurant, whose regular patrons included Robert Schuller, John  Wayne and Carl N. Karcher. . . . The restaurant's motto is "One of the great  restaurants of the Western World." David Reyes and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / French stance 'could sink Gatt talks' LEADING trade negotiators expressed concern in Geneva yesterday that France is bent on undermining the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. This follows French insistence that its European Community partners must water down a farm trade agreement with the US which Paris claims the European Commission should not have negotiated with Washington last November. French officials will this week continue discussions with Germany on Paris's proposed changes to the so-called Blair House accord on US-EC trade in subsidised farm goods. But in Geneva yesterday, trade officials from 106 countries, gathering for three critical months of negotiation which were intended to finalise the long-stalled Uruguay round, warned that reopening the Blair House agreement would scupper the round. 'If the EC were formally to ask for Blair House to be reopened, you can forget the Uruguay round,' one leading negotiator predicted. The round was launched in 1986, but stalled in 1992 because of EC-US conflict on farm trade reform. The French push follows a meeting last week between Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, when Mr Kohl appeared to endorse France's call for renegotiation. German officials have been at pains since then to insist that the German leader's comments were misinterpreted. But the confusion in their wake has led to speculation that the EC might be forced to renege on a deal that took a year to negotiate. Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), is expected to give a clear but coded signal to France to modify its position when he begins the autumn talks at a top-level trade negotiations committee in Geneva today. He will call for governments to exert political leadership in the face of pressure from lobbies. Senior officials in Mr Kohl's office yesterday reiterated that Germany did not seek formal renegotiation of the US-EC farm agreement. They said the government was aware that Blair House could not be renegotiated, even in parts, without putting the Uruguay round at risk. Confusingly, a spokesman then added that the Blair House accord had 'neither been signed nor finally signed . . . It is of great importance that this agreement is compatible with the EC common agricultural policy.' Mr Sutherland will meet Mr Kohl in Bonn tomorrow to seek clarification of last week's comments. A meeting with Mr Balladur is due next Wednesday.</p>

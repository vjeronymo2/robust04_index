In the evening  of 15 March, Mr. Ozawa appeared in the Diet building for the  first time since 1 March. Answering questions by reporters, he  said, "I am not prepared for a visit to the United States, and  it would be impossible for me to visit that country during this  month." It is believed he called off the planned visit because  the United States pinned excessively high hopes on his visit to  Washington because he is a powerful politician in the ruling  coalition. The objective of Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United  States, as seen by many, was to break the impasse in the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that remain deadlocked since  the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks broke down. Mr. Ozawa's  decision to call off his planned visit is now fueling  speculation in many quarters.    The "National Press Club" organized by the American news  media had invited Mr. Ozawa to give a lecture, and the  invitation prompted him to think of visiting the United States.  Explaining the reasons for Mr. Ozawa calling off his planned  visit, people close to him stressed he did not plan to visit  Washington only in connection with the Japan-U.S. framework  talks. However, a senior member of Shinseito, explaining the  reason why he canceled his visit to the United States, said:  "The United States was increasingly pinning high hopes on his  visit to Washington, saying, since Mr. Ozawa comes to our  nation, he will carry a bag packed with a lot of gifts. These  high hopes on the part of the United States made it difficult  for Mr. Ozawa to go ahead with his planned visit." Some  American officials took the view that "Mr. Ozawa will visit  Washington to apologize for breaking off the recent Japan-U.S.  summit talks" and this view was taken as a factor in his  cancellation of the visit.    Mr. Ozawa himself is said to have vigorously worked on the  domestic coordination of views in a bid to put the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks back on track, and the general  consensus is that "he aimed to break the deadlock in the  Japan-U.S. framework talks by visiting the United States."  However, many point out: Given the character of the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, there are many government ministries  and agencies involved so it is not easy to break the deadlock.  The attitude of the United States, that has demanded setting  numerical targets, is still tough with Japan. Even if Mr. Ozawa  went ahead with his planned visit to Washington, it would be  very difficult for him to find areas of agreement for concluding  the framework talks.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been working  on the domestic coordination of views on how to resume the  framework talks while calling administrative vice ministers of  concerned ministries and agencies into the prime minister's  official residence. Some officials in the government and ruling  coalition parties take the view that "Mr. Ozawa might have  decided to call off his planned visit to Washington to avert  friction with Mr. Takemura."</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MAY HAVE TO PAY POLICE FOR FAKING  DISAPPEARANCE  </P> <P> Rialto police said Thursday they are considering making three women who faked  their own disappearance pay for the $10,000 investigation into what police  feared was a bloody kidnaping.  </P> <P> "Why should the taxpayers be duped for a harebrained idea like this?" asked  Rialto Police Capt. Phil Greek.  </P> <P> He said an investigation of the hoax by Suzanne Ballinger, 38, her 17-year-old  daughter, Sherry Richards, and Sherry's friend, Laura Fleming, 18, cost the  Police Department about $10,000. Greek said he has asked the city attorney of  Rialto to look into possibly billing the women.  </P> <P> The three turned up unharmed in Ogden, Utah, Wednesday night, nearly a week  after they abandoned a blood-stained car in North Hollywood, Greek said. As for  the motive for the hoax, Greek said Ballinger was seeking sympathy from family  members. He said she was frustrated with driving two hours to work in Van Nuys  and was upset about her financial situation.  </P> <P> The department does not plan to file criminal charges against the women.  </P></p>

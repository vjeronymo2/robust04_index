			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / An Irish model for Britain ARE YOU worried about a hung parliament? Afraid of electoral reform? Nervous about sterling? Just plain sick of the election? A good cure for these common complaints, as I discovered last week, is a visit to Dublin. It is not only as enjoyable as ever, but unexpectedly educational. Reassuring, even. Ireland has a weak economy - for the moment at any rate - and some major financial scandals. It has recently dumped a charismatic prime minister; and thanks to proportional representation, it has a more or less permanently hung parliament. Yet over the past few years it has wrought some astonishing changes. It has reduced the government deficit from 13 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP; and plans to eliminate it altogether. It has achieved a large trade surplus, and pushed inflation down from the high teens to under 3 per cent. It is hard to resist repeating one of the great journalistic misjudgments of all time, and say: 'I have seen the future, and it works.' Only up to a point, as we will see. What does work, though in a rather Irish fashion, is coalition government; it can get you into the most terrible trouble, but it can also get you out again. What it takes is a sufficient sense of national crisis; given that, a strong leader seems able to get away with anything. Mr Charles Haughey seems to have modelled his conduct on that of Governor Huey Long of Louisiana, who won an election by promising to cut taxes and promptly raised them as soon as he was back in the governor's mansion. An aide asked him how this should be explained to the press. 'Tell them I lied,' said the governor; and he got away with it. Mr Haughey won his last election but one by denouncing the painful squeeze which has been mounted by Mr Garret Fitzgerald, then Fine Gael leader; but as soon as he took office, he mounted a still fiercer one, and with opposition support. It was not very long before he felt (mistakenly) strong enough to call an election in the hope of winning a working majority. He is now a senior victim of the financial scandals; but his successor, the pragmatic Mr Albert Reynolds, is following the same fiscal strategy. Consensus rules. The success which has formed this consensus is especially interesting from a British point of view: the totally successful unilateral devaluation of 1986. This had almost none of the bad effects we are taught to expect. There was a shortlived spike in interest rates, but that is all. Unit costs remained under tight control, and the competitiveness gained six years ago has not only been sustained, but enhanced. In spite of a boom in output, which has now fizzled out, inflation went on falling, even in this very open economy. This is because the policies required to make devaluation work - a fiscal squeeze, and a consensus on wage restraint - were already in place. After a hiccup, it was even possible to sell ever-rising amounts of Irish government securities to German investors, at quite a modest yield premium. The whole history is a model of how ERM disciplines are supposed to work. The Irish are now intensely interested in our own election, though not in a partisan way; the outcome they most fear is one the City might welcome - a Conservative government depending on Unionist support. They are also, not surprisingly, intensely nervous about sterling. Given their own experience, devaluation looks an obvious policy option; but a sharp move - certainly one which put the Irish punt at a premium to the pound - would put them in a painful dilemma. To be sure, all British parties publicly reject the option; but you don't have to be Governor Long to lie about the parity. Politics apart, though, the case is not cut and dried. Ireland has one bit of luck which will not fall to the next British government: the D-Mark was an almost ideal anchor for the system in the late 1980s. Germany had low inflation, low interest rates, and was a large-scale capital exporter. That is now sadly changed, of course, and the present German profligacy faces fellow-member of the ERM with the unpalatable choice neatly summed up by Brian Reading in a Lombard Street circular this month: imitate German fiscal profligacy, or grin and bear a long economic depression. Possibly both. In one sense that argues for devaluation: if you know you are going to have the hangover, in the form of high real interest rates, you might as well enjoy the drink. But in another it argues against it: the deterioration in German cost performance, as well as the improvement in British, means that it is now quite realistic to hope that we can go on gaining competitiveness without changing the parity. It is a difficult judgment: how far is sterling overvalued at the moment, and how long will it take to adjust? If this was simply a British decision, I would support sticking to the parity, while cursing those who chose it; but the judgment may not be left to us. At the moment Dublin's worries seem to be largely local; but should they become widespread - as a result, say, of a new deterioration in our trade performance - they would be hard to resist. And probably not worth resisting. A British devaluation might work almost as well as Ireland's. The private sector squeeze on costs and borrowing is every bit as fierce as any government policy, and is not a prey to political whims. Indeed, in an important sense the Irish strategy would be more appropriate for Britain than it is for Ireland. The present Irish figures are an amazing achievement of political will power, but possibly a perverse one. The current account surplus means that Ireland, which has a tragic unemployment problem, is now exporting capital as well as labour, hardly the appropriate balance for an under-developed country. This is partly the result of a mistaken industrial policy. Foreign companies attracted to Ireland by low corporate taxes use transfer pricing to generate profits which are lent on to more highly taxed subsidiaries elsewhere. But for Britain, free of such distortions, and still a temporary oil producer, a strategy aimed at a sustained current account surplus really could be counted an unambiguous success.</p>

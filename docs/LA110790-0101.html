			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST SALE AT THE MUSTANG WILL BE THE RANCH ITSELF  </P> <P> America's most famous brothel, the 105-bed Mustang Ranch, goes on the block  next week at an initial offering price of $1.8 million.  </P> <P> The brothel in northern Nevada, the only state where brothels are legal, was  closed by U.S. government tax collectors in September after owners Joe and  Sally Conforte failed to pay about $13 million in taxes.  </P> <P> The brothel will be opened for public inspection Saturday, and the auction  itself is set for Nov. 13-14, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service  said.  </P> <P> The property -- about 330 acres of land, several buildings decorated in pinks,  purples, reds and greens -- carries an opening bid of $1.8 million.  </P> <P> Memorabilia that includes scanty lingerie, huge paintings of nudes and a  jukebox that plays such tunes as "Let's Do It Again" will be sold individually.  </P> <P> One sign going on sale gives patrons in the mirrored Orgy Room directions to  the nearest exit in case of fire.  </P> <P> IRS official Diedre Pagni said the sale was being advertised in publications  nationwide and had already brought inquiries from individuals interested in  purchasing the ranch, which Conforte turned into a brothel in 1971.  </P> <P> Pagni said potential buyers suggested that they might want to turn the "ranch"  into a nursing home or religious retreat.  </P></p>

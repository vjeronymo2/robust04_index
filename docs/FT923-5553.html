			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Travel: A gloomy monument to Columbus - Kevin Rafferty visits the Dominican Republic's capital IN 1492, as every schoolchild on either side of the Atlantic knows, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and landed - second stop - on the shores of the island that he christened Hispaniola. Almost 500 years later, Joaquin Balaguer, president of the Dominican Republic, is set to milk the quincentenary for all the political capital it is worth. The organising committee claims the republic is the starting point for the transfer of 'the values of western civilisation to America.' The old colonial quarter of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital, is being renovated. Roads and bridges are being repaired. New tourist facilities are being prepared for the 1m or more visitors expected for the October celebrations. In the biggest and costliest venture of all, the government is finally completing the 60-year-old plans of former dictator Rafael Trujillo for a mammoth Columbus lighthouse. This is meant to be the last resting place for Columbus's bones and from the top it will project a 1m-candlepower crucifix into the night sky. Pope John Paul II will be on hand to bless the lighthouse when it is formally opened. There are plenty of ironies here. The blind octogenarian President Balaguer is responsible for lighting the light. The lighthouse that the Pope will bless has been carved out of one of the capital's slums. And hundreds of people have been displaced and scattered to provide room for the monument, its vast grass surroundings and pools and fountains. Yet when the lighthouse light has been switched on, all surrounding electricity has frequently gone off, for up to four hours a time. Even without the lighthouse, power cuts are frequent in the Dominican Republic. The monument cannot be counted as one of the seven or even 77 or probably even 777 wonders of the modern world. Do not start to think of the lighthouse as a gracefully tall tower on the edge of land warning of rocks and treacherous seas. There is nothing graceful about this hulk, a chunk of gloomy grey concrete faced with marble and engraved with crosses. It is not on the edge of the sea, and the only noteworthy landmark is the slum now pushed 700 metres away. I had expected to see some phallic monster. In fact, the Columbus lighthouse is broader than it is long, covering two street blocks of the former slum. It shows all the imagination of some communist functionary's dreams. Of all the projects the Pope has blessed, this seems the hardest to justify for a man of God or a man of compassion. At least the massive new basilica at Yamassukro, in the Ivory Coast countryside, modelled on  - but bigger than - St Peter's in Rome, could claim to be a monument to God as well as to President Houphouet-Boigny. Perhaps a stern Polish Pope will appreciate the austere grey outlines of the Columbus lighthouse. But didn't his advisers ask awkward questions about a cross on top of a lighthouse? Normally, a light warns ships to keep their distance. Is the cross in the night sky meant to be a beacon or a warning to the world? Among other plans, the government of the Dominican Republic is going all out to attract tourists. It has an eye on cruise-ships, which it hopes to persuade to call at the rundown port where only a few rusting tramp ships are now in evidence. It makes sense to a hard-pressed economy where tourism is already the largest money-spinner, worth Dollars 800m last year. But there is still a long way to go before anyone would rate Santo Domingo a must destination, even on a sun-soaked cruise. The old town has its nice points: some delicate old Spanish-style houses, pretty squares, the house where Columbus's brother lived, the oldest cathedral in the New World begun in 1596. But you can walk around it all very quickly.</p>

Bakh, Russian Academy of Sciences,  Moscow; UDC 577.152.9]    [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is widely used in biology,  medicine, and the food industry because of its high level of  sensitivity, which is primarily the result of the marker  enzyme/ligand conjugates used in the analysis. The researchers  here create conjugates consisting of a ligand and laccase  extracted from the culture fluid of Coriolus  hirsutus, and they use the reagents in various enzyme  immunoassays and compare the properties of the reagents with  those of immunoperoxidase conjugates. The laccase conjugates can  be used in sandwich, concurrent, and indirect EIA. The absolute  sensitivity of laccase/antibody conjugates was shown to be  threefold higher than that of similar peroxidase conjugates (7.7  x 10[.sup]-11[/] M versus 2.3 x 10[.sup]-10[/]). The use  of laccase conjugates simplifies the assay process by its use of  atmospheric oxygen as a second substrate for the enzymatic  reaction. Figures 5, references 17: 4 Russian, 13 Western.</p>

Pointing out that the imperialist reactionary forces are  still threatening mankind with nuclear weapons going against the  trend of the present times, the article says:    The United States continues the test and production of  nuclear weapons and is bringing dark clouds of nuclear war,  having deployed nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in  many parts of the world.    Nuclear threat is coming from Japan, too. It is no secret  that Japan, the only nuclear victim in the world, is now working  with extra zeal to become a nuclear power. Japan which has  stockpiled large quantities of plutonium can turn into a nuclear  power any moment. The outcries of the Japanese ruling quarters  over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" are intended to justify their  moves to be a nuclear power.    It is a common task of the world people to build a peaceful  new world free from nuclear weapons by smashing the nuclear war  moves of the imperialist reactionary forces.    The world peaceloving people should build a peaceful world  without nuclear weapons with a united struggle.</p>

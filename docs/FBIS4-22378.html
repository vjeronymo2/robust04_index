			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Petr Kirillov article: "Through the Looking Glass -- </F> ARGUMENTY I FAKTY Invents Arguments in Order To Do Battle More  Successfully With the Facts"]    [Text] In the art of propaganda there exists a well-worn  trick: Namely, to invent certain arguments for the opponent (or  to change existing arguments beyond all recognition) and then to  shower bitter, critical blows on these fabricated arguments. As  a result, the enemy is defeated, the amazed public applauds, and  as for the truth -- well, nobody will think to rifle through  boring papers, checking what is written in them against the  arguments being propagated in the popular press.    It is an old trick, but a good one, and it is used very  frequently. A recent example is the comparative table printed  in the weekly ARGUMENTY I FAKTY (No. 11, March 1994) entitled  "The Path of Russia's Economic Development -- How V.  Chernomyrdin Sees It. And How Ye. Gaydar Sees It," which was  then commented on by experts A. Illarionov and A. Shapovalyanets  [See FBIS Report: Central Eurasia -- FBIS-USR-94-029, 24 March  1994, pp 20-21].    Without undertaking to evaluate the authenticity of the  viewpoint expounded by the "Russia's Choice" leader on Russia's  paths of economic development, let us try to analyze how far the  ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version accords with the position of the  current government chairman, particularly as in recent months  Viktor Chernomyrdin has made repeated public statements about it  and the government's actions are not only in sight of, but under  close scrutiny from the public and the press.    So, what aims, according to the version printed in the  weekly  publication, is Viktor Chernomyrdin pursuing?    Number one on the list is "halting the slump in production"  in combination with "the reform of the state-controlled sector  of the economy." Immediately the interpretation is that, in the  authors' view, this must mean preferential credit for industry  and the agricultural sector; large-scale investment by means of  emissions; concessions to specific enterprises, sectors, and  regions; state control over economic activity; the expansion of  licensing, the regulation and level of prices, and so on. In  other words, an entire complement of nightmares, accompanying  the advent of "Red directors" and, accordingly, the collapse of  reform. Clearly, this fossilized stance is in stark contrast to  curtailing inflation, cutting large-scale benefits, financing  the budget via "non-inflationary sources," and other exemplary  measures.    But in fact, everything is precisely the other way around.  Both in the government program, adopted on V. Chernomyrdin's  initiative last August, and in all the premier's program  speeches without exception priority was invariably accorded to  the fight against inflation and the achievement of financial  stability. The government chairman speaks equally firmly and  consistently in favor of austere restrictions on the issue of  money and concessions and of highly specific and purposeful  support of efficient production units, and against dishing out  credits. And the government's economic policy has nothing  whatever to do with expanding the use of such outmoded  instruments as licensing, or freezing profitability levels and  prices. The government program also stipulates that the  creation of an efficient economy is only possible on the basis  of market mechanisms, and on condition that there is "a  significant restriction on state intervention in the economy and  a cut in the share of the state sector."    Moreover, these are not just declarations. The measures set  out in the government program to do away with preferential  credit, abolish inefficient concessions of an individual nature  offered to enterprises and regions on taxes and customs duties,  and cut the range of goods subject to quota and licensing are  already being implemented.    The draft 1994 Federal Budget submitted to the Duma  stipulates rigid requirements for targeted financing from state  expenditure on developing the national economy, the size of  which expenditure is restricted by the rigid frameworks of  priority federal programs.    At the same time, support of such sectors as the  agro-industrial complex and the coal industry will be guaranteed  basically via sources of finance not entailing further  emissions, for which it is planned in the budget to form a  special support fund. Likewise it is planned to cut drastically  budget expenditure on paying out subsidies and allowances to  state enterprises.    Why then was it necessary to pass off the dreams of hotheads  from the federation of commodity producers as the stance, indeed  as the intentions of the government leader? Actually the  question is purely rhetorical. It is all patently obvious.    However, let us go a little further into the political  labyrinth whither the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY are  consigning us. The Russian prime minister's hidden aim is  declared to be "military and political merger with neighboring  foreign states." The alternative? It goes without saying --  "integration with neighboring foreign states on an economic  basis." It is true -- for some reason the premier intends to  implement his "military-political" designs, according to the  ARGUMENTY I FAKTY version, exclusively by means of "the  accelerated creation of a ruble zone, continued financial aid to  close neighbors, and the introduction of a fixed ruble rate."    Where this astounding information came from remains a  mystery. After all, the government's position on a whole range  of tricky problems regarding Russia's relationships with  neighboring foreign states has been stated publicly on many  occasions. Even in the Message from the Russian Federation  President, the key idea is to combine economic reintegration  with a deepening of political, including military, cooperation  among CIS countries. The government was never interested in  dissolving the Russian economy, or in the amorphous post-Soviet  economic area. The premier's statement and, in particular, the  progress of the difficult talks on a whole range of problems in  Russia's economic relasionships with the CIS countries indicate  that the priority remains invariably the defense of Russian  interests. In the draft 1994 budget the extent of financial aid  to the neighboring countries is being cut significantly and its  availability regulated.    As for the highly complex process of unifying monetary  systems, there is no mention at all of forcing this difficult  matter. The government program lays down as a compulsory  condition of the functioning of the ruble zone the introduction  of a single currency and the implementation of money-credit and  budget policy strictly coordinated with Russia. It is possible  that these terms may not suit some of the partners. But Russia  can do no other if it wants to avoid emergency financial  donorship and as a result an inflationary slide.    Finally, there is one more "political" (or more precisely,  "geopolitical") contradiction. According to the version from  the authors of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, V. Chernomyrdin's aim is "to  raise Russia's role as a world power" at a time when Ye. Gaydar  is pushing merely for "the expansion of contacts with the West  and the integration of Russia's economy into the world economy."    Such a juxtaposition cannot be described as anything but  imaginary. Russia's status as a world power in no way  contradicts the "opening up" of its economy or consistent and  equal integration into the world economy. But its relationship  with the world (of course, not only with the West) is determined  by our fatherland's unique Eurasian situation.    So this is the "portrait" painted. Admittedly it is no more  akin to the original than an image churned out by a cheap  photographer, on which it is difficult to distinguish the eyes  and the nose and the ears are missing altogether. But this does  not matter, as the main thing is that it is possible to make  profound forecasts. For instance, to frighten citizens with the  prospect of 100-percent inflation a month or a currency rate of  25-30,000 rubles to the dollar. Why not 50,000 or 60,000?  After all, these numbers are conjured up by expert A.  Illarionov from that very same source whence the arguments about  the government's position derived -- from thin air.    Moreover, even our expert's opponent, A. Shapovalyanets,  commenting on Ye. Gaydar's "alternative" program, also falls  into the trap of nightmare prophecies. It is typical that both  commentators, despite different points of departure, conclude  their predictions almost identically, forecasting social  explosions on the basis of hyperinflation. But then, you only  have to invent nightmares to end up frightening yourself with  them.    It is merely a pity for the 6.5 million readers of the  popular weekly that the authors did not look before leaping.  The result is confusion, and nothing more.</p>

The foreign minister was addressing the parliamentary  advisory committee. He said that he was forming a transparent  policy on Kashmir. He said that the government had given  permission to some members of the International Committee of the  Red Cross and a group of ambassadors from four European nations  to visit Kashmir. These members visited several parts of Kashmir  valley last week and reviewed the situation there.    Mr. Dinesh Singh said that this step will help counter the  accusations of human rights violations in Kashmir being made at  Pakistan's behest at the international level. He said that there  is the danger that separatist and terrorist organizations might  stage some drama for the benefit of foreign guests and  communication media, however, the government will continue this  transparent policy.    Several members in the meeting suggested that an Indian  deputation should try to aggressively stop Pakistan's propaganda  in the UN Human Rights Commission meeting.    Messrs Jagjit Singh, Umrao Singh, L.B. Rawal, B.B. Dutt,  T.N.  Chaturvedi, Ram Jethmalani, Chit Basu, Sharad Didhe, and G.G.  Sawel were some of the prominent members present in the meeting.    India has meanwhile advised the United States as a friend of  Pakistan to prepare Islamabad for bilateral talks with Delhi  over various issues including Kashmir.    Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told Senator Patrick Monyhan  (D)  here today that it is imperative that Pakistan is made to  understand that it is useless to raise the Kashmir issue at  various levels. These actions are increasing tension and wasting  time.    Mr. Rao said that India was following all the diplomatic  protocols while Pakistan was doing exactly the opposite.    Mr. Monyhan during his visit with Home Minister Shankar Rao  Chavan said that the Shimla agreement is a major support for  improving Indo-Pakistan relations. He said that there has been  no change in the U.S. policy on Kashmir.    A senior official in the Russian foreign office said in  Moscow today that internationalization of the Kashmir issue will  not help resolve this issue. This problem should be resolved by  India and Pakistan by working together.    Mr. B.M. Yogorov, the chief of South Asian Bureau of the  Russian foreign office emphasized in an interview today that the  Kashmir problem was between India and Pakistan and it should be  resolved peacefully. Mr. Yogorov said that the Shimla agreement  can be used as a basis by India and Pakistan for resolving the  Kashmir issue.    These comments by the senior Russian diplomat are very  important against the background of Pakistan's recent campaign  to make Kashmir an international issue.    Mr. Yogorov forcefully said that Russia always had the same  stand on Kashmir and it does not see any reason to change this  stand.    He said that there are two aspects of the Kashmir  problem--political and human rights. However, these two should  not be mixed.  *</p>

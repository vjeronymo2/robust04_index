			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK ART EXHIBITION  </P> <P> Wilson is jubilant over the fact that there "has never been a historical  American art survey exhibition of this magnitude focused on black people."  </P> <P> An exhibition of this magnitude should bring about careful consideration on how  blacks were viewed by an ignorant Caucasian society at the time that the art  was created.  </P> <P> It is art that depicts this clearly and fascinatingly.  </P> <P> However, Wilson becomes a bit uncomfortable with the ideas of curator Guy C.  McElroy. Wilson only sees racism in the blatantly stupid caricatures but fails  to see the racism in those less forthright. He accepts that there is "no reason  to doubt that McElroy sees racism in these works."  </P> <P> However, he pitifully reprimands McElroy, saying the only reason he sees it is  because he is looking for it!  </P> <P> With even limited knowledge of the experiences of the black race, it is easy to  see how whites have taken advantage of their power and abused it. So, you don't  want to look for racism in these pictures, Mr. Wilson? Then why do you seek to  glorify those pictures that don't? Sure, there is art that doesn't condescend  to the black race; but why do you have to justify yourself and dismiss the  racial ones?  </P> <P> Mr. Wilson also states "having an ax to grind is as American as fast food, but  forging one's blade against the soft soapstone of art may not be the most  appropriate use of objects made for aesthetic delectation." Beautiful use of  words, but ugly idea. It's like, "Let's not dirty a sacred culture such as art  with controversy." Please look harder and deeper. By doing this, we can learn  from our past to help our future.  </P> <P> STELLA SAGANICH (age 19)  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

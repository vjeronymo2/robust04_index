			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: To restructure and not expand - Tim Burt looks at the changing nature of M&amp;A activity Tracking takeover activity is an inexact science. Sheraton's surprise Pounds 353m bid last week for Ciga, the Italian hotels group, has bucked the trend in the hotel sector just when analysts were predicting a quiet period for mergers and acquisitions. Such unexpected bids can undermine thousands of man hours invested by leading merchant banks and accountancy firms to spot markets where companies are ripe for the picking. In the automotive sector, for example, forecasts of declining takeover activity have been overtaken by BMW's agreed Pounds 800m takeover of Rover Group. Faced with increasingly unpredictable boardroom moves, merchant banks and accountants have this year begun to concentrate on the geography of takeover activity rather than the industries involved. The consensus emerging in the City points to a sharp increase in joint venture deals and equity purchases in the North American and newly emerging markets. In the US, ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement and renewed confidence following the first year of the Clinton administration attracted a wave of new investors who bought equity stakes worth more than Dollars 34bn (Pounds 23bn) compared with Dollars 13.7bn in 1992. US companies, meanwhile, spent almost Dollars 40bn on overseas joint ventures and partial acquisitions, up from Dollars 22.5bn the year before. Of the developing markets, KPMG says China emerged last year as the prize target with overseas companies investing Dollars 15.2bn, up from Dollars 5.2bn, in joint ventures and equity acquisitions. In Europe, however, activity slowed. The accountancy firm's figures on EU activity put the value of equity stakes sold off at Dollars 41.3bn, compared with Dollars 57.3bn in 1992. Outright disposals fell more sharply, down from Dollars 42.3bn to Dollars 23bn. An even gloomier picture has been painted by Translink, the M&amp;A adviser. It said the total value of cross-border deals was at its lowest level for five years despite a small increase in the number of transactions completed. After stripping out the negative effects in Europe of recession and uncertainty over Maastricht and the appeal of investing in emerging market such as China, City bankers and accountants believe M&amp;A activity is undergoing a long-term structural upheaval. They say fewer companies can now afford outright acquisitions, especially financed by borrowing, and there had been a marked shift to lesser equity purchases and joint venture deals. Mr Richard Agutter, senior partner at KPMG, says: 'Some companies feel that 100 per cent acquisitions should be avoided.' He cites British Telecommunications's decision to take a 20 per cent stake in MCI of the US as an example of this piecemeal strategy. 'Companies are being more cautious - it is no longer a case of simply asking themselves whether they have the money to afford the deal but whether they should be considering the deal in the first place,' he adds. His view is echoed by corporate finance directors at merchant banks such as SG Warburg, Morgan Grenfell and Schroders. Mapping the trends for 1994, they share a common belief that M&amp;A activity is being fuelled by the need to restructure rather than the need to expand. According to Mr Piers von Simson, head of corporate finance at SG Warburg, such needs forced BAe to sign a deal enabling it to focus on core defence and aerospace activities, while also securing for BMW an alternative supply of cars and components at lower unit costs than in Germany. Further deals, he predicts, will take place as companies come 'under pressure to create shareholder value by selling non-core divisions.' According to Mr Guy Dawson, his counterpart at Morgan Grenfell, disposals of such businesses will lead to increased activity in most sectors, particularly in telecommunications, defence and the motor industry. Yet the busiest sectors appear to be non-manufacturing sectors, with oil and gas and utilities leading the league table of cross-border deals. The growth of these two sectors has been attributed to new opportunities in developing markets which were previously closed or where overseas investors faced prohibitive tariffs. At Schroders, meanwhile, Mr Richard Broadbent, director of investment banking, says future activity in such industries will be dominated by large corporate players trying to win a commanding position in their particular sectors. 'Companies are looking five years ahead and planning acquisition and disposals now to streamline their businesses for the next century,' he adds. The merchant banks claim companies have learned - often the hard way after making costly non-core acquisitions in the 1980s - that there are no economies of scale in further diversity. Their corporate finance directors are agreed: restructuring will prompt fresh M&amp;A activity as large companies sell off non-core businesses, leaving smaller competitors with little option but to merge to survive on the international stage. 'Fashions are changing,' says Mr Broadbent. 'The last M&amp;A boom was due to an over-availability of finance. The next upturn will be driven by an upheaval in corporate planning.'</p>

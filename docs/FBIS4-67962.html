			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 3 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan signed a  ``cooperation arrangement on nuclear safety'' here today, making  Japan China's seventh partner in the endeavor for nuclear safety  following the United States, France, Germany and some other  industrialized countries.    The agreement was signed by Huang Qitao, vice-minister of  China's State Science and Technology Commission and director  general of the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA),  and Youki Kawata, director general of the Agency of Natural  Resources and Energy under the Japanese Ministry of  International Trade and Industry.    Under the agreement, the two contracting parties will  strengthen cooperation on the safety administration of  commercial nuclear power plants in the two countries, exchange  information and experts so as to ensure nuclear safety.    In a meeting with Kawata prior to the signing ceremony,  Huang  said that the agreement will usher in a new period for  Sino-Japanese cooperation in nuclear safety.    Kawata expressed the conviction that more effective  cooperation in nuclear safety will help boost the overall  Japan-China cooperation.    A month ago, the NNSA, a government organ independently  exercising administration over nuclear safety in China,  concluded a cooperation agreement for nuclear safety with the  Nuclear Safety Bureau of Japan's Science and Technology Agency.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Inspector General Klaus Naumann by Michael </F> J. Inacker in Hamburg; date not given: "Naumann: Budget Cuts  Endanger Operational Readiness of Troops"]    [Text] [Inacker] In spring 1993 you stated that the  "patient Bundeswehr" could handle another operation, but there  must be an end to the financial cuts. Now another 1.25 billion  German marks [DM] have to be saved. How many more "operations"  can the armed forces really take on?    [Naumann] What I described as an operation at the time was  an attempt to make clear that we need planning security to be  able to shape the structures of the Bundeswehr in the second  half of this decade in accordance with its tasks. Thus, the  operation refers to what the minister announced as conceptual  considerations for April.    What we are now doing is carrying out more cuts that will  lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to achieve the  degree of operational readiness that its mandate demands. This  will also reduce the scope for action in German policy, because  we will have to accept a temporary reduction concerning the  operational readiness of the main defense forces. In addition,  there will be delays in the restructuring of the Bundeswehr  because it will probably not be possible before the end of this  decade to provide a minimum contingent of crisis reaction forces.    [Inacker] As Germany's most senior soldier, can you take  responsibility for these cuts -- both regarding the troops and  regarding the politicians who expect the armed forces to be  ready for operations?    [Naumann] I am telling the politicians in very plain terms  what the Bundeswehr is no longer able to achieve. It is clear  that we will not be able to cut expenditure by DM1.25 billion  without major consequences, all the more so because the budget  debate was characterized by the understanding that "further  reductions to the Bundeswehr are no longer possible."    What is often overlooked is that there is a correlation  between mandate, structure, strength, equipment, training,  operations, and finances. One can compare the situation with a  system of communicating tubes. One cannot reduce the level in  one tube and expect the level to remain the same in the others.    [Inacker] What options of German security policy can no  longer be ensured?    [Naumann] The defense policy is oriented toward a country's  interests and its international obligations. My task as  military adviser of the defense minister and the Federal  Government is to determine what we can and what we cannot  achieve. We are currently in the middle of this evaluation  process.    My first conclusion is that we will no longer be able to  achieve the current standard of operational readiness for many  troops in 1994/95. Thus, we will lose options for German  defense policy, and we will certainly not be able to correct  that again overnight. There is no leeway within the defense  budget, which, however would be necessary to complete the  adaptation of the Bundeswehr to new and much broader tasks by  the end of the decade.    What makes the situation even worse is that opportunities to  seek solutions together with our alliance partners in the spirit  of task sharing cannot be taken as long as we do not know  whether we will participate in operations such as the AWACS  mission over Bosnia.    The fact, for example, that, in a battalion of four  companies, we will not be able to fill a quarter of one company  because of the lack of soldiers reduces the operational  readiness of the battalion for a year. This means that we need  time or would have to call up reservists if this battalion were  needed.    At the moment, such a partly filled battalion is not  required  for Germany's defense. Thus, these cutbacks are acceptable this  year. Yet this situation must change, and guidelines concerning  the development of the Bundeswehr in the second half of this  decade must be issued.    [Inacker] Is it possible to provide the army with modern  equipment on the basis of the investment funds available? How do  you assess the loss of national defense capacities resulting  from the austerity measures?    [Naumann] I am clearly worried about our national defense  capacities. We must preserve defense capacities in some areas.  However, we must do that where this is possible from a  technological viewpoint or where we have a lead, because this is  also a criterion for our capacity for international cooperation  and participation in systems.    At an investment share of approximately 21 percent in the  defense budget, it is not possible to maintain the innovative  capacity of the Bundeswehr in the long run. Ultimately, this is  the central planning problem that we have to resolve to prevent  increased procurement after the year 2000. Thus, the investment  share must be increased. Examinations concerning  rationalization have been initiated to this end.    [Inacker] You repeatedly referred to the new type of  combat-ready and fighting soldier at the commanders' meeting.  Is the required training possible with the funds available?    [Naumann] If one views training in terms of immediate and  fast operational readiness for all the troops of the Bundeswehr,  this cannot be achieved with the funds available. Thus, one  must consider carefully what training one demands for what kind  of troops. Different training is required for the main defense  forces and crisis reaction forces. This has nothing to do with  the stupid talk about a "two-class army." The task of the main  defense forces is relatively one-dimensional, aimed at the  country's defense. In this respect, it has to be taken into  consideration to a greater extent that there is a certain leeway  that can be utilized for mobilization if a decision is made at  an early stage of a crisis. The crisis reaction forces, however,  have to be trained for rapid and immediate operations in unknown  geographic areas and unknown scenarios. This has an impact on  the training level. A great deal of imagination will be  required to work out the details of this differentiation within  the Bundeswehr. As far as troops are concerned, this means: We  do not necessarily have to say that training is no longer  practicable if we can no longer do everything that was  considered mandatory in the past.</p>

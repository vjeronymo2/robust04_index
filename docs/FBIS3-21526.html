Igor Sergeyev says Moscow is no longer in control of the  safety of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine.    In an interview with Interfax on Tuesday, he said that the  missile troops deployed in Ukraine were no longer under Moscow's  control after the commanders of the 43rd and 46th missile  divisions took an oath of allegiance to Kiev.    Sergeyev spoke of being unable to control troops "whose  officers expressed loyalty to another state." He said he  outlined the emerging situation in letters to Ukrainian and  Russian Defence Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev.    At the same time, the Russian official pointed to progress  in  the negotiations on the pullout of nuclear weapons from Ukraine.  He said the first batch of nuclear weapons was to be  transferred to Russia on March 28.    Sergeyev said that tension was also running high over the  nuclear weapons deployed in Kazakhstan whose leadership  prevented the transfer of weapons to Russia and opposed the plan  for taking obsolete missiles off combat duty. Sergeyev says the  dismantling of those missiles should have been started in 1993  but nothing has so far happened.    In his words, Moscow has no problems with the servicing or  withdrawal of nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus. "These have  remained under our jurisdiction," said the general. He also  said that one of the three missile divisions deployed in Belarus  had been pulled out and disbanded as scheduled.    The two remaining divisions are to be withdrawn and  demobilized in the first half of 1996. Sergeyev says the  withdrawal process will taken in stages: four regiments will be  withdrawn in 1994 and the other four a year later. This will  bring an end to the pullout of nuclear weapons from Belarus.  The two divisions are to be disbanded in the first half of 1996.    Sergeyev says that his troops' combat readiness is just as  high as in the period of stagnation in the former Soviet Union  when military supplies were good. In his words, the withdrawal  of obsolete missiles were being carried out as scheduled.</p>

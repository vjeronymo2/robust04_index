			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures rally SHORT-DATED sterling fut-ures rallied yesterday morning after the Bundesbank refrained from changing the emergency Lombard rate at its council meeting, and the figure for Germany's July M3 money supply came in at 8.6 per cent. But, as has happened several times this week, the mood of futures dealers did an about-turn in the afternoon. Futures contracts dipped to their opening levels as the dollar fell at the start of foreign exchange trading in the US and sterling declined with it. The September short sterling contract jumped 6 basis points from its opening level of 89.66 after the Bundesbank signalled no change in rates at its fortnightly meeting. One commercial bank dealer also interpreted the M3 money supply figure as positive. He noted that the figure was 0.1 per cent lower than the previous month's monetary growth. This was particularly good, he said, since the effects of the recent 0.75 of a percentage point rise in the discount rate have not yet worked through the German banking system. In the afternoon, futures prices fell as the pound sank to DM2.8075, its lowest point since Britain joined the ERM. The September contract finished one basis point down at 89.64, and the December contract was off 4 basis points at 89.64. Some dealers felt that these were probably the bottom levels for the front-month contracts unless a rise in UK base rates looks imminent. Trade in the sterling cash market was thin. As often happens on a Thursday, dealers took most of the day to take out the shortage forecast by the Bank of England. This is because traders like to offer large numbers of bills to the Bank of England on a Friday when they can push the overnight rate down as far as possible for the weekend. In the morning, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. In early operations, the Bank bought Pounds 31m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 20m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1bn and the bank purchased Pounds 36m in Band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 91m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then bought Pounds 14m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 694m in Band 1 Bank bills, Pounds 2m in Band 2 Treasury bills and Pounds 1m in Band 2 bank bills. There was late assistance of Pounds 120m.</p>

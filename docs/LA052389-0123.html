			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN PAPER MODERNIZES, BUT KEEPS LINKS WITH THE PAST  </P> <P> When George Mason drove into Fresno to start an English-language weekly  newspaper for Armenians in 1959, there were about 50,000 Armenians in  California. They were mostly fruit farmers who had lived for a generation or  more in California. And they wanted a way to keep in touch with a culture whose  language they had mostly forgotten.  </P> <P> Today, Mason is a Beverly Hills financier and the Courier is based in Glendale.  His paper's original editor, Reese Cleghorn, is dean of the College of  Journalism at the University of Maryland, and the modest paper they founded in  the back of a gas station is the state's oldest Armenian newspaper.  </P> <P> It is virtually unknown outside the Armenian-American community, but among its  readers -- immigrants and children of immigrants -- it is a link to the simpler  Armenian life style of a generation ago and a fiercely independent political  journal that tackles the problems of the Southern California Armenian community  today.  </P> <P> It has survived, Armenian scholars say, by adapting to the times.  </P> <P> Recently, a group of California Armenians toasted the Courier at a lavish  $500-a-plate banquet, with Gov. George Deukmejian as guest speaker.  </P> <P> The Courier, now owned by a young Armenian from Syria, Harut Sassounian, has  3,000 subscribers and an estimated readership three times that. It has offices  in an Armenian-owned building in Glendale, a city whose population is about  one-fourth Armenian.  </P> <P> It circulates in 35 states and 20 foreign countries. Its subscribers, an  affluent, worldly group, include Deukmejian and former California Court of  Appeal Justice Richard Amerian. It is owned and edited by a Columbia University  graduate who writes articles about U.S. refugee policy, and it takes  controversial stands that often get its readership hopping mad.  </P> <P> "The amazing thing about the Courier is the extent to which it has mirrored the  community's growth of self-confidence," said Salpi Ghazarian, director of the  West Coast office of the Zoryan Institute, a nonprofit Armenian educational  foundation. "It started out as a small little weekly and has grown to a point  where there is more discussion of political and social issues that are  difficult and controversial. This is a crisis time for Armenians and the  Courier is one of the few papers dealing with that."  </P> <P> The Armenian-American community, with a Southern California population of more  than 250,000 and thousands more arriving every month, is swiftly changing. The  Courier is read by leaders of many of the Armenian organizations that serve the  refugees and by many of the organizations still coping with the aftermath of  December's earthquake in Soviet Armenia.  </P> <P> The Courier began responding to some of those concerns a few years ago, under  the leadership of Sassounian, the paper's editor since 1983. The paper has  become lively, political and a good deal more liberal than many of its readers,  but so far it has retained the loyalty of its founders and longtime  subscribers.  </P> <P> Robert Shamlian, an Armenian banker who lives in Glendale, has been a Courier  subscriber since the beginning. He kept his subscription after Sassounian and  his wife, Irene, took over, and doesn't mind the way the paper has changed.  </P> <P> "Usually I don't agree with Harut's point of view; he's a little bit more  liberal than I," Shamlian said. "But it's nice to have a contrasting point of  view. It opens up your thoughts."  </P> <P> There are at least five Armenian newspapers in Los Angeles today and about a  dozen more around the country. Several publish in English and several based in  Boston are older than the Courier.  </P> <P> But the Courier is one of only three papers published in English not affiliated  with one of the Armenian political parties. Its motto is "The Newspaper for All  Armenians."  </P> <P> Sassounian bought the weekly from Mason in 1986, three years after taking over  as editor. From the first, he insisted on moving the paper to Los Angeles, the  heart of Armenian life in the United States. Once a money loser, the paper has  increased its advertising by almost 75% and turns enough of a profit to support  Sassounian and his wife. Sassounian has done it by working late at night and on  weekends and learning about journalism through common sense.  </P> <P> Sassounian is Syrian by birth and political by temperament. He has a master's  degree in business from Pepperdine University and one from Columbia University  in international relations. He speaks Armenian, Arabic, English and French.  </P> <P> Sassounian is one of the more recent arrivals among Armenians who derisively  call people such as Mason and the Fresno community his paper served "shish  kebab" Armenians -- suggesting that their interest in their homeland's culture  ends with a skewer of meat.  </P> <P> The Courier under Sassounian concerns itself intimately with Armenian culture.  He reviews events and political lectures, travels to Washington and New York to  interview Armenian leaders there, and has written about international issues  such as arms talks, Soviet glasnost, the age-old conflict between Armenians and  Turks, and the recent heated ethnic protests in Soviet Armenia.  </P></p>

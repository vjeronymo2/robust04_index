			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ahold seeks listing on NYSE AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer which ranks among the 10 largest supermarket groups in the US, is to seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in the autumn. The company, which has an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme in the US, is still studying whether to move the ADRs to the stock exchange or to make a listing of ordinary shares. Ahold, with 25 per cent of the Dutch groceries market, operates over 500 supermarkets in 12 states in the eastern US. The company, listed in Amsterdam since 1948, launched its ADRs on the NASDAQ system in 1991. Its first foray into the US supermarket sector came in 1977, when it bought the Bi-Lo chain, which operated stores in the Carolinas and Georgia. Since then, it has acquired several regional groups, including Giant Food Stores, the First National Supermarkets business, and Tops Markets.</p>

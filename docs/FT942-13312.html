			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Sponsors are found for 13 technology colleges The government will announce today that it has found business sponsorship to convert 13 schools into technology colleges. Sponsorship for the first 12 technology colleges was announced in February, and ministers believe they have at last discovered a successful method for raising private funds for secondary education. Each of the schools has raised at least Pounds 100,000 from corporate sponsors, and the Department for Education will match it pound for pound. Government funds committed for the 13 schools total about Pounds 1.4m while more than 80 companies and individuals have become sponsors. Fundraisers now believe that finance could be found to convert about 100 secondary schools into technology colleges by the end of this year. But the announcement could intensify the political row over the government's decision to restrict technology-college funds to schools which have opted out of council control. Teachers' unions and Labour politicians claim this is an attempt to bribe schools into opting out. Two schools whose new funding is announced today - the John Kelly Boys' and Girls' community schools in the north London borough of Brent  - both opted out solely to gain access to the extra funding. Their head teachers said they would have preferred to stay with the local education authority. But both said they strongly supported the new scheme. Ms Kathy Heaps, head of the girls' school, said both schools had already built up relationships with their two sponsors, Unisys, the computer company, and Bestway, the retailing chain, both of which are large local employers. They will each put forward Pounds 120,000, and directors of both companies already sit on the schools' governing boards. Ms Heaps said the technology scheme 'could almost have been designed for us'. For the past five years ministers have tried with much less success to raise private funding for City Technology Colleges, a predecessor initiative which asked business to fund the building of new schools. Only 15 were established. Other sponsors of the present scheme include the Garfield Weston Foundation; DHL, the distribution group; Apricot computers; ICL, the computer company; Thames Water; and Mercury, the telecommunications company. The other schools are in: Burnley; Reading; Southampton; Birmingham; Brighouse, North Yorkshire; Manchester; Colchester; Barnet, north London; Bromley, south London; Lancaster; and Maidstone.</p>

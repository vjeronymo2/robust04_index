			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Government nears decision on postal sell-off The government will today move a step closer to deciding whether to include a Post Office privatisation bill in the next parliamentary session, which starts next month. With Tory opponents of the privatisation stepping up their efforts to force the government to abandon the proposed sale, the ministerial committee on industrial, commercial and consumer affairs will discuss the position this morning. Government business managers are thought to have told Mr John Major, the prime minister, that he will face a tough battle if ministers opt to press ahead with the bill. An opinion poll conducted at the end of last week showed opposition to Post Office privatisation was hardening among Conservative MPs. The poll of a random sample of 54 Tory backbenchers found that nearly a quarter of them wanted an integrated Post Office in the public sector with greater commercial freedom. The MORI poll, commissioned by the UCW postal workers' union, is part of a vigorous union lobbying campaign. Last week eight Conservative MPs signed an early day motion voicing concern that privatisation would lead to widespread closures of rural post offices. One in five of the polled MPs also said they were in favour of postponing a decision about the future of the industry. About 85 per cent said they thought the Post Office provided a good service, 93 per cent said they received no complaints about its service and 91 per cent identified rural areas as a crucial aspect of Post Office work. The poll also highlighted the level of public opposition to Post Office privatisation. The MPs said that only 2 per cent of representations they had received about the Post Office wanted it broken up and sold whereas 77 per cent were against. Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW general secretary, said the privatisation had become a 'political time bomb'. Government concerns, the union said, may have been heightened by an internal Post Office document warning that privatisation plans could run into legal challenges because of European competition laws. The document, according to a Sunday Telegraph report, said planned exclusive trading arrangements between a publicly owned Post Office Counters and a privatised Royal Mail and Parcelforce would potentially be in conflict with the Treaty of Rome. The ministerial committee will also be discussing today the inclusion of a gas market liberalisation bill in the session.</p>

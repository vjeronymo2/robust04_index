			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Call for return of cash from IRA raid Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday called on the IRA to return the money stolen in a post office raid in Newry on November 10, during which postal worker Mr Frank Kerr was killed. Sir Patrick, speaking in Belfast after the organisation's admission of responsibility for the robbery, said that the IRA 'cannot bring back the life of Mr Kerr but they can mark their sincerity by returning the money they stole'. It is thought that Pounds 130,000 was taken in the raid. The IRA said its members killed Mr Kerr but the robbery had not been sanctioned by the leadership. 'Responsibility . . . for this incident lies with an identified problem in the army's chain of command and not with the volunteers involved. This has now been rectified,' it said in a statement. The IRA remained committed to the peace process, the statement added. Asked whether the IRA admission of guilt would damage plans for exploratory talks between British officials and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, before Christmas, Sir Patrick said: 'It is important that whether the attack in Newry took place or not, the timetable laid down by the prime minister should be adhered to.' Sir Patrick added, however, that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had made an important qualification for the talks, that the IRA ceasefire was permanent. Northern Ireland officials said yesterday talks were still most likely before Christmas, although reports they could take place in 10 days' time are probably premature. Meanwhile, the implications of the IRA admission over Mr Kerr will be considered by the Irish Republic's caretaker government today. Acting justice minister Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn will report to a scheduled meeting of the cabinet.</p>

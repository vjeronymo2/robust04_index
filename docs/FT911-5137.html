			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Chase Manhattan bounces back with profit of Dollars 117m CHASE MANHATTAN, which seemed just six months ago to be among the most critically ill of the US retail banks, has bounced back with a near-trebling of first-quarter earnings. North America's second largest banking group posted net income of Dollars 117m, or 73 cents a share, up from Dollars 44m, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Lower funding costs and an increase in high-margin consumer lending pushed up net interest income to Dollars 841m, from Dollars 814m. Fees and commissions rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 380m, including a 25 per cent jump in consumer banking charges. Although non-performing loans continue to loom large in the bank's business, Chase's chairman Mr Tom Labrecque said he was 'encouraged' by the latest results. Analysts were especially heartened by the improved control over operating expenses, which fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 936m. Total assets slipped to Dollars 100.5bn from Dollars 107.3bn. However, return on both assets and shareholders' equity improved markedly, in the latter case from 2.3 to 10.1 per cent. Although Chase's earnings were roughly in line with recent forecasts, its share price climbed 88 cents to Dollars 18.50 yesterday on the New York stock exchange. The share price is now almost double the low reached last year when the group sharply cut its dividend to reflect spiralling loan losses, especially in US real estate. Mr Stephen Berman, banking analyst at County NatWest in New York, said yesterday that 'there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Their problems don't seem to be totally out of control'. Chase had mixed news regarding problem loans. On the one hand, non-accrual commercial real estate loans continued to mount, rising to Dollars 2.1bn on March 31, from Dollars 1.8bn last December and Dollars 884m a year ago. Other domestic non-accrual loans climbed to Dollars 761m from Dollars 723m last December. Non-accrual loans now stand at 4.9 per cent of assets, compared to 4.6 per cent three months ago, and 3.8 per cent last year. However, the rate of increase in loan write-offs slowed - and in some types of business was reversed - during the first quarter. Loan-loss provisions were Dollars 240m, up from Dollars 225m a year earlier. Actual loan write-offs, net of recoveries, totalled Dollars 270m, down from Dollars 325m. The latest figure includes Dollars 19m in write-offs on third world debt refinancings compared to Dollars 191m a year earlier. Compared to the previous three months, write-offs on domestic commercial real estate and other non-consumer loans fell slightly in the latest quarter. However they remain far higher than a year ago. Losses on consumer loans continued to rise, reaching Dollars 112m in the latest quarter, up from Dollars 106m three months earlier.</p>

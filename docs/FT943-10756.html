			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Increased car sales lift Cowie Cowie Group, the car leasing and motor trading company, yesterday announced a 32 per cent increase in half-year profits following a sharp rise in car sales and fall in interest costs. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 20.5m as the group exploited new leasing markets and sold almost 28,000 new cars in the six months to June 30, an increase of 23 per cent. The figures were also flattered by reduced interest payments of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 13.2m). Group turnover jumped 25 per cent to Pounds 492m and Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, expressed 'cautious optimism' about future prospects. He said all four core divisions had benefited from the three-prong strategy of organic growth, acquisition and increased efficiency. The performance was underpinned by the group's finance division, dominated by Cowie Interleasing, where new fleet customers and improvements in the renewal business contributed to profits of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 10.7m). Although divisional turnover fell to Pounds 113m (Pounds 117.6m), Mr Hodgson said profit margins had improved on ex-contract hire vehicles and predicted additional benefits from the acquisition in March of Fleet Motor Management, Commercial Union's former leasing business. In the motor division, profits rose to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.65m) on turnover of Pounds 355m (Pounds 249.4m) as the group enjoyed growing sales of both new and used cars at its 42 outlets, including an initial six-month contribution from Keep Trust, the dealership chain acquired for Pounds 39.5m last year. 'The figures were encouraging given the challenging trading conditions and pressure on margins,' said Mr Iain Jane, the division's managing director. Increased demand from bus operators, meanwhile, helped Hughes DAF - the bus and coach distribution business - report healthier profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1m); while Grey-Green, the London bus and coach operator, saw a modest rise to Pounds 863,000 (Pounds 781,000). Earnings per share rose to 10.5p (8p), and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.725p (2.35p). COMMENT Cowie has plenty of power under the bonnet. It boasts well-run dealerships, some blue chip fleet customers and has a good chance of forming a leading bus company following the privatisation of London Transport. Yet the market had hoped for more acceleration and the shares were left trailing 12p yesterday at 256p. This was a little unfair. The results exceeded expectations, just, and the group is set to prosper from the August car boom. Noting Mr Hodgson's cautious approach, analysts left their full-year profit forecasts largely unchanged at Pounds 43.5m. But for those anticipating a rush to the showrooms in the second half, the shares look under-valued on a forward multiple of 11.</p>

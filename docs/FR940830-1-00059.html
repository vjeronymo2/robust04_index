			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 3004(m) of the Hazardous and Solid Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required to set ``levels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term and long-term threats to human health and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment are minimized.'' EPA has interpreted this language to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean treatment standards based on the performance of best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated available technology (BDAT). This interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was sustained by the D.C. Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HWTC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 886 F.2d 355  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. den. 111 S. Ct. 139 (1990). The Agency,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, has recognized that there may be wastes that cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated to the levels specified in the rules, due to the fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the wastes are in a form that is substantially more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to treat than those the Agency evaluated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing the treatment standard (51 FR 40576, November 7,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986), or where the treatment technology is inappropriate for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste. For such wastes, EPA has established a treatability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance (40 CFR 268.44), to establish alternative treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements for qualifying for a site-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatability variance are contained in 40 CFR 268.44(h), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states, ``Where the treatment standard is expressed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration in a waste or waste extract and a waste generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under conditions specific to only one site cannot be treated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specified level or where the treatment technology is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to the waste, the generator or treatment facility may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to the Administrator, or her designated representative, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a site-specific variance from the treatment standard. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant for a site-specific variance must demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly from the waste analyzed in developing the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified levels or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specified methods.'' For a more thorough discussion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions which justify granting a treatability variance and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting information the petitioner is required to submit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> please refer to the November 7, 1986  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also known as the Solvents and Dioxins Final LDR Rule (51 FR 40605&hyph;40606).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Site Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific site addressed by this proposed variance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at Citgo Corporation's Lake Charles Refinery, 4401  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana Highway 108 in Calcasieu County in the southwest corner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Louisiana. The surface impoundment in question, referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the ``Surge Pond'' in Citgo's literature, is situated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately adjacent to the west bank of the Calcasieu River,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 10 miles southwest of Lake Charles and 15 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> north of the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge. The Surge Pond has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a surface area of twenty six (26) acres. Much of the pond is 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 20 feet deep; the deepest part is about 40 feet deep. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water surface elevation of the pond is six feet above sea level;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water layer is about 15 feet deep. The bottom of the pond is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filled with sludge which has been accumulating since the 1940's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pond has been receiving untreated petroleum refining process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water and stormwater runoff from the site throughout most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site's history. The sludge at the bottom of the pond is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary sludge generated by the settling of petroleum refining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater and thus meets the definition of RCRA Hazardous Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Codes F037 and F038.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Surge Pond discharges into the old onsite wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment system. This system consists of an earthen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equalization basin, followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks, an earthen aeration basin, clarifier tanks, a settling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pond, a polishing pond, and then discharges into the Calcasieu  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river at a NPDES regulated outfall (Permit number LA0005941).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The company's request for a treatability variance only includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludge from the Surge Pond; it does not include any sludge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated by the rest of the old wastewater treatment system.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new onsite wastewater treatment system has been in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation since May 13, 1994. The system now receives stormwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and process wastewater from the site. The system consists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily of above ground tanks with floating roofs. Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from the tanks are routed to a vapor control system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new wastewater flow path is from API separators, to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equalization tank, to a DAF unit, to aerated activated sludge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks, to a clarifier. Clarifier effluent discharges to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settling pond of the old wastewater treatment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Regulatory History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Regulations Applying to Citgo's Surge Pond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Surge Pond began operating in the late 1940's, and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been generating sludge since that time. The RCRA regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history of the impoundment, set out in full in Citgo's petition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is complicated. (See Citgo's variance petition for a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thorough discussion of the regulatory history of Citgo's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refinery.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of this history is not relevant for evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition. It is clear, however, that the sludge in the pond is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as F037 and F038; as such, it became subject to the land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal restriction treatment requirements and prohibitions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1994, the date that the national capacity variance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this waste expired. See &sect;268.36 (c), promulgated at 57 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37271 (Aug. 18, 1992). Thus, the sludge or any residues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated from its treatment cannot be placed on the land,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including back in the Surge Pond, unless first treated to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment standards for F037/F038, since the impoundment does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not qualify as a section 3005 (j) (11) impoundment. Nor does the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company want to put the treated sludge back into the impoundment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company has also constructed a new tank-based wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment system to replace the old system of surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impoundments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

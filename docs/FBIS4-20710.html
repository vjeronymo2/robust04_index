			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sofiane Bensalem: "Schools and Public Buildings: </F> Upsurge in Sabotage"--first two paragraphs are EL WATAN  introduction]    [Text] The first half of the month of Ramadan was  particularly bloody. At a time when Algerians aspired to "return  to a state of calm" in a period of devotion favorable to  meditation and solidarity, terrorism showed its claws. With rare  ferocity.    We even had the impression that the armed groups, cornered  and losing ground among the population, threw all their forces  into the battle this month.    Result: an unbelievable increase in attacks and  assassinations, especially in the Algiers area, and therefore an  ever longer victims list, in spite of the vigilance and fighting  spirit of the police, who remain mobilized to prevent the worst  from happening.    Therefore, there were deaths, many deaths during these first  two weeks of Ramadan, but also many acts of economic and  cultural sabotage. In fact, simultaneously with the  assassinations that they commit with a violence and an atrocity  that are beyond all understanding, the fundamentalists were out  to destroy public enterprises and schools by setting them on  fire.    The security departments indicated that, during the last 48  hours only, several companies and schools were destroyed by  terrorists. In the Blida area, four schools, the seat of an APC  [People's Communal Assembly], and that of a state-owned  asphalting company were set on fire.    In the Tipaza governorate, the rolling enclosure of a  state-owned company, a school, and a telephone distributing  frame were also destroyed through arson. At Relizane and  throughout Algeria, we can see the same devastation, the  "scorched earth" which, by force of circumstances, has become  the terrorists' macabre signature. From another source, we  learned that about 20 schools were destroyed since the beginning  of the year, while 100 or so teachers were killed by terrorists,  often under particularly atrocious conditions.    The toll is already heavy. Citizens no longer know where to  turn, as they are subjected daily to a veritable terror  psychosis. What can they do in such an atmosphere? This question  is on everyone's mind as we face a very dangerous upsurge in  fundamentalist activism, which obviously intends to gain ground  in order to prevent democratic society from expressing itself.    It is through fear and systematic destruction that the  fundamentalists challenge the new government. That is also the  proof that their arguments do not carry much weight compared  with the social and economic realities of Algeria, which  essentially rejects criminals.</p>

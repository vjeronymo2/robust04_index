			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Phnom Penh, April 12 (AFP) -- Unidentified gunmen  abducted two Britons and an Australian travelling in a taxi from  Phnom Penh to the port town of Sihanoukville, British embassy  officials said Tuesday.    "The car was stopped around 5.30 p.m. by armed gunmen, they  were taken out of the car and ordered into the bush," an embassy  official said.    The taxi driver was then ordered to drive on, he said.    The three, who were only identified as a male and female  from  Britain and a woman from Australia, were abducted near Sre Ambel  about 130 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, the  official said.    The embassy official refused to call the incident a  kidnapping.    "No ransom has been demanded and there is no reason to  believe one will be," he said.    A local police officer told AFP by telephone that he  believed  the Khmer Rouge were responsible.    "If it was government soldiers they would just ask for money  or cigarettes," the officer said.    The embassy official said two of the three abducted were  residents here and one was a tourist. [passage omitted]</p>

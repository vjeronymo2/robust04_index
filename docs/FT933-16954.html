			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (9): Cross border deals blossom / Review Franco-German financial relations ON the last working day of 1992, shareholders in Germany's second largest insurance group approved the sale of Germany's sixth largest bank to Credit Lyonnais, the large state-sector French bank. The timing of the deal was charged with symbolism: shareholders in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the second biggest insurance group in Germany after the Allianz colossus, approved the sale of a majority stake in BfG Bank to the French institution on the very eve of the formal opening of the single European market. This DM1.9bn transaction was linked with a second, related deal, bringing AMB into a formal co-operation agreement with Assurances Generales de France (AGF), a large French insurance company. This brought the management of AGF on to the board of AMB, allowing it to exercise full control over a 25 per cent stake in AMB - accumulated against the initial wishes of the German company's management. These two related deals were part of a series of cross-border alliances forged between German and French financial institutions during the past year. Companies from the two neighbouring countries have been taking steps to make the single market a practical reality. Three further examples of this are: Dresdner Bank - Germany's second biggest bank - which has completed a co-operation agreement with Banque Nationale de Paris. The contract, which will be sealed with a 10-per cent cross-holding later this year if BNP is privatised according to plan, provides for detailed co-operation in a number of areas. The two banks will make use of each others' home country branch networks. They will pursue expansion into third countries jointly and they have already formed joint banks in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Although contractual agreements of this sort are haunted by the memory of the failure of a similar agreement between Credit Lyonnais and Commerzbank, both parties are convinced that they have worked out the scope of the co-operation to the smallest detail - and that the agreement is the best way for both to expand beyond their home markets. The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - Germany's thriving electronic futures and options exchange - is working with Matif, the French derivatives exchange, on an ambitious plan to link their markets. Under the agreement, members of the two exchanges will be able to trade each other's products. Matif will also gain access to the DTB's screen-based dealing technology. BHF-Bank, a Frankfurt-based institution which likes to call itself the 'German merchant bank', joined forces with Credit Commercial de France to buy a 90 per cent stake in Charterhouse, a UK merchant bank. The Pounds 235m deal represents a Franco-German initiative to build up a three-legged cross-border merchant banking group. The largest of the four transactions was the AGF/AMB and Credit Lyonnais/BfG deal, completed only after months of horse-trading between some of France and Germany's largest financial institutions. During this long-winded process the chief executive of AMB lost his job, mainly because he opposed the process of co-operation with the French. For mergers and acquisitions followers it was a continental European treat: the deals were done in back-rooms, far from the scrutiny of the financial markets, with one supervisory board chief haggling with another. In this battle of the giants the interests of minority shareholders were hardly paramount. UK merchant banking advisers played a role, but all too often a limited one: SG Warburg advised Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, AMB's chief executive, on how to stay independent of the French; the advice was to no avail - Baumgartl was ousted by the pro-French chairman of his own supervisory board. An added note of exoticism was provided by AMB's defence strategy, which was to hide behind a special class of 'vinculated ' shares, which gave AMB the right to decide who should have voting rights and who should not. If the affair began last year on a distinctly unfriendly, non-European note, relations between the insurance companies became more harmonious. The votes on the vinculated shares were recognised after the French were able to provide AMB with a solution to its BfG problem. BfG-Bank - originally the Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft, a trades union bank - came under AMB's control more than five years ago. The aim was for the bank to sell the insurance company's products, but the venture into 'Allfinanz' was ill-fated. The bank suffered from its exposure to the Co-Op retailer (which nearly went bankrupt in 1989) and from high exposure to problem country sovereign loans. BfG-Bank cost its parent billions of D-Marks, and was a millstone around its neck, especially at a time of change in the German insurance market. But for Credit Lyonnais the opportunity to buy the bank, with 200 branches in east and western Germany, represented a one-off chance to establish a significant presence in the German banking market. Thus all parties were happy when AMB introduced Credit Lyonnais - its fellow state sector institution - as a buyer for BfG. In return, AGF won its influence over the big German insurer. The deal was opportunistic. But the net result was co-operation in keeping with the spirit of the single market programme which took effect soon after shareholders voted their approval at the end of last year.</p>

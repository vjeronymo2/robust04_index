			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: The pensions manager and the pudding . . . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu digests an ombudsman's report PENSIONS can inflame passions. One complaint last year to the pensions ombudsman, who arbitrates in disputes, was from a woman who had written 14 times to the trustees of her late husband's scheme. She was angry over the delay in paying her a widow's pension. But she had failed to tell the trustees he had died and had sent the letters to the wrong address, anyway. Happy to make amends, the pensions manager invited her to the pensioners' Christmas party and arranged her transport - only to see his kindness repaid by the woman throwing her Christmas pudding and custard at him. Hers was one of the 2,166 complaints received by Michael Platt, the pensions ombudsman, last year and described in his annual report for 1992, published this week. The scheme was established in 1991 to investigate complaints of injustice due to alleged maladministration by the trustees or managers of an occupational or personal pension scheme, and to arbitrate on disputes of fact or law with the trustees. If you have a complaint, you should first try to sort it out with the trustees or managers of your pension scheme. Failing that, write to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service. If OPAS cannot solve the problem, it will forward the complaint to the pensions ombudsman. (The insurance ombudsman deals with complaints about personal pensions). Last year, Platt referred almost 40 per cent of complaints received to OPAS, since they had not been sent there first. About 27 per cent fell outside his jurisdiction. In another 28 per cent, an investigation was not carried out because of lack of evidence of maladministration or because transfer values, while low, were correct. And some complaints fell outside the prescribed time limit. For these reasons, Platt was able to resolve only 59 of the complaints he received last year - but the great majority of these went in favour of complainants. He found wholly in their favour in 27 cases, and in part in another 19 cases. This is an increase on the previous year - the first year of the scheme - when he upheld 22 cases wholly or in part in favour of the complainant out of the 47 investigated. But Platt feels it is too soon to say if last year's result was just a short-term blip. The average investigation took 10 months compared with seven months the previous year. Platt is unhappy about this and has set up a screening procedure to let people know within weeks if their case will be investigated. Most complaints were about maladministration or transfer values, where scheme operators delayed either giving a transfer quotation or making the transfer payment. In one case, a man left a private employer to join the public sector in March 1990. It was not until December that the insurance company managing his pension gave him a transfer quotation, despite his request for one in June. His new employer said that the quotation would give a service credit of 18 years if it received the transfer by April 1991. But it was not until June 1991 that the transfer was made and, under the rules of the new scheme, his service credit had to be re-calculated down to 13 years. Platt decided that the insurance company, which was aware of the April deadline, had taken too long to make the transfer and directed it to pay an additional transfer value to the new scheme to provide the complainant with a service credit of 18 years. This amounted to Pounds 12,500. He also told it to pay compensation of Pounds 200. The highest compensation pay-out instructed last year was Pounds 2,800, but most fell between Pounds 100-Pounds 250. The decisions of the ombudsman are not binding, however, and two schemes refused to pay compensation. Platt said many complaints came from a failure by pension schemes to tell members clearly and simply about their rights. These included the options open to member when leaving an employer. Members should be vigilant and should not allow themselves to be fobbed off with explanations they did not understand, he said. And they should keep all documents to make it easier to resolve disputes. OPAS 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB; the pensions ombudsman shares the same address. The insurance ombudsman is at City Gate One, 135 Park Street, London SE1 9EA.</p>

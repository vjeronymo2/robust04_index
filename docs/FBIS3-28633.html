			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials and articles published by Seoul vernacular newspapers  on 9 February on the crisis situation on the Korean peninsula  concerning North Korea's nuclear issue.    The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on  page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Is the Government Making  Proper Preparations To Cope With the Crisis Situation?" and  notes the security-related ministers' meeting held in  Chongwadae, presidential office, on 8 February to discuss North  Korea's nuclear issue. The editorial summarizes the three main  points of the meeting: One, if the United Nations impose  sanctions against North Korea in the event no agreement is  reached on nuclear inspections, our government will support the  sanctions; two, our government will make constant efforts to  hold dialogue with North Korea; and three, the current situation  on the Korean peninsula is causing a degree of uneasiness among  the people. The editorial notes: "What is clear at present is  that there are more things we are not aware of than things we  are aware of in connection with the security situation on the  Korean peninsula. We are not aware of the degree of North  Korea's nuclear weapon development and we do not know how it  will use its nuclear card in the future." Noting the recent  U.S. media reports about the tension on the Korean peninsula,  the article stresses: "We should constantly review in a  multilateral way our security situation and map out a policy to  maintain security." The editorial notes the likelihood that  because North Korea is aware of its limits in negotiations with  the United States, it will participate in North-South dialogue.  The editorial concludes that the government should take  measures to prepare for the resumption of North-South dialogue.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a  1,000-word editorial entitled "Security Meeting and People's  Attention," and notes the people's desire that "North Korea's  nuclear development should be prevented without fail. However,  the issue of preventing North Korea from developing nuclear  weapons should be resolved peacefully and any unfortunate  situation should be avoided." The editorial quotes President  Kim Yong-sam as saying at the security-related ministers'  meeting: "North Korea's nuclear issue is facing a grave crisis  because of dissension between North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, over inspection methods. Even  though the situation on the Korean peninsula is not in a state  of crisis situation at the moment, the cabinet should take  multilateral measures against a sudden difficulty." Regarding  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the  editorial reports: "He should persuade the U.S. Administration  to understand our will to resolve peacefully North Korea's  nuclear issue. He should negotiate a method with the U.S.  Administration to get North Korea to accept nuclear  inspections." The editorial notes the importance of the  government's efforts to resolve diplomatically North Korea's  nuclear issue even after North Korea's nuclear issue is referred  to the UN Security Council. The editorial notes the people feel  uneasy about the situation on the Korean peninsula because the  government has remained silent about the spreading crisis  situation on the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes: "It  is important to resolve peacefully North Korea's nuclear issue  before it enters a grave stage and to implement a policy to cope  with a worst case scenario. The government should not forget,  however, that they should inform the people of the status of  negotiations with the North, the trends in North Korea, and the  situation on the Korean peninsula. By so doing, the government  should seek the people's cooperation through consensus."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3  a 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Should Make the  People Feel Relieved" and notes recent foreign press reports  that tensions have been heightened on the Korean peninsula. The  editorial cites the security-related ministers' meeting held on  8 February as deciding: "The current situation on the Korean  peninsula cannot be regarded as a crisis situation. Even though  North Korea's defensive drills and strengthening of underground  military facilities have been observed, there is no sign of an  immediate military provocation." The editorial continues: "It  is urgent that the government should dissipate the people's  sense of uneasiness about our security situation on the Korean  peninsula. The government should, above all, encourage the  people to engage in their work without worrying about security  because misunderstandings and rumors of a groundless crisis  situation could result in considerable economic and social  damage." The editorial urges the government to analyze closely  North Korea's situation and inform the people of North Korea's  trends. The editorial concludes: "It is necessary for the  government to make efforts to strengthen the ROK-U.S. security  cooperative system and to frequently inform the people and  foreign enterprises of the government's policy toward the North.  By so doing, the government will create an atmosphere for the  people and foreign enterprises to work without uneasiness."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page  3 a 1,200-word article by Pak Chong-mun noting "the emergence of  the pessimistic opinion that North Korea's nuclear issue is  rushing toward a catastrophe regardless of one or two relevant  authorities' desire to control the nuclear issue." The article  summarizes "objective circumstantial factors about North Korea's  nuclear issue as follows: It is highly likely that North Korea  will not accept IAEA full-scale inspections in the future. If  North Korea does not give a positive answer about nuclear  inspections by 21 February when the regular meeting of the IAEA  Board of Governors is expected to be held, the IAEA plans to  report North Korea's noncompliance with obligatory inspections  [uimusachal] to the UN Security Council; and the ROK and the  United States will no longer be able to seek negotiations with  North Korea." The article notes the IAEA and the United  Nations, the ROK, the United States, Japan, and China are put  into a difficult position because of objective circumstantial  factors. After elaborating on the ROK-U.S. position on North  Korea's nuclear issue, the article notes China's position:  "China is facing a difficult position in that it can neither  veto nor favor the U.S.-led resolution on sanctions against  North Korea. To avoid the current circumstances, China seems to  be making every effort to persuade North Korea." Regarding  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the  article reports that "considering the fact that Minister Han has  left for the United States approximately one week ahead of  schedule, there seems to be reasons other than the Foreign  Ministry's explanation."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Ovsiyenko report: "`Quiet' Send-off for Russian </F> Troops From Germany. Official Bonn Insists on It"]    [Text] Berlin -- Soviet and Russian troops have been on  German territory for almost half a century. Our last soldier  will leave the now-united country 31 August this year, and a  major military grouping that had once been abroad will return  home.    Many Western politicians, particularly in the FRG, are  calling this a historic event, linking it to the end of the  "Cold War." And they are right. Units of what was then the  Group of Soviet Forces in Germany took part in the Berlin events  of 1953 and 1961, went into Prague in August 1968....    At the same time, the almost 50-year presence of this  military grouping in central Europe has been a deterrent. The  same politicians are right to link peace on the European  continent with the presence in Germany of the Western Group of  Forces [WGF]....    Thus, a dignified withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany  is a matter of prestige for our country which enhances still  further its authority in Europe and the world (particularly  following our diplomatic successes in Yugoslavia).    Speaking at a Berlin press conference at the end of last  year, Colonel General M. Burlakov, commander in chief of the  WGF, made public the Russian proposals for the ceremonial  send-off, which, as he put it, had been submitted to the Russian  president. They included two stages -- April-May (memorial to  our fallen servicemen) and August (ceremonial assembly in Berlin  of an honor guard made up of Russian and allied troops and the  Bundeswehr, a march, a ceremonial Reichstag session with the  participation of the two states' leaders, and a "roundtable" for  World War II veterans)....    The commander-in-chief then advised that the German  leadership had not reacted in any way to these proposals, which  had previously been conveyed to the German side.    Last March I talked with Defense Minister Army General P.  Grachev. Holding talks with his colleague (FRG Defense Minister  V. Ruehe) he noted that the question of the send-off ceremony  for the Russian troops comes under the jurisdiction of the two  leaders -- President Yeltsin and Chancellor Kohl.    Until recently official Bonn in its discussion of the  Russian  troop send-off had restricted itself to bland diplomatic  formulas. The Berlin Senate was quite definite and did not  indulge in any diplomatic equivocation in insisting on separate  send-offs for the Russian and allied troops -- from the United  States, Britain, and France. Although the last WGF soldier will  leave Germany "quietly" 31 August, the allies can expect a  triumphant send-off in Berlin in early September.    The Berlin Senate's statement began to feature in the FRG  newspapers, and was disseminated, with some confusion, by world  news agencies....    An attempt was being made for the umpteenth time to put  Russia in its place and silence it. And by whom -- the Berlin  Senate! Was it right to resolve on behalf of the federal  government political problems that are of European and world  rather than municipal importance?...    Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry, our Bonn  Embassy, and its Berlin office failed to react at all to the  Berlin Senate's move. As subsequent events were to show, this  was wrong.    At a Bonn press conference in late March Chancellor Kohl  voiced his version (now the official version) of the allied  troops' send-off from Germany. It differs little from the  Senate version. The French Foreign Ministry, by insisting on a  parade, forced Bonn to abandon its intention to give the allied  troops a modest send-off from Berlin.    Now the chancellor has promised our World War II allies a  triumphant send-off ceremony with a military parade, banners,  and music....    Explaining this sudden decision, H. Kohl stated that it was  the logical conclusion to the stormy debates about the send-off  to be given to the allied troops who had for 50 years guaranteed  the preservation of the status of West Berlin....    What about the Russian troops? Bonn is insisting on a  "quiet" send-off far from Berlin, at WGF Headquarters in  Wuensdorf. Whereas the allied send-off will end, for instance,  with a ceremony of mourning at the Brandenburg Gates, no such  ceremony is envisaged for the Russian troops.    I would recall that in the Berlin Operation our forces lost  over 300,000 men. And it would be blasphemous not to pay our  respects to them one last time.    The German capital is going further in its division into  worthy and less worthy. The allied ceremony on 8 September will  be addressed by Presidents Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand,  and by Prime Minister John Major. The Russian president and the  federal chancellor will speak 31 August at the memorial to the  Soviet troops in Treptow.    ...Europe is no longer the way it was in the fifties and  sixties, at the height of the "Cold War." There will be no  return to a past which brought the peoples to the brink of a  dangerous confrontation. History cannot be rewritten to suit  short-term interests. People are in agreement on that in both  East and West.    But, on the other hand, how can we understand the Bonn  authorities' decision to have separate send-off ceremonies for  the World War II allies, dividing them into worthy and unworthy,  and essentially revising this same history?</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: AT&amp;T extends offer for NCR AMERICAN Telegraph and Telephone (AT&amp;T) yesterday extended its Dollars 90-a-share tender offer for NCR, the Ohio-based computer manufacturer, until May 20. AT&amp;T offered to increase the bid price to Dollars 110 a share over a week ago, but suggested replacing the consideration by paper rather than cash. Mr Charles Exley, NCR chairman, has said he would recommend that his board accept this, but only if certain protection was provided against a fall in the AT&amp;T share price. MIDWAY Airlines, the struggling Chicago-based carrier which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, yesterday reported a net loss of Dollars 16.4m in the first quarter of 1991. Revenues in the three-month period were down from Dollars 157.2m to Dollars 151.7m, but operating expenses fell more sharply, to Dollars 169.1m from Dollars 183.3m. At the beginning of the quarter, the company began to pull out of its ill-fated Philadelphia expansion scheme, having agreed to sell assets there to USAir. The net loss compared with a Dollars 22.9m deficit in the same period of 1990.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: A DUALISTIC GRAHAM PARKER, A SOULFUL MIKI HOWARD;  </P> <P> GRAHAM PARKER "HUMAN SOUL." MCA ***: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR  (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> "When I get mad I'm really a drag," sings Parker by way of introducing his  latest, contradicting the wisdom of die-hard fans who like him good 'n' angry.  He goes on to quote his patient love: "Lighten up, fella," she tells him  repeatedly in the chorus of the opening "Little Miss Understanding," and  indeed, Parker spends most of the album's first side in the same sort of  tight-lipped, R&amp;B-tinged mode that characterized most of his early- and  mid-'80s output, being buoyed by the love of a woman who has wrought peaceful  havoc with the work of a once perfectly bitter artist.  </P> <P> A visit to his local mall in the humbly self-deprecating "Big Man on Paper"  inspires a few broadsides on popular culture ("Look at the youth in their  Whitesnake T-shirts / They're wearing a poor man's version of the haircut / Man  they might as well be from another universe," he sings, more alienated from  rock fashion than ever). But mostly, he admits, "The bills on my table / Or my  kid's first Halloween disguise" keep him from getting too worked up over the  sorts of things that once would have had him spitting vitriol instead of  playing the skanking family man.  </P> <P> But wait, what's this? Side 2? The "surreal side," an almost nonstop song suite  with a harder edge in which narrator Graham sleepwalks through the bemusing,  confusing waking dream that is the news of the world outside his domestic  tranquility? By dividing this album into neat halves, Parker finally gets to  have it both ways -- lover and fighter; relaxed, settled-down soulster and  Angry Aging Man. The production could stand to be sharper and the songs are  uneven, but in scope, ambition and self-integration, he's closed out the '80s  with what is at least his most interesting album of the decade.

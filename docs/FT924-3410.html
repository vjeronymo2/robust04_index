			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: In Shops falls to Pounds 0.9m but sees recovery IN SHOPS, the Birmingham-based property group specialising in retail centres and serviced offices, reported reduced interim profits but predicted recovery in its next financial year. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September were Pounds 903,000, against Pounds 1.05m, on turnover up at Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 11.1m). Earnings per share were 1.7p (2.05p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.66p. During the first half In Shops lost Pounds 250,000 on its serviced office operations, but the retail centre business continued to expand. New retail centres opened in Aberdeen and Paisley in Scotland and at Kings Heath and Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands. Although the second half was likely to be only marginally more profitable than the first, Mr Brookes believed the worst of recession had been seen but that recovery would not be reflected in business confidence for at least six months.</p>

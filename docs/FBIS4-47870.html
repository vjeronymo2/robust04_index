			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 5 SAPA -- Hernus Kriel's easy smile,  twinkling eyes and verligte [enlightened] image disguise a tough  and experienced politician, a man who since August 1991 has been  handling what is probably the most difficult and controversial  portfolio in the De Klerk cabinet -- that of law and order.    Kriel was born in Kakamas on November 14, 1941, and moved  with his family to Wellington in 1947 where he started and  completed his schooling.    He obtained a BA and LLB from the University of Stellenbosch  in 1964, and the following year took a job as public prosecutor  in Bellville.    In 1968, after completing his articles, he established his  own law practice in Parow, and in 1978 entered the business  world by establishing a mining company. He sold his interests  in the company in 1980, when he started practicing as an  advocate.    Kriel was elected to the Cape Divisional Council in 1974 as  representative for Parow. In 1976 he was elected the  youngest-ever chairman of the council, and served on the  executive of the Association of Divisional Councils and on the  United Municipal Executive.    In the 1977 general election he was elected unopposed to the  provincial council, and in 1981, after being re-elected  unopposed, he was appointed to the province's executive  committee in the local government portfolio.    In a 1984 by-election Kriel became MP for Parow.    In September 1989 president FW de Klerk appointed him  minister of planning and provincial affairs, to which national  housing was later added. He also served as minister of local  government in the Ministers' Council of the House of Assembly.    In this portfolio Kriel was deeply involved with land reform  and squatter issues. Under him, the separate Amenities and  Group Areas Acts were scrapped, and controversy flared over the  Residential Environment Bill, aimed at beefing up control over  residential norms and standards, which was to have come in the  wake of group areas. The bill was eventually dropped.    Earlier, Kriel had reportedly said in a conversation with  journalists that if black people wanted to bargain with the NP  [National Party] for the scrapping of the Group Areas Act, they  had to be prepared to give up something equally dear in their  own culture -- and he mentioned the lobola [dowry] system as an  example.    He is also reported to have said he believes former Premier  John Vorster is the father of political reform in South Africa.    In June 1991 Kriel announced that fast reaction "squatter  auxiliary units" were to be set up by the provincial  administrations in cooperation with the police to deal with  suspected squatting.    On August 31 1991 he was sworn in as minister of law and  order in place of Adriaan Vlok, who was sidelined to the  correctional services portfolio after revelations that police  had funded an Inkatha rally.    Kriel immediately pledged himself to restoring the SAP's  [South African Police] image as an unbiased non-partisan force.    In March 1992, announcing a comprehensive anti-crime  strategy, he said the government was "deadly serious" about  clamping down on lawlessness.    The strategy included the formation of an Internal Stability  Division which would eventually be four times the size of its  predecessor the Riot Squad and boosting the 94,000 strong police  force by almost 16,000 new recruits.    In May that year Kriel joined the government's Codesa  [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] team, and  subsequently became a leading and tough-talking government  spokesman on negotiations.    As political head of the police, Kriel has had to deal with  criticisms of police conduct in the Trust Feeds and Boipatong  killings, and with claims by Pathologist Dr Jonathan Gluckman of  large scale killings of prisoners in police custody.    In August 1992, after the compilation of the Waddington  Report on Boipatong, he said 18 police generals would take early  retirement, and admitted that a racist policy in the force had  thus far prevented black officers from reaching the general  staff. He announced the immediate promotion of officers who had  been discriminated against in the past.    Kriel and his wife Juliette were divorced in 1993. They had  two daughters and a son.</p>

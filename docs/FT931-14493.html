			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Swap market goes into overdrive to keep pace WITH the Eurobond machine cranked up and running on all cylinders, the swap market has been working overtime to keep up. Spreads in the swap market have narrowed as a result - though even at the end of last week, rates in several currencies were only just below levels at which more borrowers could be tempted into the bond market. Few of the recent headline-grabbing D-Mark issues are thought to have been swapped into other currencies. Borrowers like Italy and Finland, which between them have raised DM8bn so far in 1993, need the currency to replenish reserves or repay the Bundesbank for its activities to support their currencies. There is one big exception in the D-Mark market: a spate of reverse floating rate notes (close to DM1bn in all last week) aimed at retail investors who want to gear up their bets on falling German interest rates. Virtually all of this is likely to have been offset through the swap market. Unlike the D-Mark, virtually all borrowing in Canadian dollars (CDollars 2.5bn of it so far this year) is prompted by arbitrage opportunities presented by the swap market. The arbitrage arises from the steady stream of domestic Canadian entities willing to pay the fixed-rate leg of a swap transaction: Canadian mortgage loans, for instance, are largely fixed-rate, and the banks which make such loans are natural swap-market counterparties, exchanging their fixed-rate payment streams for floating-rate ones. The swap market operates between this domestic Canadian market and the fixed-rate euro-Canadian dollar market, which is used by international borrowers whose standing allows them to tap into international demand for the Canadian dollar, but who are not natural users of the currency. Canadian dollar swap spreads at the end of last week stood at 68-69 basis points for five-year maturities, having slipped at the end of the week before. Even at that level they remain attractive to Euromarket borrowers. Sterling swap spreads also started the year at a healthy level. A belief in some quarters that interest rates will rise again before too long has prompted more demand from treasurers wanting to lock into fixed rates at current levels. However, the prospect of another interest rate cut has also kept most on the sidelines, waiting longer before taking the plunge and moving back down the yield curve. Five-year sterling swap spreads narrowed last week by between five and 10 basis points, reducing the attractiveness of Eurosterling. As Canadian dollar and sterling swap rates have eased, borrowers turned last week to another arbitrage to shave a little more off their borrowing costs - the different shape of the swap and the underlying government bond yield curves. In theory, the two should mirror each other: in practice, government bond curves are dictated by certain benchmark issues, making them a less efficient pricing mechanism for maturities which fall where there is no benchmark issue. The end of last week saw almost identical bond issues in the sterling and Canadian dollar markets with maturities of just over five and a half years. Priced off the five-year benchmark bonds, these issues take advantage of the mismatching yield curves in both currencies during 1998. The swap curves take full account of higher longer-dated rates for such maturities, while the government bond curves do not. The three sterling borrowers who took advantage of this are reckoned to have saved a net 5-10 basis points in yield.</p>

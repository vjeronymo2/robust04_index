			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Finns to debate new nuclear plant EUROPEAN energy industry leaders and environmentalists will be watching the Finnish parliament closely today as debate opens on whether to approve construction of a nuclear power plant. The project, one of a few of its kind in Europe, has become the focus for wider arguments over the merits of nuclear power. Within Finland, it has prompted sharp debate in recent years, with the outcome of a free vote by MPs due on Friday still uncertain. Commercial interests are watching developments closely. Bids to build the proposed FM10bn-FM15bn (Dollars 1.75bn-Dollars 2.62bn) plant have already been received from ABB Atom of Sweden, Atomenergoexport of Russia and NPI, a consortium formed by Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France. Finland already has four nuclear reactors, built in the 1970s, with a total capacity of 2,300MW. They supply about a third of the country's electricity needs. Two, at Loviisa, east of Helsinki, are Soviet-made pressurised water reactors with Finnish control systems. The other two are Swedish-built boiling water reactors at Olkiluoto, on the south-west coast. In 1975, talks began on building a fifth reactor of about 1,000MW capacity at one of the existing sites. By 1986 the authorities were close to giving the go-ahead when the Chernobyl nuclear accident led to radioactive fallout over Finland. The project was frozen until two years ago. The cabinet finally gave its assent, by an 11-6 vote, in February, but that only intensified a debate which has split the two largest parties, the governing Centre party and the opposition Social Democrats. Mr Markku Nurmi, a member of the national Energy Policy Council, says Finland should not buck the international trend away from nuclear power. He rejects projections showing steeply rising demand for electricity as outdated. But Mr Juhani Santaholma, head of the nuclear power utility Pevo, says electricity consumption has gone on rising in spite of a fall in overall energy consumption resulting from recession and several mild winters. He insists that demand will rise significantly and that a new nuclear plant is the only realistic way of bridging the gap. Finland's energy-thirsty and powerful forestry industry is behind Pevo, as are the unions. But the anti-nuclear camp has some key supporters of its own, including Mr Esko Aho, prime minister and leader of the Centre party.</p>

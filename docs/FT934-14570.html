			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand forests threatened with gypsy moth bombardment A MAJOR hunt is under way for the feared Asian gypsy moth in New Zealand amid fears that it could devastate the country's native and exotic forests, one of the country's biggest export earners. The search follows the discovery of clusters of moth eggs on a ship from China and the Russian Far East. The Forestry Ministry says that the moth would devastate New Zealand's forests, exports of which earn the country NZDollars 2.3bn a year and are forecast to grow rapidly with vast areas of farmland being planted with pinus radiata at present. The gypsy moth has already appeared the US and Canada, forcing the authorities to undertake costly measures eradication measures, such as aerial spraying of forests. Vancouver city was recently sprayed at the cost of NZDollars 8m. The ship was not allowed to berth in New Zealand and sent back fully laden to Asia. This is the latest in a series of vessels found to be carrying the moths' eggs. Forestry Ministry official Mr John Handiside believes that the moths may have already established themselves in New Zealand, as until recently quarantine officials, in the belief the larvae died in the tropical heat on the way from Russia to New Zealand, had not searched for the moth larvae. New information from North America had shattered that belief. Mr Handiside said that the real problem was the moth's caterpillar stage. 'The moths can build up biblical storms of millions and strip forests of their leaves,' he said, adding that their mere presence in New Zealand would pose a threat to timber exports as other countries would be unwilling to risk importing infected timber.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Rate rises in Sweden and Italy hit European markets Surprise interest rate rises in Italy and Sweden threw European financial markets into turmoil yesterday and triggered speculation other continental central banks might follow suit. The Bank of Italy raised two short-term rates, with the key discount rate increasing from 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent. In Sweden, the Riksbank raised its lending rate to banks from 7.5 per cent to 8 per cent, and the important money market repurchase rate from 6.92 per cent to 7.2 per cent. Although the moves by the two central banks were widely seen to be motivated by domestic concerns, they sent shock waves through European bond markets because some investors saw them as confirmation that continental interest rates were on the rise. The move was also felt in the US currency market where the dollar ended sharply lower against other leading currencies on similar expectations of rising European rates. Markets are also nervous ahead of next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's open market committee, which many expect to lead to higher US interest rates. The Bank of Italy also increased its Lombard, or fixed-term advances, rate from 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent, citing the need to defend the lira from speculative attack. However, initially the change was counter-productive. Yesterday evening, the lira was quoted at a record low of L1,016.50 against the D-Mark, compared with a London close of L1,005 10 minutes before the rate move was announced. The Riksbank said its move was designed to counter inflationary pressures. However, the foreign exchange markets were unimpressed, saying that both central banks had failed to address the main issue worrying the markets - the large fiscal deficits of the two countries. The Swedish krona was quoted in London at SKr4.987 against the D-Mark, off a low of SKr5 earlier in the day, but well below Wednesday's close of SKr4.940. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, stressed the detrimental impact of the moves. 'Putting up rates doesn't make your currency stronger . . . and it will be harder for the governments to fund,' she said. She cited the case of the Italian national debt, much of which is financed on a short-term basis. Yesterday's change would add L3,000bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to the cost of debt service in the first year. European markets were surprised by the changes although Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, said the rate rises were a 'timely reminder that we are close to the turning point in world interest rates'. Mr Sanjay Joshi of Daiwa Europe said markets reacted badly over 'the fear that some of the smaller central banks will be forced to follow suit'. Bond prices, which tend to move in the opposite direction to interest rates, fell sharply. In Italy, 10-year government bonds lost 2.6 points, pushing the yield to 11.26 per cent from 10.77 per cent on Wednesday. The yield on Swedish nine-year bonds rose by just over half a percentage point to 11.28 per cent. In the UK, the price of 10-year gilts fell 1 1/2 points, pushing the yield to 8.67 per cent from 8.42 per cent, while in Germany, the yield on 10-year bunds rose to 7.20 per cent from 7 per cent.

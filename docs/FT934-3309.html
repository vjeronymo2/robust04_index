			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / AEG acts to move out of the red AEG is to sell its household appliances business to Electrolux of Sweden in a radical shake-out designed to return the loss-making Daimler-Benz subsidiary to the break-even point in 1995. Other projects outlined by AEG yesterday include joint ventures with General Electric of the US, a new structure for its railways operations, collaboration deals, and the disposal of 'fringe' businesses in lighting and meters. Mr Georg Stockl, AEG chairman, said the changes would reduce turnover from DM11bn (Pounds 4.3bn) last year to DM9.3bn, and the payroll from 60,000 to 48,000. The company would be known as AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie. Mr Stockl gave no details of the price expected for the appliances business, in which Electrolux already has a 10 per cent stake, but said the Swedish group had agreed to keep open the company's three German factories. The deal would give Electrolux an estimated 35 per cent of the German white goods market, compared with 20 per cent, and would increase its share of the European market from 25 per cent to some 30 per cent. Completion of the deal depends on approval by the European Commission competition office. However, the group does not foresee regulatory problems, partly because most of its sales in Germany are generated through an intermediary which is free to choose a different supplier. Early signals suggest the authorities are satisfied that there is enough heavyweight competition, such as Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens. Mr Stockl said a letter of intent had been signed with GE for the US group to take a majority stake in AEG's low voltage switchgear business. GE was also to manage a joint venture embracing both companies' interests in drives automation. AEG is known to be seeking a partner for its loss-making DM1.5bn-a-year railways business. Further savings are expected from intra-group deals under which AEG is to take full control of Daimler's micro-electronics business. The changes at AEG are part of the rationalisation of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial concern. Its Deutsche-Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary, for instance, recently announced the closure of six German sites and warned of further cuts. World stock markets, Page 41</p>

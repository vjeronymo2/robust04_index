			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Orimulsion fuel fails environment test MOVES to introduce the controversial fuel orimulsion into Britain received a setback yesterday when UK pollution inspectors indicated to National Power that they would not approve it without further environmental measures. National Power has been seeking permission to burn the fuel at its power stations at Padiham, Lancs, and Pembroke. The company has asked the inspectors for more time to reformulate its application. 'We have had constructive discussions with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, and there are quite a few issues outstanding to be considered,' the company said last night. National Power hopes to burn 3m-4m tonnes of the fuel a year. Orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel imported from Venezuela, has been denounced by environmentalists as 'the filthy fuel'. The power generation industry accepts that it contains more sulphur than most oil or coal, but argues that its overall emissions are less harmful. It is cheaper than domestically produced coal and competes with imported coal. PowerGen, the smaller of the two power generators, has been burning orimulsion for several years on an experimental basis without environmental controls at two stations in Kent and Cheshire. The fuel acquired some notoriety last year after an accident at the Kent plant left nearby cars corroded. PowerGen burns about 1.5m tonnes a year under permission granted under earlier pollution control regulations. The company is having to reapply under the new regulations. The HMIP did not detail the extra environmental measures it may ask National Power to take before it will grant permission, but they are expected to include flue gas desulphurisation equipment. The stand taken by HMIP was welcomed by the environmental lobby last night. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, said: 'For the first time ever, the government (has) accepted in principle that orimulsion burning causes damage and that steps must be taken to limit its effect.'</p>

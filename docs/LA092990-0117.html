			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> SENTENCING DELAYED IN BABY-SLAYING CASE  </P> <P> Sentencing for Steven Delgado, the Santa Ana man convicted of second-degree  murder in the death of his girlfriend's infant daughter, was postponed Friday  after the judge rejected arguments that Delgado should receive a new trial.  </P> <P> The key element in the defense plea for a retrial centered on recent  confessions by Elizabeth Ruiz, the mother of 11-month-old Amanda Ortiz who was  beaten to death a year ago.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Frederick L. McBride argued that Ruiz's confessions that she  killed her baby -- statements made after Delgado was convicted -- warranted a  new trial.  </P> <P> McBride presented affidavits from Ruiz, one of her friends and from her  therapist attesting to her account of the crime. Ruiz said in a statement that  she knocked her daughter's head against a door, threw her into the air, dropped  her on the ground and beat her with her fists the night the child died.  </P> <P> But Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon countered that Ruiz's confession was not new  evidence, that the jury had known during the trial that the woman was a  possible suspect and that Delgado had implicated himself throughout the trial.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Judge Ragner Engebretsen concurred, and said he  felt confident that the jury made the right decision.  </P> <P> Delgado's sentencing was rescheduled for Oct. 26. He faces 15 years to life in  prison. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

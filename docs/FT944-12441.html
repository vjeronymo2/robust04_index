			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (4): Era of the personality cult - Nikki Tait explains why the opposition parties keep changing their leaders Personalities, not policies, have dominated Australia's federal politics of late. Perhaps the strongest spotlight has fallen on leadership machinations within the Liberal Party, the dominant opposition party. Back in early 1993, when the recession was biting badly, Mr John Hewson, its former leader, lost a seemingly unlosable election to Paul Keating's incumbent Labor Party. For over a year, Hewson then limped on as the wave of destabilising rumours and speculation swelled around him. He finally threw in the towel last May, calling for a party-room ballot. The showdown was surprisingly neat. Two aspiring candidates - Mr Peter Costello, a Victorian lawyer in his late-30s and relative newcomer to federal politics, and Mr Alexander Downer, Hewson's treasury spokesman - collaborated to present a joint 'youth ticket'. It won comfortably with Mr Downer, whose blue-blooded Adelaide family has been involved in politics for three generations, taking the senior job. Mr Costello became shadow treasurer. But matters soon became messy again. Mr Downer, having enjoyed an initial 'honeymoon' in the opinion polls, made a series of public gaffes, the most serious of which concerned opposition policy towards Aboriginal native title rights. The recent decision by Mr Andrew Peacock, the veteran Liberal politician, to quit the federal scene has not been helpful either: while Mr Peacock has reaffirmed his support, speculation over his successor in the blue-ribbon seat of Kooyong has provided an opportunity for gossip-mongering to restart. In the meantime, the opinion polls have switchbacked, and now give Labor a clear edge over the opposition. Mr Keating, who has never ranked highly in the personal popularity stakes, leads Mr Downer as preferred prime minister by a solid margin. But while the Labor side of the equation has been better-organised, it has not been without its own personality upheavals. In early 1994 - and for a wide variety of reasons - the Keating government lost four ministers, including John Dawkins, the former treasurer, and Graham Richardson, who held the health portfolio and was one of the party's key backroom players. Since then, the cabinet has stabilised, but there has been a not-so-subtle lining-up of potential Keating successors. No one believes that the prime minister is set to depart in the short-term. But there is a school of thought which suggests that if he wins the next election, due in 1996, he could then step down midway through the next government's term of office. So Mr Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, has arranged to move from the Senate (parliament's Upper House) to the House of Representatives. This would allow his hat to go into the ring. Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former Western Australian premier who took over Mr Dawkins' seat and Mr Richardson's portfolio, is another possible contender. Mr Kim Beazley, finance minister, and Mr Simon Crean, employment, have also been touted as candidates. All these comings and goings have tended to mask the legislative vacuum. The Keating government pushed through key measures, such as the Native Title legislation and a contentious Industrial Relations act, during its first 12 months of office. This was often uphill work: the government lacks a majority in the Senate, and the Democrats and a couple of Green Party senators who hold the balance of power there caused difficulties. More recently, however, the Keating regime has cooled the tempo. The most conspicuous feature of its last finance package, for example, was the absence of any significant new measures. Opponents spoiling for a fight were left flailing in thin air. The overall result is that the profile of the minor parties has fallen significantly. But perhaps the central question now hanging over Australian federal politics is whether the opposition can find a package of policies which differentiate it sufficiently from a 'middle-of-the-road' Labor government, and yet offers greater appeal to the electorate. This is not an easy task. During the past 10 years, Labor has followed a moderate reform path. This has involved putting a programme of tariff reductions in place, nudging the labour movement towards enterprise-based deals, deregulating key industrial and financial sectors, pushing the Asia-Pacific links, and so on. With a fair amount of skill, and helped by a weak opposition, the government has been moving at its own pace. It has thus retained a broad measure of consensus support. The fate of Mr Hewson, whose 'Fightback' package would have pushed the reforms further and faster, suggests that the Australian electorate will not be wooed by a more radical economic agenda. So the Downer team is taking a different tack. Its first effort has been a broad 'strategy' document called 'The Things that Matter'. This sets out the main policy areas which the party plans to develop in more detail during the run-up to the next election. 'Four key issues define what we believe should be the major priorities of Australia: the creation of jobs, the strengthening of families, the empowerment of communities and the restoration of national cohesiveness and independence,' it reads. The jury is still out on the wisdom of this approach. Many commentators have found little to quarrel with in the document, which is also skilfully packaged. But the big question is the extent to which government niggling will mean that the rather bland generalisations have to be turned into detailed, costed policies. That is when the Labor guns will really fire - if only to divert from a certain lack of new initiatives on their own side. The next 18 months could be interesting.</p>

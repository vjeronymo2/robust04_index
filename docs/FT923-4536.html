			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Berkertex group calls in receivers BERKERTEX, one of Britain's largest bridalwear manufacturers and retailers, went into receivership yesterday after a long period of falling sales, Tim Burt writes. The group, which includes Genesis clothing and Fifth Avenue retailers in central London, employs 1,200 people and has 250 retail outlets. It also has 42 overseas outlets, including 26 in Spain. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been appointed receiver for the group. Mr Christopher Morris Touche Ross said: 'We have started to seek buyers for the Berkertex businesses as going concerns. Trading is continuing while we assess the position.' The fortunes of the group, formed in 1986 through a Pounds 21.6m management buy-out from the Raybeck retail group, have failed to match the profits of the late 1980s when the company bid Pounds 41m for Ellis &amp; Goldstein, the women's clothing group. Its expansion plans were obstructed, however, when Ellis &amp; Goldstein opted instead for a counter-offer from Alexon, another clothing company. In the 1990s the combination of high interest rates and falling consumer spending has hit the company, which last year had a turnover of Pounds 40m.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Police and striking workers in Rio de Janeiro and three other Brazilian cities  fought sporadic battles, leaving 10 people wounded, in the second day of a  48-hour nationwide strike to protest the government's economic austerity  program, officials said. Rio's subway, commuter ferry and government-run  commuter trains, which carry about 1 million passengers a day, remained idle.  Brazil's two main trade unions organized the strike to protest what they  describe as a 40% cut in real wages since March, 1986. The unions are calling  on the government to lift a price and wage freeze, imposed in January to help  control 1,000% inflation.  </P></p>

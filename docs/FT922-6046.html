			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Jenufa - Opera at Glyndebourne Glyndebourne brings back its 1989 production of Jenufa. Three years ago it was already a noble achievement; now it must be deemed one of the festival's unarguable triumphs, superlatively well sung, played, acted and conducted - an experience of 'small-house' Janacek opera, close-meshed in ensemble, that proves almost too much to bear. Stumbling back at the end, blinded by tears and stirred to the marrow, into the civilised Glyndebourne world of Pimms and picnic baskets may be one of life's odder experiences. It is certainly one of British opera's most meaningful and valuable. The tone of the revival - urgent in momentum, never driven in pace - is set by the musical direction of Yakov Kreizberg, the young Russian making his British debut. On this showing he would appear to possess a talent for genuinely dramatic opera-conducting of a rare order. The sonorities drawn from the LPO are no longer refulgently Straussian and string-based, as they were first time round, but athletic, woodwind-dominated - lots of lyrically insistent oboe and plangent bassoon to the fore - and stamped by an airy clarity of texture that lets through the voices and allows the angular phrase-nuggets to soar. The cleaned-up Mackerras-Tyrrell edition used by Glyndebourne sounds not just leanly magnificent but fiercely right; the pulse-beat of the music, keen yet steady, is made indistinguishable from that of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's severely beautiful staging. The two leading sopranos of 1989, Roberta Alexander in the title role and Anja Silja as the sextoness, have returned to the production, to its incalculable benefit. They find in its acutely judged confines an ideal space for creating character through voices and bodies. Miss Silja's gaunt tragic radiance was from the first on the highest level of music-drama, a triumph of sweeping imaginative perception fully realised; now Miss Alexander is every bit her equal, with sweet yet sinewy singing and a heartbreaking quiet warmth of bearing. The two play to each other's strengths with glorious freedom, subtlety and generosity. When they are on stage together, alone or alongside Menai Davies (grandmother), Angela Hickey (mayoral wife) and Elen ap Robert (Karolka), all superb, Jenufa demands to be accounted the great Woman's Opera. But since Kim Begley's heroically sung Laca and Kurt Schreibmayer's trimly handsome Steva (a touch unsteady of voice at climaxes) arrive at the same full-blooded roundness of characterisation, it is in the end Janacek's sublime honesty of vision that Glyndebourne celebrates. In repertory until July 17</p>

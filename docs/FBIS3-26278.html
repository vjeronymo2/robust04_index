We should  encourage peasants to boldly enter the market economy, to  simultaneously develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fisheries, and to comprehensively  develop primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We should  put increasing peasant income in the first place.    Two days ago, Acting Governor Zhang Wule visited some  peasant  households in Shuiyuan Township, Yongchang County, and asked  them about their lives in the period leading to the Spring  Festival. On behalf of the provincial party committee and  government, he expressed his Lunar New Year greetings to the  peasants. In home of a peasant named Wang Jiaoying, Zhang Wule  asked him about his income from grain sales last year, his  purchase of agricultural production materials, and the  township's service for agricultural production, supply, and  marketing. [passage omitted]    When a village party branch secretary told Zhang Wule that  the village people ensured grain acreage in the course of  planting fruit, Zhang Wule expressed agreement with this and  stressed: Gansu is a grain-deficient province, where 6 million  people are short of grain, so developing grain production is  Gansu's basic principle.

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Obituary of Lord Joseph: The principal architect of Thatcherism Lord Joseph, who died on Saturday at the age of 76, was the principal architect of the monetarist approach to economic policy which came to be known as Thatcherism. This was implicitly acknowledged by Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher in her book The Downing Street Years when she described Lord Joseph as her oldest political ally and 'indeed mentor'. Both in his public and private life he will be remembered as an immensely courteous and sometimes surprising man. At Harrow School he spent much of his time playing cricket. As an opening batsman he twice hit a six off the first ball, but never became more than captain of the second eleven. At Oxford he became a fellow of All Souls' and could have had a distinguished academic career. He could also have run the family business Bovis, where he was briefly chairman after having insisted on starting on the building sites and working his way up. Instead he chose politics. Lord Joseph became a monetarist convert after serving as health and social services secretary in the cabinet of Mr (now Sir) Edward Heath from 1970 to 1974. He was one of the big spenders when the money supply increased by 25 per cent in a single year under the chancellorship of Mr Anthony (now Lord) Barber. In a memorable display of candour when he moved over to the opposition front bench after Mr Heath had led the Conservative party to its second successive general election defeat in 1974, Lord Joseph confessed to having been an 'inflationeer'. He further underlined the significance of the sea change in his approach to economic policy after the interventionism of the Heath government by saying: 'I have only recently become a Conservative'. Lord Joseph defined the object of Thatcherism as 'increasing the inequalities' so as to provide the incentives needed to motivate entrepreneurs and innovators at the top, and to facilitate the trickle down effect intended to benefit those at the lower end of the income scale. But having produced the blueprint Lord Joseph realised that he did not possess the political steel needed for the lead role in implementing a policy certain to face formidable opposition from the outset. In spite of attempts by some rightwing backbenchers to persuade him to change his mind, Lord Joseph backed away from an earlier intention to challenge Mr Heath for the leadership of the party. Mrs Thatcher took up the gauntlet instead in 1975, and after replacing Mr Heath she relied heavily on Lord Joseph, who had overall responsibility for policy and research, in the interval before she became prime minister in 1979. Their relationship continued in the seven years he served in her cabinet, first as industry secretary, then in charge of education and science. The initial opposition to Thatcherism came from the 'wets' in the cabinet and on the Conservative back benches, as well as from the other political parties. With Mrs Thatcher happily terming sterling a 'petro-currency', the combination of high interest rates and an over-valued pound had a sharp impact on much of the corporate sector. Unemployment soared, company failures increased, and Lord Joseph soon had to contend with opposition from industry itself. Feelings ran so high in some company boardrooms that in a speech which he later came to regret Sir Terence Beckett, director-general of the CBI, advocated a 'bare knuckle fight' with the government. From the outset Lord Joseph had recognised the limitations of the policy and spelt them out in a pamphlet entitled Monetarism is Not Enough. In this he admitted that whereas cuts in public expenditure rarely materialised, squeezes imposed on the private sector were 'for real'. On those grounds Lord Joseph defended the cabinet's insistence that revenues from North Sea oil should be used to keep down the level of taxation and the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. He was unmoved by demands that they should be used to counter the shrinkage in the industrial base which resulted in Britain becoming a net importer of manufactured goods for the first time in living memory. In the wake of sterling's enforced exit from the European Community's exchange rate mechanism in 1992, Lord Joseph recognised that the manufacturing and services sector of the economy were 'too slim and too thin' to provide the jobs and rising prosperity Britain needed. He still maintained, however, that most of the reasons behind the decline in British business were due to 'long-standing cultural and attitudinal causes'. Lord Joseph was a formidable advocate of rolling back the frontiers of the state, to reverse what he denounced as the 'ratchet' effect of socialism. Lord Joseph's decision not to seek the leadership of the Conservative party was also influenced by the fierce reaction to a speech in which he attacked the 'permissive society' and the moral laxity which resulted in so many young girls becoming unmarried mothers. He underlined the increase in the number of births to mothers in socio-economic classes four and five who, as a result of social deprivation, were least fitted to bring up children. Lord Joseph's conclusion that 'the balance of our population, our human stock, is threatened' caused uproar and he was accused of advocating master-race theories. His willingness to confront any issue also led him into difficulties in the Commons when he advocated the return of capital punishment. Lord Joseph undermined his own case by admitting that for all its deterrent effect hanging would not be a suitable punishment for the category of murders which were the cause of the greatest public concern at the time  - those committed by terrorists. Lord Joseph never shrank from admitting policy failures. For instance, he felt deeply about the environmental and social consequences of the high-rise building developments encouraged during his periods of office at the housing ministry. He served as a junior minister in that department before becoming its political head on being promoted to his first cabinet post by Harold Macmillan in 1962. Lord Joseph entered the Commons in 1956 after winning the safe Tory seat of Leeds North East in a by-election. To those who knew him the question always remained of how such a sensitive, educated and intelligent man could go into politics and bear the opprobrium that was thrown at him. But he did, and perhaps his character and continual asking of questions were more important than any direct political achievements. Lord Joseph made people think.</p>

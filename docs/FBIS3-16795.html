Therefore, it is expedient to prolong the state  of emergency regime in several districts of the region, expiring  on March 31.    "The Russian peace-keeping force is the main security  guarantor in the region," the president claimed.    There are various opinions on the state of emergency regime  in the North Ossetian official quarters and among multinational  population of the republic, ranging from its repeal to  preservation and extension, provided the temporary  administration is transformed and functions of subordinated to  it military units are changed.    This issue will be debated by the North Ossetian Parliament  next week.</p>

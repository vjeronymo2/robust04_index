			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense  Department investigators have found that the IFF (identification  friend or foe) systems of the two U.S. Army helicopters shot  down by U.S. fighter planes were turned off when the incident  took place, it was reported here today.    The two U.S. UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters mistakenly  identified as Iraqi Hind helicopters by the two U.S. Air force  F-15C fighters were shot down in northern Iraq on April 14.    The WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Pentagon officials as saying  that  the switches on the Black Hawks' IFF units were found in the  "off" position when investigators sifted through the wreckage in  the crash sites.    But one official described the findings as preliminary,  saying the crashes' impact might have jarred the switches from  "on" to "off."    The newspaper said if the helicopters had been flying  through  the no-fly zone with the IFF transponder shut off, it would  explain why AWACS [airborne warning and control system] aircraft  got no response when it electronically queried them shortly  before the F- 15C planes fired the missiles.</p>

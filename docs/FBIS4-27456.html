			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] It was reported that on 25 and 26 May, the  Vietnamese killed two Cambodians and wounded five others while  Cambodians killed 30 Vietnamese and burned 60 brick houses and  27 sampans.    The report said that about 500 Vietnamese families totaling  some 3,000 persons have occupied the (Kbal Tao) area along Tonle  Sap lake in Pursat Province. They control all land and  waterways in the area, where there are all sorts of facilities  resembling a floating city for the Vietnamese.    As for the Cambodian people, they cannot earn their living  independently because (Kbal Tao) belongs to the Vietnamese. The  Cambodians can earn a living only by catching fish for the  Vietnamese boss. [passage omitted]    While the Vietnamese earn from 50,000 to 100,000 riel from  selling fish caught by Cambodians, the Cambodian workers do not  have enough to eat.    On the afternoon of 25 May, about 30 Cambodian workers  returned from fishing to ask the Vietnamese employer for their  weekly pay. They told the boss that they wanted to go home to  grow rice because the planting season has come. The Vietnamese  employer told his 12-year-old (?son) to give a glass of liquor  to each Cambodian worker and told the workers that he would not  give them pay and rice this week, as the pay and rice would be  given only after they finished working at the end of June when  the fishing season ended. After arguing for a while, both sides  were furious. [passage omitted]    The boss then drew an AK rifle from his table and shot at  the  workers, killing two and wounding five others. The dead and  wounded fell down from the brick house. The boss continued  firing at the workers, who fled unhurt.    At 2100 on 26 May, while the Vietnamese men and women were  drinking and watching television under the bright electric  light, every brick house and sampan were burning. [passage  omitted] Suddenly, the fire blazed up brightly.    Next morning, eyewitnesses said that 30 Vietnamese men and  women were killed and 60 brick houses and 27 sampans were  burned. [passage omitted] Who killed these Vietnamese? Who set  fire to this floating Vietnamese city? What devices were used?  Was it a bomb, a resin torch, or turpentine? Some said  everything, even fuel oil, could be found in (Kbal Tao).  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITAIN RELUCTANTLY OKS TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Britain's monopolies monitoring commission gave its conditional approval today  to a hostile joint takeover bid for the electronics group Plessey by General  Electric Co. of Britain and Siemens AG of West Germany.  </P> <P> The Anglo-German bid, announced last November, would create one of Europe's  biggest electronics groups, capable of competing with the industry's giants in  North America and Japan.  </P> <P> Plessey Co. PLC fought hard against the unwanted $2.9-billion bid, launching  several unsuccessful court attempts to remain independent.  </P> <P> The Monopolies and Mergers Commission approved the bid "provided appropriate  undertakings are given . . . to deal with aspects of the merger which might  otherwise be expected to operate against the public interest." Plessey and GEC  are both major defense contractors in Britain and the Ministry of Defense was  earlier reported to have raised objections to the bid.  </P></p>

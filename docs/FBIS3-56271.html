			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] The dramatic events in Russia in 1993 have  confirmed that the Clinton-Yeltsin axis can withstand overloads,  Interfax was told by the former Soviet Foreign Minister, now  head of the Foreign Policy Association, Aleksandr Bessmertnykh.    He believes that the Russian-U.S. summit is of vital  importance for the future world situation and character of  Russian-U.S. relations.    Bessmertnykh believes that the Moscow dialogue should pass  on  equal terms. Bill Clinton will have to give up the temptation  to act not only as the leader of the United States, but as one  of the only superpowers whose mission is to rule the world.  This approach will not work in Russia because in this country  American aspirations for world leadership are not recognized as  natural, he said.    Bessmertnykh is sure that it is beneficial strategically for  the United States to look at Russia as a strong and prosperous  state. Clinton is a leader of the new generation, he said. He  is able to see the great advantage in U.S. friendship with a  strong Russia rather than with a weakened giant spreading  disintegration and instability throughout the world.    Bessmertnykh believes that Russia should be satisfied in its  relations with the United States with the level of partnership.  The desire to reach the rank of a U.S. ally is inexplicable, he  said. "Why hurry if the willingness is not shared by the other  side?" said Bessmertnykh.    He emphasized that Russia, as the successor of the former  Soviet Union, remains a world power with a broad range of  interests which should be respected by the rest of the world.  Without the understanding of this on the part of the United  States, it would be hard to lay a firm foundation under the  Russian-U.S. relations, which in this case will be destined to  fluctuate, he said.    Unless the two sides reach understanding in this respect,  any  efforts by Russia within the Commonwealth of Independent States  and outside will continue to be interpreted as the manifestation  of Russian "imperialism." The most delicate solutions - for  example, NATO-extended membership to include the countries of  Eastern and Central Europe - will depend on the result of the  talks on this subject, said Bessmertnykh.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (2): Economic recovery starts to take root  -After a severe recession, the country hopes for growth of 5 per cent in 1995 For the first time since 1990, economic activity in Finland shows signs of reviving. Between 1990 and 1993, the country suffered the hardest recession to have hit any member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development since the second world war. The economy, hit simultaneously by the international recession, the collapse of trade with the neighbouring Soviet Union, the bursting of a credit boom and the burden of an expansive welfare system, shrank by some 15 per cent over the period. Unemployment shot up from 3.4 per cent of the workforce in 1990 - one of the lowest rates in Europe - to today's level of 18.5 per cent, putting Finland alongside Spain and Ireland at the top of the European jobless league. This year, however, a recovery that began to show itself in late 1993 has taken root. Driven by a powerful surge in exports, gross national product is set to grow by 4 per cent this year; with domestic demand also beginning to revive, official estimates forecast up to 5 per cent growth in 1995. 'That is regarded by many economists as too cautious and I hope they are right,' remarks Mr Sixten Korkman, the finance ministry's chief economist. The sense of rekindled optimism was reinforced on October 16 when a referendum of the electorate approved Finland's entry next year to the European Union. The result was greeted with enthusiasm by business leaders, the trade unions and most of the political establishment as an important confirmation of Finland's trading position and a spur to new investment. 'EU membership is good for our economy,' says Mr Korkman. 'It should help to sustain the momentum of our recovery and help to bring down long term interest rates. Investment activity should benefit because there will be more certainty about the rules of the game.' Several factors have combined to provide the turnaround. Above all, the country's exporting industries - notably the big forestry companies and manufacturers such as Nokia, the telecommunications group - have been able to exploit fully a pick-up in international demand, thanks to the sharp devaluations of the Finnish markka in 1991 and 1992 and productivity gains that have made them much more competitive than previously. This year exports are set to rise by some 15 per cent over last year, producing a surplus on the balance of payments current account equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP, after 10 years of deficits. Meanwhile, both consumption and investment are set to grow this year and next after long periods of contraction, but annual inflation is among the lowest in Europe at less than 2 per cent. The prospect of a vigorous recovery after such a tough recession has caused considerable satisfaction in Finland that the country has managed its affairs better than neighbouring Sweden. Although Sweden has suffered much less of a contraction in its economy, its recovery is threatened by a deep budget deficit and rapidly growing public debt that have pushed up interest rates. Finland, too, has experienced a sharp deterioration in its public finances. But under the stern guidance of Mr Iiro Viinainen, finance minister in the centre-right government, fiscal policy has been kept largely under control. State debt has gone up fast from very low levels to approaching 70 per cent of GDP. But by sticking to a policy of not allowing government spending to grow in real terms, the debt has not reached the levels of almost 100 per cent of GDP reached in Sweden. Even in his 1995 budget, with the unpopular government facing defeat in the March general election, Mr Viinainen has pushed through a small cut in expenditure in real terms, despite having to allow for some FM10bn in net extra spending stemming from Finland's accession to the EU. Finland's debt growth will peak next year and the country should start meeting the EU's convergence criteria of budget deficits not exceeding 3 per cent of GDP by 1997. But the optimism about the recovery is dampened by the overwhelming political and social problem posed by unemployment. Just how difficult this will be to reverse was outlined by a special commission appointed earlier this year by President Martti Ahtisaari to study the problem. The commission concluded that to achieve a target of cutting unemployment to 200,000 from the present level of 480,000 by the year 2000 would require annual growth of 5 per cent a year. Even if that was achieved, unemployment would still be running at 8 per cent of the workforce. A key factor in attaining such growth will be investment and consumption levels. Both were depressed during the recession. Household consumption was cramped by high levels of indebtedness while public consumption has been squeezed by the need to control the public finances. The latter will continue to be depressed. But there are now signs of renewed private consumption and investment is set to grow by 3 per cent this year and by 15 per cent in 1995. However, with long-term interest rates still around 10 per cent, and many households and businesses still wary of borrowing, the conditions for expansion are still limited. The presidential commission's prescription for engendering sustained growth included more stringent spending cuts - that would inevitably cut into popular welfare provisions - a cut in marginal income tax to 50 per cent from the present rates of around 60 per cent, cuts in employers' social security contributions and a variety of labour market measures. These ranged from trade union-friendly proposals on sabbatical leave to employer-friendly measures on more flexible working hours and hire-and-fire regulations. Members of the commission, a mix of non-overtly political academics and industrialists, clearly hoped their report would attract a political consensus behind it. It has at least achieved the merit of having set the economic agenda for the general election. But political action to enact its recommendations before then is far from certain as the Social Democratic party has so far hesitated to join the government's call for early legislation.</p>

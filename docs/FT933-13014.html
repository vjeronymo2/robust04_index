			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Marginal rise for Siemens at nine months NET profits at Siemens, Germany's biggest electrical and electronics group, rose by 1 per cent to DM1.32bn (Dollars 776m) in the first nine months of the financial year to the end of June. Siemens said business had been 'robust' in the nine months against the background of a weak world economy. Group turnover climbed by 2 per cent to DM55.8bn while order intake fell back by 5 per cent to DM59.9bn. Business outside Germany compensated for a downturn in the domestic market. Turnover in Germany dropped 3 per cent but abroad rose 6 per cent to DM30.7bn. Although the pattern was repeated with new orders, where there was a 12 per cent drop in Germany offset by a 2 per cent increase abroad, Siemens said this was not to be taken as a sign of a worldwide recovery. The company said the growth in orders outside Germany was due to a number of large projects in plant-building and systems, rather than economic recovery. The strong expansion in infrastructure business - which had lasted for the past three years - had reached a plateau, albeit at a high level, Siemens said. Business with industrial customers had weakened further, whereas there had been an increase in transportation and energy production systems. Together with construction-related products, these had been the areas of most substantial growth in turnover. In common with other large German companies, Siemens has moved to cut staff numbers in a bid to reduce costs. At the end of June, the group employed 401,000 people worldwide, down from 413,000 at the beginning of the financial year. Despite this 3 per cent staff reduction, personnel costs rose by 6 per cent to DM26.3bn. Investments totalled DM4.7bn, down from DM6bn in the comparable period last year.</p>

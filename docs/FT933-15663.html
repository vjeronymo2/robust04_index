			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Tokyo seeks tocut the pompand paperwork JOHN MAJOR, Bill Clinton and even Francois Mitterrand agree on one thing: that the annual Group of Seven summits have become too elaborate for their own good. The leaders will discuss today the future of the meetings, with some, such as Mr Major, advocating a return to the 'good old days' of 1975 when heads of government first gathered out of the public eye for a 'fireside chat' on global economic problems without hoards of officials and journalists turning the event into a circus and stoking up expectations. Already the Japanese hosts of this year's summit have gone a good way to cutting down the element of spectacle. Whereas previously the G7 summiteers happily succumbed to lengthy opening ceremonies, this year's talks began yesterday in a determinedly businesslike manner. Punctually, at four-minute intervals, the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Community arrived at Tokyo's Akasaka palace and began their talks after no more than a brief handshake with the host, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. Further streamlining is promised with a savage attack on the mountains of paper that summits have produced. The political declaration to be issued today will be no more than two pages of text, compared with five last year. The final economic declaration will also be brief compared with the 10-page monster from last year's Munich summit. Indeed, for the second time this century Munich has become associated with an infamous international meeting. Last year's G7 summit in the city is now considered to have been no more than an expensive photo-call. Yesterday's progress in the Quad trade talks has probably reprieved the G7 summit as an institution. But after last year's meeting Mr Major suggested to his fellow leaders that future summits be limited to heads of government. A lively discussion is expected.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts end stronger as traders digest price data UK government bonds dipped yesterday on the release of higher-than-expected producer price data for December, but quickly bounced back when it became clear the underlying trend was lower year-on-year. They ended the day about a  1/4 point higher, with an equal performance along the yield curve. 'The market was reassured by the numbers since they showed that price inflation is still falling,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at S. G. Warburg. He said the figures provided a favourable background for the retail prices index, which will be published tomorrow. The Bank of England is due to announce details of its gilts auction this afternoon. The market widely expects the Bank to opt for a 2010 maturity, in the middle of its 2008-2012 range, thereby establishing a new 15-year benchmark. Analysts expect the auction to raise between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 3.5bn, with a yield on the stock of around 6 1/2 per cent. German government bonds eased in quiet trading as investors retreated to the sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting on Thursday. The holiday in the US also dampened activity. The March bund future on Liffe fell 0.12 point to 100.53 in moderate volume. Analysts said the recent fall in the D-Mark against the dollar had reduced the chances of a cut in German interest rates this week. There was also little evidence of a slowing in M3 growth. 'The Bundesbank has to have something on which to hang the rate cut,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at UBS in Frankfurt. However, the release of preliminary cost of living data for January later this week could provide the market with a fresh direction, he added. Italian government bonds gained  1/4 point, bucking the downward trend elsewhere in continental Europe, as the market took comfort from the fact that Mr Carlo Ciampi will stay on as caretaker prime minister in the run-up to elections, called for March 27. Without this, there could have been a 'political vacuum which would have prompted a big sell-off', said Mr Andrew Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS in London. However, he warned the market was likely to become more volatile in the run-up to the elections, particularly if some of Italy's more marginal political parties start to make a strong showing in opinion polls. Although the market currently takes the view that crucial economic reforms are already in place, the economic policies of some of the smaller parties remain unclear. Mr Roberts is recommending that clients switch from Italy to Spain, although he says the outlook for Italy remains favourable in the longer term. Japanese government bonds and futures remained weak due to supply concerns in the market following the Trust Fund Bureau's announcement that it intends to sell Y900bn of its 10-year bond holdings over the next three months. Fears that the government's fiscal package might be larger than expected, and that there will be no early easing in the discount rate, also depressed the market, said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International in London. The yield on the benchmark No 157 bond rose to 3.27 per cent yesterday from 3.16 per cent on Friday. Bond analysts noted the yield was below 3 per cent only one week ago. The March contract closed at 116.20 in Tokyo, down from 116.90 on Friday, and slipped further to 115.67 in London trading. Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe, said there was not a great deal of selling in the cash market, since investors were opting to hedge their positions rather than sell their cash holdings. US bond markets were closed yesterday.</p>

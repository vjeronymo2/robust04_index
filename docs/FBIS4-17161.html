			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Officials of the Russian  Presidential Staff and Government are expected to meet in May  for a series of consultations with various structures of the  Chechen Republic to prepare talks between the Russian and  Chechen leaderships, Chief of the Presidential Staff Sergey  Filatov told TASS on Thursday.    He believes that "the public feelings in Chechnya,  especially  among the opposition to current President Dzhokhar Dudayev, are  increasingly proving to the republic's aspiration for closer  ties with Russia".    In contrast to Russian Minister for Nationalities and  Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, Filatov does not link the  proposed talks to early elections in Chechnya. However, he  still presses the republic for recognizing its status as a  subject of the Federation and for concluding a bilateral  agreement similar to that between Russia and Tatarstan.  Chechnya has not yet clarified its stand on these two issues  Russia lays down as the necessary condition for talks to get  under way, the chief of the presidential staff noted. According  to him, the Chechen side submitted its own draft of a bilateral  agreement with Russia "which is on the whole quite acceptable  for consideration in the course of talks", but remained rather  inarticulate as concerns its status within the Russian  Federation.    Filatov said Russia had a "tough" and a "soft" options in  settling its differences with Chechnya. The "tough" one  provides, in particular, for shifting the Russian railway from  Chechen territory, since crime and plundering on the railway  exceed all bounds. "but before resorting to tough measures, we  should try soft ones", he pointed out.</p>

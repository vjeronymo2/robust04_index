			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Team Spirit' &amp; Patriot Missiles"] </F>   [Text] The joint U.S.-Korea military exercise Team Spirit  is intended to maintain the defense capability of the Korean and  American forces here against a possible North Korean attack.  So, it was naturally expected that the two allies would conduct  the annual military drill this year too.    However, Seoul and Washington canceled it as a concession in  the nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and South Korea, the  United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Now that the hardline Stalinist state has failed to carry  out  its half of the bargain, this concession might be expected to be  withdrawn. But Pyongyang is again threatening to pull out of  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if the U.S. and South  Korea resume the exercise, which Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for  a nuclear war against the North.    China has also come out in support of the North Korean  position. Although President Kim Yong-sam stated after his  summit with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin in Beijing that  the two did not discuss Team Spirit and the deployment of  Patriot anti-missile batteries in the South, Chinese officials  made it clear China is as opposed to them as before.    A formal Seoul decision on the two matters is expected after  President Kim's return home, as he promised before his departure  for Japan and China a week ago. With the two presidents having  called for a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear  problem through dialogue among the parties concerned, Kim is  likely to weigh the further postponement of the military drill  in expectation of a change in Pyongyang's nuclear stance.    It is our view that suspension of the Team Spirit drill  needs  to be considered, lest it provide an excuse for the North to  translate its NPT pullout threat into action, leaving no room  for a peaceful solution to the issue. Since Seoul and  Washington have used Team Spirit as a bargaining chip in nuclear  negotiations in the past, they may well decide to leave it as a  card up their sleeves for use in the future.    On the other hand, Korea and the U.S. need to positively  consider the deployment of Patriot missiles, as it is designed  for defense against the North's Scud missiles. It is illogical  and unreasonable for Pyongyang to voice its opposition to the  Patriot deployment in the South, while it produces and develops  offensive missiles.    In a nutshell, the suspension of Team Spirit is  recommendable  for the present in order to avoid the worst but the Patriot  missiles are needed as a war deterrent to cope with the erratic  and unpredictable North.    Our side's unlimited concessions at this point could rather  encourage the defiant North to continue adventurism and  brinkmanship that are in no one's interests.</p>

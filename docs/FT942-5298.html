			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Czechs alerted by investment deadline: Vincent Boland assesses the latest twist in an eastern European privatisation Little disturbs the average Czech investor, except the occasional deadline. This weekend, aspiring shareholders in another tranche of the country's economic infrastructure were making last-minute touches to their voucher booklets as the second and crucial round of the second wave of privatisation drew to a close. Applications for shares in 846 of the Czech republic's top companies have to be at the privatisation ministry first thing this morning. Ministry officials have cleared the decks for a deluge of paper from an estimated 6m investors. Prague launched Eastern Europe's most ambitious mass privatisation programme with the first wave of sell-offs in 1991, transferring 943 enterprises to the public. It is now mid-way through the second, and probably final wave of mass privatisation. To rapidly transfer state property to the public, the Czechs have developed a complex system in which each investor starts off with 1000 points. These points are then converted into shares through a series of closed national auctions at bids which are matched with the shares available. If a particular share is over-subscribed no shares are sold and the share is moved into a second round of bidding at a higher price. The second wave of privatisation began in March with an initial round of bidding which resulted in the allocation of just over 13 per cent of the Kc155bn (Dollars 5.34bn) of assets for sale. Bids for the second round closed this morning and investors are busy predicting how much of the state property will be sold. Analysts in Prague expect a large number of the available shares to be sold off in this round. 'This is the single largest round in terms of shares distributed,' said Mr Alexander Angell of stockbrokers Wood and Company. 'My guesstimate is that between 40 and 50 per cent of the shares will be allocated.' Managers of Prague's investment funds, to which 65 per cent of private investors have entrusted their vouchers, are tight-lipped about which sectors and companies in this round are most in demand. Fierce competition among the 349 funds for points, and the inevitable excess of quantity over quality on offer, is likely to lead to heavy bidding for certain sectors, reflecting a growing trend among fund managers to concentrate their investment strategies on certain sectors. Privately, the fund managers say that the brewing, pharmaceutical, chemical, telecommunications and oil distribution sectors are those most likely to attract the most bids. In the first wave, many less-experienced funds bid for shares in almost all the companies on offer. The result was a dispersed portfolio which has failed to match the returns being offered to investors by those funds which concentrated their investments in a narrower range of companies. The most successful funds - including Creditanstalt Investment Fund, ZB Trust (run by Zivnostenska Banka) and Harvard (established by controversial Mr Viktor Kozeny) - have invested in less than 100 companies in key sectors of the economy. This round of the privatisation is attracting strong interest by foreign investors, according to Mr Nigel Williams, chairman of Creditanstalt's funds. Foreigners cannot participate directly but some, such as emerging market funds, are offering to buy stakes in some Czech companies from the investment funds at a premium. Mr Williams said the premium can be as much as 20 per cent of the value of the stake. 'It happened to an extent with industrial investors in the first wave. Now we are seeing financial investors coming in,' he said. The premium offered by such investors to the Czech investment funds goes to the shareholders in those funds, increasing the attraction of investing in the funds themselves rather than directly in the companies. Creditanstalt's privatisation fund was fully listed on the Prague stock exchange last week, only the second such fund to be quoted so far. When the second wave is completed, probably by October of this year, some 1,600 companies will be listed on the exchange, making it the biggest stockmarket in eastern Europe. Then, all investors should have taken possession of the shares, substantially increasing the liquidity of the market. Problems of illiquidity have caused share prices to fall heavily in recent months. Since February 1, the market has dropped by more than 40 per cent in thin trading as the big investment funds concentrated on the share flotations. Analysts expect the deadline today deadline to shift the focus back to the market, though no great surge in prices is expected until more companies are fully listed.</p>

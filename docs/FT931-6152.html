			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nissan to export Spanish 4WD vehicles to Japan NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, is to start exporting vehicles from its Spanish plant in Barcelona to Japan next year with planned volumes of up to 12,000 a year. Shipping four-wheel-drive (4WD) leisure/utility vehicles from Spain will be the second export programme from Europe to Asia for Nissan, which already exports up to 10,000 cars a year to Japan and Taiwan from its UK car plant in Sunderland. Nissan said it planned to export 10,000 units of its new Spanish-built Terrano II four-wheel-drive vehicle to Japan in 1994, rising to 12,000 a year. Nissan Motor Iberica, its majority-owned Spanish subsidiary, said yesterday that it had plunged into a loss of Pta14.37bn (Pounds 85.53m) last year in the midst of its ambitious expansion programme. Mr Juan Echevarria, Nissan Motor Iberica executive chairman, warned that the company did not expect to return to profit before 1995. Continuing losses and rising indebtedness, combined with the company's commitment to a heavy capital expenditure programme, are expected to force a capital restructuring. Nissan Motor Iberica has spent more than Pta100bn on capital spending and product development in the past two years, however, to try to transform itself into a maker of vehicles for the European passenger car market based on its Serena people carrier and the Terrano II. It said yesterday it still planned to increase total vehicle production to 135,000 in 1995 from 79,450 last year. Output of the Serena is planned to rise to 20,000 this year from 8,700 in 1992, and output of the Terrano II is expected to increase from 35,700 this year to more than 64,000 in 1994 including the exports to Japan. Some 22,000 Terrano IIs will be supplied to Ford, the US vehicle maker, which will market the vehicle under the name Ford Maverick through its own European dealer network.</p>

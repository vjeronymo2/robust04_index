			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk took  part in a phone-in today for readers of the MOLOD UKRAYINY youth  newspaper. Answering a question from a UNIAN correspondent on  whether the decision to run in the presidential election on 26  June is final, Leonid Kravchuk said: "I would like the Supreme  Council to consider my appeal. If it postpones the election, I  will withdraw my candidature; if the decision by the previous  parliament remains in force, I will run in the presidential  election."    "If the election, nonetheless, does take place, who of the  other contenders for the post of president would you regard as a  possible rival?", asked the UNIAN correspondent. Leonid  Kravchuk replied: "It is difficult to say this. The main  contenders, who have made a good showing and who have the  appropriate image are Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. I know  that certain circles like young contenders Valeriy Babych and  Volodymyr Lanovyy. Oleksandr Moroz and Petro Talanchuk are also  taking an active part in the election. That is to say, I would  not like to distinguish anyone -- everyone has his chance and  time will show who takes advantage of it."</p>

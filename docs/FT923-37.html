			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (1): Carefree days are ended - Public spending cuts are set to follow the floating of the markka earlier this month. The country's affluent standard of life will decline and the fear is that the 1990s will be a long hang-over. This survey has been written by Robert Taylor FINLAND this autumn is edging along a precipice. The floating of the markka on September 8 to stem the dramatic outflow of the country's capital reserves has brought a deep sense of national crisis. To many Finns this autumn's turbulent events on the money markets have come as an unwelcome shock. For most of their country's short history they have weathered political and economic storms with a pugnacious finesse. Now they must face what looks like being a harsh reality. During the next few weeks the centre-right coalition government of Mr Esko Aho must agree and push through parliament a range of cuts in spending programmes as far ahead as 1995 that will mean a sharp contraction in Finland's public service sector and lower living standards for everybody. No social benefit or government funded project seems likely to be spared critical scrutiny. Under the unseeing but merciless pressures of a turbulent international money market, Finland's carefree days of semi-isolated, regulated independence are over, probably for good. 'The people are ready to accept radical decisions,' Mr Aho told the Financial Times. He and many other Finnish policy-makers believe the mood has changed since last autumn when the country was forced to devalue the markka by 12.3 per cent and opinion was divided on what to do. But the prime minister and his coalition colleagues will have to show a much greater willingness to use the knife on cherished spending programmes than they displayed during the course of this year when Finland seemed to lurch from one crisis to another as sceptical foreign financial opinion questioned the government's economic performance. 'We had a credibility problem after the devaluation,' admits Dr Sirkka Hamalainen, governor of Finland's central bank. She disliked having to float the currency and hopes it can be pegged at an exchange rate related to the European currency unit once the markets have calmed down. Floating provides a breathing space but is no solution for anything. Indeed, there is a strong chorus of complaint from Finnish industrialists who dislike the uncertainty that a floating markka means for business. The trade unions are also unhappy because they face the prospect of having to accept a real cut in the wage packets of their members for next year in central pay negotiations with employers. For the politicians as well, floating is not an easy option. Next month, Finland goes to the polls in local government elections and no party wants to say or do anything unpopular before the results. The Conservatives in the coalition may lose ground, though Mr Aho is confident his own Centre party will show greater resilience. After all, as ministers insist: 'There is no alternative' to what they propose to do. Whatever happens, Finland is not about to suffer a relapse to the kind of misery and deprivation the country knew during the inter-war years, As Dr Hamalainen points out, all that the country needs to return to the straight and narrow is contract its public sector to its size in the early 1980s before the government became a really big spender. Nonetheless, relatively straitened times will not come easily to the Finns as they prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of their independence from Russian rule. In recent years they have grown used to a standard of life that is one of the most affluent in the world. Under the shadow of Soviet Communism for its first days of freedom in 1917, Finland survived the Second World War not through diplomatic appeasement but from fighting bravely against the Red Army. It was the only European country to confront Stalin that escaped eventual Soviet occupation. After 1944 the Finns were forced to pay large reparations to the Kremlin. Yet four years later they entered into a bilateral clearing house trade agreement with the Soviet Union that lasted until 1990 and was of enormous benefit for Finland as the country received an agreed volume of crude oil and natural gas in return for selling its neighbour sophisticated manufacturing goods and consumer durables. In its foreign and defence policy the country stood firmly neutral. It eschewed moral posturing that might offend the Soviet Union and western countries. At the same time Finland grew rapidly after the 1960s as a thriving market economy, the most capitalistic in the Nordic region. With more than a touch of luck but also a great deal of cunning, the Finnish political establishment was able to enjoy the best of both worlds. The results in the 1980s were remarkable as Finland's growth rate rose much faster than the western European average. In the past, Finns had emigrated in search of work to Sweden and further afield: now they came home. There was almost a Klondyke spirit in Finland as personal consumption reached Swedish levels. It became almost commonplace for families to enjoy two extended holidays a year. It is the speed at which that aggressively booming, swaggering image of the country in the 1980s has changed that bewilders and angers many Finns. From boom to bust in 18 months is an experience no other western European country has suffered in recent times. Dr Max Jakobson, a former diplomat, notes gloomily that Finland is 'heading into worse times'. The 1990s look like being one long hang-over for the country. This does not mean Finland is about to witness the rise of political extremism. 'The left-right spectrum is meaningless these days,' says Dr Jakobson. Finland does not even have any populist anti-statist party, unlike other Nordic countries. But there is widespread apathy and disillusionment with the political system. Accustomed to a sense of security, many Finns are keen to ensure their country is anchored firmly with western Europe. Support for European Community membership remains much higher in Finland than elsewhere in the Nordic region. Negotiations are expected to start with Brussels early next year and a national consensus persists on the merits of joining the EC. Last spring's application for entry by Mr Aho's government has still not produced a fierce backlash even after the narrow Danish No vote against the Maastricht treaty in June. Dr Jakobson believes there is a good reason for this. 'Many Finns want to be in the EC not for material reasons but to identify themselves with western Europe,' he explains. Neutrality, the sense of balance between east and west and the need to maintain a special relationship with Moscow were the crucial signposts that guided post-war Finnish foreign and security policy. But now, they have lost almost all their relevance. Slowly, Finland is edging closer to a realisation that its national interest lies through developing a greater sense of collective security in Europe. Ministers do not rule out eventual participation in the Western European Union or whatever military formation emerges out of the EC in the future. This is not to say that Finland wants to provoke or humiliate Russia. On the contrary, Helsinki's policymakers are keen - within clearly defined limits - to remain on good terms with their neighbour but they share no illusions on what may lie ahead. A conservative, nationalistic dictatorship with revanchist claims on Finland seems improbable at present. But many Finns are uneasy about what they see as the spread of criminality from Russia that has brought drugs, prostitution and black market activity to the streets of Helsinki. There will be no 'open door' policy to potential Russian immigrants. Nightmare visions two winters ago of hundreds of thousands of hungry jobless Russians trying to break into Finland may have been melodramatic and mistaken but Finland is not going to relax its guard.</p>

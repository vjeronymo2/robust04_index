			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US rallies for Uruguay Round vote Opponents and supporters of the Uruguay Round global trade pact yesterday were lobbying feverishly for votes ahead of today's vote in the House of Representatives on the deal reached last December. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday predicted that the House today would pass the legislation implementing the Round by 'a large vote' in favour, sending it on to the Senate 'with overwhelming support' for a vote on Thursday. A serious hurdle was cleared last week when Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, accepted a deal addressing his concerns about the dispute settlement mechanism in the proposed World Trade Organisation. But Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer activist and a leader of anti-Gatt forces, said neither side could claim enough votes in the Senate, where 60 are needed for passage, and no one in the Administration disputed him. Mr Nader had one victory yesterday. Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican, took him up on his offer of Dollars 10,000 to any member of Congress who would read the implementing legislation and pass a 12-question test on the contents. The senator, who had been leaning in favour of the pact, passed the test, rejected the Dollars 10,000 and then announced he had decided to vote against the pact. 'He realised the US would be paying 25 per cent of the costs while taking in about 30 per cent of the imports and it would get only one vote out of 124,' his spokesman said. The trade pact battle, conducted when there is little else in the national news, is receiving attention on a par with the fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Opponents maintained that polls showed the US public were against the deal. Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has vowed to start a third party if the deal passes. In an effort to counter the negative messages, supporters, led by the Alliance for Gatt Now, poured funds into television, radio and print. Individual companies - Boeing, Merrill Lynch, and EDS - entered the fray, and trade groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers of America called for 'a vote of confidence in America's ability to succeed in a fair world trading system'. President Clinton held a rally with supporters, hoping to convince wavering senators. The president said: 'It is not a Republican agreement or a Democratic one. It is an American agreement designed to benefit all the American people in every region of our country and from every walk of life.' The US Business and Industrial Council, a protectionist business group, placed a large advertisement in the Washington Post listing names of 91 defeated and retiring senators and house members. 'The Gatt vote will be very close,' it said. 'This means that the defeated lame duck Congressmen and senators - many of whom will soon become lobbyists for special and foreign interests - will get to decide OUR economic future.' All weekend the CNN television network ran an advertisement with pigs - designated as members - at a trough. 'Some call it a global trade deal, but hidden inside is billions of special interest pork,' it says. 'Call your senators today and tell them don't butcher the budget. Take the fat out of Gatt.' Three former presidents - George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter - released a letter to the president calling the pact 'a bridge from the post-war world of half a century ago to the post-Cold War world which is being forged today'.</p>

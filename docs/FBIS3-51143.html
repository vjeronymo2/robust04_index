			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] Another of the mandatory issues Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin must address while in Venezuela is the case of the  helicopter in Arauca. The Colombian Prosecutor General's Office  has enough evidence to press charges against 10 members of the  Venezuelan National Guard for their part in the border  incidents. She will not be able to achieve a thing if there is  no cooperation from Venezuela.    The Prosecutor General's Office is investigating four  specific crimes stemming from the helicopter incident involving  10 members of the Venezuelan National Guard. The Prosecutor  General's Office now believes the helicopter was not shot down  and that the Venezuelan officers violated Colombian territory.  Theft, property damage, and attempted kidnapping are the other  crimes under investigation. Given the situation, however,  Colombia will be unable to act against those responsible as long  as the Venezuelan Government does not cooperate.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What will the  Prosecutor General's Office do next? Are you going to order the  arrest of those involved?    [Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff] Naturally, we will  have to take measures to take the suspects into custody as well  as press charges, determine which charges to press, and present  our cases before the judge.    [Reporter] Can these steps be taken by the Colombian  Prosecutor's Office or will it have to be done by the Venezuelan  Prosecutor General's Office?    [De Greiff] It will have to be done by the Colombian  prosecutor because the events took place in Colombia. Where we  do need Venezuela's cooperation -- and we think we will get it  -- is in identifying the suspects.    [Reporter] Would these suspects be brought to Colombia?    [De Greiff] Naturally. Again, this would be done with the  Venezuelan Government's cooperation. [end recording]    The issue is now in the hands of Minister Noemi Sanin and  her  protest action today in Venezuela, which is directed at getting  the Venezuelan Government to second Colombia's legal actions and  seeing these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>

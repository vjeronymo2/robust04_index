			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] A discharge will be requested for the National  Maritime Service [SMN] policeman who was arrested for carrying a  weapon and pulling it out of its holster during the United  People [UP] alliance's musical event. Corporal Juan Bautista  Zapata of the SMN is being held at the Homicide Division of the  Judicial Technical Police [PTJ] and will be handed over to the  Electoral Court.    The authorities are trying to determine Zapata's criminal  accountability. He was arrested by police after he pulled out a  gun during a UP musical event as UP presidential candidate  Ernesto Perez Balladares was stepping down from a dais. Zapata  said he drew his gun because he thought he was going to be  attacked. To the police, this is a violation of the law.    [Begin PTJ Director Oswaldo Fernandez recording] The mere  fact that he was attending a political event not in uniform  constitutes a serious charge under our disciplinary regulations,  but it will be up to his superiors to make any final decision.  [end recording]    According to Major Santiago Fundora, director general of the  National Air Service, Zapata not only faces a criminal  investigation, but disciplinary sanctions as well.    [Begin Fundora recording] We are prohibited from attending  political meetings and caravans. Therefore, regardless of  whether his situation is clarified, he will be sanctioned with  dismissal. He will be sanctioned with dismissal, because we  cannot permit uniformed members to take part in one or another  manner in political activities. [end recording]    UP presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares canceled  a  series of electoral campaign activities scheduled for today as a  security precaution in light of the incident that occurred  yesterday on Balboa Avenue during the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party] youth festival, when the SMN member was  arrested with a gun. The PRD, whose presidential candidate is  Perez Balladares, will close its electoral campaign tomorrow  with an event at the 5 May Plaza.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAKING THEIR NAMES ON IT;  </P> <P> MANY WELL-KNOWN LOCAL FIRMS HAVE KEPT A LINK WITH THEIR FOUNDERS AS PART OF  THEIR IDENTITY.  </P> <P> You can tell a lot about a place by knowing a little about the people who  started the best-known businesses there. The knowledge tells you, for instance,  what it has taken to succeed and survive in the local economy.  </P> <P> Although Southern California is sometimes accused of having a short memory  about its past, not all its businesses have been flashes in the pan. In fact,  it has no shortage of long-established, successful companies.  </P> <P> So, examine a measure of local immortality -- people whose names are still  attached to the companies that they founded here and whose corporate legacies  include widespread name recognition.  </P> <P> Who were they? Not unlike many of today's Southland entrepreneurs, they were  often immigrants who came here flat broke. Most commonly, they were fortune  seekers, dreamers and unorthodox risk takers. And, also not unlike today, they  sought some imaginative way to tap this rich market.  </P> <P> Here is a little background on some of the region's most venerable names in  business. The ground rules for inclusion were that the companies must be  Southern California-based, that they were founded here, still carry their  founders' names and have been around for a long time.  </P> <P> This list is not exhaustive. It also leaves out local companies that were  founded elsewhere, have moved away, were started in the recent past, dropped or  never used their founders' names, do not have high name recognition or no  longer exist.  </P> <P> There are many, many companies in those categories, but sic transit gloria.  </P> <P> MARK C. BLOOME CO.  </P> <P> Anaheim-based tire retailer, now owned by Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.  </P> <P> Mark C. Bloome (1902-), after emigrating from Canada to Southern California,  opened a gas station in 1924 on Slauson Avenue in Compton. Using razzle-dazzle  promotions -- among them glassware giveaways and woman attendants on roller  skates -- he built his business into a chain of service stations across Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, under the guidance of his son-in-law Jerry Fields, Bloome's  stations gradually began to specialize in selling tires. The chain pioneered  the concept of the large, clean tire store selling all major brands, with  service bays facing the street and air-conditioned waiting rooms. The family  sold the business to Petrolane Inc. in 1972; Goodyear purchased it in 1986. It  currently operates 45 stores in Southern California.  </P> <P> BULLOCK'S  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based department store chain, now a unit of R. H. Macy Co.  </P> <P> John G. Bullock (1871-1933), born in Canada, founded his Los Angeles department  store in 1907 at Seventh and Broadway, with financial backing of his former  boss Arthur Letts, owner of the Broadway Department Store down the street.  Later, he bought out Letts' interest and expanded his chain to several stores,  each operated independently. In 1970, after their purchase by Federated  Department Stores, the Bullock's and Bullocks Wilshire chains were made into  separate entities. (Bullocks Wilshire dropped the apostrophe in its name as  part of its effort to establish its own identity.) Both chains were purchased  by Macy in 1988.  </P> <P> MARIE CALLENDER PIE SHOPS INC.  </P> <P> Orange-based chain of coffee shops, now owned by Wilshire Restaurant Group.  </P> <P> Marie Callender (1907-), with husband Cal and son Don, began making pies in a  rented Quonset hut in Long Beach in 1948, then selling them wholesale to coffee  shops and restaurants.  </P> <P> A decade later, the Callenders began opening their own restaurants,  specializing in such basic fare as soup, chili, sandwiches, pie and coffee. The  family sold the business, which has grown to 153 restaurants in 16 states, to  Ramada Inns in 1986, which sold it in May of this year to Wilshire Restaurant  Group.  </P> <P> WALT DISNEY CO.  </P> <P> Burbank-based entertainment and theme park company.  </P> <P> Walter Elias Disney (1901-1966), a one-time Missouri farm boy with a talent for  drawing, moved to Southern California in the 1920s and began making animated  cartoons in a Hollywood garage. Despite early setbacks, he hit it big with  Mickey Mouse and built a billion-dollar entertainment empire.  </P> <P> After his death, the company stagnated and was almost taken over by a corporate  raider. But, under new management, it has become a hugely profitable  entertainment conglomerate in the 1980s.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT  </P> <P> Long Beach-based aircraft builder, now part of McDonnell Douglas Corp.  </P> <P> Donald Wills Douglas (1892-1981), a pioneer aircraft engineer, moved to Los  Angeles and founded his own airplane company in 1920 in a back room behind a  Santa Monica barbershop. A decade later, Douglas developed the DC (for Douglas  Commercial) series of aircraft, which accounted for more than half of the  world's airline seats until the end of the 1950s, by which time Boeing's wildly  successful 707 had ushered in the jet age and taken away Douglas's lead in  commercial airplanes.  </P> <P> The company's delay in entering the jetliner market hastened its merger with  McDonnell in 1967. Douglas stepped down as chief executive that year at age 75.  </P> <P> DUCOMMUN INC.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based aerospace manufacturer.  </P> <P> Sometimes called the state's oldest company, it began in 1849 when Swiss  watchmaker Charles Louis Ducommun (1820-1896) set up a watch shop that became a  general store near the center of the pueblo of Los Angeles. Early in the 20th  Century, Ducommun's heirs diversified by becoming suppliers to the area's  fledging aircraft manufacturing industry. Ducommun family members still occupy  key executive positions, but in recent years the company has hit hard times,  including four straight years of losses.  </P> <P> EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS INTERNATIONAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based maker of wheelchairs and medical equipment.  </P> <P> Herbert A. Everest, paralyzed in a mining accident, needed a wheelchair, but  those used in the 1930s were made of rigid wood and wicker. They didn't fit in  a car, so Everest and his friend Harry C. Jennings (1888-1964), also a mining  engineer, puttered in a West Los Angeles garage and came up with a folding  wheelchair made of lightweight aircraft tubing and fabric. From that beginning  has grown the world's largest wheelchair manufacturer, with annual sales of  $191 million.  </P> <P> FLUOR CORP.  </P> <P> Irvine-based engineering and construction company.  </P> <P> John Simon Fluor (1867-1944), a Swiss immigrant who, in the 1890s, worked with  his brothers in the construction business in Oshkosh, Wis., moved to Santa Ana  in 1912 and founded Fluor Construction Co. In 1915, the company got its first  oil and gas construction contract, which led eventually to mammoth refineries  and other energy industry projects. Fluor remained active in his company until  he died, and his heirs and relatives still fill a number of key positions at  the publicly traded, $5-billion firm.  </P> <P> HUGHES AIRCRAFT  </P> <P> Culver City-based defense and electronics firm, now a unit of General Motors.  </P> <P> It is not known exactly when, but in the early 1930s -- not long after the  brilliant, eccentric Howard Robard Hughes (1905-1976) purchased the RKO movie  studio and began to spend considerable time in Southern California -- Hughes  formed an aircraft division of his Houston-based Hughes Tool Co. In essence, it  was a bookkeeping entity to pay for the experimental racing planes that he  built and housed at Glendale airport.  </P> <P> In 1941, he moved Hughes Aircraft to Culver City, where it developed aircraft  with non-metallic "skins" -- culminating in the gigantic Spruce Goose. After  World War II, Hughes steered the company into defense electronics and  eventually communications satellites. In 1953, it was made a separate corporate  entity whose profits went to the charitable Howard Hughes Medical Institute,  and in 1985, it was sold to GM.  </P> <P> IRVINE CO.  </P> <P> Newport Beach-based land developer.  </P> <P> James Irvine (1867-1947), son of a San Francisco merchant-turned-Orange County  sheep rancher, took his father's share of a huge Orange County ranch and built  it into an agricultural giant, raising mostly beans and sugar beets. Under his  sons and granddaughter in the 1950s and later, the company began to develop the  land as Orange County became a major population center. The family's foundation  sold the company to a group of investors, including Donald Bren, in 1977. Bren  now has a controlling stake and serves as chairman.  </P> <P> LAWRY'S FOODS INC.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based specialty foods and restaurants company, now owned by Thomas  J. Lipton Co.  </P> <P> Lawrence L. Frank (1887- 1970), after a successful career with his  brother-in-law in the Van de Kamp's bakery business, incorporated his own  company -- using his nickname -- to operate restaurants and similar businesses.  The centerpiece was Lawry's The Prime Rib, which has become a fixture on La  Cienega Boulevard.  </P> <P> In 1938, he began selling his own brand of blended seasoning salt to Lawry's  The Prime Rib customers; that modest beginning has grown into a $200-million  food products business that includes Lawry's California Center, a sprawling  manufacturing and restaurant operation near downtown Los Angeles. Lipton, the  tea maker, has owned Lawry's since 1979.  </P> <P> LITTON INDUSTRIES  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based electronics company.  </P> <P> Charles V. Litton (1903-1972), owner of an electron tube company in Northern  California, sold his firm in 1953 to conglomerate builder Charles (Tex)  Thornton, who merged it with his fledgling Electro-Dynamics Corp. in Southern  California. Litton's name was attached to the combined firms in 1954 because of  the good reputation that his products enjoyed among brass at the Pentagon, the  company's major customer. Litton never worked for the $5-billion, Beverly  Hills-based company that bears his name.  </P> <P> LOCKHEED CORP.  </P> <P> Calabasas-based defense, aircraft and electronics firm.  </P> <P> Barnstormers and flight pioneers Allan Haines Loughead (1889-1969) and his  brother Malcolm struck it rich giving aerial sightseeing tours at an exposition  in San Francisco in 1915. His efforts to start an aircraft factory were mostly  failures, however, and only a rescue by a group of investors in 1932 kept  Lockheed Aircraft Corp., which he started in 1926 and sold in 1929, from going  under.  </P> <P> The company, which now generates revenue of more than $10 billion annually, has  used the phonetic spelling of Loughead's name since its founding to avoid  unfortunate mispronunciations, such as "lug-hed." Allan legally changed the  spelling of his name to Lockheed in 1934.  </P> <P> METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER PICTURES  </P> <P> Culver City-based movie and television producer, now part of MGM/UA  Communications.  </P> <P> In 1924, Loews Corp., owner of a chain of movie palaces badly in need of more  films, bought and merged three Hollywood production houses: Metro Pictures,  Goldwyn Picture Corp. and Louis B. Mayer Productions. Producer Samuel Goldwyn  (1882-1974) had departed his failing company in 1922 and never participated in  MGM. Louis B. Mayer (1885-1957) became the unquestioned boss of MGM in its  "golden age."  </P> <P> The film company, nearly bankrupt in the late 1960s, has been controlled for  two decades by financier Kirk Kerkorian, who has used it in a series of  complicated financial dealings and a foray into Las Vegas hotel-casinos. MGM's  famed Culver City studio is now owned by Lorimar, its film library belongs to  Turner Entertainment Co., and the parent MGM/UA is being acquired by Australian  conglomerate Qintex.  </P> <P> NORTHROP CORP.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based aircraft and electronics manufacturer.  </P> <P> John Knudsen Northrop (1895-1981), a tireless inventor with only a high school  education, worked with flight pioneers Allan Loughead and Donald W. Douglas  before starting his own company in 1939. He was known for wildly inventive  designs, such as the ahead-of-its-time flying wing. He retired early from the  company in 1952, bitter and disappointed after the Air Force canceled his  flying-wing program. But he lived long enough to see the idea resurrected in  the new Stealth bomber, which had its maiden flight this year.  </P> <P> RALPHS GROCERY CO.  </P> <P> Compton-based supermarket chain, now a unit of Campeau Corp.  </P> <P> After his career as a bricklayer was curtailed by a hunting accident, George  Albert Ralphs (1850-1914) became a grocery clerk and, in 1873, went into  partnership with his boss in a store at Sixth and Spring streets in Los  Angeles. Later, his brothers Walter and Newell bought in and the business  became Ralphs Bros. Grocers.  </P> <P> By providing free lodging and stables for farmers bringing their crops to  market, the Ralphs were able to lock up huge supplies and cut prices below  their competitors'. The family-run company was sold to Federated Department  Stores in 1967; acquired by Campeau Corp. in 1988, it has more than 140  supermarkets throughout the area.  </P> <P> ROBINSON'S  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based department store chain, now a unit of the May Department  Stores Co.  </P> <P> After moving to Los Angeles in 1882 from North Bridgewater, Mass., Joseph  Winchester Robinson (1846-1891) opened the Boston Dry Goods Store near the  corner of Temple and Spring streets downtown in February, 1883. It was an  immediate success, and Robinson became a prominent figure in the community.  </P> <P> After his untimely death at age 45, the store -- by then renamed Robinson's --  went through a succession of managers until his son, Harry Winchester Robinson  (1877-1933) took control in 1924. May bought the chain in 1986.  </P> <P> SMART &amp; FINAL IRIS CORP.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based specialty warehouse grocery chain, now 88%-owned by French  food conglomerate Etablisement Casino.  </P> <P> James Samuel Smart teamed up with H.P. Final in 1914 to start a cash-and-carry  wholesale grocery business in Santa Ana. The partners opened more stores and  warehouses, and in 1952, they acquired Haas Baruch &amp; Co., a grocery  wholesaler that was a direct descendant of a feed and grain business founded in  Los Angeles in 1871.  </P> <P> Haas Baruch's popular Iris brand was then added to the company's grocery  shelves and corporate name. Smart &amp; Final Iris, which operates 100 stores  in California and Nevada, was acquired in 1957 by Thriftimart, a supermarket  chain, which in turn was purchased in 1984 by Etablisement Casino.  </P> <P> 20th CENTURY FOX FILM CORP.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based movie and television producer.  </P> <P> Hungarian-born William Fox (1879-1952) (originally spelled Fuchs) bought an  interest in a Brooklyn movie house in 1904 and parlayed the investment into a  chain of theaters. In 1915, he formed Fox Film Corp. to produce movies for his  theaters, quickly buying an East Los Angeles studio and then starting his own  at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue.  </P> <P> His Hollywood empire crumbled in the Depression, and bankrupt Fox Film was  merged in 1935 with 20th Century Pictures, founded by movie pioneers Joseph  Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. 20th Century Fox, which survived half a dozen  brushes with collapse and episodes of corporate intrigue in the intervening  years, is now owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.  </P> <P> VAN de KAMP'S HOLLAND DUTCH BAKERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based regional bakery.  </P> <P> From a store that they opened in 1915 at Second and Spring streets in downtown  Los Angeles, brothers-in-law Theodore J. Van de Kamp (1891-1956), uncle of  California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, and Lawrence L. Frank, who later  founded Lawry's Foods, made and sold potato chips. A shortage of potatoes in  1916 forced them to sell other items, most notably macaroons, under Van de  Kamp's label.  </P> <P> The business, known for its blue-and-white windmill logo, grew to include  self-service bakery counters in grocery stores along the Pacific Coast, coffee  shops and a frozen foods business. The company, whose ownership has changed  several times through the years, eventually sold all but its bakery business,  which still operates from a landmark 1931 building on Fletcher Drive in the  Northeast Los Angeles "breadbasket," where a number of other regional bakers  are located.  </P> <P> VONS GROCERY CO.  </P> <P> El Monte-based supermarket chain.  </P> <P> Charles T. Von der Ahe (1882-1973), a Danish immigrant, founded Von's  Groceteria at Seventh and Figueroa streets in 1906, expanded it to a chain of  87 stores and then sold out to a predecessor of Safeway in 1929. With his sons  Ted and Wil, he began a new Vons Grocery Co. in 1932, which has grown into the  current El Monte-based supermarket chain with 340 stores and more than $5  billion in revenue.  </P> <P> WARNER BROS. INC.  </P> <P> Burbank-based movie and television studio, now part of Warner Communications.  </P> <P> Sons of Polish immigrants, the Warner brothers -- Harry (1881-1958), Albert  (1884-1967), Sam (1888-1927) and Jack L. Warner (1892-1978) -- started in the  film business in 1903 with a nickelodeon in Newcastle, Pa., and just a decade  later were producing films at their own pioneering studio in Hollywood. They  incorporated their company in 1923, with Harry as president, Albert as  treasurer, Sam as chief executive and Jack as production chief.  </P> <P> Their production of the first talkie, "The Jazz Singer" in 1927, took them from  also-ran status to the first tier among Hollywood studios. Harry and Albert  sold out in 1956, but Jack stayed on until he sold the company in 1967 to Seven  Arts, a Canadian movie company. In 1969, Warner Bros. was acquired by Kinney  National, a New York conglomerate that became Warner Communications and is  currently being acquired by Time Inc.  </P> <P> WINCHELL'S DONUT HOUSES  </P> <P> La Mirada-based doughnut chain.  </P> <P> Jukebox operator Verne H. Winchell opened his first doughnut shop in Temple  City in 1948, then quickly opened others in Huntington Park and South Gate. As  franchise mania swept the country in the 1960s, Winchell's familiar  yellow-and-brown stores spread to other states.  </P> <P> Winchell merged his company with the Denny's coffee shop chain in 1968 and  served as chairman until the 1980s. He sold his stock when Denny's Inc. was  purchased in 1984, and is now retired. The doughnut chain, with more than 400  outlets, is being acquired by Shato Holdings, a Canadian firm.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marina Lebedeva: "Human Rights Conference Not </F> Yet Open, But Arrests of Participants Already Under Way. These  Are Being Carried Out by Uzbek Militia on the Territory of  Sovereign Kazakhstan"]    [Text] The international conference on human rights  organized by the Russian-American Bureau for Human Rights will  start work in Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May. But at least two  invitees will not be taking part; they are Talib Yakubov and  Vasilya Inoyatova, activists of the Uzbek people's movement  Birlik.    Yakubov was arrested in the apartment of relatives 10 May.  Vasilya Inoyatova, whose name is still on many people's lips  over last year's trial (she was accused of impugning the honor  and dignity of President Karimov by her poetry) was arrested  while still on Kazakhstani territory, in the settlment of  Chernyayevka, 12 May.    The car in which Inoyatova was traveling was stopped by  pursuing Zhigulis. Inoyatova and those accompanying her were  taken to the city militia administration in Tashkent where they  underwent a five-hour interrogation, conducted by Deputy Chief  Khudaybergenov. All, except Inoyatova, were released with a  warning to sever all links with members of Birlik.    Reports about the arrests of Yakubov and Inoyatina came from  the U.S. human rights organization Helsinki Watch and the  Society for the Defense of Human Rights in Central Asia.    After reporting these arrests, human rights campaigners  noted  that there has recently been a growing number of unlawful  actions by the Uzbek militia and special services on the  territory of other sovereign states, the authorities of which  are taking no serious measures whatsoever. Last year, at the  end of a similar conference, Abdumannov Pulatov, the well-known  defender of human rights from Uzbekistan, was picked up right in  front of the Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] militia. He was saved from prison  only thanks to the intervention of human rights workers of many  countries, journalists, and statesmen from the United States.    The Uzbek writer Yadgar Obid has been beaten up twice in  Moscow in the last six months; however, the culprits have not  been caught or punished.    So what, then, can the participants in the conference in  Alma-Ata expect? Will they be able to discuss the theoretical  problems connected with human rights or will they in practice  have to defend their own rights straightaway, as it were?  Yesterday we received a new report: Another two people invited  to the conference, Mikhail Ardzinov, deputy chairman of a human  rights society, and Mamura Usmanova, chairman of the Society of  Free Women, Tumaris, have been arrested in Tashkent.</p>

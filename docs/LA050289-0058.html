			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE' GLOSSES GRIM MESSAGE  </P> <P> The message delivered by John Zaritsky's documentary "Extraordinary People"  (tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 15, 10 p.m. on Channel 50) is decidedly mixed.  By choosing to focus on the resilient abilities of three male Canadian victims  of the deformity-causing drug thalidomide, it tends to emphasize -- even  romanticize -- the indomitable human spirit, and pushes the meaning of the  thalidomide tragedy to the background.  </P> <P> Indeed, this mixed view is expressed by "thalidomide child" Alvin Law, who  comments that it's no use blaming anyone for what happened, and is then seen  organizing with other Canadian thalidomide victims to pressure their government  for compensation overdue by at least 20 years.  </P> <P> Thalidomide was a drug thought to suppress morning sickness in pregnant women,  but caused horrible deformities in babies, if they lived to birth. More than  8,000 known victims were born between 1959 and 1962 in several countries  outside the United States (where it was never approved, due to the resistence  of Dr. Frances O. Kelsey of the Food and Drug Administration).  </P> <P> That does not mean that the United States was spared. More than two million  tablets were distributed free, and given to 20,000 patients. Between 10 and 16  known thalidomide babies -- perhaps more -- were born in the United States.  These facts were documented by British journalists but appear nowhere in  Zaritsky's film. The film's rather bald assumption that the thalidomide story  is well-known, stated here by host Judy Woodruff, results in gliding over some  of the most crucial and obscure dimensions of the story.  </P> <P> It is certainly remarkable when the camera trains on the armless Law as he  plays a very mean set of jazz drums with his feet, or when it shows how  thalidomide children, naturally used to the sensations in their flipper-like  feet or arms, often successfully resisted being fitted with artificial limbs.  Law, like the film's other subjects, Randy Warren and Paul Murphy, exhibit a  humbling sense of honesty, self-esteem and altruism.  </P> <P> But the outrageous thalidomide legacy is more than the gallery of portraits in  strength that Zaritsky presents. It is the result of governments neglecting to  watchdog profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and a stern warning that it  could happen again.  </P></p>

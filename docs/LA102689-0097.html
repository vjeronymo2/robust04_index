The roadway has  been refinished several times, creating a relatively uneven surface.  </P> <P> Traffic will be detoured around Vermont Avenue between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. during  the project. Visitors to Griffith Park will be asked to use the park's Fern  Dell Drive and Commonwealth Canyon entrances. Visitors to the Observatory will  be asked to use the Western Canyon entrance.  </P> <P> One side of the roadway will be under construction at a time. The west-side  lane will be the first part to undergo renovation.  </P> <P> Residents of Vermont Avenue will have access to their homes every night but  will be asked to move their cars or stay away from sidewalks during certain  phases of the project.  </P></p>

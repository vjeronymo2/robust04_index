			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Executive Committee of  the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] has condemned the  right-wing extremist riots in Magdeburg "with utmost severity."  "Xenophobic excesses and all other acts of violence must be  punished with the utmost severity of the law," CDU Secretary  General Peter Hintze said in Bonn on Monday [16 May].    The alleged violent criminals, who were arrested on  Ascension  Day [12 May], should not have been released again during the  same night, Hintze stated. Saxony-Anhalt Minister-President  Christoph Bergner (CDU) will investigate why the hooligans were  released from police detention so quickly, he announced.</p>

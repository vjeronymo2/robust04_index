			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Rambling through history - Theatre David Edgar's new play could be a thriller about art and the work of art historians. It could be about the plight of asylum-seekers in south-eastern Europe. It might be comedy, satire or melodrama. In fact, Edgar has flung in a bit of everything. Pentecost is at times literally a babble of voices, Christian, Moslem, Jewish, agnostic - a collection of people who have been displaced by the end of communism in Europe and the hostilities in the former Yugoslavia. Yet the play does not start like that. The set, designed by Robert Jones, is an abandoned church near the border of an unnamed country in the Balkans. The mural behind what must have been the altar is a slice of socialist realism. It is what lies underneath that matters. Could it have been Giotto or, even more tantalisingly, a work that foreshadowed Giotto about a century beforehand? A female local curator tries with increasing success to convince a visiting British art expert that it is the latter, though he is careful to say that his subject is contemporary, not pre-Renaissance. Still, it looks like one of the biggest art discoveries of all time. Then an American arrives to dispute the findings. Meanwhile the local Catholic and Greek Orthodox priests are quarrelling about repossession of the church. The minister for restoration in the new regime is suspicious of all foreigners who might want to claim the painting. All that would be enough for a play in itself, even one - like Pentecost - lasting three hours. Just before the interval, however, there is an interruption. In storms a group of refugees, taking hostages and demanding safe passage to a country that will give them a home. The second half is largely a vehicle for letting the refugees explain their various origins, as well as the affinity that can develop between captives and captors. I shall not say how it ends, though it is with a bang. The common theme is that in this part of the world populations have shifted throughout the centuries as invaders came and went. The end of the Soviet empire is only one more change. Yet the price of all that shifting has been the lack of a defined identity. With the collapse of communism and Soviet rule, some of the characters would like to join the 'European Club', but are not sure what the club is, nor whether Europe will have them. In its present form, Pentecost is a slightly rambling piece. Nevertheless, Edgar writes well, as usual, has some fun with the linguistics and has clearly done his research on art history as well as the Balkans. He is good, without being obscure, at having characters discuss ideas on stage. Sometimes, too, he comes up with a surprise. The most striking character in Pentecost is the American art academic who enters like a freelance photographer looking for a war, but turns out to have considerable expertise  -and humanity. This is an excellent performance by Linal Haft. I liked Jan Ravens with her funny English as the local curator. On the other hand, Charles Kay as the British art expert is a little too much stock Englishman. Direction is by Michael Attenborough; the piece should be cut by about 20 minutes before it comes to London. The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. Pentecost is financially supported by JBA.</p>

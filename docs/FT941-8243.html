			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts It has not been a good year for index-linked gilts so far. Having finished 1993 around 2.85 per cent, real yields are now back over 3 per cent. In theory, index-linked paper ought to provide a haven for worried equity investors. The two instruments have a similar structure, in that capital value and annual payout on equities tend to increase with inflation too. But equities carry an additional company risk and, at only around 0.25 per cent, the difference between the FT-A All - Share dividend yield and real yields on index-linked gilts is the lowest for almost two years. That should make index-linked attractive, but it probably says more about the degree to which equities are over-valued. Part of the trouble is the perennial lack of liquidity in the index-linked market. But inflationary and exchange rate worries have not subsided enough to allow real yields on conventional bonds to fall much below 3 per cent. Since real yields on index-linked issues tend to follow those on conventional gilts, the chance of further progress is limited for index-linked as well. Indeed, the low coupons on index-linked gilts produce a gearing effect which means their prices fall more sharply than those of conventional gilts when real yields are rising. That reduces their safe-haven attraction. In contrast, index-linked will outperform conventional issues when higher inflation rather than upward pressure on real yields is causing fixed-rate prices to fall. Last week's retail and producer price figures suggest that point is still some way off.</p>

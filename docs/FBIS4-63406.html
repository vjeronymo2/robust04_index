			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lev Sigal report in the "Opposition Is Looking for a </F> Leader" column: "No Accord in the Name of Zorkin Is Working Out  Yet"]    [Text] The Accord in the Name of Russia has so far failed  to emerge as a powerful opposition super-movement. The founding  conference of this organization, scheduled for Thursday, did not  take place because organizational and technical preparations for  it were not completed in time. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY predicted in  its 13 May issue, the majority of opposition leaders today are  not particularly interested in the accord.    The prospects for the Accord in the Name of Russia project  still look uncertain. The movement initiators will apparently  have to abandon their plans to encompass the entire opposition  or at least a greater part of it. Ilya Kostantinov, the leader  of the once notorious National Salvation Front, told  KOMMERSANT-DAILY that he for one does not know anything about  the organizational efforts by Mr. Zorkin and company and  expressed doubt that the accord's founding conference will ever  take place.    Apart from project coordinator Valeriy Zorkin, some activity  toward the accord is being shown by Aleksandr Tsipko, Sergey  Glazyev, Aman Tuleyev, and Petr Romanov. At the same time the  initiative group has somewhat distanced itself from Aleksandr  Rutskoy, who is now engaged with his own "Russian" organization,  The State [Derzhava], as well as from Aleksandr Prokhanov. The  initiators have shifted to the center somewhat and, unlike the  ex- vice president, act on the assumption that the hopes for  early presidential elections are unrealistic and therefore do  not consider the question of presidential candidates. True,  they say that Mr. Zorkin would like to see Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn as leader of the nation.    No doubt, the more time elapses between the emergence of the  idea of the Accord and its structural organization, and the more  stable the political situation in the country becomes, the  farther the interests of the movement initiators are drifting  apart.    Thus, observers point out that Gennadiy Zyuganov can now act  independently. Aman Tuleyev and Petr Romanov are playing out a  Siberian regional card; some other people would like to create a  kind of industrial division of the Agrarian of Democratic Party.  In this light, it is only "an opposition leaders club" whose  formalization appears more or less realistic. Importantly, no  one here possesses any substantial monetary resources; only  communists and agrarians have human resources; and only Mr.  Zorkin is trying to create an apparatus. So far, as movement  cofounder Vasiliy Lipitskiy told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a conference  of movement supporters has been scheduled for 28 May which will  apparently proclaim itself a National Council. The organizers  hope for large and representative delegations to arrive from  Siberia, Central Chernozem Region, and the South of Russia.  Apparently the failure of the unification project will indicate  that the crisis in the opposition has aggravated further.  KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the conference results on 31  May.</p>

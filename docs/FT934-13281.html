			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: On the road to the future - Audi and Alcoa have developed a saloon car with a light aluminium body With the start this month of commercial production at the world's first plant for volume production of aluminium body structures, Audi and Aluminum Company of America have started to take car manufacturing into new territory. Alcoa has invested DM120m (Pounds 49m) in the plant at Soest in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region. From there, body parts will be sent to the Audi car plant further south in Ingolstadt, Bavaria. They will form part of the new luxury Audi ASF (aluminium space frame) saloon, of which the company hopes to sell 15,000 a year after the launch at next spring's Geneva motor show. The components of the ASF will be assembled into the skeleton-like aluminium 'space frame', around which a skin of aluminium body panels will then be pressed and attached. Alcoa should then begin to obtain a clearer idea of how much potential exists among other manufacturers for a car construction concept offering substantial weight savings over steel, and thus better fuel consumption and reduced exhaust emissions, but at much higher material cost. Since the new top-range saloon is expected to be only the first of a range of aluminium models from Audi, the up-market subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, Alcoa has planned an eventual annual capacity of 100,000 structures a year at Soest. Eric Winter, manager for automotive products at Alcoa's technical centre in Pennsylvania, says Alcoa is talking to 'a number of automakers' about similar projects in Europe and North America. However, there are no firm commitments yet from other car companies to adopt the aluminium technology and processes developed jointly by Audi and Alcoa over the past 10 years at a cost of DM1.1bn. Other large manufacturers have exploratory programmes under way  - Ford of the US, for example, through a technology partnership with Canada's Alcan group  - but appear reluctant to commit themselves as extensively as Audi. Ford and Alcan have built a small fleet of aluminium-bodied prototype cars. However, senior executives at Ford's research centre near Cologne believe Ford is more likely to use aluminium for some body panels, such as bootlids and bonnets, and a broader spread of mechanical components than seek to build aluminium-bodied cars in large volumes. The Audi/Alcoa process is said to be viable for production runs of up to 100,000 cars a year, not enough for cars such as Volkswagen's popular Golf model or similar cars built at the rate of 200,000 or more units a year in some plants. The partners are looking at ways of meeting these volume requirements however, in the belief that in the long term, aluminium's attractions of reduced weight, 50 per cent lower tooling costs compared with steel and almost infinite recyclability will offset the higher cost of aluminium  - about three times that of steel  - and the large amounts of energy needed to produce it. Despite its drawbacks, aluminium now appears to be the front-running material to break the long monopoly held by steel in car bodies. Predictions by chemical companies in the 1980s that plastic composites could take over the role from steel appear to be foundering, mainly because of recycling difficulties. According to Franz-Josef Paefgen, head of body development at Audi, the average aluminium content in current vehicles is already between 6.7 and 11 per cent. However, this is mainly in mechanical components such as engine blocks and gearbox housings; weight savings in these areas have been more than offset by more sophisticated comfort, safety and other features. Reversing the trend is only possible through the 'quantum leap' offered by an aluminium body, says Paefgen, because the body typically accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of total vehicle weight. There are important implications for energy consumption because a 10 per cent lighter vehicle yields a 7 per cent reduction in fuel consumption. Simply replicating a conventional car body in aluminium would not work because of the different strength and behaviour of the two metals. But the skeleton and panel cladding approach used for the ASF goes well beyond the classic concept of a 'space frame'. It is formed from mainly box-sectioned extrusions joined to complex, ribbed and extremely strong die-cast components at highly-stressed corners and connecting points. This lends extreme rigidity to the structure. One-third fewer individual parts are needed than in a conventional body. Load-bearing components are joined mainly by continuous welds, also giving greater rigidity than spot welds. The stressed skin panels are mostly joined by a punched riveting process being used for the first time on a car body. Audi and Alcoa say this allows higher-quality consistency than is possible with conventional panel attachments. The end result, according to Heinrich Timm, manager of Audi's fundamental concepts activities, is a body shell 40 per cent stiffer and 40 per cent lighter than a steel equivalent. Asked why people have not been driving aluminium cars for years if the concept is so good, he says it has required the advent of the supercomputer, with its enormous processing power, to make the ASF feasible. 'For budget and time reasons,' he says, 'such a revolutionary change in body construction technology, together with the use of a material which has been previously unknown in this application, is not possible without the extensive use of a supercomputer.' The computer simulation techniques so essential in the development process were simply not available before. Now that they exist Audi has high hopes that the nature of the structures and the manufacturing processes will allow it to develop and make different models more quickly and cheaply. Headaches, however, have been plentiful. Aluminium's elasticity and elongation characteristics make it more difficult than steel to press into multi-curvature panels, thus needing extra care and precision in die-making. Panels have to be transported in special containers as they are more vulnerable to scratching than steel. The structurally crucial die castings, made with the Vacural process in which the die is evacuated before the molten aluminium is injected, require extreme care in the control of the casting process and of the smelt, while the parts themselves must be carefully heat treated. Some of the joining processes, such as punch riveting, are new or have been extensively adapted from conventional processes, in each case requiring very careful development but ultimately proving well worth the effort. A significant advantage is that the ASF structure has only about one-third the number of body parts that a steel monocoque contains. Arguably, this is necessary as the manufacturing process is still more labour intensive than with steel and will remain so until a breakthrough into high volumes of smaller cars makes investment in new forms of automation viable. Only about 10 per cent of the assembly process is automated. There are other manufacturing quirks too  - for example, the need to heat the completed bodyshell to 210'c for 30 minutes to give it the required strength. Audi will market the car as a lighter, more responsive, fuel-efficient and longer lasting luxury car than any steel-bodied counterpart. 'The question will not be how long the car will last but when the customer decides that he wants a new one,' according to Wolfgang Ullrich, head of Audi's factory service centres. Will Audi price the car at a significant premium over a conventional model? It is not saying yet. The pricing policy for the ASF will be decided early next year.</p>

The strike had put on hold a Dollars 2bn deal for the Italian car maker's subsidiary Fiat Auto to take over the plant in southern Poland that produces Fiat's Cinquecento minicar. Mr Maciej Brzozowski, a Fiat spokesman, said the agreement had not been affected by the stoppage although production of more than 20,000 cars had been lost before strikers accepted a management pay offer yesterday.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Learning how to get poor, fast - Serious Money What a week of shocks. Fuel tax, VSEL, Warburg and Magellan. Magellan? In between the big quakes came a small announcement from America: Magellan Fund is skipping its year-end payment to its 3m investors. So what? Well, all's well that ends well: just a minor accounting glitch - apparently. But, for a brief few hours, the markets were full of rumours that selling by Magellan was going to torpedo share prices round the world. Magellan is a mutual fund - the American equivalent of a unit trust. But it is not just any old mutual fund: it is the mutual fund equivalent of General Motors - and when Magellan sneezes, world markets catch cold. This is not just because Magellan is big: its assets total around Dollars 36bn. It is because its performance over many years gave the lie to those who reckon that no fund manager can continue to beat the market. From 1977 to 1990, the fund was run virtually single-handed by Peter Lynch. When he moved in, it was worth Dollars 18m; when he retired, it was worth Dollars 14bn. Anyone investing in Magellan when Lynch took over would have been nearly 30 times richer by the time he retired. And although growth had begun to slow even before Lynch left, the myth of the unbeatable fund remained. Lynch's approach to investment appeals to personal investors partly because it sounds so easy to emulate themselves. Indeed, he has written a couple of books explaining how the plain man can beat the professionals*. One of the more ironic aspects of this week's rumours was the suggestion that massive losses on derivatives were behind the skipped pay-out to investors. Lynch himself argued vehemently that picking stocks was enough for any red-blooded investor: 'I've never bought a future nor an option in my entire investing career, and I can't imagine buying one now. It's hard enough to make money in regular stocks without getting distracted by these side bets, which I'm told are nearly impossible to win unless you are a professional trader. ' . . . If this is sensible investing, then the Titanic was a tight ship . . . The large potential return is attractive to many small investors who are dissatisfied with getting rich slow. Instead, they opt for getting poor quick.' Not, of course, that it is just small investors who take the fast lane to penury. One reason rumour-mongers were so ready to pin derivative upsets on to Magellan was that losses on derivatives and other highly leveraged investments have been making the headlines with such regularity. This week, for instance, Bankers Trust, one of Wall Street's premier investment banks, had to sign a written agreement to make its derivatives salesmen behave better. On the other side of the continent, a Californian county has gone bankrupt - or tried to - because another sophisticated financial toy exploded in its face. Both the woes of Bankers Trust's customers and the wrangles over Orange County's losses come back to the same thing: investors dissatisfied with getting rich slow who learn how to get poor - fast. To shoot oneself in one foot might be regarded as a misfortune. To shoot oneself in both looks like carelessness. Great Universal Stores' Pounds 300m special dividend payment has a careless tinge to it. The market had been hoping the group would use part of its Pounds 1.5bn excess cash to buy back some of its outstanding shares, which improves the earnings capacity of the remaining shares. Instead, it is handing out 30p a share to all shareholders as a special dividend - which slightly reduces future earnings potential. That is bullet-through-foot number one: long-term shareholder value. But perhaps the deal has benefited shareholders in the short term? The explanation by GUS for choosing a cash repayment rather than a buy-back was that it was fairer to individual shareholders, since only professional investors can normally sell shares in a buy-back. Well, up to a point, Lord Wolfson. The market was so disappointed by the announcement of the 30p a share hand-out that the share price dropped 36p. Any investor paying 40 per cent tax will have to pay another 7.5p tax on the 30p net dividend, and so ends up with only 22.5p in the hand: notably less than the 36p fall in the share price. Sounds like a double whammy. *One up on Wall Street (Penguin) and Beating the Street (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York). Both by Peter Lynch, in conjunction with John Rothchild.</p>

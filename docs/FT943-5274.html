			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / EU delegates battle to head off abortion row: Dispute looms at Cairo population conference European Union delegates launched a late effort yesterday to prevent bitter differences about abortion overshadowing the International Conference on Population and Development, which opens today in Cairo. The EU wants to soften the language on abortion used in the draft statement which has become the focus of angry opposition from religious conservatives. The dispute over abortion has threatened to open up a new divide in international politics, with Roman Catholic and Islamic states joining forces to oppose more liberal proposals primarily from the US and some north European states. The talks to avert an open dispute came as more than 15,000 national delegates, representatives of hundreds of non-governmental organisations and about 2,000 journalists arrived in Cairo amid unprecedented security for the week-long gathering. The European initiative follows an EU agreement yesterday to a compromise on abortion that could form the basis for a consensus among the 170 countries at the conference. The EU agreement bridged the conservative stance on abortion taken by Ireland with more liberal proposals favoured by Denmark and the Netherlands. Amendments to the draft document were being circulated in the corridors of the conference last night by EU delegates. The central proposal was to state in the document that 'in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning'. However, the concerns of the more liberal western states are addressed by the proposal to urge in the document that governments 'deal with abortion as a major health concern'. The UN population fund estimates that 50m-60m abortions are performed worldwide each year and that as many as 250,000 women die each year from poorly performed operations. The compromise appeared to have won the backing of the powerful US delegation, which has been the primary focus of criticism from the Vatican and Islamic conservatives, who have accused Washington of endorsing abortion. Mr Timothy Wirth, US under-secretary for global affairs, said: 'The European Union has come up with a draft language which we think is very promising as a compromise.' He emphasised that the participants in the conference had reached agreement on '92 per cent' of the proposed text during three years of preparatory discussion.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Pakistan Pumping in Arms"] </F>   [Text] Srinagar, Jan 1 -- While on the one hand Kashmiri  militants are avoiding direct confrontation with the security  forces, switching over to hit-and-run tactics instead, there is  a disturbing increase in sophisticated weapons being pumped into  the Valley by Pakistan.    The recent hauls have ranged from 107mm artillery shells,  fin  stabilised 57mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm mortars, high  velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic grenade  launchers (AGLs), disposal rocket launchers, grenades of NATO  origin, long-range high frequency sophisticated wireless sets  with multi-mode facilities and even portable solar panels for  charging batteries for the wireless sets.    Other gadgets include pen pistols of Japanese origin,  silencers for both AK 56 assault rifles and 9mm pistols,  telescope fitted `Dragnov' sniper rifles with infrared  capability and a large variety of improvised explosive devices  (IEDs). All this is in addition to the more conventional  Kalashnikov series assault rifles, general purpose machine guns  (GPMGs), rockets and rocket launchers, several types of  grenades, anti-personal and anti-tank mines, and a wide range of  revolvers/pistols and, of course, assorted ammunition, all of  which have been recovered in mind-boggling numbers. For example,  the quantum of explosives recovered by the army alone so far  exceeded 6000 kg, with 2,500 kg having been recovered from a  storage dump in one incident alone on December 6.    "We have recovered enough weapons from the Valley to equip  an  infantry division," says Lt. Gen. S. Pdmanaban, the corps  commander at Srinagar. "But we have managed to produce a counter  of militancy in all aspects of tactics and weaponry. In many  cases we have anticipated it," he adds confidently.    Nevertheless, both the quantum and quality of weapons  available to the Kashmiri and foreign militants not only  indicates the level of Pakistani involvement in this strife-torn  state but demonstrates the point that controlling terrorism in  this scenic Valley will be a long haul yet.    Fortunately, however, the militants have not been equipped  with rockets to launch either the 107mm shells or the 57mm  rockets. But the security forces are aware that Pakistan might  resort to desperate measures keeping in view the post Hazratbal  systematic and calculated anti-militant mop-up launched by the  security forces in the state on the one hand and the gradual  public disillusionment with militancy on the other.    The army has discovered several specially constructed and  deceptively located concrete underground bunkers in houses of  active harbourers used by militants to hide both themselves and  their weapons. For example, during the flushing out operation in  Sopore, the army had recovered six bunkers in such houses. The  bunkers fitted with small trap door entries were mostly located  under the floor. In one case the trap door to such a bunker was  located under the chullah in the kitchen. Another was behind a  staircase, one in the field and yet another was in a narrow  corridor-shaped false room.    The militants have been making effective use of wireless  sets. Most outfits are equipped with short range walkie talkies.  Sympathisers have also been provided these sets who have often  compromised the army's movements in the Valley. About 150  wireless sets have been recovered up till now. The more  sophisticated ones with ranges of up to 300 km have been  discovered to possess frequency hopping, selective broadcast,  and digital burst communication facilities which are difficult  to intercept. The sets recovered till now have been mostly of  Japanese and U.S. origin. While `HAIFIS' is the common wireless  set of U.S. origin, the Japanese sets have popularly been of  Casio, Icom, Kempro and Yasev makes.    The solar panel, which is not yet available even with the  Indian army, has been the most recent recovery. The U.S. made  solar panel, recovered only two weeks ago, comes in a book form,  one square foot in size, and is meant for recharging  sophisticated sets requiring up to 18V output. The army has also  recovered battery for these sets but has yet to recover the  concerned wireless set. But a sleek wireless receiver of Sony  make recovered recently was found to possess automatic scanning  facility fitted with a display panel and an inbuilt microphone  with the facility to monitor wireless communication of the  security forces between 30 and 300 MHz.    The 107mm artillery shells, 57mm air-to-ground rockets and  disposable rocket launchers are all of Russian origin and are  suspected to be the leftovers of the Afghan war. The 107mm  shells are being used as an IED, while the 57mm rocket popularly  used by attack helicopters have been triggered with solar  powered improvised direction giving devices. The above three  weapons, as also the 60mm mortars, are all area weapons and  capable of causing severe damage if fired on built up areas.  Interestingly some of the two-inch mortar shells recovered from  the militants have been found to have Indian ordnance markings.</p>

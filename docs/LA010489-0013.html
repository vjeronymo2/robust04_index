			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN OFFERS WHISTLE-BLOWER RIGHTS MEASURE  </P> <P> President Reagan, who last year vetoed legislation intended to protect  government whistle-blowers, proposed a new measure Tuesday that he said would  provide similar protection without forcing government personnel managers into  "routinely defending appropriate personnel decisions."  </P> <P> The legislation would give federal employees the right to appeal a personnel  action before the Merit Systems Protection Board on the ground that the action  had been taken as a reprisal for whistle-blowing. It would also establish the  independence of the Office of Special Counsel within the government to protect  federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.  </P> <P> In a message to Congress, Reagan said that "federal employees who blow the  whistle on fraud, waste, abuse and violations of the law help to ensure that  the federal government uses American taxpayers' dollars effectively and  efficiently."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protect From Reprisals  </P> <P> "The nation's laws must encourage such reports and protect those who make them  from reprisals," said the President, who is winding up a two-week vacation in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Reagan drew sharp criticism, particularly in Congress, when, on Oct. 26, he  vetoed legislation that would have protected whistle-blowers from being  harassed or fired. The vetoed bill would have made the special counsel more of  a lawyer for the employee rather than for the government.  </P> <P> The Administration endorsed the original legislation, but later, Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh made a last-ditch appeal to Reagan, stating that the bill's  protection mechanism was unwise and unconstitutional. He said that, if the bill  went into effect, the government could have found itself in the odd position of  suing itself over whistle-blowers' complaints.  </P> <P> Subsequently, the President argued in his veto message that the bill's method  of giving whistle-blowers more legal authority to fight against reprisals from  their superiors "would have interfered substantially with personnel management"  in the federal government.  </P> <P> According to Michael Wermuth, deputy assistant attorney general for legislative  affairs, the new measure would give government employees the right to sue the  agencies for which they work -- a right he said they do not now have -- rather  than handing that job over to the special counsel.  </P> <P> In addition, he said, the Office of Special Counsel would be given the status  of an independent federal agency, with the counsel appointed by the President  and subject to removal. "The earlier version would have made the special  counsel answerable to no one," Wermuth said.  </P> <P> Under the measure Reagan proposed Tuesday, the special counsel would be  empowered, during the course of investigations, to administer oaths, examine  witnesses, take depositions and receive evidence.  </P> <P> If the special counsel determined that a whistle-blowing government employee  had been treated unfairly, that finding would be presented to the Merit Systems  Protection Board, the Office of Personnel Management "and, in appropriate  cases, the President."  </P> <P> The board, which oversees federal government personnel practices, was  established to protect the rights of federal employees. It hears and decides  employee appeals of personnel actions and orders corrective and disciplinary  actions against agencies or employees when appropriate.  </P> <P> Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), who, along with Rep. Frank Horton (R-N.Y.),  reintroduced the vetoed bill Tuesday, said that Reagan's proposal is no  improvement over current law.  </P> <P> "It's the same refrain. It's a little quacking from the duck as it leaves  town," she said, referring to the President's lame-duck status with barely two  weeks left to his term.  </P> <P> Staff writer Sara Fritz in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

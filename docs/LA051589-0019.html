			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TWAY'S LATE CHARGE OVERWHELMS ZOELLER FOR A TWO-SHOT VICTORY  </P> <P> Bob Tway birdied three of the last four holes Sunday, beating Fuzzy Zoeller in  a head-to-head duel to win the Memorial golf tournament at Dublin, Ohio.  </P> <P> Tway twice hit approaches within a foot in his stretch run, then rolled in a  25-foot putt on the final hole, finishing with a three-under-par 69.  </P> <P> Tway earned his first victory since the 1986 PGA championship with a four-round  total of 11-under-par 277.  </P> <P> Zoeller, who led through the first three rounds, simply could not match Tway's  closing holes and gave him a high-five after Tway's final birdie.  </P> <P> Zoeller, also a non-winner since 1986, matched par with a 72 and was two shots  back at 279.  </P> <P> When Tway tapped in a putt on the 17th, he took the lead and Zoeller needed to  gain a stroke on the 18th to force a playoff.  </P> <P> That appeared possible when Tway's drive hit a tree on the 18th, and bounced  back. But it bounced back in the fairway.  </P> <P> "It was a break," Zoeller said. "But that's golf. Good things happen to you  when you're playing good."  </P> <P> Tway took advantage of it. He hooked his second shot between trees to the green  then ran in the long putt that won it.  </P> <P> Payne Stewart, who started the day nine shots back, shot a bogey-free 65 and  was third at 281.  </P> <P> Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament last month, had a chance to make a run  at the lead but missed birdie opportunities on two of the last three holes.  </P> <P> Bruce Lietzke's last-hole birdie got him into a tie for fourth with Mark  Calcavecchia at 283. Lietzke had a closing 71, and Calcavecchia had a 70  despite a double bogey on the 18th hole.  </P> <P> Mark O'Meara and Scott Verplank were next at 284. O'Meara had a 69, Verplank a  70.  </P> <P> Cindy Rarick curled in a 20-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole to take control  and capture the $275,000 Chrysler-Plymouth women's tournament at Lincroft, N.J.  by two strokes for her first LPGA victory in two years.  </P> <P> Laura Davies of England, who chased Rarick along with Sherri Steinhauer,  finished second, one shot ahead of defending champion Nancy Lopez and Alice  Ritzman.  </P> <P> Rarick, who had a share of the lead in all three rounds, had a final-round  one-under-par 72 and finished the 54-hole event in five-under 214.  </P> <P> Heading into the final round, Rarick was tied with Davies and Steinhauer. Four  other players, including Lopez, were two shots back.  </P> <P> However, Rarick quickly moved into the lead by making a three-foot birdie putt  on the first hole. When she made a 20-footer on the sixth hole, she suddenly  had a three-shot advantage.  </P> <P> But it didn't last long, as Rarick, 29, bogeyed the seventh hole by missing a  three-foot putt and the eighth by missing the green.  </P> <P> Davies, the long-hitting 1987 U.S. Women's Open champion, moved into a share of  the lead at four-under by making an eight-foot birdie putt on the 10th hole.  But she quickly dropped back with a three-putt bogey from 20 feet on the 11th  hole.  </P> <P> Rarick never lost the lead after that. But Davies and Steinhauer, who bogeyed  the last two holes to finish at one-under, kept the pressure on.  </P> <P> Dave Hill watched as Chi Chi Rodriguez missed a 12-foot par putt, then made a  four-footer on the third sudden-death hole to win the $400,000 Bell  Atlantic-St. Christopher's seniors tournament at Malvern, Pa.  </P> <P> Hill, who won $60,000 for the victory, and Rodriguez finished regulation play  tied at a four-under-par 206 for the 54-hole tournament.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, who earned $35,000, missed a chance to win in regulation when he  bogeyed No. 18. He finished the final round at three-under-par 67 with six  birdies and three bogeys.  </P> <P> Hill had two birdies on the front nine in finishing the day with a 68.  </P> <P> The sudden-death playoff was the second this year on the senior tour and Hill  has been involved in both. The first was a four-way tie won by Bob Charles at  the Suncoast tournament.  </P> <P> Harold Henning won the $29,000 third prize by finishing a stroke behind the  leaders with a 68 Sunday, and a three-day total of 207 on the 6,710-yard  course.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Amexco to pay Dollars 375m for Thos Cook units American Express is expected to announce today that it has acquired the international business travel operations and US travel agencies of Thomas Cook for about Dollars 375m (Pounds 241.9m). The deal will confirm American Express as one of the world's two big business travel groups, alongside Carlson of the US and Wagonlit of France, who agreed to combine their business travel operations last March. The sale of its business travel operation will allow Thomas Cook to concentrate on its three remaining activities: leisure travel agencies outside the US, foreign exchange and traveller's cheques. The purchase of the US travel agencies business is a separate transaction. The US business is owned by Mr David Paresky, who operates under a franchise agreement with Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook was prevented by US banking laws from operating the business itself, because it is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank. The expected Dollars 375m purchase price represents the payment to both Thomas Cook and Mr Paresky. It is not known how it is divided between the two transactions. Thomas Cook is thought to have decided that it did not have the resources to compete in the international business travel market. Purchasing airline tickets and booking hotel rooms for corporate customers will require an increased investment in computer technology over the next few years. Unlike American Express, Thomas Cook does not have a charge or credit card to offer business travellers. The ability to provide clients with a plastic card to use on their trips has become an increasingly important part of the business travel service. Carlson and Wagonlit have said that they hope to negotiate an agreement with a card issuer. Thomas Cook said last month that it wanted to increase its involvement in the traveller's cheque business when it acquired Interpayment Services, the world's largest issuer of Visa traveller's cheques, from Barclays Bank. The acquisition, for an undisclosed consideration, raised Thomas Cook's share of the Dollars 54bn world-wide traveller's cheque market from 17 to 30 per cent. This put it in second place behind American Express, which has 44 per cent. Thomas Cook is also thought to have had discussions about buying the traveller's cheque operations of Citicorp. Citicorp, the only other issuer of traveller's cheques of any size, has 12 per cent of the market. Why agents are going global, Page 11</p>

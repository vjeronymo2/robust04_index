			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities make good progress in active trading - Market Report The UK stock market gave an immediate and positive response to the 71-point surge of Wall Street overnight, mirroring a general upsurge in markets across the world. Adding to the euphoric mood in the UK market was a feeling that the big institutions will now focus sharply on what is expected to be a strong upsurge in earnings and dividends payments in coming weeks as the September reporting season gets under way. At the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index ended 29.0 higher at 3,234.2, its best level since March 17 and a rise of almost 63 points over the past three days. The FT-SE Mid Cap index, which has been left behind by the market's senior index recently, jumped 27.3 to 3,789.4, its highest level since April 28 this year. The upsurge in share prices was given increased credence by market specialists who pointed to another substantial increase in the level of business transacted in London. Turnover reached 843.5m shares, the heaviest single day's business for some months and with the market leaders accounting for almost half of that figure, indicating a sharp increase in the level of institutional buying in the FT-SE 100 stocks. Analysts said the value of customer business in the market on Wednesday reached Pounds 1.68bn - the highest for some time - and added that marketmakers had reported a surge of retail buying interest yesterday. Dealers in the UK were slightly unnerved by the power and pace of Wall Street's performance, which followed a surprisingly large 4.2 per cent fall in durable goods orders. Wall Street was also supported by a better than expected auction for some Dollars 11bn-worth of five-year bonds. The FT-SE 100 began the day 33 points higher, as marketmakers hoisted their opening prices to try and head off any over-aggressive buying interest in areas where the market was known to be short of stock. Renewed buying of the FT-SE future drove its premium to fair value up to around 30 points shortly after the opening but slipped back thereafter to end the session at around seven points. A strong opening and subsequent performance by gilts, which remained well bid all day, helped underpin the equity market. Activity in equities began to tail off around midday when the future turned off, a move which triggered a flurry of arbitrage activity in the future and the cash market. But any selling of equities was generally well absorbed, dealers said. A disappointing opening by Wall Street, which moved quickly into negative territory shortly after the start of trading, did little damage to European markets. The FT-SE 100 trickled back to end the session still in good shape, and was influenced by a very heavy two-way trading programme, said to have been executed by BZW, the leading UK investment bank, and worth in excess of Pounds 100m. The regional electricity stocks continued to race ahead, still boosted by share buy back stories, stakebuilding rumours and a generally bullish outlook for the companies. There was aggressive buying of Eastern Electricity with marketmakers noting persistent bids on the inter-dealer broker network. And Norweb rose strongly after the group announced big job cuts. Standard Chartered moved up amid suggestions that a broker's buy circular is imminent while Redland rose strongly for the same reason. There was big switching in recently strong Prudential shares into Legal &amp; General. Meanwhile, the composites, which have been strongly supported as gilts and equities moved up strongly, came under pressure as profit-takers moved in. Rentokil's interims were given a poor reception.</p>

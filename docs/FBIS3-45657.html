			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  Central Postal Office in Beijing recently announced that an air  mail service company, which will operate relatively  independently and which will assume sole responsibility for its  profits and losses, will be established. In the near future,  China's postal departments will possess their own airplanes and  will substantially improve their services, putting an end to the  past situation of having no express delivery.    Since the 1950's, China's postal departments have primarily  relied on railroad and aviation services to deliver mail.  Because the volume of mail has risen sharply in recent years --  an overall increase of 20 percent annually and an increase in  express delivery of 71.7 percent and even 100 percent in some  regions -- the railroad and aviation services can no longer meet  the demand. Of all complaints received by the express delivery  postal departments, more than 80 percent were related to losses  incurred in economy and credibility because of the late delivery  of mail. In the past, when China had no express delivery  services, it took an average of 5 to 7 days to deliver a letter  from one province to another. For a remote province, it could  take more than 10 days. The postal services have failed to  correspond with the rapid development of the national economy.    At present, the postal departments have to pay airlines a  considerable amount in freight charges to transport air mail  items. As this operational system faces many contradictions and  problems, it cannot meet the increasing needs. The postal  departments should be capable of carrying out independent  operations as soon as possible. On one hand, the postal  departments should consult with the aviation departments and  continue postal services through the airlines. On the other,  they should set up an independent postal aviation company in  order to increase social efficiency.    Preparations for the establishment of the new air mail  service company are going smoothly in various aspects. It is  being said that the preparatory work for the company has entered  a new stage.</p>

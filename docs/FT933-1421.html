			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Losing cities saddened by Olympic defeat DISTRESS was evident in the face of the Beijing studio audience watching the nationally televised broadcast when the news came that Beijing had lost the Games. One member of the audience, when asked about the Americans, said simply: 'I hate them.' 'It will not help relations with the US,' a western diplomat said. 'There could be a surge of negativity.' The decision of the International Olympic Committee is a big setback to the Communist party, which has acted for months as if winning the Olympics was a foregone conclusion and has been angered by calls in the US Congress for Beijing to be denied the 2000 Games on human rights grounds. Security was stepped up outside the British and American embassies, and employees at the British embassy were told not to drive their cars to work today for fear of vandalism. Immediately after the decision, the state television announcer read a prepared People's Daily editorial and a statement from Mr Li Tieying, the head of the commission on restructuring economy. Both thanked the Chinese for their efforts and stressed the importance of carrying on with China's programme of reform and modernisation despite the defeat. Meanwhile, stunned silence, a sad collective groan and the tears of several of north-west England's lady mayoresses at a VIP recpetion greeted Sydney's victory as the result came over a giant television screen in Manchester town hall. But the red, white and blue balloons slung in nets high in the ceiling of the great hall were not spilled out in celebration on to the throng below. Then, himself fighting back tears, Councillor William Risby, the lord mayor, said: 'The task I have to do on behalf of Manchester, and its people, to a man and a woman, is to wish all the best to Sydney for a successful games.' Mr Robert Key, the environment minister who has provided the government's chief liaison with the bid, said: 'Of course we are disappointed, but at least we have kept it in the family. The British taught the world how to be good sportsmen and sportswomen, so we mean it when we wish Sydney well.' Anti-Olympic campaigners in Berlin did not crack open the champagne, nor did they burst out in song last night. Instead, like the many thousands who had gathered under the Brandenburg Gate, formerly the symbol of a divided Europe, they joined in the stunned silence when the announcement was broadcast on the giant screen. Then the crying started, especially among the Berliners. Mr Herbert Werner, a 40-year-old restaurant manager, was weeping with disappointment. 'It's so sad,' he said. 'This would have been a great chance uniting not only the two Germanys but Europe as well. We could have used the games as a symbol of peace.' Opposition to the campaign among some Berliners under the banner 'NOlympics' helped influence the decision. The campaign distanced itself from anarchists who staged arson attacks on department stores which had sponsored the Games bid. Jutta, from Kreuzberg, home of bedraggled leftovers of the 1960s radical movement, said: 'I'm glad Berlin didn't get it. This unification is costing a packet. We have too many problems with the economy and unification. The taxpayer would have had to pay more.' Such was Istanbul's assessment of its own chances that Young and Rubicam, the marketing agency handling its bid to host the Games, even had a 'let-down' campaign in place before the disappointment of last night's vote. But on a balmy Sep-tember evening, most young Istanbullus were more taken up by the presence of Michael Jackson, the US pop star, rocking an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 at the Inonu Stadium overlooking the Bosporus when the IOC announced the winner.

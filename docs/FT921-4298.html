			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Torday at near break-even TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, the niche engineer which fought off an Pounds 18m bid from Dowding &amp; Mills last year, yesterday announced the virtual elimination of profits for 1991. The dividend is being cut from 7p to 4.5p. The result - down from Pounds 4m to Pounds 25,000 at the pre-tax level  - was better than expected as the group had forecast a loss of Pounds 110,000 during the three-month bid battle. Turnover fell by 16 per cent to Pounds 42.8m. Exceptional charges for redundancies had depressed profits by Pounds 684,000. Further charges of Pounds 1.15m were taken below the line. They included the Pounds 653,000 cost of fighting off the Dowding bid and a provision for a leasehold property. Mr Peter Ryan, chairman of Dan-Air, is to become non-executive chairman, following the annual meeting. Mr Paul Torday, chairman and chief executive, said he felt the group needed a more objective role for the chairmanship. Oldham Signs, where losses had forced the group into the red at the interim stage, had been returned to profit in the final quarter, said Mr Torday. Losses for the year totalled Pounds 1m. Mr Torday warned that the order book for 1992 had fallen back from the fourth quarter. DMI, the diesel engine and marine business, contributed operating profits of Pounds 1.8m. Although orders were higher than at the same time last year, Mr Torday warned that factors such as the decline in world trade activity could have a bearing on the division's future performance. Pound for pound, Mr Torday said Elfab Hughes - which makes pressure relief and safety equipment - had provided a better return on capital employed. This division contributed Pounds 650,000 at the operating level. The final dividend was 3p (4.7p), making a total of 4.5p (7p). The losses per share were 4.58p compared with earnings of 17.85p.</p>

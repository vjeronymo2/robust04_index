			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HANSCOM WINS SURF KAYAK TITLE  </P> <P> Eric Hanscom of San Diego routed the field in the World Kayak Surf  Championships this past week in Cardiff, Wales, scoring 546 points, 27 more  than the second-place finisher.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive year Hanscomb has taken the title, but the  victory was somewhat bittersweet. The U.S. team, coached by Hanscom, managed  only a third-place finish.  </P> <P> "Of course I would have been happier if we were also able to repeat as team  champions," Hanscom said. "However, after our upset win last year, I knew the  Europeans would work hard to beat us this year.  </P> <P> "I am obviously elated about my individual title."  </P> <P> England and Wales finished first and second in the team competition.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Point Loma Nazarene College opened its second season under Coach Barbara  Rozendal with an easy nonleague victory at Mt. St. Mary's, 15-9, 15-5, 15-4.  </P> <P> The Crusaders were led by Roberta Silva, who had six service aces; Liz  Villanueva, five kills, and Tracy Daniels, 16 assists.  </P> <P> "I thought we could have played a lot better," Rozendal said. "At times we  weren't playing together as a team, but it was a good win, especially for our  first game after practicing only a week and a half."  </P> <P> San Diego State took two victories at Cal State Fullerton's Collegiate Premiere  tournament, getting by Southwest Texas, 15-3, 15-7, 15-7 and then going five  games before defeating Minnesota, 15-6, 15-1, 12-15, 11-15, 15-11.  </P> <P> Caroline Kasper had 16 kills for the Aztecs and seven aces. Erin Tomblin also  had seven aces and Amy Erben had six solo blocks and 15 kills.  </P> <P> The Aztecs, ranked 14th nationally, are 4-3, 2-0 in the tournament.  </P> <P> U.S. International fell to 1-4 as St. Mary's defeated the Gulls, 15-12, 9-15,  15-0, 5-15, 15-8. St. Mary's is 2-1.  </P> <P> SOCCER  </P> <P> A young U.S. International soccer team (16 newcomers, 14 freshman) continues  its season this weekend as host of the 15th USIU Soccer tournament. All games  except tonight's opener between USD and Cal, which will be played at USD  (7:30), will be held at USIU's Scripps Ranch campus.  </P> <P> The fourth team involved in the tournament, Cal State Dominguez Hills, plays  USIU at noon Saturday.  </P> <P> USD is the defending champion.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Song Ui-ho: "Manpower in North Korea's Nuclear </F> Development Program: Its Personal Relationships, Training and  Taboos"]    [Excerpts]    -- To Sang-nok, Han In-sok and other scientists who  defected to the North against the "National University Plan"  laid the foundations. -- Under General Manager  Chong Kun, a "Moscow-trained group" including Choe Hak-kun and  Yun Ho-chin played the key role. -- Theses  written by 100-odd North Korean scientists in the 1970's are  kept in the U.S. National Archives.  -- Construction of the Yongbyon nuclear development  complex began in 1962. -- Security is so tight  that even Kim Il-song has to disembark from his car when  entering the Yongbyon complex.    When did North Korea embark on its nuclear development  program? Who have participated in it, and how has Pyongyang  trained the required manpower? And what are the general software  levels of the program?    These questions surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue  have not been fully answered, although there has been a great  deal of discussion dealing with hardware. There have been  debates as to the type of atomic reactors in Yongbyon, the  amount of plutonium they could produce, the kind of reprocessing  facilities, and the number of weapons they have possibly  developed by now, but almost nothing is known about the people  who possibly have participated in those processes.    For this reporting, I interviewed nuclear scientists in the  South, persons who had served in high positions in North Korea  in the past, and correspondents who visited Pyongyang. I also  received assistance from intelligence agencies at home and  abroad. Among them were some who were deeply involved in the  nuclear development effort in the Pak Chong-hui era. Also, I  used channels with links to the Japanese Cabinet Information  Research Office.    North Korea first began exploring nuclear development  possibilities in the mid-1950's immediately after the end of the  Korean War. Kim Il-song, who had been unnerved by MacArthur's  atomic bomb threat, reorganized the Korean People's Army [KPA]  in 1954 right after the end of the war, establishing a "Nuclear  Weapons Defense Branch" for the first time as part of the  reorganization.    The next year, in 1955, President Eisenhower went so far as  to say that "new-type nuclear weapons" will be deployed to the  U.S. Forces in Korea [USFK], stirring North Korea. Meanwhile,  President Syngman Rhee, crying out for "March to the North for  Reunification," declared that "if the North invades us, we will  respond with a nuclear holocaust." North Korea, confronted with  the crisis, held a mammoth Pyongyang City Mass Rally on 5 August  1955 to condemn the United States. According to Mr "A," a former  North Korean official who participated in that rally, "the  uneasy feelings the nuclear threat caused among the North Korean  authorities and population then were almost a panic."    About that time, the former Soviet Union, then the leading  power of the communist world, launched an all-out effort to  develop a new-type, nuclear weapon that can match what the  United States had.    Thus came the "Agreement on the Organization of a Joint  Nuclear Research Center" signed in 1956 as part of Soviet  nuclear strategy. The agreement stated that 11 socialist  countries (the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam,  Mongolia, Poland, East Germany, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and  Albania) will pool manpower and material resources for joint  nuclear research and utilization to strengthen the nuclear  capabilities of the socialist camp.    The joint research thus started was conducted at the  renowned  Dubna Nuclear Research Center in Moscow. It was an old institute  reorganized and rechristened "Dubna Joint Nuclear Research  Center," they say. "It was then that North Korea, in accordance  with the agreement, began sending 20 to 30 nuclear physicists to  Dubna every year," said Mr "A."    Subsequently, the "Korea-USSR Agreement on the Peaceful Use  of Atomic Energy" was signed in 1959, and North Korea began  creating a nuclear development complex in Yongbyon in 1962.  Through all this, Pyongyang took interest in a nuclear  development program early on.    Then came the 1962 "Cuban crisis" which led North Korea to  distrust the Soviet nuclear umbrella. The Soviet fleet steaming  through the Caribbean Sea carrying missiles to Cuba was  confronted with the U.S. threat of war, bowed to the pressure  and made an eleventh-hour retreat. NODONG SINMUN strongly  criticized the action by Khrushchev. North Korea was seized with  apprehensions that with Khrushchev in power, the protection of  the Soviet nuclear umbrella could be taken away from it in the  event of a similar U.S. threat.    It was precisely in December that year at the Fifth Plenum  of  the Fourth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee that  North Korea put forth the Four Military Lines calling for  self-reliant defenses. The military strategy adopted then was  essentially sought to thwart the U.S. atomic bomb.    Mr "A" continued: "There was only one way to make the U.S.  atomic bomb good for nothing and it was for them to go  underground. The Turn-the-Whole-Country-Into-a-Fortress policy  was basically a `hedgehog tactic,' that is, going underground.  All installations began moves to as deep as 150-200 meters  underground. The subway in Pyongyang was no exception."    The U.S. nuclear threat increased its pressure on North  Korea  in the early 1970's. Especially, at the collapse of South  Vietnam in 1975, the United States deployed additional tactical  nuclear weapons in South Korea against a possible invasion by  the North, even pronouncing that "if the North should invade the  South, we will crush it with our tactical nuclear weapons."  Newspapers and broadcasts unhesitatingly reported on the nuclear  arming of the USFK.    "At the time, North Korea was engrossed in the task of  determining the strength of tactical nuclear weapons deployed to  the USFK. Materials were gathered from South Korean newspapers,  broadcasts, and magazines and from authoritative Japanese and  U.S. newspapers for analytical purposes. Through this work, it  determined that the number of tactical nuclear weapons as  referred to in a `Memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,' was 900 to 1,000," said Mr. "A."    Against these historical backdrops, Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il began saying in the mid-1970's that "the key of modern  warfare is nuclear strategy. The nuclear weapon can be a  political and military threat." In other words, Pyongyang had  recognized its military strategic need for nuclear weapons.  Further, it began viewing nuclear weapons in light of the  strategy for survival. It was then that the North Korean  leadership began thinking--vaguely though--that it should come  to have nuclear weapons. [passage omitted]    It can be said that the Manhattan Project and France's TGV  high-speed train system belongs to this category, the category  of Big Science. So, which way a country pushes its Big Science  program has an important bearing on the future of that country.    "In North Korea's case, military science--nuclear science in  particular--must have become an ambitious Big Science program  for it," says Dr Yun Se-won, 72, a South Korean nuclear science  pioneer of the Syngman Rhee era.    According to scientists who were deeply involved in nuclear  development in the Pak Chong-hui era, North Korean scientists  who worked for the nuclear development program, Pyongyang's Big  Science program, can be divided into the first, second, and  third generations--those who defected to the North around the  time of the Korean War forming the first, their children who  defected to the North with them and who later studied in the  Soviet Union making up the second, and those who were educated  in North Korea, then studied in the Soviet Union and who are  currently working in the nuclear development program  representing the third generation.    Among those viewed as leading first-generation figures who  must have established a master plan and led the development  program are To Sang-nok, Yi Sung-ki, and Han In-sok. Their  personal history follows:    To Sang-nok, a native of South Hamgyong Province, majored in  physics at Tokyo Imperial University [present Tokyo University].  On liberation, he returned to Korea and became a Kyongsong  University [present Seoul National University, SNU] physics  professor. According to Dr. Cho Sun-tak, 70, former director of  the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology [KAIST],  To Sang-nok was his professor in his university days. Professor  To, he said, had studied two years at Tokyo Imperial University,  which was then a three-year institute, spending the third year,  the year for thesis writing, in Korea working as a teacher at  Songdo Middle School in Kaesong, for financial reasons involving  his family. Thus, he had to earn his way through the university.  The thesis he wrote then was about "the Structure of the  Hydrogen Molecule."    After that, To Sang-nok worked as professor of Singyong  University, established in Manchuria mainly by Tokyo U.  graduates, until immediately before liberation. On liberation,  he moved to Kyongsong University. His son, To In-sop, also  attended the SNU physics course. The father and son are said to  have defected to the North together. Regarding his work in North  Korea, Mr. "B," another former North Korean official, said as  follows:    "I understand that while serving as the head of the chair of  physics in Kim Il-song University, Prof. To was devoted to  radioisotope research. Through with the pure science stage, his  research was on military application. Without Soviet aid, he was  laying the foundations of nuclear energy research almost  single-handedly. His academic level was so high that those who  know used to cite as top scientists `To Sang-nok in physics, Yi  Sung-ki in chemistry, and Kye Ung-sang in sericultural science.'  In other words, To Sang-nok is the father of nuclear research in  North Korea."    To Sang-nok became an Academician, the highest position for  a  scientist in North Korea, and was awarded the titles of Labor  Hero and People's Scientist. He died in February 1990.    Meanwhile, some observers view Dr Yi Sung-ki as having made  greater contributions to the North Korea nuclear development  program. They are mostly veteran scientists who know both To  Sang-nok and Yi Sung-ki well or those who took part in the Pak  Chong-hui era nuclear development effort. Yi Sung-ki has a  distinguished record as scientist.    A native of Tamyang, South Cholla Province, he majored in  synthetic fiber at Kyoto University, Japan. He was the second  SNU president when he defected to the North immediately before  the Korean War. And by inventing vinalon, a synthetic fiber from  coal, he became a world-renowned scientist. Besides, Yi Sung-ki  was known for being broad- and open-minded. So, he had many  followers in the South, too, it was said.    Commenting on his role in the nuclear development program,  Dr  Yi Pyong- ho, 70, professor emeritus of the KAIST nuclear  engineering department, said as follows:    "Although it is not very likely that he participated  directly  in the nuclear development program, there is no question that he  must have performed the role of organizing the research team for  it. He is the top leader of North Korean scientists. When he  selects people for a project and ask them for cooperation, it  would be unlikely that they turn him down. Prof. To Sang-nok  was, basically, a loner-type researcher, while Prof. Yi Sung-ki  had a great deal of experience in setting up team work in  research."    Moreover, considering the fact that the process of  extracting  plutonium for atomic bomb materials is fundamentally a process  of chemical engineering, and that Kyoto U. is known for being  most advanced in nuclear physical chemistry, it would not be  strange if he took part in the nuclear development program.    It is officially unknown who was the first director of the  Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center [NRC]. According to a scientist  who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear  development effort, "Yi Sung-ki was the first director" of the  Yongbyon NRC. "He was not," countered Mr. "B," the former North  Korean official who testified earlier about To Sang-no. With  regard to Yi Sung-ki's work in North Korea, the latter said as  follows:    "It is true that of all the scientists in North Korea, Yi  Sung-ki was trusted most, but he was a chemical engineer known  for his vinalon research, not a nuclear scientist. He became the  director of the Research Institute of Chemical Technology right  after his defection to the North, but soon began devoting  himself to vinalon research while leaving institute business to  Yo Kyong-ku, his junior partner. Needless to say, it is not that  he made no contributions to military science. It should be  noted, however, that while making all-out efforts for nuclear  development, North Korea did even more to develop chemical  weapons. When the Defense College was established in 1962 under  the Four Military Lines, Yi Sung-ki became its first commandant.  This put him in military uniform for a while. Thus, I understand  that while in charge of training scientists and engineers for  munitions industries, he was deeply involved in chemical weapons  development." [passage omitted]    For his service in solving the problem of clothing for the  people with his invention of vinalon, Yi Sung-ki was awarded the  title of Labor Hero and the Lenin Prize in 1962. Currently, he  is serving as the head of the Hamhung branch of the Academy of  Sciences. According to Mr. "B," the person who said that Yi  Sung-ki did not take part in the North Korean nuclear  development program, "the first director of the Yongbyon NRC was  Han In-sok." [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, influenced by Dr. Yi Sung-ki, many professors and  students of the SNU engineering school's chemical engineering  branch defected to the North. Among those professors were Yo  Kyong-ku, who went over to the North even before Yi, and Ma  Hyong-ok, Yi Se-hun, Kim Tae-yol, Yi Chang-chik, and Sin  Hyon-sok. Also, it is said that it was about that time when Kwon  Tae-mun, Kim Pyong-chun, and Ok Chi-hun, who were all classmates  of Ma Kyong-sok, 73, honorary president of the South Korea  Engineers Club, and second-batch graduates of the chemical  engineering branch, defected to the North. It is difficult to  rule out the possibility of those who had majored in chemical  engineering, a course with possible links to nuclear  reprocessing, having performed a role in the nuclear development  program.    According to Ma Kyong-sok, he learned some time ago, through  telephone conversations with Dr Yi Sung-ki and Ok Chi-hun, of  the Hamhung branch of the Academy of Sciences, that of these  people, Yo Kyong-ku, Prof. Sin Hyon-sok, and Kwon Tae-mun had  died. He was also told, Ma said, that Yi Chae-op, a graduate of  the Kyoto U. chemical engineering course who defected to the  North before Liberation, and Chang Chil-pyo, his pupil who went  to the North with him, had married Yi Sung-ki's daughters.    Besides Dr. Yi Sung-ki and Prof. To Sang-nok, another person  who seemed to have played a leading role in the nuclear  development program is Prof. Han In-sok. A graduate of the  physics course of Japan's Tohoku University, he studied in  Germany for a while, then served as physics professor at  Kyongsong U. It is known that soon after that, he, as one of the  opponents to the "National University Plan," briefly moved to  Yonsei University before defecting to the North.    According to his pupils who remember him, it is unlikely  that  Han In-sok had attracted attention as a preeminent physicist --  not in South Korea at least. In the North, however, it seems  that he stood very much in the spotlight. Mr "B," who said that  Han In-sok was the first director of the Yongbyon Atomic Energy  Research Center, explained Han's role in North Korea as follows:    "While at Kim Il-song University [KISU] as physics  professor,  Han In-sok went to Moscow to study the latest nuclear theories  for some time. He began giving North Korean leaders, including  party cadres, lectures on the importance of nuclear energy and  the need for nuclear development, in the late 1950's. He was  articulate. In the early 1960's, he put out many theses  concerning nuclear development. This led to rumors among cadres  that he was even more capable than To Sang-nok. Han In-sok,  along with To Sang-nok, can be called the founder of North  Korea's nuclear physics."    In 1965, Han In-sok made public his research paper entitled  "Distribution of Irregular Speeds of Electrons in Plasma." Dr.  Yun Se-won, Han's pupil, said he and Han frequently got together  at parties when they were both professors at Yonsei U. for a  short period. Yun said: "He was a man of little ambition but of  great passion and outstanding brains. The only setback was his  move to Yonsei; he did not get the treatment he deserved while  there. According to Yun, Prof. Han celebrated his 60th birthday  about 25 years ago. In an appearance in a broadcast program that  day, Han said that "I have a pupil in the South," referring to  him by name, Yun said, adding that "I was deeply impressed."    The person who also seemingly performed an important role,  only next to the roles played by the three, To Sang-nok and Yi  Sung-ki and Han In- ok, in importance, is none other than Chong  Kun. According to a nuclear engineer who was deeply involved in  the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort, "when Dr Yi  Sung-ki was in charge of organizing the nuclear development  team, Chong Kun must have acted as the top working aide for him.  I had felt his such presence on various occasions."    Chong Kun, one of the second-batch graduates of the  Kyongsong  U. physics course, majored in basic physics, molecular movements  in particular. It is said that he left for Moscow to study after  his defection to the North. It was the time when KISU was being  established. He studied nuclear physics in Moscow, specializing  in reactor physics, a field directly linked with the nuclear  development program. On his return from Moscow, he became a  member of KISU. He is known to have written five or six theses  on reactors after that.    Dr. Cho Sun-tak views Chong Kun as an "extraordinarily  brilliant person." "When I was involved in a leftist movement,"  Cho said, "I first thought that he belonged to the South Korean  Labor Party, but later learned that he had belonged to the North  Korean Workers Party from the beginning." That made him remember  Chong very clearly, Cho added. Among the theses Chong wrote in  the 1960's were "Research on Thermoelectric Phenomena," "Thermal  Diffusion of Neutrons," and "On Minimums of Metallic Resistance  at Low Temperatures."    In addition to the above-listed, scientists like Yo  Kyong-ku,  Chon Pyong-su, Kim Yong-ho and Yo Chol-ki are thought, in the  views of atomic energy-related scholars, to have participated in  the nuclear development program one way or another, for their  academic levels.    Yo Kyong-ku, nephew of Yo Un-hyong, who majored in applied  chemistry in Japan's Waseda University, was assistant professor  of chemical engineering at Kyongsong U. when he made his rather  early defection to the North. About that time, after learning  that Dr. Yi Sung-ki was troubled by the "National University  Plan," he is said to have visited Yi to suggest that he go over  to the North. In North Korea, Yo Kyong-ku rose to Candidate  Academician of the Academy of Sciences. He is said to have  participated in the V-2 rocket development in Okinawa in the  last days of World War II.    Chon Pyong-su, a native of Hamhung who majored in physics in  Japan's Hokkaido University, briefly served as physics professor  at Kyongsong U. While in Japan, he was viewed as being so  extraordinarily brilliant that his professor made him his top  student, they say. Ideologically, however, he was socialist from  the beginning. In North Korea, he briefly departed from  scientific research and joined a political school, even serving  as the party's top responsible officer at KISU.    It is known that after leaving that post, Chon Pyong-su  shifted from pure research to experiment. Among theses he wrote  in the 1960's were "On Nuclear Interaction in Nuclear Fluid by  Particles with Energy," "On Raising Precision in Measurement of  Each Distribution," and "On Each Distribution of Secondary  Particles in Nuclear Interaction with Heavy Nucleuses in Nuclear  Fluid."    Kim Yong-ho, who majored in quantum chemistry at Japan's  Kyoto U., was a chemistry professor at Kyongsong U. when he  defected to the North. Quantum chemistry is said to have  connections with nuclear reprocessing facilities. He was also  reputed to be a very outstanding scientist, they say.    Yo Chol-ki, one of the second-batch graduates of the SNU  physics course, was assistant professor of the university when  he defected to the North. He is a brother of Yo Sok-ki, who was  once English literature professor of Korea University. He  attended a 1990 World Conference of Korean Physicists held at  Yanbian University in China as chairman of the North Korean  Physical Society, and accompanied by four persons. He was a  Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences at the time. It  was then that Dr. Ko Yun-sok, 67, former chairman of the  Physical Society of the South, met Yo Chol-ki, his 2-year  senior, for the first time in many years. They talked about many  things. Of the meeting, Ko said as follows:    "He was calm and not particularly argumentative. He was the  same chain smoker as he was before. His specialty then was  plasma physics. As I knew it, it was his fourth. He had  specialized in hydromechanics, then in particle physics, and the  latest I had heard was that he was studying nuclear physics. The  fact alone that he was ranging over a number of fields like that  made me think that he was perhaps assigned some important job.  Strangely, whenever I asked about some statistics, he kept his  mouth shut."    Besides Yo Chol-ki, North Korean physicists Cho Pyong-nae  and  Kim Yong-il, both specializing in statistical mechanical  physics, attended the conference. Another scientist named Ko  Yong-hye, specializing in the theory of field at KISU, who  appeared to be in his fifties, also showed up at the conference.    Scientists referred to in the above were mostly Kyongsong U.  professors in physics or chemical engineering when they defected  to the North. Leftist leaders at the Kyongsong U. science and  engineering school in those days were To Sang-nok and Yo  Kyong-ku, it was said. Although those scientist defectors were  mostly leftists opposed to the "National University Plan," they  excelled in scholarship. In the views of atomic energy-related  scholars, they must have laid North Korea's scientific  foundations, setting the direction of its nuclear development  program.    Other scientists from the South include Choe Sam-yol, a  graduate of the Tohoku U. chemistry course, who served as  professor of KISU and later became an Academician, and Yi  Chae-yong, a graduate of the Kyoto U. fuel chemistry course.  These people went straight to North Korea while they were  overseas for study purposes. In the views of atomic energy  scientists in the South, it is possible that they also  participated in North Korea's Big Science project, the nuclear  development program.    Forming another group are second-generation scientists who  were trained by the above-listed seniors and who could have  performed the central role in the nuclear development program.  Among them are Choe Hak-kun, Yun Ho-chin and Kye Yong-sun.    Choe Hak-kun, a native of Hamgyong Province, is a nuclear  expert who went to Moscow University from KISU, then to the  Dubna NRC. Following his return home, he served as the second  director of the Yongbyon NRC, then as minister of the Ministry  of Atomic Energy Industry, which was created within the State  Administration Ministry in December 1986. He also served as  counselor in Vienna for 4 years from 1975, when North Korea  joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi, 64, former director of the Atomic Energy  Bureau of the [ROK] Ministry of Science and Technology, and IAEA  board member for 1977 through 1983, was Choe Hak-kun's  counterpart in Vienna. North Korean officials in Vienna usually  moved around in a pair; on rare occasions when Choe met with Dr.  Yi by himself, he always was inquisitive about the state of  atomic energy in South Korea, said Dr. Yi.    At the time, one of the three secretary-level officials --  graduates of KISU physics, metal engineering, and chemical  engineering departments respectively -- alternately came from  Pyongyang to work under Choe Hak-kun. They were seen frequenting  at the IAEA library, where detailed information were available  on blueprints of, and construction methods used for, atomic  reactors that had been built in various parts of the world. Dr.  Yi continued:    "Over there, one could obtain the entire information needed  to build an atomic reactor in 1 or 2 years if he was determined  to do so. Suppose North Korea had spent about 4 years making  such preparations, the 5-megawatt-class Yongbyon No. 2 atomic  reactor was possibly built in early 1980. Give it enough time  for a good trial run and inspection, say 7 years, then the  reactor could possibly be put in operation in 1988."    Dr. Yi also noted that "at any rate, the massive data thus  gathered at the time must have been used for the nuclear  development program." He added that "Choe Hak-kun is believed to  have played a significant role in that process." Meanwhile,  since North Korea's entry into the IAEA, Choe Hak-kun  intensified his demand for the "denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula."    Yun Ho-chin, resident officer in Vienna, was responsible for  administrative affairs concerning the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty [NPT] and the inspection issue. A graduate of the KISU  physics department, he also had extensive knowledge about  nuclear power. Once he was engaged in a heated debate with  Ambassador Kennedy, the ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary of the U.S. State Department on NPT issues.  According to Dr. Yi, who was listening to the debate, it seemed  that no one could beat Yun in argument. He is a specialist who  is, in effect, in charge of external affairs concerning the  North Korean nuclear issue.    Kye Yong-sun, a KISU gradate, who also studied in the Dubna  NRC, is a key figure in North Korea's nuclear power plant  construction. It was he who first suggested that "we build  nuclear power plants for ourselves" in early 1970, they say. Kye  Hyong-sun, former minister of machine-building industry,  regarded as the godfather of North Korea's munitions industry,  is his elder brother, they say.    Under these second-generation scientists, there are  third-generation specialists who returned from the former Soviet  Union and are currently active on the first line of the nuclear  development program. Their names are mostly unknown.  Fortunately, Mr "B," the former high official in North Korea,  knew one of them -- Yi Yun-song, alias Yi Yun-su.    Yi Yun-song, a very bright boy since his childhood, went to  Moscow U. the year after his graduation from KISU, obtaining a  Ph.D in physics at the age of 31. On his return from Moscow, he  served as a professor at Pyongsong Institute of Science before  moving to the Yongbyon NRC. He should be about 50 years old and,  if he still is with the NRC, he could be at the level of a  section chief.    The people mentioned above are part of the North Korean  brains in the nuclear development program as we came to know  about from information provided by atomic energy scientists and  intelligence agencies in our country and by people who formerly  served in high posts in North Korea. They of course represent  only a small part of the picture. It is a limitation we face,  but there is a way to overcome it a little bit.    It is by using our judgement on the basis of theses written  by North Korean scientists. Agencies in the South reportedly  used the same method for some time to measure levels of the  North Korean nuclear development program. Basically, however, it  is difficult to gain access to such theses. The Korean division  of the National Archives of the U.S. Congress is known to be the  only place in the West that provides access to theses by North  Korean scientists.    Even so, it is limited to the period through the early  1970's. Entering the 1970's, North Korea apparently tightened  control over the handling of theses as it embarked on its  nuclear development program. Those available at the National  Archives are said to be the result of a volunteer's efforts who  collected them in Hong Kong despite great difficulties.    The theses kept in the National Archives are by 100-odd  scientists, mostly published between the 1950's and the early  1970's. They include many by the previously mentioned  scientists. Most of the theses were printed in KWAHAGWON TONGBO  [ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT], which is a highest-level journal  published in North Korea. About half of them only deal with  mathematics while the rest are doing researches based on  experiments. Considering the fact that they were by North Korean  scientists in the period through the early 1970's, and that the  nuclear development program has been Pyongyang's Big Science  undertaking, it can be said that a considerably large number of  the authors probably participated in the nuclear development  program.    Dr. Chong Sun-tak, who examined the theses, said "their  research seems to cover fields such as high energy, solid-state  physics, statistical physics, hydrodynamics, astrophysics, and  even atomic nucleus. In respect to experiments, it appears that  organized research with links to defense and industry were under  way." The following is a look at some of those scientists who  have published relatively many theses, their post at the time  and their representative thesis:     -  Kim Kyong-chong, assistant  professor, engineering, B.A.; "Heat Transfer Between the Fixed  Bed and the Heat-Exchange Wall" (1966)    -  Kim Myong-nin,  engineering, B.A.; "On Mechanism of Interaction Between  Manganese Oxides and Sulphurous Acid Gas in Water Solution"  (1966)    -  Kim In-sik, candidate academician, engineering;  "Experiment of Pellet Melting by Various Chemical Catalysts in  the Electric Furnace" (1961)    -  Kim Hyong-nak, assistant professor,  chemistry, B.A.; "New Calculating Method in Chemical Analyses  Using Formation Reaction of Adherent Compounds" (1967)    -  Yi  Myong-ha, physical mathematics, B.A.; "On Energy Loss of Charged  Particles with Magnetic Moment in Plasma" (1964)    -  Yi Yon,  physics, B.A.; "Statistical Dynamical Instability in the  Combination of the Atomic Nucleus" (1965)    -  So Sang-kuk, physics,  B.A.; "On Phenomenological Quantum Electrodynamics of the Scalar  Particle" (1964)    -  Chong Kye-son, physical mathematics, B.A.;  "Effect of Plastic Deformation to High-Temperature Internal  Friction" (1967)    Among other physicists and chemists whose theses are found  in  the National Archives are: Kang Ho-ung, physics, B.A.; Kwak  Tae-hung, professor, engineering, Ph.D.; Kim Nae-su, chemistry,  B.A.; Kim Tal-won, engineering, B.A.; Kim Yong-hum, assistant  professor, engineering, B.A.; Kim Il-tae, chemistry, B.A.; Kim  Chae-kil, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Chong-tok, assistant professor,  physics, B.A.; Kim Chun-ul, assistant professor, engineering,  B.A.; Kim Chun-hwan, chemistry, B.A.; Kim Hyong-nak, assistant  professor, chemistry, B.A.; Yu Chong-kun, assistant professor,  engineering; Yi Mun- yong, engineering, B.A.; Yi Pang-kun,  engineering, B.A.; Yi Song-chun, assistant professor,  engineering; Yi Yong-tae, physics, B.A.; Yi Chae- pok, assistant  professor, physical mathematics, B.A.; Yi Hyo-chin, engineering,  B.A.; Pae Nae-sop, assistant professor, engineering; Paek  Yong-kon, physics, B.A.; Pyon Yong-nip, physical mathematics,  B.A.; Sin Mun-kyu, engineering, B.A.; Sin Pyong-chong,  engineering, B.A.; Sin Tae- kon, engineering, B.A.; Sin  Taek-hui, assistant professor, engineering; Om Song-nok,  engineering, B.A.; Yu Song-chol, engineering, B.A.; Cho Yong-uk,  physics, B.A.; Cho Chol-hui, engineering, B.A.; Choe Sok-kwon,  chemistry, B.A.; Hong Sun-tae, engineering, B.A.; Hong Ha-kyong,  chemistry, B.A.    In addition, there were scientists brought in from overseas,  mostly Korean residents in foreign countries. Explaining, Mr.  "B" said:    "I understand that quite a few overseas Korean nuclear  scientists entered North Korea. In most cases, they were  residents either in the Soviet Union or Japan. For them,  separate research facilities were set up, mainly in Kanggye and  Hyesan in Chagang Province where many weapons production bases  were located, as well as in the vicinity of Pyongyang. I  understand that in the cases of well-known figures, some were  assigned to the National Defence and Science Institute."    Of those from Japan, some stayed on in North Korea taking  part in the development program while others shuttled between  the two countries. The Korean Scientists and Engineers  Association in Japan (Kwahyop) served as the channel. Kwahyop's  slogan was "Promote Scientific Research and Technological  Development of Korean Scientists in Japan and Contribute to  North Korea's Construction."    More than 100 executives and members of Kwahyop are  reportedly playing key roles in advanced science and technology  divisions of Japanese universities and corporations. Among them  are scientists working in nuclear fusion, control engineering  and accelerator fields or even taking part in nuclear technology  development programs.    Dr. Kyong Won-ha is one of them whose name is frequently  mentioned in conversations concerning Korean scientists who went  to North Korea from Japan. He is known to have participated in  the atomic bomb building at the Los Alamos laboratory in New  Mexico, then served as professor at Canada's McGill University  before moving to North Korea in about 1974. But a check with  atomic energy-related scientists and people who formerly  serviced in high posts in North Korea revealed that none of them  had any knowledge about him.    At a time when information is as scarce as it is, the  foregoing list could represent a small, first step in our  attempt to get a more comprehensive picture of human  relationships in the North Korean nuclear development program.    North Korea's training system for nuclear-related talents  also deserves careful attention. The training began at a  university level. The first nuclear physics course was  established in 1949 before the Korean War. "That year, North  Korea's first nuclear physics course was created within the KISU  physics school and 30 students were selected for it," said Mr  "B."    It was also in 1949 when Pyongyang began sending students to  Moscow U. and St. Petersburg University. Needless to say, they  were not all nuclear physics students. Suppose 30 students left  for Moscow or St. Petersburg in any given year, three to four of  them were nuclear physics students. Choe Hak-kun, former  minister of atomic energy industry, is said to have been one of  the first-group students who went to Moscow.    The KISU nuclear physics course was closed temporarily  during  the war but reopened later. After that, in about 1957, a nuclear  engineering department, made up by three courses, was created in  Kim Chaek Institute of Technology [KCIT]. The number of students  was 50. Further, in 1963, a nuclear physics course was opened in  Pyongsong Institute of Science in South Pyongan Province, a  college under the control of the Academy of Sciences, accepting  50 students. Pyongsong is a North Korean science town similar to  Taedok Science Town in the South, and its Institute of Science  is an equivalent of our Institute of Science and Technology.    There are slight differences between the roles performed by  these three institutes. While they are all for the study of  nuclear physics, KISU is dedicated to both theoretical and  technological researches, KCIT trains technical personnel and  Pyongsong trains scientists, research officers and professors  primarily in fundamental theoretical fields. Besides, a nuclear  engineering department was created in the National Defense  College in Hyesan in about 1963, primarily for the training of  specialists in munitions and weaponry.    Basically through these four institutes, North Korea has  systematically trained its personnel since the 1950's. The  length of their nuclear physics courses is 7 years, they say,  and they accept only bright students.    On this point, Mr. "B" said: "They take only students of  I.Q.  160 or higher. Children of state cadres who are bright enough  are required to take the nuclear physics course mandatorily even  if it is against their wish. Once, there were moves among  students to avoid taking the course as those who willingly had  entered the course first saw graduates assigned to Yongbyon or  military-related research institutes. Circulating rumors had it  that once they entered the course, their coming and going would  be restricted and, more seriously, they could be exposed to  radioactivity. Once there was a case in which one of the cadres  prevented his child from applying for the course, and when the  fact was discovered by authorities, he was reassigned to a  remote forestry station. Since that time, if a student would  avoid applying for the nuclear physics course, he or she would  be sent to the countryside or otherwise called to task for it."    Attached to these institutes are, respectively, "the KISU  Nuclear Physics Research Institute," "the KCIT Nuclear Physics  Research Institute," and "the Nuclear Physics Research Institute  of the Academy of Sciences." The KISU Nuclear Physics Research  Institute has a long history of research in radioactive isotope.    Other major research institutes are mostly lactated in the  Yongbyon complex. They include the "Atomic Energy Research  Institute," "Radioactivity Prevention Research Institute," and  "Nuclear Power Generating Research Institute." The Yongbyon  nuclear complex was created in the late 1950's. North Korea  began its expansion in earnest in 1962 after the fifth plenum of  the fourth party Central Committee.    Beginning in the 1960's, North Korean institutes turned out  nuclear scientists in large numbers who were trained by  themselves through those 7-year courses. Some of the graduates  left for Moscow for further studies, mostly at the Dubna NRC.  Scores of them were sent there each year in rotation; their stay  in Dubna ranging from 2-3 years to over 10 years. There they,  along with scientists from other socialist nations, jointly  participated in the Soviet nuclear development program.    The cases of those who had stayed there for more than 10  years were because their research achievements were so  outstanding that the Dubna NRC would not let them go home.  Occasionally, there were minor disputes over persons whose  homecoming ran into difficulties for such reasons. Among them  were many who had obtained Soviet doctorates at the age of 30  and became an object of envy. So, Soviet scientists, knowing  about their abilities more than anyone else, would never  underestimate the levels of North Korean students, it is said.  At times, students were deported back home from Dubna because of  their persistent attempt to spy on advanced Soviet nuclear  technology.    North Korean students were also sent to the Kurchatov NRC,  the Kiev NRC and the Ioffe NRC. While Dubna was for basic  research in nuclear physics, Kurchatov was known as a laboratory  for experimenting and building nuclear bombs. They were all  secret facilities off limits to unauthorized citizens as well as  foreigners.    Dr. Yi Pyong-hwi happened to be allowed to visit the  Kurchatov Nuclear Physics Research Center, a secret facility,  for 1 week in 1992. Named after Dr. Kurchatov, who led the team  that built and tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949, the  center stands about 20 kilometers from downtown Moscow.    Dr. Yi was amazed at research facilities at the center.  Nuclear fusion, remote control and radioactivity lab facilities  appeared to be incomparably more sophisticated and advanced than  those at the Argonne National Laboratory where the Manhattan  Project was conducted. The world's most advanced installation,  however, had come to a complete standstill because of Russia's  economic collapse.    Consequently, the United States is reportedly working on  economic aid for improvement in the treatment of Russian nuclear  scientists so as to prevent their exodus from the country. "It  is quite possible," Dr. Yi speculated, "that quite a few of  those Russian nuclear scientists who had been to North Korea in  the past, returned there in 1989 or 1990 during the  disintegration of the Soviet Union and just stayed on there."    North Korea also sent scientists to China, which  successfully  conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964, although fewer in  numbers than those sent to the Soviet Union. For exchanges with  Chinese nuclear physicists, Pyongyang sent its specialists to  Xiangshan Zhao Dai Suo in Beijing where those Chinese frequently  get together. Pyongyang also sent scientists to the Xinjiang  explosion test site to learn explosion technique. Thus trained  through various routes, the number of North Korean nuclear  experts and technical personnel is now estimated at  approximately more than 5,000, including 200 trained at Dubna.    The systematic training like this showed its first results  in  the development of missiles. North Korea produced on its own a  short-range rocket missile using nuclear energy in the late  1960's. To share the excitement, a demonstration firing was  conducted for 2 hours in November 1970 before some 1,000 party  delegates who arrived from all over the country for the Fifth  Party Congress, according to reports.    Pyongyang's nuclear policy came to the fore in March 1974  when Kim Il-song told a National Industrial Workers Meeting that  "we must build nuclear power plants on our own." Thus, North  Korea, with its own technology, embarked on the construction of  No. 2 reactor, a 30 megawatt-class reactor by the graphite  moderator gas coolant method, in Yongbyon in 1980, completing it  in 1987.    In addition to an army of nuclear talents thus trained,  North  Korea has uranium ore deposits scattered all over the country, a  factor that made possible the nuclear development on its own.  The development of the large-scale Pyongsan and Pakchon mines  began in the 1950's, and the Sunchon and Songchon mines are  known for high uranium purity. Other uranium mines include one  at Unggi, North Hamgyong Province, and the Kujang Mine in Mt.  Myohyang. It is also known that there are a number of them in  the vicinity of Hyesan and Hamhung.    Although North Korea had to send ores to the Soviet Union  for  processing before the 1960's, it later built its own smelting  plants near mines for independent processing. Then the  prospecting drive for uranium ores, they say, spread to other  parts of the country so widely that slogans like "Find the  Bluish-Black Mineral" became popular among prospecting workers.    Yongbyon is geographically very close to Pakchon. Thus, it  has a uranium mine a short distance away and, surrounded by  Kuryong River and Mt. Kuryong, has a security advantage, plus  natural water of good quality. It reportedly was the  unquestioned top candidate when authorities were looking for a  site for the nuclear development complex. When the project got  under way, residents were relocated elsewhere.    Yongbyon was gradually turned into a secret town. Guard  posts  were erected around the complex, which was then put off limits  to unauthorized persons. Security measures made were so tight  that they were simply beyond imagination. Except for workers  there and Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and the chief of the  general staff of the KPA, no one is allowed to enter the complex  without authorization, including high-ranking cadres and  politburo members. Even Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il are of  course not completely free to enter the facility. On this point,  Mr. "A" said:    "There is a check point at the Kuryong River bridge leading  to the Yongbyon complex. Even the car carrying Kim Il-song  and/or Kim Chong-il must stop at the point. Officials from the  complex in another car meet them there. The visitor(s) then  would get in their car and go through the point. The facility is  off limits even to the aide-chauffeur for the visitor(s).  Security is that tight."    Personnel are also under strict security control.  Researchers  are usually not authorized to leave the complex. When one is  allowed to leave for a compelling reason, e.g.,the death of a  parent, he will be shadowed by two or three security men of the  Ministry of National Defense, they say. Telephones and mail to  and from the complex are out of question. Even for  communications with the Atomic Energy Committee, the facility  uses a courier. On the other hand, the complex has every  facility needed for the daily life of people there, they say.    When the need arises for building facilities inside the  complex, a special team of the 105th construction unit under the  Ministry of Public Security is assigned to it. The unit itself  is a special one assigned to such works as repair of the houses  of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, the Pyongyang subway or special  tunnels. So, there is absolutely no way for outside people to  know what is going on inside the complex.    "Considering the fact that major North Korean facilities  have  gone underground, facilities that have been put to the  international inspections are only those that had been made  public. It is reasonable to think that there are other  facilities that have not been made public," said Mr. "A." In  addition, it is known that there are many underground plants in  Taechon, only eight km from Yongbyon, he added.    Nuclear physics research institutes attached to universities  in general are also under strict security. They are off limits  to unauthorized people and telephone calls are impossible. When  people come out with personal belongings, they are checked by  defense department personnel each time, they say. These  institutes are under the control of the WPK Science and  Education Department. Also, personnel of this department are  known to enter the institutes once or twice a year when party  meetings are held to sum up their activities. Persons found to  have leaked secret information are separated and sent to remote  places in the mountains.    Mr. "A" said he would like to point out a misconception  which  he comes across so frequently in discussions about the North  Korean nuclear issue. It is that because of the current economic  crisis, Pyongyang would be unable to continue the enormously  expensive nuclear development program. It is indeed a capitalist  perception, he went on, but the fact is that in North Korea,  they can carry out any project only by paying the personnel  expenses, and if that should become difficult, even by just  giving workers enough to eat.    Materials needed for the nuclear development program are  mostly available domestically. The only thing they had to buy  from outside was equipment from the Soviets. Even for them,  North Korea could solve the payment problem by, extremely  speaking, mobilizing military personnel for free labor at gold  mines and refining facilities and handing over nuggets to the  Soviets, Mr. "A" said, adding that although digging a tunnel,  for instance, costs dearly in the South, it can be done  virtually free in North Korea by mobilizing people's labor.

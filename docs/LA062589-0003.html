			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANSON  </P> <P> It is true. A picture is worth a thousand words. The picture on the cover of  Charles Manson brought forth many words for me: insensitivity, cruelty,  manipulation, powerlessness, barbarity, persecution -- the list goes on. What a  way to start Mother's Day.  </P> <P> ELAINE PARKER  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

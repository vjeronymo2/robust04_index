			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams] </F>   [Text] "Sinn Fein welcomes tonight's development. It  represents an important initiative and has created an  opportunity to break the stalemate in the peace process.    ``This stalemate was created and is sustained by the British  Government's repeated refusal to provide clarification to Sinn  Fein about the Downing Street Declaration and the processes  envisaged in it. Such clarification has been provided to all  the other parties. It should now be provided to Sinn Fein as a  matter of urgency. Direct dialogue is the obvious and most  effective method of doing this. I call upon John Major to  authorise direct and immediate talks between our party and his  Government representatives so that the peace process can be  moved forward.    ``Just as importantly, direct dialogue would also indicate a  genuine interest on the part of the British Government in  developing a real peace process through the esential recognition  of Sinn Fein's rights as a political party, the validity of our  mandate and the democratic integrity of our electorate.    ``Sinn Fein has no great concern to be engaged in bi-lateral  discussions on constitutional matters with the London  government. I have publicly outlined my position is this regard  on a number of occasions. This is, properly, the business of  future talks involving the two governments and representatives  of all the Irish people, including Sinn Fein.    ``This, however, is not the point of our reasonable calls  for  clarification. Clarification clearly is not negotiation.  Clarification is required so that Sinn Fein, and everyone else,  can properly and fully explore how the peace process can be  moved forward at this time and, specifically, how the Downing  Street Declaration fits into this.    ``I understand that Mr Major faces many difficulties.  Tonight's announcement clearly eases some of these. It should  be built upon. The search for peace requires imagination and  determination.''</p>

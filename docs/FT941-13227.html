			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatile Frankfurt changes tack again Wall Street's weakness touched on bourses late in the day, but European equities were losing their glitter before US markets opened, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reversed Monday's pattern, the Dax index building on previous post-bourse gains to close the session 46.77 higher at 2,126.78, then losing most of it in the afternoon where it ended at 2,090.78, leaving dealers casting about for the reasons why. There was talk of falling bund and Dax futures driving the cash market lower, of disappointment with the Deutsche Bank dividend (DM16.50, against an expected DM17, but still up DM1.50 on the year), and some mention of the breakdown in pay talks for engineering workers in North Baden-Wurttemberg. However, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, equities had been destabilised by a rise of over 90 points in the Dax in just over 24 hours, following a drop of 232, or 10 per cent from their 1993/94 high just three weeks earlier. 'The market took six months to drop 13 per cent in 1984,' said Mr Benischek. 'It has been moving too fast - both ways'. Turnover eased from DM10.5bn to DM10bn. Deutsche Bank fell to DM791.00 after hours, losing all and more of the DM20.30 gain to DM811.80 it recorded on the official session. However, the metals, chemical and pharmaceutical group, Degussa, closed DM6.50 higher at DM462 then continued climbing late in the day to finish at DM468 although its drugs subsidiary, Asta Medica, said that it would await further developments in the pharmaceutical industry before it applied for a public listing. PARIS retreated from mid-morning gains but overall activity remained muted with many investors waiting for results from Bouygues (down FFr2 at FFr731) due after the session had ended. The CAC-40 index closed up 3.85 at 2,278.34, after a session high of 2,298.29. Other stocks in the construction/building materials sector remained firm, with St Gobain, which pleased the market with its results last week, putting on FFr6 to FFr692, and Lafarge Coppee, due to report today, gaining FFr7.20 to FFr468.70. UAP was marked down FFr20 to FFr630 after the sale of a 5 per cent stake at FFr617 a share, indicating, some analysts commented, the price that the insurer might set in its forthcoming privatisation. In contrast LVMH, which was hit hard last week on news of a change in its cross shareholding arrangement with Guinness, recovered FFr80 to FFr3,920 as some buyers returned. MADRID balanced the Bank of Spain's quarter-point interest rate cut against later weakness on Wall Street, and came out with the general index 3.93, or 1.2 per cent higher 342.94 in turnover of Pta51bn. Bank stocks reacted to the interest rate move, Bankinter rising by Pta800, or 6.7 per cent to Pta12,750 and BBV by Pta90, or nearly 3 per cent to Pta3,100. MILAN gained ground on signs that the country's centre parties may be moving towards co-operation. The Comit index ended the day up 7.31 or 1.2 per cent at 625.21, with screen trading closing at a record L887bn. AMSTERDAM was moderately lower with declines in heavyweight stocks weighing on sentiment. The AEX index lost 3.46 to 426.29, after an earlier high of 431.20. STOCKHOLM dropped 1.6 per cent after Goldman Sazchs downgraded Ericsson in New York, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 24.70 lower at 1,525.80. Ericsson B dropped SKr23, or 6.1 per cent to SKr353. WARSAW broke through the 16,000 level with sentiment boosted by the listing of Bank Slaski, the market's biggest ever issue. The WIG index advanced 962.5 or 6.1 per cent to 16,808.8 in high turnover of 2,900bn zlotys. Bank Slaski closed at 6.75m zlotys or 13.5 times the issue price. ISTANBUL lost a further 6.3 per cent, bringing its losses for the last three days to 16 per cent. The composite index shed 1,533.53 to 22,727.21 as investors remained nervous because of the weakness of the currency against the US dollar in the money markets. The market's recent correction compares with a 400 per cent gain in 1993 and Carnegie International, in London, said that any sign of stability returning to the money markets could well trigger a wave of fresh buying. ATHENS lost 3 per cent as profit-taking continued. The general index shed 33.34 to 1,143.49 in volume of 3.8m shares.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA) -- The newspaper AL-THAWRAH  maintains that the U.S. Administration is using democracy and  human rights as political cards to damage the interests of world  peoples and undermine their abilities to freely make political  decisions and pursue independent options.    In an article published today under the headline "Clinton,  Ignorance, and Zionist Motives", the paper, which speaks for the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds: When they advance arguments  grounded in the U.S. concept of human rights and U.S. national  security, U.S. officials forget that other world peoples have  their own national security to worry about, and that they also  have human rights that must be respected.    The paper wonders: Since democracy is rooted in dialogue,  how can anybody who professes to be a democrat and a staunch  advocate of democracy reject dialogue and wave the big stick in  the face of anyone who chooses to hold a dissenting view?    The paper notes the periodic report U.S. President Bill  Clinton submitted to Congress. In this report, the paper says,  Clinton spoke, thanks to the bad advice offered him by his  Zionist advisers, of what he called Iraq's sponsorship of  terrorism, and of human rights violations in Iraq. Clinton said  Iraqi policy continues to pose threats to U.S. national security  and to U.S. foreign policy -- something that prompts the United  States to support the continued enforcement of the economic  sanctions against it.    The paper adds: The U.S. President has deliberately chosen  to overlook the fact that there is a UN Security Council [UNSC]  resolution passed at Washington's urging, i.e., Resolution 687,  that must be taken into account in this regard. The U.S.  President has chosen to forget that Iraq has honored all its  commitments toward this resolution, and that, consequently, the  UNSC must immediately honor the provisions enshrined in  Paragraph 22 of this resolution by lifting the sanctions clamped  on Iraq. According to the rules in force, Iraq is entitled to  see the embargo lifted. The UNSC must act to lift the sanctions.    The paper goes on to say: Clinton has set fresh terms for  lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq prior to the UNSC's  periodic review of the sanctions. His statements will not fall  on receptive ears at the UNSC, particularly since the positions  of the UNSC permanent members on the embargo have experienced a  clear change due to Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments toward  Resolution 687.    The paper accuses the U.S. president of taking positions  that  reflect a flagrant ignorance of the geopolitical facts of the  Arab region, of the cohesive political regime in Iraq, and of  the Iraqi people's rallying around its nationalist leadership.    The paper adds: Clinton must understand that his implication  of Iraq in terrorism is meaningless. It is clear to those near  and far that Iraq has nothing to do with terrorism. Clinton is  aware of who the real terrorists are. Iraq has never been  involved in the terrorism game, the parties to which have become  known to all.    The paper notes the hostage games and the bargaining  conducted between the United States, some Western countries, and  some Middle Eastern parties and political regimes. The paper  says this is flagrant proof of the involvement of the United  States and these parties in terrorism. This shows Iraq has  nothing to do with terrorism.    AL-THAWRAH says the "human rights" argument raised by the  U.S. Administration whenever the UNSC's periodic review of the  Iraq sanctions approaches has become ridiculous.    The paper urges the United States to adopt a balanced policy  toward Iraq and the Arab homeland, because it is not in its  interest to see Iraq weakened, as Clinton's advisers must have  deluded him into believing. Iraq is a crucially important  factor for development, progress, stability, and equilibrium in  the region. It is a factor conducive to world security and  peace. As for the embargo, it is about to be defeated, whether  Clinton likes it or not.</p>

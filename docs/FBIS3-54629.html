			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nonsense Non-Papers"] </F>   [Text] Trivialising the issue is what the Indian government  seems to be interested in right now. When the secretary level  talks on Kashmir started in Islamabad at the start of the new  year, no one expected a breakthrough but it was generally hopes  that the meeting will at least lead to a marked decrease in  human rights violations and repression of the Indian armed  forces against the Kashmir people living under Indian  occupation. Instead, the Indian army has intensified atrocities  and the ferocity and the frequency of "sieze, search and  destroy" operations in the predominantly Muslim areas has  increased manifold. When a delegation of the Amnesty  International was in New Delhi last week, it was denied  permission to visit these areas which continue to be under  perpetual siege by the Indian army who do not allow even  essential supplies into these areas as a collective punishment  for the entire population. The method adopted by the Indian  army in occupied Kashmir is more brutal and inhuman then even in  Bosnia where at least there are some safe heavens. [as  published] In occupied Kashmir there are no safe heavens even  for women, children and the aged. The Indian army has divided  the whole [word indistinct] of population in the valley into  fully guarded prisoner camps and totally isolated them from the  outside world. This is what the Indian leaders call "the Punjab  way" of solving the Kashmir problem. This only confirms  Pakistan's suspicion that India's readiness to discuss Kashmir  was nothing but a diversionary move to gain time and befool the  world public opinion. If any fresh proof was needed to confirm  these suspicions, the Indian foreign secretary provided it when  he handed out six non-papers to Pakistan High Commissioner in  New Delhi the other day. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar was trying  to be polite when he described these non-papers as  "disappointing."    From what has become known about these non-papers, it is  clear that India has made a deliberate effort to miss the point  by dodging and ducking the real issue. First, India dragged its  feet as usual and delayed delivering on the promise of providing  informal position papers within a fortnight. After Pakistan  expressed its indignation over the delay, the Indians handed  over the "non-papers" which mostly focus on non-issues or simply  repeat India's previous position on technical matters involved.  In some matters like Siachen, Sir Creek, Wuller Barrage, etc,  the Indian non-papers do not pick up the thread from where it  was left in the latest talks early this month. Instead, the  position stated goes back to what was known even before the last  secretary level talks. The non-papers do not reflect whatever  little progress was possible in the last round. That can only  mean that the Indians either do not want the next round of talks  to start sooner or want to introduce as many non-issues as  possible and stretch the talks to provide, their armed forces  with enough time to choke and strangulate the whole population  which continues under their brutal siege.    On its part, Pakistan provided India with two non-papers it  had promised and suggested specific steps to improve the  situation in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan had also made it clear  that the next round of talks should focus on discussing the  modalities for holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. The Indians, in  their non-papers not only have avoided the substantive issue of  Kashmir but have also made a mockery of the whole exercise by  raising a wholly non-existent issue, i.e. "no first strike"  using nuclear weapons. While India may have nuclear warheads,  as many believe it has, Pakistan has no such weapons and hence  no question of first strike capability of Pakistan can be  relevent. This only shows the utter nonseriousness of the  Indian leaders in solving a problem which continues to be a  flashpoint in this sensitive region. As for our US friends, who  have been trying to facilitate a dialogue with India on Kashmir,  we would only say that the most important ingredient of a  peaceful solution continues to be missing and that is political  commitment of the Indian government to resolve the dispute.  Should we continue to hope that the Americans will ultimately  notice this glaring absence and try to convince their Indian  friends that it is time to abandon pretensions and attend to  solving the core issue in earnest.</p>

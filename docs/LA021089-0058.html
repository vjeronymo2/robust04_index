			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> The old saw that a painting is a window is still a surprisingly stimulating  observation in the paintings of Ernest Silva and Robert Gil De Montes. Silva's  interior rooms, decorated with brushy leaf-and water-patterned floors or walls  are cut open by rough "picture window" paintings. The framed images form a  neat, round robin kind of internal reference as the artist's studio becomes an  exploration of the artist as mythical figure, "rogue" outsider and expressive  volcano pumping up a fluid unconscious from the depths of the painting and the  artist's own fertile mind.  </P> <P> Silva's paint handling is quick and powerfully direct. When he slaps it over  furniture sitting in front of a similarly painted "Lighthouse" canvas, there is  a weird blurring of boundaries between the real and the allusive. That visual  and conceptual fuzzing doesn't have the same intellectual complexity as the  paintings, but the simple symbolism of a hollowed out orange life raft caught  in swirls of blue bent willow has its own poetry.  </P> <P> Robert Gil de Montes' paintings are not so much windows as surrealist theaters  with painted curtains framing symbol-rich landscapes. It is tempting to view  the paintings strictly from their ethnic roots, because the artist is  represented in the County Museum of Art's current "Hispanic Art in the United  States" exhibition. But to do so would be to miss the strength of the  Gauguin-esque color and the lusty plant life in "Black Lake." And it would  ignore the artist's enticing ability to use such bold color to subtly solidify  space so that the various folk art monkeys, masks and transparent leaves fuse  with their surroundings.

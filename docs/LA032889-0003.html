			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LONG LINE  </P> <P> The militant Operation Rescue leaders brought their campaign of intimidation to  Los Angeles last week, and local supporters of women's rights proved they would  not bow to the pressure. Clearly, the demonstrators had some impact by  publicizing their cause and keeping some women away from the clinics. Just as  clearly, those who support keeping abortion legal had an impact by showing that  they would not be bullied. None of this, however, raises the level of debate.  </P> <P> The clinics that were picketed last week will not close merely because people  are willing to violate the law to blockade their entrances. They may close or  be severely restricted, however, if the U.S. Supreme Court reinterprets its own  decision on how closely states may regulate abortion. That is the real threat,  and both sides are trying to ensure that their point of view cannot escape the  justices' notice as they deliberate a Missouri case in coming months. The  automobile convoys, the placards, the walkie-talkies employed here last week  may be only a preview if the court throws abortion regulation open to the 50  state legislatures.  </P> <P> Abortion is the latest in the long chain of volatile issues that has emerged as  women seek to change their place in American life. Past conflicts have emerged  when women, left out of the Constitution by the Founding Fathers, sought not to  be considered the property of their husbands, to own real property themselves,  to attend college, to vote, to enter professions and blue-collar fields in  which they had not traditionally worked, to obtain birth control information  and to receive equal pay.  </P> <P> Indeed, abortion was not always this hot an issue. Reading history shows that  abortion has been legal for much of the nation's 200 years. Historians around  the country have been drafting a brief for the upcoming Supreme Court case in  which they point out that abortion was a known and legal practice when the  Constitution was written. It remained a common and highly visible practice well  into the 19th Century. Those laws that did seek to regulate it did so to  protect pregnant women from the dangerous abortion techniques of the time.  </P> <P> Doctors were the leading force seeking regulation in the middle of the 19th  Century. They wanted to control medical practice by keeping out midwives and  abortionists. Other groups, reacting to the growing women's rights movement in  the late 19th Century, sought to restrict abortion to keep women at home  bearing children, the historians say; still others feared too many Protestants  were using abortion and therefore white Anglo-Saxon families would be  outnumbered by immigrants with large families. Only in recent decades has  concern with killingfetuses become the focal point of abortion arguments.  </P> <P> That is obviously the concern voiced by Operation Rescue. Its followers must be  allowed to demonstrate, even to place their ugly signs in the hands of  children, as long as they are willing to pay the law's price for their  violations. In this regard, local police generally acted with restraint last  week in the face of hundreds of demonstrators who wanted to be arrested but  refused to cooperate during the procedure. Charging leader Randall Terry with  conspiracy to commit a crime was, however, an excessive restriction on free  speech.  </P> <P> The long line that traces the progress of women's rights since the earliest  days of the Republic is a line that inches ever upward despite the tactics of  desperate opponents. It does so because of those women and men who repeatedly  stand up for what they believe, as pro-choice advocates did this past week. As  the poet Adrienne Rich has written, women knew early on that their efforts for  equality would not be a simple walk across an open field.  </P></p>

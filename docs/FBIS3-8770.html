			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, March 13 (TANJUG) -- Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky and Deputy Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Radoslav Bulajic on Sunday urged the promotion of bilateral  relations so that they could reach their previous levels after  the lifting of the international sanctions against Yugoslavia.    Jeszenszky is unofficially in Serbia's northern Vojvodina  province since Saturday to attend ceremonies marking the 100th  anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth, organized by the  Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the  national party of the Hungarian minority. "Relations between  Hungary and Yugoslavia should not remain at their current  level," Jeszenszky told journalists after the talks in Novi Sad.  "I hope very much that the inernational community's efforts will  result in a peace in the former Yugoslavia and that all people  who live here will overcome a difficult period," the Hungarian  diplomat said.    Bulajic also expressed hope that the two countries'  bilateral  relations would soon attain a higher level and, with this in  mind, he officially invited the Hungarian president and prime  minister to visit Yugoslavia soon.    Jeszenszky also attended a commemoration of the 100th  anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth held in the Vojvodina  village of Novi Itebej, close to the Hungarian Border. The  Hungarian foreign minister told the manifestation that it is  always better to compromise in conflicting situations than to  try to reach solutions by force, and expressed regret that evil  and destruction imposed by others are still present in the  territory of the former Yugoslavia. Recalling the historic role  of Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian revolution of  1848, Jeszenszky said that this was the period when the  Hungarians, Serbs, Croats and other nationalities became aware  that they have to live together in the Carpathian basin. The  only way for their coexistence is tolerance and readiness to  make concessions, because in a possible armed conflict all sides  would be losers, Jeszenszky said.    The Hungarian press anounced that after Vojvodina,  Jeszenszky  would leave for Zagreb and Sarajevo.</p>

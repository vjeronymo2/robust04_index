			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: BSN moves against hostile stake-building BSN, the French group which is one of the most powerful players in the European food industry, plans to take a defensive step against hostile stake-building by banning any investor from exercising voting rights over more than 6 per cent of its equity. The proposal, suggested by Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's veteran chairman, and endorsed by a board meeting yesterday, will be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting in late September. BSN has come under the spotlight because of its role in the controversial battle for Perrier mineral water. During the bid BSN broke ranks with its old allies, the Agnelli family of Italy which owns 5.8 per cent of the French food group, to side with Nestle, its chief competitor, in return for an agreement to buy Volvic, one of the Perrier mineral waters. The Volvic deal went through earlier this week after the European Commission, initially critical of the tactical liaison between the two rivals, gave the green light to Nestle's FFr15.46bn (Dollars 3.03bn) bid. However, the Perrier drama raised questions about the long-term relationship between BSN and the Agnellis. BSN's proposals involve limiting the voting rights of any shareholder to a maximum of 6 per cent - the amount held by Lazard, BSN's biggest investor - or 12 per cent if they have double voting rights. This restriction would be waived if any investor acquired more than 90 per cent, thereby facilitating a full bid. BSN said the voting restriction was necessary because its equity was so widely dispersed that it was anxious to avoid the threat of an investor exercising disproportionate influence over the company by buying a minority stake.</p>

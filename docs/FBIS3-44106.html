			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Corruption is running rampant within the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT]  government's ruling clique and it continues to be widely  reported by various Angolan circles.    COMERCIO E ACTUALIDADE magazine, which is published in  Luanda, yesterday described as corrupt three ministers in the  government headed by Marcolino Moco. Those ministers are:  Agriculture Minister Isaac dos Anjos, Territorial  Administration Minister Paulo Kassoma, and Norberto dos Santos,  minister for assistance and social reintegration. COMERCIO E  ACTUALIDADE magazine also reports that those three government  officials have formed a building society that participated in  the construction of four factories on the outskirts of Luanda  costing the Angolan Treasury some $10 million.    That magazine also accused Agriculture Minister Isaac dos  Anjos of having received a large commission from the recent  importation of farming tractors.    In addition to these developments, Roberto de Almeida, an  MPLA-PT deputy to the National Assembly, has asked the  government to open an inquiry into the recent importation of 300  Mercedes Benz vehicles intended for Luanda government officials.  Roberto de Almeida described that measure as irresponsible and  counterproductive in view of the country's current situation,  marked by a deeply impoverished economy, serious food shortages,  and a very high inflation rate.</p>

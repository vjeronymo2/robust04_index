			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: . . . but get me to the church on time - You can insure against most wedding day disasters, including the vagaries of the British weather THE WEDDING and summer fete season is in full swing during June but, as usual, the British weather is taking its toll on open-air events. Rain is one hazard that the organiser of any outdoor event has to consider - would a downpour force you to cancel the event or affect your takings? If you think anything more than a drizzle would ruin your day, rather than crossing your fingers and hoping for sunshine, there is the option of Pluvius insurance, which allows you to insure against a specified level of rainfall. This type of policy can compensate for cancellation, ticket refunds or lost revenue. It is also known as measured rainfall cover. Naturally, the cost of cover depends on where in the UK the event is being held - the rainiest places, such as the Lake District, incur higher premiums - as well as the sum insured. The organisers of last year's Blairgowrie Highland Games paid Pounds 415 for cover with Eagle Star. After more than a fifth of an inch of rain fell in a three-hour period, Eagle Star paid out Pounds 10,000. If you are running a fishing competition or a kite festival, a wet or windy day may be essential - so you can also insure against fine weather. However, you cannot merely listen to the weather forecast the day before and rush to your insurers if the outlook is bad: insurance must be taken out at least ten to 14 days in advance. The oldest provider of Pluvius insurance is Eagle Star, which is still the market leader after 70 years, and bases its premiums (minimum Pounds 100) on weather records going back over a century. Other companies, such as Cornhill, now offer similar policies. Of course, disastrous weather is just one of many factors which could affect the success of an event. Other circumstances could force you to cancel - the star booked to open the fete might not show up, your cash box could be stolen, or someone could be injured tripping over a marquee rope. General policies covering charity fairs, boot sales, agricultural shows, gymkhanas etc can provide cover for a variety of risks, with premiums depending on the size of the event. Independent Insurance, Insurex Expo-Sure, Cornhill and Lombard Continental are among companies offering cover but a broker may be able to advise on what is available. Weddings are seen as a special case by many insurers. If one reads the list of contingencies covered by specialist wedding policies, it can seem like a miracle if a wedding ever passes smoothly. Snags can include: photographers failing to turn up or forgetting to put film in their cameras; coffee spills on the bride's dress; theft of gifts; wedding car breakdown; the reception venue closed by a bomb scare; and a business going bust soon after the reception booking is made. Illness, death or unemployment affecting the couple or their close relatives can mean the whole wedding has to be called off. Specialist policies will normally cover all the situations described as well as loss or damage to hired suits, flowers, rings and other wedding paraphernalia. Cancellation because one half of the couple gets last-minute cold feet is not covered. Cornhill's Weddingsurance policy (tel: 0734-575491) costs Pounds 45. Extensions are available if you want higher cover for a particularly expensive wedding dress, or need to insure a hired marquee, for instance. Grand UK insurance (0603-767699) offers a standard wedding insurance package at Pounds 42.50, with optional honeymoon travel insurance available. Insurex Expo-Sure (0892-511500) charges Pounds 150 to insure a wedding costing Pounds 6,000, with up to Pounds 10,000 cover for damage to the church, reception venue, and the same again for damage to clothing, gifts and so on. Leisurecare (0793-514199) has branched out into wedding cover via honeymoon travel insurance. The price of its package is determined by the amount of cancellation cover needed: up to Pounds 3,000 costs Pounds 40, up to Pounds 5,000 costs Pounds 60, and quotes can be made for higher figures. The package also covers re-arrangement expenses, clothing, rings, presents, photographs, liability etc. The basic package from Methodist Insurance (061-833-9696) costs Pounds 30 and covers cancellation, wedding attire, photographs, presents and public liability. Higher levels of cover are available. Provincial (0539-723415) is planning to revamp its Cupid wedding policy in September, but offers two options: standard, costing Pounds 30, and deluxe, with double the cover of standard, costing Pounds 45.</p>

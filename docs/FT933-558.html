			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (10): Pitfalls of outsourcing / Industry INFORMATION SYSTEMS OUTSOURCING:MYTHS, METAPHORS AND REALITIES by Mary C Lacity and Rudy Hirschheim John Wiley Pounds 24.95, 272 pages FEW DECISIONS in corporate computing can be as politically charged or as spattered with hyperbole as a resolution to move to facilities management, or 'outsourcing'. This volume in Wiley's information systems series illuminates the part office politics and the hidden agenda plays in what should be a seemingly straightforward strategic decision. Outsourcing is the use of an outside agency to fulfil a company's data processing requirements to an agreed service level for an agreed fee. In some cases, the agency takes its customers' computers and data processing staff on to its own books; in others, the company retains ownership of staff and machines. The UK government's 'market testing' plans - where a department's ability to deliver IT and other services efficiently are to be measured against the market alternative - are outsourcing on a grand scale. Whatever the flavour of outsourcing, the advantages to the customer are perceived to be a cap on information technology costs and freedom from the chore of running a department which may have nothing to do with the company's core business.

The dangers are that the company loses control of its crown jewels - its data - and its source of competitive advantage - its information technology strategy. At a personal level, the company's information systems(IS) manager stands to lose his or her job in the changeover. Anyone wrestling with whether to outsource his or her organisation's data processing operations would do well to digest Mary Lacity and Rudy Hirschheim's carefully researched study. The two academics analysed 13 companies where outsourcing had been examined as an option. Their conclusions cast doubt on many popularly held views of outsourcing and should help to cut through the hyperbole. They suggest, for example, that publicly available information about outsourcing presents an overly optimistic view: 'Outsourcing is not a panacea for information systems problems,' they say. 'Several participants suffered severe service degradation and paid significant excess charges that negated expected savings.'</p>

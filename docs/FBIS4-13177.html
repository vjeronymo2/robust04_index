			<p>BFN     [Text] Various Muslim organizations held a demonstration in  the capital today to draw the world community's attention toward  human rights violations in Pakistan. They also protested  against the victimization of Urdu speaking muhajirs [Indian  immigrants] by the Army in the Sind Province. Later, a  delegation led by the Falah-i-Millat [Islamic Community Welfare]  Action Committee's general secretary, Dr. Mohammad Furkan,  submitted a memorandum to the Pakistani high commissioner urging  upon Islamabad to stop atrocities against muhajirs and release  the thousands of workers of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement  languishing in jails for several years.</p>

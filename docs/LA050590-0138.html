			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT / REGGAE: SETTLEMENT OF $30-MILLION BOB MARLEY ESTATE IS ANTICIPATED  </P> <P> Nine years after the death of reggae patriarch Bob Marley, it appears that a  major settlement of the legal disputes surrounding his $30-million estate is in  the works.  </P> <P> This could mean the release of a major body of his work: more than 100 singles  that have never been collected on albums, as well as a significant amount of  unreleased recordings.  </P> <P> Among the unreleased tracks are some songs that have long been legend in reggae  circles, including "High Tide Low Tide," a hymn to his mother, and "I Know a  Place Where We Can Carry On," which Marley wrote in 1978 after discovering he  had cancer. The first releases may come before the end of the year.  </P> <P> Chris Blackwell, president of Island Records and the man who helped establish  Marley as an international star in the '70s, confirmed the broad outline of the  proposed arrangements last week from his New York headquarters.  </P> <P> "We're in the final stages of negotiations right now. We've lined up virtually  all of Bob's baby-mothers, along with his wife, Rita, and Mrs. Booker, Bob's  mother," Blackwell said. (Baby-mother is the Caribbean term for the unwed  mother of a man's children.)  </P> <P> Central to the settling of accounts is the disposition of Tuff Gong, the  company founded by Marley and his bandmates in the Wailers, Peter Tosh and  Bunny Wailer, in 1970. When Marley succumbed to cancer on May 11, 1981, at 36,  his widow Rita Marley assumed control of the company. But in 1986, the Jamaican  government, which had taken over the estate, forced her to resign her post with  the company and as executrix of the estate after revelations in court that she  had been coerced into signing a false will.  </P> <P> At that time, the government appointed banker Louis Byles to take charge of the  Marley holdings. The tiny flow of unreleased works, which had been initiated by  Rita Marley, ground to a halt. Her country home was auctioned in the pages of  the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper to pay back taxes, and she was indicted for tax  fraud.  </P> <P> Blackwell has already moved into Tuff Gong. "One of the initial things we've  done is to close down the company to begin its complete reorganization. I plan  to put in my own management team as soon as possible," he said.  </P> <P> In January, 1989, the Jamaican government sold the entire Marley estate to  Blackwell for $8.4 million. The sale was immediately challenged by Marley's  mother and several others, with the final appeal scheduled last January in  England's Privy Council.  </P> <P> At the last minute, Blackwell was able to postpone the hearing while he  attempted to reach a settlement with the many interested parties. These include  Rita Marley, Bob Marley's mother Cedella Booker, his 11 children by seven  women, various former co-workers and band members, and music publishers.  </P> <P> In February, the broad outlines of the plan began to emerge. Blackwell would  assume control of all of Marley's recordings; his properties in various  countries; his likeness, and more.  </P> <P> Once his assumption of the estate is approved by the Privy Council, Blackwell  says he will turn it all over to a nonprofit Bob Marley Foundation.  </P> <P> One person exhilarated by the apparent settling of most of the controversies is  Marley's mother, Cedella Booker, who has gained title to her spacious Miami  house as part of the resolution. Mrs. Booker also owns a great deal of the land  in Nine Mile, the rural village in northern Jamaica where Bob was born and is  buried. Blackwell has plans for the property.  </P> <P> "We are currently looking into the feasibility of moving the Bob Marley museum  there," he said. "And of course we will need other buildings nearby to  accommodate the visitors in a properly organized way."  </P> <P> Other ideas include a recording studio in Trenchtown, the Kingston slum that is  the setting for many of Marley's songs. The facility would be geared to helping  Jamaican youths learn music.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Rita and her lawyer and accountant are still scheduled to go to  trial in Jamaica on a $16-million fraud charge.  </P> <P> "I welcome this opportunity," Rita Marley said earlier this year in Los  Angeles. "It will force the government to show everyone just how they have been  mishandling the estate since they took it away from me five years ago."  </P></p>

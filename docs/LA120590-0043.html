			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN WIFE'S  MURDER  </P> <P> A municipal court judge in Victorville on Tuesday ordered a La Canada  Flintridge man to stand trial in the murder of his wife, whose charred body was  found Sept. 13 in a remote desert area west of Victorville.  </P> <P> Judge John B. Gibson ordered Donald Miralle, 46, bound over for trial after a  two-day preliminary hearing in which prosecutors presented evidence that tread  marks and footprints found near the body matched tires and tennis shoes owned  by Miralle.  </P> <P> Tessie Miralle, 49, disappeared after she went to her husband's office in  Pasadena on Sept. 12. Her body was discovered while it was still burning early  the next morning. Defense attorneys challenged the identity of the body and  said all of the evidence linking Don Miralle to the crime is circumstantial.  </P></p>

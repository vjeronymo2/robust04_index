			<p>in   Europe   <F P=102> LD2406132894 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 1229 GMT 24  Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> LD2406132894 </F> <F P=104>  London PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PA News, in Corfu] </F>   [Text] [British Prime Minister] John Major today launched a  five-point plan to tackle crime and fraud across Europe to show  citizens that the EU can influence their daily lives.    The Prime Minister told the European Summit in Corfu it was  time to bring European policies closer to the people in the wake  of a Euro election which demonstrated widespread apathy about  the EU's relevance.    He said the two key issues were unemployment and crime, and  he urged his fellow European leaders to back a new initiative to  beat crime and fraud.    Mr Major said that since the start of the year enough  cocaine  had been seized in the EU countries for 24 million individual  doses--with a street value of 840 million pounds sterling.    "We must protect our young people from this trade and we  need  a clear action plan," he said.    The Major proposals are:    --A European convention on intelligence gathering and  anti-crime cooperation completed by October    --A concerted attack by the newly-created Europol, based in  The Hague, and national authorities on drug trafficking and  organised crime    --The close involvement of the countries of central and  Eastern Europe in anti-drug measures    --A conference on drugs and organised crime under the  forthcoming German EU presidency    --Agreement to streamline national criminal laws and  punishments for cross-border crime and fraud by the end of this  year.    Intelligence gathering was the key to success, Mr Major  said,  but he stopped short of suggesting that Europol should involve  an active police force in addition to its role as a data and  information exchange system for crime prevention squads in the  member states.    It was now time to give the drugs problem top priority in  Europe, with the accent on education as well as investigation.    Mr Major said fraud cost Europe's taxpayers millions every  year. He cited a recent investigation which uncovered subsidies  of 65 million pounds sterling which were paid out by Brussels in  the form of grants for non-existent supplies of wheat.    He wants the Corfu Summit to include a firm commitment,  particularly on drugs, in its final conclusions tomorrow  afternoon.    The Prime Minister was speaking in the first round of talks  at the summit, following an invitation from Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou to address one of the most pressing problems  confronting the EU.</p>

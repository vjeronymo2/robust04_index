			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ELEPHANT' ON PBS: A GRIM STATUS REPORT  </P> <P> What a thrill to see the birth of an elephant. A membrane-wrapped package falls  to the ground, and almost immediately the wobbly, 175-pound calf struggles to  stand and reach its mother's milk, metaphorically becoming an entire species  fighting for survival.  </P> <P> Therein lies the conflict of "Elephant," the latest PBS special from the  National Geographic Society, a celebration and a eulogy, a chronicle of birth  and of slaughter.  </P> <P> It airs at 8 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50.  </P> <P> Much of "Elephant" is unpleasant, for here, in this wise and eloquent hour  written and produced by Irwin Rosten, is another chapter in the eternal  conflict among earth's inhabitants. This one illogically pits humankind against  the elephant, with the inevitable result looming ahead.  </P> <P> Filming in Laos, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Kenya and Zimbabwe, Rosten  dramatically contrasts the Asian and African elephants and the historic roles  of each on their respective continents.  </P> <P> The elephant traditionally has been respected in Asia. But these powerful,  intelligent animals are also utilized as laborers and entertainers there,  undergoing a brutal domestication in being bent to the will of humans whose  economic livelihoods are dependent on them. And on another front, notes  narrator E. G. Marshall, the Asian elephants are imperiled by "a tidal wave of  people and their machines."  </P> <P> The larger African elephant roamed the wilderness freely and was never  domesticated, we're told. But now that wilderness, too, is shrinking, even as  the demand for the elephant's ivory is growing. We're given the ultimate  paradox, beauty produced by carnage: pictures of exquisite ivory sculptures  followed by pictures of elephants slain by poachers for their tusks, their  decaying carcasses being picked at by vultures.  </P> <P> Weighed against this is that rare and wonderful birth sequence at a zoo in  Portland, and also the monitoring of animal savers -- scientists and others  studying and working to preserve the elephant. "It's probably only a holding  action," one of them admits.  </P> <P> The hour concentrates so heavily on this tenuous coexistence with humans that  elephants in the wild -- free, unencumbered and doing what comes naturally  without human involvement -- are largely absent from the program.  </P> <P> Yet this shortcoming itself becomes a grim status report of the elephant, who  fills the screen tonight with his greatness and sadness.  </P></p>

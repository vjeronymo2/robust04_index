			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: PUBLIC MAY SEEK DAMAGES FOR ILLEGAL USE OF CREDIT CARD DATA  </P> <P> A bill to allow consumers to seek up to $2,500 in civil damages for the illegal  use of their credit report information has been signed into law by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "Many Californians do not want the private information contained in their  credit report files to be sold to third parties for compiling direct mail or  telephone lists," said Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa), the author of AB  2908.  </P> <P> Peace said TRW, Equifax and Transunion, the three main consumer credit  reporting agencies, have agreed to stop providing such information to  unauthorized parties upon the request of consumers beginning Jan. 1, when the  law goes into effect.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Bills Signed  </P> <P> Garage Door Openers: AB 3600 by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to  establish safety standards for automatic garage door openers to prevent injury.  </P> <P> Earthquakes: AB 4333 by Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush (R-Saratoga) to  appropriate $22.2 million in earthquake bond funds to repair state facilities  in the San Francisco-Oakland area that were damaged by last year's major  temblor.  </P> <P> Los Angeles River: SB 1920 by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) calling for a  state study of the feasibility of developing the Los Angeles River flood-way as  a park and recreation area.  </P> <P> Organic Foods: AB 2012 by Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) to establish tighter  state regulation of the fast-growing organic food industry.  </P> <P> Telephone Calls: SB 2765 by Sen.

Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) to limit the  rights of homeowners near airports to file noise damage lawsuits. The governor  said he was concerned the bill might encourage construction of homes within  areas where construction is discouraged because of the airport noise level.  </P> <P> Hotel Reservations: SB 2082 by Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los  Angeles) to make hotels and motels subject to lawsuits for civil damages if  they overbook and fail to provide accommodations guaranteed by reservations.  Deukmejian said he was not satisfied there was sufficient abuse to justify the  proposed remedy.  </P> <P> Criminals: AB 3821 by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) to make  computerized photographs of criminals with records with funds from increased  fines to circulate among law enforcement agencies. The governor said he was  concerned the technique could mean a significant increased cost to the state.  </P> <P> Domestic Violence: SB 1856 by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) to increase  marriage license fees to help finance programs to reduce domestic violence.  Deukmejian said he did not believe it was appropriate for only one group of  people to bear increased costs for this purpose.  </P> <P> Airports: SB 2798 by Sen. Bob Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) to exempt Los Angeles  County from a requirement that every county in California have an extensive  airport land-use plan.

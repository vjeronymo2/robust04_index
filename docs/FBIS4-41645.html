In an interview to journalists at a polling station, he  spoke  in favor of cooperation between all branches of power in  Ukraine. "If there is no such consensus, we will be unable to  avoid certain collisions," he said.    Vitaliy Masol said that apart from the election results, he  would soon propose at the parliament the list of government  members. The prime minister declined to comment on a possible  cabinet reshuffle.</p>

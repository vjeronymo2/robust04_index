			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Labouring in the slow lane - Italy: Fiat is still shaking off effects of recent losses For evidence of how bad the past couple of years have been for the Italian car market, you need only look at Fiat Auto, with its 44 per cent share. In 1993, the company - which manufactures under six different brand-names, including Fiat, Lancia, and Alfa Romeo - lost L1,745bn, after only breaking even in 1992. The Fiat industrial group reported a record loss of L1,783bn after tax and minority interests, reflecting its dependence on the automotive business. Not only was the state of the European car market grave, it was unexpected. Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat group, said in July that it was 'only matched by the collapse in demand after the first oil shock 20 years ago'. Signs of recovery in the Italian market are slower to appear than in the rest of Europe. While deliveries in Europe rose an average of 6.6 per cent in the first half of 1994, the number of units delivered to clients by Italian distributors slipped 2.6 per cent to 1.058m, from 1.086m in the same period, according to Anfia and Unrae, the Italian trade bodies for automobile manufacturers and importers. Italian car buyers are already punished by the high cost of petrol, and the high level of taxes on new cars but in the first quarter of 1994 the market was also hit by political uncertainty, ahead of the March general election. Optimism after the victory of Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance was undermined by the new government's failure to clarify whether it would introduce incentives for first-time car-buyers and existing owners wanting to replace their vehicles. Fiat claimed potential customers were holding back from buying because they thought incentives could be round the corner. As Mr Agnelli observed tartly at the group's annual meeting in July, car sales in France and Spain - both had enacted measures to improve demand - increased substantially in the first five months of the year. In the past couple of months, however, better news has begun to filter through from the market. Official statistics in Italy are notoriously sluggish to emerge, but projections from the ministry of transport indicated that registrations in August increased, compared with the equivalent period last year, sustaining a year-on-year monthly increase. Promotor, an independent car industry research group based in Bologna, observed in September that the faint signs of a general Italian economic recovery were beginning to stimulate the car market. Some 58 per cent of Italian dealers polled by Promotor at the end of August said the level of orders was normal or high, compared with only 20 per cent in June, and 29 per cent in July. Only 16 per cent of dealers thought demand would drop over the next three or four months. Consumers, cajoled by aggressive autumn promotions, may now go ahead with purchases which were postponed for the first two-thirds of the year. Fiat, in particular, has put much promotional weight behind its new Punto small car, Italy's best-seller. However, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the statistical evidence. The main one being that the figures may be distorted by the high proportion of 'parallel exports' from Italy to other countries where prices are generally higher. Until two years ago, it was Italians who slipped across the border to buy up to 50,000 or 60,000 cars a year from dealers in neighbouring countries. After the September 1992 devaluation of the lira, however, it is Italy which is benefiting from the bargain-hunting traffic, officially discouraged by the car distributors. 'At the moment, prices are much lower than in the rest of Europe, possibly by as much as 15 or 16 per cent,' says Gian Primo Quagliano, director of Promotor. 'But with discounts offered by dealers and intermediaries, that can rise to more than 20 per cent.' He estimates that out of some 1.9m sales likely to be recorded this year by Italian dealers, as many as 250,000 could be accounted for by parallel exports, compared with 150,000 in 1993. 'Sales are roughly at the same level as last year, but this total is made up of internal demand, which is still cautious, compensated by (parallel) exports,' says Mr Quagliano. Fiat Auto, which is pressing the transport ministry for more efficient statistical information about the Italian market, warns that some parallel exports may be counted twice, as registrations for Italy and the final country of destination. Parallel exports are still sales, however, and the currency devaluation has undoubtedly benefited Italian manufacturers, even on the home market. For example, the strong yen has discouraged Japanese imports, further shielding Fiat and its main European and US competitors on the Italian market, from the likely effects of full liberalisation of the European Union car sector in 1999. In the first half of the year, Italian car-makers (that is mainly Fiat, plus some specialist manufacturers) accounted for 45.89 per cent of the total number of cars delivered, according to the Anfia/Unrae statistics  - an increase of more than 1 percentage point on their market share in the first half of 1993. Fiat group is forecasting a return to overall profit in 1994. But Fiat Auto is still relatively pessimistic about its home territory. 'For us the Italian market isn't showing any signs of recovery. Although we have had one or two months where sales have increased the trend generally this year is static,' says Fiat. For Fiat Auto's Italian operations - and, by extension, for the Italian car market as a whole - the real recovery will not be felt until 1995.</p>

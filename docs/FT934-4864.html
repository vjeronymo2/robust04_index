			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: A Round sceptic seeking a square deal - A US official negotiating a Gatt package which once he did not believe in Mr Jeffrey Garten, the new US Commerce Department undersecretary for international trade, will make his debut as a trade negotiator in the Uruguay Round talks in Geneva tomorrow in what he deems 'the most inclusive international negotiation ever attempted'. An avowed believer in 'an open market-oriented trading system', his brief will be to defend the US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, considered by many US trading partners as little more than covert protectionism. He will also oversee the interests of two of the most protected US industries - textiles and steel. One of the Clinton administration's 'innovative pragmatists', Mr Garten was taken on to help move the US Commerce Department from the bureaucratic backwaters to the cutting edge of trade and economic policy. No one who knows him doubts that this genial former merchant banker has the mental agility for the job. Mr Garten argues that the US trade laws are essential to assure American companies that 'there is a degree of fairness in the international trading system, especially since the US market is more open than others'. The Round cannot win congressional approval if the trade laws are in any way 'diluted' and, besides, the amount of trade effected is 'an insignificant portion of imports' - less than 5 per cent. Mr Garten cut his negotiating teeth on Latin American debt restructuring in the early 1980s. He has also arranged dozens of deals between Asian and American companies as director of Shearson Lehman Brothers' Japan office. Mr Garten has also written about foreign and economic policy in leading US newspapers and foreign affairs magazines and in a book on past and future relations between the US, Japan and Germany. At times his views have got him into trouble. It was while he was at Shearson Lehman and the Uruguay Round was being launched that he expressed doubts about the Round in the Wall Street Journal. This proved to be a public embarrassment to one of the Round's greatest backers, Mr Jim Robinson, then chairman of American Express, which owned Shearson Lehman. Against all the optimism of the times (the Round was to be completed in 1990 after four years of talks), Mr Garten argued that the negotiations would be too complex, involved upheaval in too many domestic policies and had little to do with US trade problems at the time. 'The big trade issues had to do with currencies,' he says. 'The dollar was just coming down. There was talk about de-industrialising the US. The Round would not deal with the issues that were killing us.' All that has now changed, he he says, since the Clinton administration has set the course for budget deficit reduction, worker retraining, technology policy and efforts to stimulate investment. Now the Round provides a link between trade and domestic economic and social policies, he says. Furthermore, a successful Round will bring into the trading system in a more integral way the developing countries, which hold the greatest growth potential for US companies. 'That means the emerging markets have enhanced obligations. They also have to have a fair shot at access to the industrialised country markets.' As for Europe, Mr Garten sees it as a diminishing opportunity for US companies. Writing in Foreign Policy magazine last summer he foresaw the loss of American leverage in negotiations with Europe 'as a result of Europe's reduced need for American military protection' and as intra-European trade rises faster than transatlantic commerce. 'There is no chance that Europe will cede its national markets willingly,' he adds. 'A strong defensive response, characterised by slower-than-usual approach to trade liberalisation and selective but heavy government intervention is more likely.' For all its desirability, with all the momentum going for a deal, Mr Garten does not under-estimate the difficulties. 'The number of trade-offs among different categories is potentially mind-boggling,' he says. 'You have so many countries involved . . . at different stages of development. You are negotiating apples and oranges and pears.' In the end, he insists, the Clinton administration will not take a deal that falls short of its goals. 'It would be a mistake to think the administration will sign an agreement simply because it's the Uruguay Round and this has been a central part of economic strategy and we see trade liberalisation as a major part of job creation. 'There are some very major obstacles to cross; it will take a Herculean effort to do it.'</p>

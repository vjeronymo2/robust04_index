			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> In last week's Commercial Scene column on major office buildings for sale,  Daishin Kyouritsu Co. was incorrectly identified as the buyer of 9107 Wilshire  Blvd. in Beverly Hills. Wilshire-Doheny Associates Ltd. is buyer of record;  Daishin U.S.A. Co. Ltd. is a principal and managing general partner. Also, sale  of 9000 Sunset Blvd. by Pacific Financial Group has not closed, but is pending  close of escrow. Panorama City's Panorama Towers was incorrectly identified as  an investment of Pacific Financial; it is owned by Panorama Enterprises, and is  not for sale, according to principal Arthur Blech. And Winthrop Financial of  Boston says its share of Irvine's Park Place is not for sale -- despite reports  by several local brokers to the contrary.  </P></p>

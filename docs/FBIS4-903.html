			<p>BFN     [Text] Interethnic clashes continued in the northern  districts of the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, last night.  Details of casualties were not known by this morning.  Meanwhile, sporadic shooting was heard in Kamenge and Cibitoke  districts, which are Hutu-dominated. However, according to  External Relations Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, the situation  is not alarming. The government has asked the 15-member OAU  international observer mission to undertake joint patrols with  Burundi soldiers in order to obtain objective reports on the  cause of these disturbances.</p>

The document was signed in  Tbilisi February 3.    According to the protocol, by July 1 it is planned to create  three military bases in Vaziani (30 km to the south of Tbilisi),  Akhalkalaki, (southern Georgia) and Batumi (Adjaria) on the  basis of the Russian military contingent in the Transcaucasus.    The general believes that besides providing security for  Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region, the creation  of the bases will help stabilize the situation in the region and  protect the Russian-speaking population.    Galkin said that the protocol on creating the bases will be  in effect for 10 years. Afterwards the agreement may be  extended or annuled if mutually desired.    In February the expert group must take the final decision on  maintaing military bases and decide on the quantity of the  personnel and military technology. General Galkin who is the  chief of the armored troops department, believes that about 100  Russian tanks will be deployed at the three bases.    He has said that the training of officers of the Georgian  army in Russian military schools and academies will possibly be  made part of the payment for leasing the territory for the  military bases.    The general is sure that a similar document will be signed  with Armenia, where Moscow intends to create one military base.  Preliminary consultations on the issue have already been made.  Russia also plans to create one military base in Azerbaijan, but  the issue has not been coordinated yet, said Aleksandr Galkin.</p>

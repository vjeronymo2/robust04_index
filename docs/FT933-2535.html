			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / French economy stabilises FRENCH economic activity stabilised in the second quarter of this year, with gross domestic product showing a zero rate of growth, according to figures released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office. The Economy Ministry said they showed the economy had bottomed out after sharp contractions in the final quarter of 1992 and the first three months of this year. But private sector economists expressed caution about the statistics. 'This doesn't mean that the recession is over,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers. Like other economists he said GDP growth would probably fall again in the third quarter because of weakening consumer spending. Consumer expenditure was one of the factors which lifted the second quarter results, increasing by 0.4 per cent over the previous three months after a fall of 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year. The increase, which included a 7 per cent rise in spending on cars is, however, expected to be offset in the July-September period by the effect of increased taxes. The Contribution Sociale Generalisee, a tax on all income, and levies on petrol and alcohol, have all been raised since July. Industrial output also reversed its decline in the second quarter, rising by 0.2 per cent after a contraction of 1.8 per cent in the January-March period. But investment fell for the eighth successive quarter, declining by 1.2 per cent. Economists said the second quarter figures needed to be interpreted with care. Using the measure of market sector GDP, which excludes state services and more widely used in France until now, economic activity contracted 0.1 per cent in the first quarter. Insee maintained its forecast that GDP would fall by 0.7 per cent for the year as a whole. The consensus among private sector economists is a decline of about 1 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Ivanidze report: "Why Is Moscow Staying Silent?"] </F>   [Text] An avalanche has descended on the Russian Foreign  Intelligence Press Service. This is how we may describe what  has been happening since Wednesday morning at the old Moscow  town house at 11 Kolpachniy Pereulok. Press Service Director  Yuriy Kobaladze has been parrying questions about Aldrich Ames,  the Soviet-Russian agent in the CIA, which journalists have been  asking all day, with just one answer: "We have no comment to  make on events in Washington" and "the Foreign Intelligence  Service is concerned and would not want to see anything hamper  the building of good relations between the United States and  Russia."    Replying to an IZVESTIYA question about how our intelligence  service -- when it was still Soviet -- managed to recruit such a  high-ranking CIA staffer as Aldrich Hames, Yuriy Georgiyevich  sighed heavily: "Who told you we recruited him?" My  explanation -- that Bill Clinton himself had told everybody that  Ames had been recruited -- provoked an altogether human reaction  from the chief of the intelligence service Press Center.    "Well, you must understand that I am not the president or  the  Foreign Ministry! I cannot comment. And no special service in  the world would comment on whether a particular person is one of  its agents or not. If I say yes, then I put a guilty man in the  dock, and if I say no, you will ask me to prove it. Basically,  the official position of the Russian intelligence service is not  to comment!" Mr. Kobaladze stated.    In order to find out about the Russian intelligence  service's  unofficial policy, we had to approach a ranking Foreign  Intelligence Service staffer who asked us not to reveal his name.    Thus something unusual has happened in the normal practice  of  intelligence services. The U.S. President has personally  informed the whole world that the FBI has caught a former Soviet  and now Russian spy together with his wife, also a spy. The  Russian intelligence service representative believes that  Clinton has started a real "spy-mania" which has not been long  in coming. All the American newspapers have taken up the  improbable scandal, and the arrest of the Ameses has been  covered in great detail.    The intelligence service representative did not agree that  the arrest of such important agents could be regarded as a  setback. "Just a minute, why do you think it's a setback?! The  intelligence service has recruited practically the head of the  department. What do you call that, a setback?! In this matter  interpretation is everything. Well...of course, the fact they  have been arrested is not a good thing. The intelligence  service certainly can't rejoice about it. But it is completely  wrong to state unequivocally that it is a setback," the  representative told IZVESTIYA.    He did not deny that all the fuss that has been made could  be  connected with the fact that the FBI and CIA are worrying about  their budgets. Propaganda stunts of this nature are practiced  by intelligence services all over the world. Particularly in  countries where public opinion has an impact on the size of the  budget.    In this representative's opinion, today Moscow could also  arrest CIA agents in Russia and create a furor. "But we won't  be doing this," the representative added; he believes that  Russian spying against the United States is at least no greater  than the level of U.S. intelligence activity against the former  Soviet Union.    And so the facts look like this. It is clear that Clinton  has taken an unprecedented step by personally announcing the  capture of a spy, thus linking his name with the success of the  special services forever. From this it would seem that the  proof of Ames's guilt cannot be doubted.    Moreover, the CIA and FBI are not getting tired of praising  one another, which is also surprising. The squabbling between  these two departments has long been a tradition.    Finally, one last point. The Ames agents apparently did  everything in their power to ensure that the FBI found them out.  They bought a house in a luxurious suburb of Washington and paid  for it with a lump sum rather than in installments. They bought  a very expensive sports car. And most surprising of all, they  spent an enormous quantity of money which far exceeded their  salaries. And when they spent all this money, as if for the  FBI's convenience, they used credit cards rather than cash! All  this is somehow not very hush-hush.    Judging by the reaction of Russian departments and the text  of the U.S. protest note, it has been suggested that our country  should stay silent until the United States has concluded its  investigation and Clinton has won his brownie points. All the  indications are that there are no specific complaints against  Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F> Democratic Left, by Robert Casensky and Michal Musil in  Bratislava; date not given: "We Are the Only Alternative to  Meciar"]    [Text] Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the  Democratic Left (SDL), is currently one of the most important  players on the Slovak political scene. His party has managed to  get into the government, yet Weiss himself stays in the  background. We asked him about the prospects of future  political developments in Slovakia.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] The SDL has managed to get into the  government. How would you react to the statement that the  communists have returned to power?    [Weiss] It does not bother anyone in the Czech Republic, nor  is anyone frightened by the fact that Mr. Dlouhy and Mr.  Kocarnik, both of whom are former communists, have now been in  power for two years. When, however, communists who have created  a new political party assume power, it instantaneously bothers  everyone. I would like to hear about a single nondemocratic  step ever asserted by the SDL or at least one objection that our  economic program is directed against transformation.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What are you going to do when the Movement  for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections again? Are  you afraid of Vladimir Meciar's return to power?    [Weiss] The momentary rise of electoral preferences for the  HZDS is associated with the wave of emotions that arose in the  wake of Vladimir Meciar's dismissal from the post of prime  minister following the president's speech and the former prime  minister's speech. However, in the elections, citizens of the  Slovak Republic will have to express themselves clearly about  which path Slovakia will embark upon: whether it will follow the  line of "Civil war rather than the president" [one of the  slogans chanted by Meciar's supporters after his  dismissal]--that is, the path of political revenge against those  who had the courage to democratically pass a vote of  no-confidence in the prime minister, the path of populist  movements that constantly promise something but never keep their  promises, or the path of normal cooperation among political  parties that exist in the West. Precisely therein lies the  alternative to populist and excessively nationalist policies,  confrontational and intransigent policies, the policy of  searching for an enemy, a policy that reaches into the arsenal  of political techniques applied under the previous regime, by  which I mean the evocation of an atmosphere of conspiracy and  the labeling of political adversaries as enemies, traitors, and  saboteurs. This alternative is represented by the social  democratic grouping made up of the SDL, the Social Democratic  Party in Slovakia, the Farmers Movement, and, possibly, the  Green Party, with respect to which there exists a realistic  chance that it will join our coalition. In addition, there is  also the Association of Workers of Slovakia, which reflects  mainly the sentiments of workers disillusioned with the fact  that the promises given to them by Mr. Meciar two years ago have  not come true. Even if this association does not join the  preelection coalition, postelection cooperation is very  realistic. Hence, we do not consider ourselves defeated in  advance and are no pessimists. Quite the contrary, we see a  realistic chance in this lineup of being able to play at least a  drawn game with the HZDS.    Of course, there exists yet another possibility in the form  of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], possibly an alliance  with the Democratic Party, which, in terms of membership, is  identical to the former Civic Democratic Union. I do not think,  however, that the majority of voters would decide in favor of  this alternative. It also remains to be seen what chances the  emerging bloc of small liberal-oriented parties of Messrs. Roman  Kovac and Jozef Moravcik, Mr. Cernak, and Mr. Knazko will be  able to create for itself. If this grouping managed to gain  seats in parliament, it would represent a natural partner for  the social democratic political grouping.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] There is talk of disagreements within the  SDL, however. There is talk about the existence of a faction  that has the support of the members' base and that rejects the  SDL's coalition with the KDH.    [Weiss] This is Mr. Meciar's wish. Some zealous  correspondents have started spreading it and started to write  about a split in the SDL. The fact is that the SDL is the last  entity on the political scene that has not split. The first to  fall apart was the Public Against Violence movement [VPN], which  was followed by the split of the HZDS, the KDH, and the Slovak  National Party. Someone evidently objects to the fact that  there exists a consolidated political entity with a clear  programmatic orientation and headed by politicians who rise  above personal ambitions and do not let themselves be provoked  to commit some foolishness just to get into the government for a  few months. What is being strangely labeled as a conflict  within the SDL was just a normal debate in the party leadership  and in the Club of Deputies, a debate, conducted at the time  when the dismissal of former Prime Minister Meciar and the  calling of early parliamentary elections were being considered,  about which tactical course of action to choose. The sole cause  of disagreements was that some members of the Club of Deputies  and members of the SDL leadership did not feel that the  guarantees that early elections would be held were sufficient.  Subsequently, it turned out that common sense and realism  prevailed in parliament and that deputies reached a unique  agreement on early elections. The political trauma that the  government would not remain in power only until the early  elections and that someone would be trying to extend its  existence until 1996 ended and so did the discussions within the  SDL. Now that we have assumed our share of government  responsibility, we want the government to function and deal with  problems in a pragmatic way. We have delegated to the  government, first and foremost, experts and not political  personalities.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What kind of economic policy does  Slovakia need at present?    [Weiss] First of all, it is necessary to realize in what  situation the Slovak economy has found itself, including from  the viewpoint of the nature of this economy. This economy is  capable of supplying a far larger market than it has at its  disposal. From this follows the main task--growth of export  policy. This means, at the same time, the need to develop  economic relations with neighbors, European Union countries, and  other countries in the world. The instruments in the monetary  and credit sphere must also be oriented so that they promote  exports and correspond to the needs of exports.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you think Slovakia can afford the  present size of the budget deficit, which is approximately 14  billion [Slovak korunas]?    [Weiss] The deficit projected for this year should be  adhered to; it should on no account be exceeded. This deficit  must be used for development targets. The present deficit  really is unacceptable because we spend it on consumption  instead of using it to revive the economy.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What is your opinion of devaluation?  Leaving aside the fact that this step is within the  jurisdiction of the bank of issue, do you think Slovakia can  avoid this step?    [Weiss] Let us not brandish devaluation as though it were  some magic wand, some miraculous device that will resolve all  problems of the Slovak economy. The wish to stabilize the  Slovak currency prevails, and the National Bank of Slovakia  identifies with it. The possibilities of accepting a loan from  international monetary institutions are being considered, as  well as the risks associated with the acceptance of this loan.  Our course of action in talks with the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund will be based on expert arguments,  and, at the same time, it must minimize the risks for this  government.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you agree that considerations about  devaluation are strongly affected by a political factor, the  fact that early elections are only a few months away and  devaluation is an unpopular measure?    [Weiss] This government's program is not based on  devaluation at any cost and under any circumstances. It will  consider all of the macroeconomic and social risks of such a  step. Moreover, the decision on whether to devalue is made by  the National Bank--that is, devaluation is not a political  decision made by the government. The National Bank's tendency  is to keep the currency stable. Foreign exchange reserves have  gone up slightly, and, if everything comes off, a new bonds  issue will be prepared. We are not predetermined by fate to  experience rapid devaluation.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Wherein lie the biggest current problems of  the Slovak economy?    [Weiss] These are the growing deficit of the state budget  and the literally critical situation in education and the health  services, caused by the lack of funds, which the new government  inherited from the previous one. This government does not want  to take the path of delaying inevitable rational measures at any  price, just in view of the election campaign. At the same time,  however, it naturally does not want to get into a situation  where it will be blamed for things for which it is not  responsible. We are now going to conduct intensive talks with  the social partners. There will be talk of specific figures  ensuing from the signing of the general agreement.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Which party in other postcommunist  countries does the SDL resemble most, in your opinion?    [Weiss] The SDL has much in common with the Hungarian  Socialist Party, for example, and there are also similarities  with the Polish Alliance of the Democratic Left [SLD], though  the party's transformation took place under different  circumstances there. We also make no secret of our good  relations with the Italian Democratic Left Party. Hardly anyone  knows that the SDL's name came into being two weeks before the  name of the Democratic Left Party in Italy.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Could you specify in greater detail the  similarities between your party and the Polish SLD?    [Weiss] Many identical features exist--above all, in  economic  policy. Like the SLD's policy, the policy proposed by us is  pragmatic, realistic, and, to a large extent, compatible with  liberal economic policy. We do not want to fall into the trap  of promising something that cannot be fulfilled, as occasionally  happens to social democratic policy. We do not want to continue  shifting the burden to coming generations. Of course, we have  ideas about how to make transformation socially more acceptable  and how to distribute the costs of transformation more evenly  than has been the case thus far. Some economic burdens that the  population is asked to carry can be compensated by noneconomic  steps. Savings in some social payments, for example, can be  compensated by a greater feeling of safety in the streets. In  that case, it is possible to expect certain support from the  population. At any rate, it is necessary to speak the truth and  not to make any promises. After all, it is not admissible in  the name of some short-term political aims to bring about,  within six months, an economic situation for the recovery, from  which the state will need four years.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Which party in the Czech Republic is the  nearest to you?    [Weiss] The party nearest to me is the Czech Social  Democratic Party.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] A part of your members base supposedly  calls you a right-wing radical. How do you feel about that?    [Weiss] This is not what the members base says but what some  uninformed correspondents write. The members base knows me  well, and it voluntarily chose the path I proposed in late 1990,  which led to the founding of the SDL at the beginning of 1991. I  am in regular contact with party members and do not ascribe  great importance to such claims.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What do you think about communism?    [Weiss] It was a social experiment that defied the  principles  on which it was built and that foundered for that very reason.  It was a method of organizing society that did not manage to  produce either greater productivity of labor or a higher  standard of civilization or technology and that was even unable  to fulfill the proclaimed values of liberation of man and the  democratization of society. Quite the contrary, it was  precisely in the sphere of human rights that the greatest  failure of the communist regime and the greatest denial of the  declared humanitarian principles made themselves felt. Our  decision to create the SDL was given by the fact that this  social experiment simply failed, that the kind of political  parties that operated in the former existing socialist societies  on the basis of the principle of leading role lost their raison  d'etre and justification and that there was no sensible reason  to keep them alive. The crisis of communist parties in Western  Europe proved us right.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] According to Viliam Plevza's book  Gustav Husak Spoke, after November 1989, you and  Pavol Kanis used to visit the, by that time already isolated,  president of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic at Prague  Castle. What did you discuss with him, and what are your  recollections of those visits?    [Weiss] I did not see him regularly. In the course of the  then developments, we quite clearly recommended to President  Husak his immediate resignation.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] What kind of foreign policy should Slovakia  pursue, and how should Slovak foreign policy approach the  question of NATO membership? Are you afraid of developments in  Russia in this context?    [Weiss] The SDL was the first Slovak party to adopt a  comprehensive foreign policy program, and, together with current  Defense Minister Kanis, in this program we uncompromisingly  pushed through the idea of rapprochement with NATO up to  Slovakia's membership in this organization. Our pro-Western  orientation is quite unambiguous. After the decision of the SDL  congress in Zilina in May 1993 [to advocate Slovakia's NATO  membership], public opinion regarding the question of joining  NATO has changed in a very positive way. The number of  advocates of this solution to Slovakia's security situation has  increased, while the number of opponents has declined.    We are naturally watching developments in Russia and are not  pleased with the manifestations of extremism and the new wave of  Greater Russian nationalism. For this reason, we also agree  with the Partnership for Peace project.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] During its talks with Slovak Social  Democrats, the Czech Social Democratic Party let it be known  that it would propose the formation of a Czech-Slovak union.  What position did you assume on this proposal?    [Weiss] The division of the CSFR was caused by the  unwillingness of the Czech political elite to accept truly equal  coexistence of the two nations and a fundamental transformation  of the federation. This was the concept that was offered by us,  but we did not find any allies for it, neither in the Czech  Republic nor in Slovakia. That is why we see the CSFR's  partition as a fact and the independence of the two republics as  a reality that it is pointless to change. Both states have been  recognized, so there exist neither foreign political nor  domestic political conditions for the restoration of what  existed here before. We are a party that is interested in good  and literally privileged relations with the Czech Republic  because it is not possible to simply throw out of the window the  74 years of coexistence and the specific economic but also  cultural and family ties that have been formed. While the older  generation and the middle-aged are still emotionally tied to  many elements of coexistence in the common state, the young  generation already perceives things differently.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Had you become prime minister, would the  talks with the Czech Republic have taken a less conflict-ridden  and calmer course than, for example, the property talks with  Vladimir Meciar's government?    [Weiss] They would have definitely taken a more civilized  and businesslike course. From the viewpoint of expertise,  however, we would have surely been tougher partners than the  previous government.</p>

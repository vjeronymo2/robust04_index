			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / People: CIB's cosmopolitan flavour The Chartered Institute of Bankers has picked a foreign banker as president for the first time in its 116-year history. Andreas Prindl, 54, an American who lives in London and works for a Japanese bank, has taken over from Sir Brian Pearse as president of the main professional body for Britain's bankers. Prindl (right), who has been a member of the institute since 1970, began his banking career with New York's Morgan Guaranty Trust in 1964. After stints in Europe and Tokyo, he was seconded as chief executive of Saudi International Bank in London. In 1984 he joined Nomura International and two years later helped found Nomura Bank International, of which he remains chairman. In the past the president's job has tended to be given to senior British clearing bankers as a mark of recognition at the end of their banking careers. As well as Sir Brian, who stepped down as Midland Bank's chief executive earlier this year, the post has been held recently by people like Sir Jeremy Morse, the ex-chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Sir John Quinton, the former chairman of Barclays Bank. Prindl, who has a doctorate in international economics, says that the institute faces a number of challenges 'ranging from the acceptability and validity of its qualifications, its international commitments and the structure of its membership, to its relationships with other institutes in the City'. As competition in the financial services industry has grown in recent years it has been rumoured that the Institute of Bankers might merge with other bodies such as the Insurance Institute or the Building Societies Association. Prindl is not the only foreign face at the institute. Gavin Shreeve, 47, who was educated in South Africa, is taking over as secretary-general from Eric Glover, who is retiring after 31 years with the institute. Shreeve is a former editor of The Banker which is owned by the Financial Times. John Melborn, 56, deputy chief executive of National Westminster Bank, has been elected as deputy chairman of the institute, which means that on past form he will take over as president after Prindl has served his turn.

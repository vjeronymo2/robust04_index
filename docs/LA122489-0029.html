			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL ACTIVISTS ARE CRITICIZED FOR IGNORING CONSTITUTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL  REALITIES  </P> <P> Regarding the article about animal furs, I agree that furs should not be  obtained from endangered animals or through the use of inhumane traps, but  animals raised for their fur are the same to me as animals raised for their  meat.  </P> <P> If an activist leads an existence free of animal byproducts obtainable only  through the animal's death, then and only then would I respect his opinion.  </P> <P> STAR MEYER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / BR telecoms arm to be privatised BRITISH RAIL Telecommunications, a wholly-owned BR subsidiary, is to be sold late next year. The government said it has the potential to compete with BT and Mercury in the UK's telecoms market. Announcing the sale yesterday, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said that responsibility for rail signalling safety would pass to Railtrack, which will assume ownership of the rail network under the government's privatisation plans. Although BRT will continue to supply signalling, communications and business services to the railway, Railtrack is likely to be free to employ other private-sector suppliers, with BRT free to use spare capacity to sell to other companies, provided it gains the necessary public licences. In the year to April BRT had a gross income of Pounds 114m and made an operating surplus of Pounds 22m. With cables running alongside 60,000 miles of track, Mr MacGregor said BRT's network 'could be exploited for external telecommunications customers'. He added: 'There are excellent opportunities for private-sector involvement in rail telecommunications while safeguarding operational requirements.' A study of BRT's investment requirements is under way. However, doubt was cast over the sell-off earlier this month with the sudden departure of Mr Peter Borer, BRT's managing director. Mr Borer is believed to have clashed with Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, over the sell-off plans. He had been attempting to promote a management buy-out of BRT with a view to making it a national telecoms competitor. But the necessary private-sector backing for the venture does not appear to have been forthcoming. The investment is necessary to extend the trackside lines to homes and businesses. Telecoms operators including Singapore Telecom are believed to have expressed interest, but to have gone no further. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House of Commons, refused to be drawn yesterday on whether the government would seek to reverse the defeats it has suffered in the House of Lords on the railways bill when it returns to the Commons, Ivor Owen writes. He said ministers were still considering the implications of amendments made by peers which permit BR to seek franchises to operate passenger services, and requiring the government to guarantee the solvency of the industry's pension fund. Mr Newton insisted that it would not be appropriate for him to make any further comment until the consideration had been completed.</p>

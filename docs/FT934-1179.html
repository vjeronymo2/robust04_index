			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Big electricity users back down in dispute Pressure on Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to reach a compromise with generators National Power and PowerGen increased yesterday when big energy users backed down from their insistence that the generators should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Major Energy Users' Council said that there was no need for a referral if changes were made to the way prices were determined in the wholesale electricity pool. Mr Peter Rost, chairman, said: 'This offers an escape route from a monopolies inquiry, which would involve delay and uncertainty.' He wanted the government to use the coming sale of its 40 per cent stake in the generators to create additional companies in the market. Prof Littlechild said last week that he would decide on a reference by mid-January. The change of stance from the council is significant because the organisation represents influential organisations including Marks and Spencer and the National Health Service. Its preference for a negotiated settlement over pool prices means that virtually all interested parties have expressed a desire for referral to be avoided. The council's policy shift follows its commissioning of a report, by Ilex Associates, the consultancy, which was published yesterday. Ilex concludes that the generators' rates of return are 'arguably higher' than appropriate when there is surplus capacity but are not excessive. It suggests the pool-price determination should be changed so that it reflects more accurately the costs of generation. In part this would be achieved by increasing capacity-related payments. Greater variation between peak and off-peak prices would result. Ilex says the regulator could bring about such change but would have to regulate the pool-price bidding system. The objective would be to 'curb National Power's and PowerGen's ability to gain excessive profits through their manipulation of pool prices'. Ilex says prices for household consumers would increase only marginally by 0.06p per kilowatt hour but those for base-load industrial customers could fall 0.3p per kwh on average in the middle of the decade.

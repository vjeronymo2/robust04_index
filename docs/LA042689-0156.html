			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CANSECO OUT OF EGG COMMERCIAL  </P> <P> Oakland Athletic's slugger Jose Canseco, arrested last week on firearms  charges, has been dropped from a television commercial sponsored by the  California Egg Commission.  </P> <P> "When we're spending the money that we are, someone like that just doesn't  portray the image that we want to portray," Robert Pierre, the commission's  president, said of Tuesday's decision.  </P> <P> Canseco was arrested Friday after a pedestrian spotted a loaded handgun on the  floor of his cherry-red custom Jaguar. The car was parked at the campus of the  University of California at San Francisco, where Canseco was having an injured  wrist attended to.  </P> <P> It is a felony to have an unregistered weapon on a university campus.  </P> <P> The television spot is part of the commission's $4.5-million campaign for the  year. In it, Canseco says: "Eggs are a terrific source of protein, and protein  means power. You know what I do with my power."  </P></p>

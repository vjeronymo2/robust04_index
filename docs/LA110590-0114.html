			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SONIC YOUTH FOCUSES ITS POWER, SOARS  </P> <P> As a stage band, Sonic Youth has reached sonic maturity.  </P> <P> The underground rock icons from New York City shaped and focused some of the  most chaotic guitar sounds imaginable in a playful, authoritative and often  exhilarating performance Saturday night at UC Irvine's Crawford Hall.  </P> <P> On record, Sonic Youth regularly has achieved that sort of mastery at least  since its 1986 album "Evol," which established the band as a leader of the  alternative rock scene. In concert, though, the band's strengths were prone to  be obscured by an overflowing surge of unharnessed sound. Now, its control and  coordination seem complete.  </P> <P> The idea of making over-the-edge but coherent rock music out of clangor and  electronic overload goes back to the Velvet Underground in the mid-'60s (and  Sonic Youth played against a backdrop of projected colors and shapes that  recalled the "Exploding Plastic Inevitable" multimedia shows that Velvets'  mentor Andy Warhol built around that band in its early days).  </P> <P> Without copying the Velvets' sound, Sonic Youth provided a state-of-the-art  embodiment of the rock-as-noise concept. Guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee  Ranaldo used feedback howls, dissonances, twisted riffs based on unusual  tunings and skewed playing techniques (a guitar doctored with duct tape for  Ranaldo; a drumstick to scrape at or bang on strings for Moore at several  junctures). These helped put the customary two-guitar blend on strange new  footing.  </P> <P> Instead of dividing the guitar work into standard lead and rhythm roles, Sonic  Youth was more concerned with spatial relationships. Moore usually played the  foreground figures that were easiest for a listener to trace (drummer Steve  Shelley often drove those riffs home by doubling the guitar cadences). Ranaldo,  who chose from an array of about a dozen different guitars as if he were a  golfer plucking the right club out of his bag, was the feedback master who  wrapped his fellow guitarist's strands in a broad fabric of sound.  </P> <P> This approach might sound a little measured and cerebral for a guitar-hero  tradition that calls for grabbing the ax, turning its volume knob up to 10, and  chopping away. But Sonic Youth was fun to watch. By the fourth song, for  instance, Ranaldo had swung a 12-string guitar exactly like an ax, smashing it  apart against the stage. Later, he held his guitar out to the audience as he  shook groans from it, turning feedback into a sacrament.  </P> <P> Vocals, divided mainly between Moore and his wife, bassist Kim Gordon, were  designed to serve more as added instrumental lines rather than as a  conventional medium for pop melody. Moore had a bit of Tom Verlaine's yelp in  his delivery, while Gordon's incantational singing was hoarser, more biting  than on record.  </P> <P> Just about everything Sonic Youth played during its 70-minute set was taken at  a hurtling, swarming pace, although less hectic eddys appeared at times,  temporarily slowing the insistent, fast current. This method didn't change much  from song to song but once the band began clicking with its third selection,  "Cinderella's Big Score," unswerving intensity made up for the lack of variety.  </P> <P> It was a show that needed no additions (although the band's songbook easily  could support a longer set without losing quality). But as Sonic Youth gets  ready for its 10th year as a band, it still is working under a limitation that  besets most '80s bands: excessive specialization. Sonic Youth has found a good  niche for itself and has burrowed deeply into it, refining and amplifying the  same approach with each album. The best rockers of the '60s and '70s were far  more protean.  </P> <P> The Velvet Underground, for example, played some of pop's most tender ballads  -- "I'll Be Your Mirror," "Sunday Morning" -- when it wasn't going on the noisy  anti-pop excursions of a "Sister Ray." Sonic Youth's repertoire includes  celebrations of rock's power, odes to transcending the everyday grind, songs of  spooky irony and pieces devoted to dark humor or black dread. But it hasn't  shown a hint of tenderness and warmth. Perhaps its method doesn't allow it. But  perhaps it would be worth finding new methods to explore.  </P> <P> Second-billed Mudhoney didn't escape the trap that Sonic Youth bounded over  with the sheer force of its playing -- sameness leading to tedium.  </P> <P> The young Seattle band proved that it could hammer home '60s garage rock riffs  culled from as far back as the Kinks' "You Really Got Me," along with some more  recent-vintage punk thrashing. Everything about Mudhoney, including singer Mark  Arm's leathery howling, was raw and hard. That's promising, but the band needs  to develop more involving, less repetitious material.  </P> <P> Bassist Matt Lukin made the biggest impression -- not for any musical efforts  but for his foolish babblings between songs.  </P> <P> Lukin was back at it during Sonic Youth's final encore, when members of  Mudhoney and opening band Gumball joined in for a version of the Stooges' "I  Wanna Be Your Dog." Lukin's contribution to the sloppy but fun number was to  drop his trousers.  </P> <P> Gumball was restrained but reasonably effective in a brief opening set that  dredged up tougher '60s sources ranging from the Stooges to Jimi Hendrix to  Neil Young. The proceedings could have used some of the humor and verve that  come through on "Rake," the latest album by Velvet Monkeys, a band in which two  members of Gumball used to play.  </P></p>

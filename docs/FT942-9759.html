			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop setbacks put Indian sugar trade into reverse - Imports are now needed so that a presence can be maintained in the export market India's sugar crop hopes are continuing to fade. Having already been lowered to 10.5m tonnes from 11m, the production estimate for the 1993-94 season (October-September) has recently been cut to not more than 9.8m tonnes. Last year, the country produced 10.6m tonnes of sugar, down from the 1991-92 record of 13.4m. A concerned federal government has allowed duty-free imports of white sugar so that the domestic production shortfall does not lead to a runaway inflation in sugar prices. According to industry officials, between the Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim Corporation and the trade, nearly 500,000 tonnes of sugar have already been contracted for import. And import contracts for another 300,000 tonnes are likely to be signed in the next few weeks. The imported sugar has started arriving at Indian ports and to facilitate its distribution the government has told the trade that it will be exempted from the 'stock-holding limit and turnover time applicable to sugar produced within the country'. Earlier the government allowed the import of raw sugar for processing and re-export at a minimum value addition of 7.5 per cent. This was done in response to the suggestion by the Indian Sugar Mills Association that India, which reappeared as a sugar exporter in 1990-91 should maintain a presence in the world market in spite of the production setback. The ISGIEC, the industry's trading arm, has already imported 12,000 tonnes of raw sugar, and the seller has the option to supply the same quantity by June 1994. Meanwhile, ISMA has told the government that in view of the worsening domestic supply situation the imported raw sugar should be allowed to be marketed within the country after processing without attracting any levy. And the government is expected to accept the proposal. Hit by a severe drought, Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing state, where crushing of cane is almost over, will end the season with production of 2.7m tonnes, compared with last year's 3.36m. The setback to production in Uttar Pradesh to 2.66m tonnes from 2.86m is blamed on large-scale diversion of cane to production of gur and khandsari, traditional sweeteners for the local peasant market. According to ISMA, 'a good 500,000 tonnes of sugar has been lost in Uttar Pradesh because of the cane diversion'. The production loss in Bihar is because of damage caused to the standing crop by floods and excessive rains. There will also be production shortfall in the two north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. Gujarat, however, is expected to step up production to 970,000 tonnes from 751,000. Production will also be higher in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The expected production of 9.8m tonnes will not meet domestic consumption, which the government is seeking to restrict to about 12m tonnes through the monthly sugar release mechanism. The total availability of sugar in the current season will be, however, around 13.8m tonnes, including the carry forward stocks of 3.2m tonnes and imports of 800,000 tonnes. Though the Indian sugar season begins in October, production gains momentum only from the end of November, so the new season should ideally start with stocks equal to the sugar requirement for at least two and a half months. This is not going to happen in 1994-95. In the meantime, new cane plantation has started. According to industry official plantings will be 20 to 25 per cent higher than last year's. But the first crop forecast and the likely sugar production in the next season will not be available till June by when the monsoon has set in.</p>

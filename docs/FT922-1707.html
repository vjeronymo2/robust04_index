			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: Rise and fall of a Nazi toff HITLER'S DIPLOMAT by John Weitz Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 336 pages SUAVE AND shallow seems an apt summing up of Joachim von Ribbentrop. He added the 'von' himself, to enhance his status as son of a wine merchant. So, unlike the bully boys who formed the Nazi Party, young Ribbentrop joined as a toff. The louche, cabaret ambience of pre-war Berlin gave him contact with the young riff-raff of the party. He presented these roaring boys in his home as 'men who have a programme for Germany'. It was an early example of radical chic, as Tom Wolfe remarks in his preface to John Weitz' fluent and fascinating biography of Hitler's ambassador to London. In some ways, the young Ribbentrop resembled the yuppies of yester-year: he had money, married well, had good connections and was an ardent social climber. He had a certain cosmopolitan polish gained from travel abroad; he even played a good game of tennis. He might have lived a casual, rich, social life, but instead he became thoroughly besotted with Hitler. Hitler wanted someone to translate the London and Paris papers, Ribbentrop was recommended. Hitler became a guest at the house, usually on his own, because of his table manners - 'he was not someone you could invite anyone with]' according to Anelies von Ribbentrop. Finally he got a minor job in the office of Hess, the party deputy. Gradually, he inveigled himself into a position where he ran foreign errands for Hitler. He expanded his office into an organisation. He became Hitler's advance man in his campaign for an alliance with Britain. (The author is especially revealing on English society of those years.) By 1935 Ribbentrop had become Ambassador Extraordinary on special mission, by-passing the London and other embassies. He negotiated (his diplomatic technique was 'take it or leave it') a Naval Agreement with the British Government which was hailed by Hitler as a triumph. Posted in 1936 as ambassador to the Court of St. James, he proved way out of his depth. The bitchy, witty society of that time, as recorded by Chips Channon, made fun of him. His worst gaffe was at the Palace: bowing out of the audience chamber, after presenting his credentials to George V1, Ribbentrop three times half-raised his right arm in a modified Hitler salute. The press got to hear of it and went wild: 'Ribb Heils King]' The gaffe quickly reached Berlin; even Hitler was dismayed. And so it goes on, a figure more foolish and ambitious, maybe, than monstrous, but utterly tainted. Because even if he did not know what he was doing at the start, he soon learned the truth about the Nazis. A sort of slavish admiration of Hitler, devoid of any moral sense, led him on. The world of diplomacy was far more glamorous than importing wines. In the end, fallen from his glory as foreign minister, even Ribbentrop came to realise that his pact with the devil could only end one way: by his execution. His ashes were deposited unceremoniously with those of the other war criminals in a small stream near Munich.</p>

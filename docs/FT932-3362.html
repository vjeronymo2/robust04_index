			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / Mehta may turn state witness MR Harshad Mehta, the flamboyant stockbroker at the centre of India's biggest financial scandal, has offered to be a state witness and testify about possible pay-offs to politicians, Reuter reports from New Delhi. He would thus gain immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying about a Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) political payoff, said Mr Ram Jethmalani, his lawyer. Mr Mehta, 38, has been charged with bribery, fraud and currency violations in the scandal, which was exposed in April 1992. He is one of several brokers and bankers accused of involvement in the scandal, in which money is alleged to have been siphoned from the interbank securities market to help pump up prices on the then booming Bombay stock exchange.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 13 (XINHUA) -- The U.S.  Administration is considering a proposal that Congress lift its  ban on military aid to Pakistan in exchange for halting  production of nuclear weapons materials.    The proposal would allow Pakistan to take possession of  dozens of F-16 fighter planes it has already paid for but never  delivered because of a Congress amendment, according to the NEW  YORK TIMES today.    The amendment bans military aid to Pakistan unless the U.S.  President can certify that Pakistan neither has nuclear weapons  nor is trying to develop them.    U.S. officials were quoted as saying that the proposal is  part of a policy to stem the spread of nuclear arms in South  Asia.    The proposal implicitly recognizes that the U.S. has failed  to prevent Pakistan from developing the ability to build a  nuclear weapon and now is trying constrain the country's nuclear  program, the newspaper said.    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that her  country would not give up its nuclear program despite pressure  from the United States.</p>

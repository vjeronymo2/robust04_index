			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Surge in US consumer confidence A SURGE in consumer confidence and a strong increase in home sales indicated the US economic recovery is gathering momentum, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. Consumer confidence rose almost 13 points to 78.3 this month, according to an index compiled by the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group. The gain was bigger than Wall Street expected and took confidence to its highest level since the surge in consumer sentiment following the end of the Gulf war in spring last year. Sales of existing homes rose 5.8 per cent between October and November to their highest level in nearly six years - a sign that big cuts in interest rates this year are reviving the housing market. The November increase followed a revised 10.3 per cent jump in October and left sales 19 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Consumer confidence has risen nearly 24 points in the past two months. However, the rise in the index, mainly reflected a sharp increase in a sub-index measuring 'expectations', which rose from 70.7 in October to 104.5 last month. Yesterday's figures follow encouraging reports from many retailers who have reported the best Christmas sales for four years.</p>

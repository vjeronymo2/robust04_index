			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): A quiet revolution  -Profile of Dunlop Cox THE FIRST impression on any visitor to the headquarters of Dunlop Cox is the dull thud of 400-ton presses reverberating through the building. However, Mr Ian Beattie hopes a quieter revolution at the car seat slide manufacturer will have a more lasting impact. Mr Beattie, managing director of the Nottingham-based company whose customers include Rolls-Royce, Rover, Volvo and Nissan, has overseen a transformation in manufacturing practices and cultural attitudes which has covered everything from information technology to the adoption of Japanese methods to cut waste. Along with many suppliers to the automotive industry, Dunlop Cox has had its ups and downs, but, when it came to replacing its former computerised batch processing system in 1990, there were special reasons for ensuring that the company made the right decision. A difficult move from two factories into one new plant, and an underfinanced attempt to introduce just-in-time manufacturing, had turned the company into a high-risk supplier by the time BTR, the international engineering group, bought it in January 1990, says Mr Beattie. An investment was made by BTR for additional plant, tooling and training to allow the full potential of JIT manufacture to be realised. Further improvements followed with the introduction of cell layouts, Kanban systems and other Kaizen techniques. Thus, with a very conservative base that requires reliable and timely deliveries - at the right quality and price - any new production system had to be capable of supporting Dunlop Cox's updated and re-arranged manufacturing methods, rather than smother them. Because stocks are low and manufacturing processes are balanced, production on an hour-by-hour basis is controlled on the shopfloor using Kanban. The computerised production control system, however, is needed to support the interface between customers, who frequently change their schedules, the production cells and the company's suppliers. It was here that the selection of a comprehensive new computer system became a problem. Dunlop Cox had outgrown its old ICL batch processing machine, and wanted a system that could keep up with daily production of as many as 17,000 seat mechanisms and slide assemblies. But very few system vendors, says Mr Richard Bull, production director, were able to understand the needs of real JIT manufacturing. At any time, the company has just 13-14 days of stock in the entire production process, and uses a fairly simple system of manual controls to pull parts and products through the system. Storage of materials between the various operations such as pressing, fabrication, painting and final assembly has been virtually eliminated, and the company does not need to know, for example, how many parts are being produced by a particular press - or where an individual item has reached in the manufacturing process, as this is controlled using the Kanban system. Dunlop Cox has now introduced a system based on a UK-built McDonnell Douglas Series 19 superminicomputer, supporting software from Worksop-based All Business Systems and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Matrix package. Matrix is an online manufacturing suite with variants available for batch, contract, repetitive and process industry needs. At Dunlop Cox, the Pounds 400,000 system is proving its worth in a number of ways; by enabling the immediate tracking of information in the receiving bay - previously it might have taken three days for the system to register receipt of a component or roll of coiled steel; by enabling real-time 'backflushing' of sales, generating supplier schedules automatically; by allowing the creation of sophisticated 'process routings' to replace the limited instructions available under the old system. Not everything has gone smoothly. Transferring existing records to the new computer has not been easy, says McDonnell Douglas, while Mr Bull says it took the supplier some months to work out how to get his forward calendar to match with the system's. Dunlop Cox is currently doubling the system's processing power but Mr John Bryant, manufacturing engineering director, says the company already has the backbone of what it needs. The system's ability to provide instantaneous access of data from the manufacturing cells will help the company's continuous improvement process and - through links with its Computervision Cadcam system - its new product development. The company, says Mr Beattie, is no longer a high-risk supplier - a statement supported by its exclusive contract to supply seat slides for the Nissan Primera and Micra assembly plant at Washington, Tyne &amp; Wear. Its new computer system will help it stay in its customers' good books.</p>

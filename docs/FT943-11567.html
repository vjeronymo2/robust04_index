			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Sainsbury/Wm Low J. Sainsbury's Pounds 210m bid for Wm Low is cleverly pitched. Having crunched the numbers, Sainsbury clearly calculated that a price of 305p a share would give it a serious chance of winning without threatening earnings dilution. Had the offer been any lower, Tesco would have had no hesitation in rushing in again. Had it been any higher, the market would have worried that Sainsbury had dropped its trolley. It is curious that Sainsbury did not seek Low's approval. Then again, unless Tesco responds, Low has no option but to accept given that Sainsbury's bid is all cash and some 36 per cent above the original offer. The market assumes Tesco will raise the stakes again. Low's shares closed 19p above Sainsbury's offer price. But Tesco would have to work hard to justify re-entering the fray at that level. Arguably Low is worth more to Sainsbury because of the latter's smaller presence in Scotland and lack of distribution facilities. Sainsbury may also be able to recoup more money from selling on some of Low's smaller stores while Tesco appears committed to trading from all of them. What follows will be an test of the industry's claims to maturity. In recent years, similar, if more private, auctions were conducted around the country as grocery chains bid up superstore sites to ridiculous prices. The sums involved for Low are small and the penalty for overpaying would not be great. If bidding goes higher, the market may nevertheless attach more credit to the company that walks away than the one that wins.</p>

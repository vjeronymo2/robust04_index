			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Excerpt] All ruling parties held their meetings of  legislators today to decide to resume the deliberations on  political reform bills tomorrow in the House of Councilors and  affirm their plans to pass the bills during the current Diet  session.    [Begin recording of Social Democratic Party of Japan  Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama] The current Diet session has been extended to  29 January this year. The political reform bills should be  passed in the Diet by that date, and the most important task I  will have to accomplish is to have the bills passed in the Diet.  I believe it would be good if both ruling and opposition parties  find areas of agreement in revising the bills when they  deliberate them. The matters of principle, especially  corporation contributions, on which the ruling parties agreed  whey they formed the coalition government, cannot be subject to  deals between ruling and opposition parties. [end recording]    In this way, Chairman Murayama indicated that his party  would  not go along with any call for revising the prohibition in the  bills on the corporate contributions.    [Begin recording of Shinseito representative Tsutomu Hata]  After concluding that if Japan's politics remain unchanged as it  has been, Japan would be unable to fulfill its responsibility in  the international community, we have decided to reform even the  current electoral system as part of the political reform. Some  are arguing, however, that priority must be given to the  prevention of political corruption and stimulus measures. I  think the argument is ridiculous and out of the question. [end  recording]    [Begin recording of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa]  I hope that this year, we will achieve our long-standing goal of  carrying out political reform. This year, I will do my best and  work hard while refraining from making rash remarks. [laughs]  [end recording]    [Begin recording of Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is  attempting to collapse the political reform by boycotting the  deliberations of political reform bills in the Diet. I think  that we should fight against the LDP's attempt. [end recording]  [passage omitted on remarks by officials of other parties]</p>

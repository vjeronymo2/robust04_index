			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Treasury includes dissidents inpanel to advise on economy THE UK Treasury last night named three economics arch-dissidents in its panel of private sector forecasters which is to advise the government on the economy. In a development expected to lead to greater openness in UK economic policymaking, the panel is to include Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research. The three are among the Treasury's most severe critics of the past few years. Also on the panel will be Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, and Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the Confederation of British Industry. Prof Godley, who for 20 years has warned of structural problems in the UK economy resulting from the lack of a sufficiently competitive manufacturing sector, said: 'I am very grateful to be asked on to the panel. It is a generous act.' Prof Godley, who restarted formal forecasting just last year after a break of about eight years, was the only mainstream UK economist in the spring of last year to predict accurately that national output would decline both in 1991 and 1992. He wants the government to take immediate action to support manufacturing through further cuts in interest rates from 7 per cent to 5 per cent. He also wants a further devaluation of the pound by about 15 per cent, to add to the depreciation of roughly the same amount which has already taken place since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism. Prof Minford, a prominent monetarist economist, said: 'I am willing to give it (the panel) a try and see what happens.' Prof Minford, who wants the government to base future monetary policy on specific monetary targets, said he had had misgivings about being asked on to the panel but was willing to serve on it since he had been assured it would touch on policy matters. He and Prof Congdon are members of the Liverpool Six group of monetarist economists who since early last year have warned of the dangers of a deep recession and called for Britain to leave the ERM. The panel will meet three times a year and give Treasury officials a wide-ranging briefing about economic developments. The discussions will be be chaired by Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser. A report drawn up by Treasury staff on the meetings will be published soon afterwards, after having first been cleared by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The first meeting is expected to be in January or February. Profiles, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> REFERENDUM EFFORT ON ELECTIONS STALLS  </P> <P> A legal glitch has stalled the referendum efforts of a Tustin group trying to  overturn the City Council's decision to change local election dates.  </P> <P> The group has gathered more than 600 signatures for a referendum, but some  members, including leader Berklee Maughan, have stopped collecting signatures  after learning of potential legal problems with the referendum.  </P> <P> City Atty. James Rourke said last week that he would advise the council that  the referendum is not proper even if enough signatures are gathered.  </P> <P> Elections, he said, are not a proper topic for referendums. A spokesman for the  California secretary of state's office agreed with that opinion.  </P> <P> "The referendum has died," said Councilman John Kelly, who had supported the  effort. "I'm not going to collect any more signatures. All I can do is keep my  fingers crossed that the judge rules in our favor Jan. 17."  </P> <P> On that date a Superior Court judge is scheduled to hear a case brought last  month by Kelly and Councilman Earl J. Prescott challenging the legal residency  status of Ronald B. Hoesterey, who voted for the election-date change at his  last meeting before resigning.  </P> <P> If the judge rules in Kelly's and Prescott's favor, Hoesterey's vote, and hence  the decision to change election dates, could be ruled invalid.  </P> <P> Prescott is not waiting until then, however. He has asked Assemblywoman Doris  Allen to request an opinion on the referendum from the state legislative  counsel. That opinion is due Monday, he said. Until then, he is still  collecting signatures, which will be submitted as a petition if the referendum  is ruled invalid, he said.  </P> <P> "It isn't over until the fat lady sings, and in this case, that's the  legislative counsel opinion," Prescott said.

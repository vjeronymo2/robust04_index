			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Limits clarified on non-EU dentists / European Court In two rulings last week, the ECJ clarified the rights of establishment in the internal market of dentists who are member country nationals but who obtained qualifications outside the 12. In the first, the French Conseil d'Etat asked the ECJ to interpret the 1978 directive on mutual recognition of dentist qualifications. The minister of social affairs had refused on May 2 1986 to authorise Mr Abdullah Tawil-Albertini to practise as a dentist in France. The ECJ was asked to clarify whether the provisions of the directive requiring member countries to recognise certificates issued by another member country prior to the directive coming into force also applied to dental qualifications obtained in non-member countries recognised by a member as equivalent to its own. In 1968, Mr Tawil-Albertini obtained a Lebanese dental diploma. In 1979, before the mutual recognition directive, his diploma was recognised as equivalent and he was permitted to practise in Belgium, followed by the UK in 1980 and Ireland in 1986. Mr Tawil-Albertini argued his Lebanese qualification had been recognised as equivalent to another member country's and that he should benefit from the mutual recognition directive implemented in France from 1980. The ECJ said the directive (78/696) did not require member countries to recognise qualifications other than those based on training in another member. This was because mutual recognition was based on the guarantee provided by a second directive on co-ordination (78/687) that minimum training standards were satisfied. As an exception, qualifications obtained in a member country before implementation of the harmonised system must also be accepted by other member countries, provided a dentist has practised for three of the preceding five years. But this only covers qualifications issued by members. Although the directive permits a member country to authorise a dentist to practise in its territory with qualifications obtained in a non-member country, such recognition does not bind others. In the second case, the ECJ was asked by the Bundessozialgericht to interpret provisions in the recognition directive permitting specific training period requirements as a condition for registration as a dentist under national health insurance schemes and the Treaty prohibition of restrictions on the right of establishment. An Italian national, Mr Haim, had obtained a Turkish dental qualification in 1946. In 1981, he was recognised as a dentist in Germany and permitted to operate in private practice; in 1982, his Turkish diploma was recognised in Belgium as equivalent to a local qualification; and he worked for eight years registered under Belgium's national health system. But in 1988, his registration application under a German national health scheme was rejected as he had not completed two years training required by German law. He argued he was exempt because his Turkish qualification was recognised as equivalent to a qualification listed in the recognition directive. But the ECJ rejected his argument. It said the system of mutual recognition and co-ordination of qualifications was established over eight years from the date the member countries were notified of the 1978 directives. Only dentists with qualifications listed in the directive were exempt from any training period once the directive came into force. During the previous eight years, only dentists with qualifications issued by a member were subject to a reduced training period. When a dentist with non-EC qualifications but recognised by a member country had practised under the national health insurance scheme of another member country, Treaty rules on the right of establishment required the German authorities to take into account any relevant experience in deciding whether its practical training requirements had been satisfied. Without such verification, the prohibition of restrictions on the right of establishment precluded national authorities from refusing registration. C-154/93, A.

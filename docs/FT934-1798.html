			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Afrikaners and Zulus denounce new S Africa Afrikaners and the Zulus, South Africa's two most powerful ethnic groups, yesterday gathered at two 19th-century battlefields in Natal - site of their greatest military triumphs - to denounce the new South Africa and vow to resist it, with force if necessary. While the African National Congress staged a show of force in Soweto to mark the anniversary of the formation of its military wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), hundreds of miles away in Zululand the ANC's main rival, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, celebrated the victory of Zulus armed with spears and sticks over the military might of the British empire, in the 1879 battle of Isandlwana. Some 10,000 Zulus, almost all carrying the same weapons which humbled the British - the assegai (spear), knobkerrie (club) and shield - roared their approval as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini called on them to prepare for war. As the crowd bristled with menace, King Goodwill urged them to 'let the valour and the honour that led to the defeat of the British in this place in 1879, rise up to claim Zulu warriors' at the Zulu nation's darkest hour. 'Resist, I command you, resist, I implore you. We will not be ruled by a constitution we spurn. We will not be subjugated by a political party which wants to destroy us simply because it wants to rule,' he added, in a reference to the ANC. Some 50km away at Blood River, site of the legendary 1838 battle in which 470 Voortrekkers (Afrikaner pioneers) triumphed over 10,000 Zulus, the Afrikaner leader, retired Gen Constand Viljoen, used the anniversary to deliver a far less militant message. But he used the same imagery of darkness and danger to evoke the threat felt by Afrikaners. It was as though Zulus and Boers, the two groups who feel most threatened by the new South Africa, were making a symbolic retreat to the site of their greatest military victories to draw strength for the battle ahead. Addressing 1,500 people, few with obvious weapons, Gen Viljoen said 'the darkest hour of the darkest night' had descended on the Afrikaner nation. The Afrikaner must draw lessons from Blood River to avoid defeat, he said. The Voortrekkers had called on God to defend them, swearing a sacred vow to honour him if they were spared; their descendants should do the same. 'If you give us victory over the darkness which now faces us, we will renew and reaffirm that vow,' he said. Gen Viljoen believed battle could be averted. Not so Mr Eugene Terreblanche, leader of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), who told 3,000 supporters Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, wanted war, 'and he shall have it'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was the  guest of a conference of educators entitled "Education Toward  Peace," held in Jerusalem. Taking the opportunity to deliver a  message to Syria, the prime minister said the Syrians could have  prevented the incident in south Lebanon yesterday. Our  correspondent Ya'el Ben-Yehuda reports on Rabin's remarks:    [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister opened  his remarks by saying that it is hard to talk about peace on a  day when the bodies of four soldiers are being laid to rest.  His conscience as prime minister and as defense minister,  however, is clear, he said, because in addition to upholding  security, the government is trying to attain peace on a path  fraught with hardship and terror. He offered his condolences to  the bereaved families and sent his wishes for a speedy recovery  to the wounded.    The prime minister accused Hizballah of sabotaging peace and  held it responsible for the victims killed yesterday. He did  not absolve Syria either.    [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from  continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it  is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use  its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its  backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more  troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation  Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquillity  with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which  entails certain arrangements concerning security and some  guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating  alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in  this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would  expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building  measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us.    [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister was asked whether the  delegation currently in Cairo has a mandate to conclude issues.    [Rabin] The delegation headed by the foreign minister left  for Egypt to conduct negotiations in order to reach agreement on  key points in the implementation of the first phase of the  Declaration of Principles, to finalize certain points in the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I very much hope that an  agreement will be reached -- some progress was made in Davos --  but this will only be the nucleus for future negotiations on a  comprehensive agreement that includes all the elements enabling  the beginning of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement.    [Ben-Yehuda] The prime minister emphasized that one of  Israel's principles in the peace talks is that there will be no  uprooting of settlements. We will retain responsibility for  settlements, Israelis, and traffic in the territories. United  Jerusalem is outside the negotiations, the prime minister  stated. [end recording]</p>

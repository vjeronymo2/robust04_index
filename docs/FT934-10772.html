			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Sainsbury cuts spark price war: Food retailing shares fall as supermarket group announces reductions on 300 lines BRITAIN'S biggest food retailer J Sainsbury launched a supermarket price war yesterday as it disclosed that it was indefinitely cutting the price of 300 of its most popular own-label products - accounting for 10 per cent of its sales. The move is the most important evidence yet of a significant shift in UK retailing away from concentration on profit margins, towards offering lower prices to drive volumes higher. Shares in the food retailing sector were sharply lower, with brokers fearing escalating price competition would damage profits. Sainsbury itself fell 15p to 385p; Argyll, owner of Safeway, fell 18p to 274p; Tesco was down 4 1/2 p at 195p; and Asda fell 2 1/2 p to 50 1/4 p. Kwik Save, the leading discount chain, also fell 18p to 620p. The move came as Marks and Spencer announced a 21 per cent increase in interim profits after trimming gross margins and sharpening prices. Mr Bill Currie, analyst at BZW, who predicted Sainsbury's move, said the scope of the price cuts was bigger than expected. 'I think we are now in a price war,' he said. 'This turns the screw in a big way on the competition. They can either respond by cutting prices or they can lose sales.' Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said the move marked a long-term repositioning on price. 'It is more than just something we do for a three-month period. It (will) set the pattern for our future position in the market.' He said other leading food retailers had responded to mounting competition from discount chains such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and the UK's Kwik Save and Shoprite by focusing on price at the expense of quality. 'This provides us with a significant opportunity,' he said. 'Our response will be to press home our advantage by improving both price competitiveness and quality.' Mr Sainsbury refused to disclose the average size of the cuts or the reduction they would cause in gross margins. He said their effect on profits would depend on any increase in sales. TV and press advertisements with the slogan 'Sainsbury's - Essential for the Essentials' have been running since Sunday - a departure from the previous campaign featuring celebrities' recipes. The first price cuts were made on Sunday but their extent became apparent only yesterday, as Sainsbury announced record interim profits of Pounds 434m. Sainsbury's action will significantly step up the pressure on other superstores, with Safeway probably forced to follow suit. Analysts said Tesco, which introduced a cut-price 'Tesco Value' brand in August, and Asda, which has sharpened its prices, might be cushioned, but Safeway would probably be forced to follow suit. The biggest casualties are expected to be weaker chains such as Gateway, Waitrose, the Co-ops and independent grocers. The move comes a week after the UK's three biggest supermarket chains failed in a High Court battle to block the opening by US company Costco of the country's first warehouse club - which will sell a range of goods at very low prices to fee-paying members. Sainsbury said it would not appeal against the judgment.

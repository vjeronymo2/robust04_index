			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Crimean Minister of Finance Lyudmila </F> Zaytseva by Irina Karpenko; place and date not given: "Will  This Corner of Paradise Become Heaven on Earth? ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI's Observer Irina Karpenko Converses with Crimean Minister  of Finance Lyudmila Zaytseva"]    [Text] Crimea's president has issued an edict appointing  Lyudmila Zaytseva the republic's minister of finance. Lyudmila  Mikhaylovna is a mathematician by training, but has worked as a  professional economist for over 20 years. She participated in  the elaboration of the program of Russia's economic development.  Before her new appointment she was in charge of the Russian  Federation Government's Center for Information and Social  Technologies Sector for Financing the Non-Production Sphere.  She has written articles on topical problems for our newspaper,  and promised to give ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI her first interview as  minister of finance.    [Karpenko] This is nice, Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, you have kept  your promise. And a finance minister's promise carries quite  some weight. Congratulations on your appointment. But are you  not afraid? What is the Crimea's current financial and economic  situation? What is the status of the coupon, the ruble, and the  dollar?    [Zaytseva] As regards being afraid -- yes and no.... In for  a penny, in for a pound. Now that I have been appointed, there  is no point worrying about it, I have to get down to work. As  for the Crimea's financial and economic situation, it is the  same old story. Russia, Ukraine, and the Crimea all face the  same problems.    But it goes without saying that the Crimea's economic  situation is largely dependent on Ukraine's political and  economic course. This must be borne in mind, and so must the  fact that the majority of our enterprises are geared to either  delivering their output to Russia or purchasing components from  Russia. Thus, Russia's economic role in the Crimea is also  highly significant.    Turning to the coupon's rate of exchange against the ruble  and the dollar (and the coupon is now recognized as the sole  legitimate means of payment and is accepted without restrictions  throughout the Crimea), it is obvious that here too we are most  strongly dependent on Ukraine's policy. And the dollar's rate  of exchange in the Crimea is actually tied in with the  ruble-dollar rate of exchange.    [Karpenko] Does this mean that your hands are absolutely  tied as regards your own actions, and that the government's  original program for the Crimea's economic development would be  pointless? Would it not be simpler not to "rush in where angels  fear to tread" and cope with events as they develop?    [Zaytseva] No. The external conditions in which we exist  have to be taken into account, but this does not mean that we  will not pursue our own economic policy. We also have the legal  basis for this. An edict by the president of Ukraine in 1993  granted the republic the broadest powers in the sphere of  financial, budget, currency, and credit relations. This enables  us to transform shortcomings into assets and utilize the  Crimea's unique geographical and natural position and its  agricultural and industrial potential which must be made to work  efficiently for the Crimeans' benefit.    [Karpenko] So, how will your program differ from Ukraine's  program of sluggish reforms or from Russia's stunningly bogged  down reforms?    [Zaytseva] Of course, we are in a much more advantageous  position than those who launched their reforms in 1991.  Unfortunately, we are learning from mistakes. There is no  doubt that Russia's experience of reforms will be taken into  account. Even in the Crimea -- we are, after all, not starting  altogether from scratch -- market processes are already under  way. But the strength of the state's impact on economic  processes, and consequently the degree of the economy's  manageability, is much greater here than in Russia. This is a  more advantageous situation, and we must exploit it.    We are choosing a softer option of reforms. We will, without  any question, take into account the negative experience of the  taxation burden. Incidentally, taxes in Ukraine are much higher  than in Russia. Therefore, the first avenue of our economic  policy will be to reduce the tax burden and cut the amount of  taxes. We intend to increase budget revenue by increasing the  number of subjects of economic activity. The second, and  equally important, avenue is the social orientation of financial  policy. Thus, we have taken the risk of lifting restrictions on  the consumption fund. Such restrictions exist both in Ukraine  and in Russia. We in the Crimea have decided that there is no  need to impose restrictions on the wages fund. And this  principle has already been implemented.    [Karpenko] Are you not afraid that this might lead to higher  inflation?    [Zaytseva] The point is that the Crimeans' wages today are  very low -- 600,000 coupons on average (at the rate of 1 ruble  to 22 coupons), while food prices are only one-half of what they  are in Russia. If we continue along the path of curbing wages,  we will only aggravate the situation: Our Crimeans will be  simply unable to buy the output they themselves produce. And  this means that we will strangle our own agriculture and  industry with our own hands. Boosting the population's  purchasing power, and simply making people's life easier -- this  is one of the first steps. The bread and milk problem will also  have to be solved. Prices of these categories of produce have  hitherto been artificially held back in the republic. Subsidies  are already greater than costs. We appear to be helping the  Crimeans, bit at the same time we are also feeding all the  tourists, whose numbers in 1993 equaled those of the Crimea's  population. We cannot yet afford such generosity. Would it not  be better to cut the subsidies and channel the funds thus  released directly in the Crimean residents' pockets by raising  pensions, allowances, wages....    As regards the budget and inflation.... During the great  depression, U.S. President Roosevelt said that a balanced budget  is a crime against the people. I regret the fact that the  Crimea does not have the power to issue its own currency. A  deficit-free budget must not be a dogma. Inflation will be  pumped across to us from the mainland -- from Ukraine, from  Russia. Imagine a tiny ship in a stormy sea. How can the  ship's helmsman influence the elements, does the strength of the  wind or the height of the waves depend on him? We can only sail  with the wind, steer the ship so as to eventually reach the  promised shore.    [Karpenko] Nonetheless, you are probably feeling the  temptations facing all financiers: Cut the budget deficit and  solve the most acute production problems by harsh savings in the  so-called budget-funded sphere, in other words at the expense of  science, culture, education....    [Zaytseva] There can be no argument: The expenditure of  state funds must be very strictly monitored. But savings for  savings' sake -- in other words cutbacks in the financing of  science, culture, education, health care -- this is a policy  which has no right to exist. But the whole point is that it is  impossible to look at only one aspect of the problem. After  all, if we leave the situation as it is today and budget  revenues are reduced, we will have to reduce budget  appropriations. Therefore, there is only one way out: Channel  all our efforts into ensuring a boost of the economy, which will  lead to an inflow of budget appropriations. The temptation will  simply vanish then.    [Karpenko] But life is life.... Which of the factors  capable of hindering Crimea's successful reform do you consider  to be the most dangerous: The political ones, or Ukraine's  dispute with Russia over the Black Sea Fleet, or the criminal  forces?    [Zaytseva] I hope that we will have normal relations with  the Ukrainian authorities. Speaking about the domestic  situation, I cannot yet see any serious forces which would not  be interested in improving the Crimea's economic situation.    Of course we are worried about the Black Sea Fleet's future,  but this question must be resolved in a civilized manner. Both  Russia and Ukraine will have to pay the Crimea for the  deployment of military installations since, under the law on the  delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea, the land  is the republic's property. The Crimean budget was supplemented  from this source in 1991, even though to an insignificant  extent. In 1992, on the Crimean Supreme Council's initiative,  military units were granted preferential treatment until 1  January 1994. But the deadline has expired and no payments have  been received. Thus, this issue will have to be revisited.    There is something else that is worrying: As a result of  Ukraine's harsh economic measures, and for self-preservation's  sake, a series of our enterprises were forced to seek roundabout  ways to, for example, "modify" the coupon's extremely low rate  of exchange against the ruble and the dollar. We ought to make  sure that nonpayment of taxes and the utilization of semilegal  structures become more disadvantageous and dangerous than  conducting business honestly.    [Karpenko] The Crimea has always been perceived as a corner  of paradise, and was dubbed a sanatorium in Soviet times. Could  the Crimea's recreational facilities yield high revenues?    [Zaytseva] Very high. This is how it should be, but so far  this contribution is far below what is desirable. It is our  strategic goal to substantially increase it. Of course, this  needs political stability in the first place. I would like to  take advantage of this occasion and say that the political  situation in our country is calm now, any comparisons of the  Crimea with Karabakh or the Dniester Region are totally out of  order -- there is no need to scare people off. Therefore, be  not afraid to come on vacation to the Crimea.    Unfortunately, by no means all people in Ukraine or Russia  can afford such a trip. Thus, we are vitally interested in  seeing that all people in Ukraine, in Russia, and in all other  CIS countries live in peace and tranquility, but primarily the  Crimeans....    [Karpenko] Does all you have said mean that it is still  possible to build a more or less prosperous life in a given  region on its own?    [Zaytseva] We hope so. Provided the politicians and the  powers that be do not mess things up.... We all should act with  greater wisdom.</p>

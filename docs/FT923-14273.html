			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / British Airways discusses partnership with USAir NEGOTIATIONS between British Airways and USAir to form a transatlantic airline partnership appear to be nearing a conclusion,airline industry officials said yesterday. If successful, a deal would achieve BA's long-term aim of linking with a large US carrier to strengthen international competitiveness and increase penetration of the US market. If completed, the two partners are expected to consider acquiring assets from Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn. Both BA and USAir declined to comment yesterday, but sources in the US suggested that the two airlines had been due to meet ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend and decide whether to proceed with negotiations. Since then, the talks are understood to have continued. Other European airline industry sources suggested yesterday that a deal could be imminent. Questions about the proposed link-up with USAir are expected to be raised by BA shareholders at the UK airline's annual meeting on Tuesday. TWA confirmed last week that it was discussing an important sale of assets to USAir. But it appears that both BA and USAir are seeking to complete a deal between them before considering the purchase of TWA assets. Analysts believe USAir is seeking a substantial capital injection from BA as part of any deal, to help reduce its Dollars 2bn debts. BA, which reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 285m for the year ending March 1992, has long sought to invest in an American carrier. It came close to a deal with United Airlines three years ago. The apparent progress in the talks with USAir may have been influenced by proposed changes in US aviation policy to allow more 'open skies' for foreign carriers within the US. USAir, the sixth-largest US domestic carrier in terms of revenue passenger miles flown, recently said it had two international marketing objectives: to continue to add international service from its US hubs and to develop strong partnerships with international carriers. The carrier has made after-tax losses of about Dollars 760m during the past two years. However, there have been management changes and attempts to cut costs. A partnership with USAir would give BA a US feed into its international routes. One attraction of USAir is its strong domestic network, focused in the eastern US where most European travel originates. BA would also gain wider access in the US if the two airlines were to conclude an asset purchase deal with TWA.</p>

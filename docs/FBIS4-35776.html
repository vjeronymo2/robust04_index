			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arab League today declared its backing for the  UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution that calls for an  immediate cease-fire in Yemen, for solving inter-Yemeni disputes  peacefully, and for restoring peace and stability in that  country.    The League said that Yemeni unity, which represents national  interests and pan-Arab achievements, must be preserved. It  announced, however, that unity cannot be imposed by force.    The League issued a new appeal to the Yemeni parties to  hasten to end the tragedy in their country, as the victims are  none other than the sons of the fraternal Yemeni people.</p>

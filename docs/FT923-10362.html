			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Tribal tensions undermine Kenyan opposition party KENYA'S main opposition party has been weakened by a bitter power struggle which could boost the electoral chances of President Daniel arap Moi. The rift in the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) is so severe that yesterday Mr Maside Muliro, the interim vice-chairman, alleged 'the two camps have armed themselves to the teeth to do battle with each other'. Privately, many senior Ford officials say the split, ostensibly over internal party elections, is irreparable and a formal division is possible. Behind the issue of the party's elections lie tribal divisions and a power struggle between Mr Kenneth Matiba, a presidential aspirant who is a Kikuyu, and Mr Oginga Odinga, another presidential aspirant who is interim chairman of Ford and a Luo. Party officials say the bickering between the two factions has played into Mr Moi's hands to the extent that Ford's early popularity has waned and Mr Moi could win a snap election. Mr Moi has the right to call the country's first multi-party elections in more than two decades any time before the end of parliament's five-year term next March. Political observers in Nairobi believe an election in September or October is possible. Crisis talks appeared to be under way yesterday to resolve the rift, which emerged publicly on Tuesday when five Ford executive committee members called for the postponement of the party's internal elections, which are due to begin tomorrow. They said Ford was ill prepared to conduct free and fair internal elections. Mr Odinga and his faction said the elections should go ahead. Mr Matiba believes that as a hero of the pro-democracy movement, he deserves the presidency. Mr Odinga's group say that the country is not ready for another Kikuyu president (former President Jomo Kenyatta was a Kikuyu) and that Mr Matiba is not well enough since suffering a stroke as a result of his long detention by Mr Moi.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cook previews policy launch - Health MR ROBIN COOK, shadow health secretary, said yesterday that a Labour government would restore an integrated local health service. He said in a preview of today's relaunch of the party's health policies that Labour would develop a system in which hospitals could 'co-ordinate' their activities rather than compete against one another for business. The new regime would require managers who 'see things from a patient's perspective'. Mr Cook told a gathering of political journalists that Labour would set up local health councils with a 'clear obligation' to provide local services. 'We will be seeking to put the same stress on quality as this government has on quantity,' he said. Mr Cook pledged a more onerous burden of 'service sampling' on National Health Service managers, who would be expected to assess the efficiency of public transport and the quality of hospital meals. He said he had been 'gobsmacked' at the recent increase in prescription charges. Labour's private weekend polling had indicated the rise was the second most important reason why voters were turning away from the Tories. The government may authorise the spending of Pounds 1m for NHS patients to be treated in private-sector hospitals in an to reduce waiting lists, it was reported last night.

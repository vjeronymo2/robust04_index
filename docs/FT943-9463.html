			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Fishermen angry at Navy action Cornish fishermen complained yesterday that the Royal Navy was harassing British trawlers fishing for tuna in the Bay of Biscay instead of protecting them from the Spanish. The attack came as agriculture ministry officials said they were still considering whether to take legal action against the Charisma, a Cornish trawler, which was found at the weekend to have broken European Union rules on the length of its driftnet. Fisheries protection vessels from the Navy have confiscated the Charisma's nets and have also issued a caution to another boat, the Alice Louise, which was alleged to have exceeded the legal net length of 2.5km. Charisma's nets were found to have exceeded the limit by 160 metres. Fishermen's representatives claimed this was within a 5 per cent to 10 per cent allowance for stretching at sea. However a ministry official said this was a 'fallacy' and legal action which could result in a fine was still being considered. An agriculture ministry official said the Alice Louise's nets, which had been measured at sea by European Commission inspectors, were measured again by British inspectors and found to be over the limit. The skipper was cautioned. The Alice Louise yesterday set out for the Bay of Biscay. Yesterday the French navy ordered a French vessel back to Brest for allegedly using illegal nets. Spanish fishermen had complained to EU inspectors that three French boats were exceeding the net limits. Mr Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for Cornwall North, told BBC radio: 'The suspicion among Cornish fishermen, and rightly so I believe, is that the ministry is not operating on our behalf but appears to be acting as the watchdogs of the Spanish government.'</p>

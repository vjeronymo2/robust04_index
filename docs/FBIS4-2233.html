			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Federation  Council today vetoed President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to  confirm the removal of Procurator-General Alexey Kazannik from  office for his implementation of the State Duma's February  amnesty.    After a 50-minute debate, the Council (upper house of  parliament) rejected the president's suggestion by a vote of 61  to 57, with 4 abstentions.    Kazannik, who had been an enthusiastic supporter of Yeltsin,  was appointed procurator-general soon after the October 1993  confrontation between Yeltsin and parliament.    On February 26, the State Duma (lower house of parliament)  adopted a resolution to grant amnesty to organizers of the 1991  "August 19 event" and those leaders arrested after the October  1993 bloodshed.    The amnesty question posed a dilemma for Kazannik. According  to the state constitution, as procurator-general he was  obligated to carry out the legislature's decision; at the same  time the president tried to prevent him from doing so.    Shortly after the amnesty was implemented, Kazannik tendered  his resignation to Yeltsin and it was accepted.    Yeltsin also asked parliament to approve his suggestion that  Alexey Ilyushenko, director of the monitoring bureau of the  presidential office, be named acting procurator-general before  formal confirmation by parliament.    However, the parliament did not want Kazannik to resign,  while Yeltsin insisted that he go.    After the veto, Presidential Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov  stressed that the post of procurator-general should not be  vacant and the existence of two procurators-general would not be  allowed.    Presidential Parliamentary Representative Alexandr Yakovlev  today said that he expects the upper house to review its veto  decision.    Observers here believe that the ongoing controversy over a  candidate for the position of procurator-general mirrors the  complexity of current Russian politics.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Latest Set of Economic </F> Edicts Signed"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin has signed the latest set of economic  edicts. Three of them are devoted to problems of housing  construction. In addition, he has also signed the edicts "On  Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest Advertizing," "On  Improving the Work of the Russian Federation Banking System,"  "On Some Measures to Encourage Investment Activity, Including by  Attracting Foreign Credits," and "On Some Measures to Ensure  State Management of the Economy."    Yeltsin's lawmaking activity is due to two factors, in the  opinion of observers. First, the president is concerned at the  slow progress of the reforms. Second, he has been forced to  take some steps to compensate for the Duma's inactivity.    Whereas the first set of edicts, signed at the end of May,  was prepared exclusively by government experts, the latter  documents are the work of government economists collaborating  with their colleagues from the president's team. All the  documents have been presented for signature on the government's  behalf.    In the opinion of Deputy Economy Minister Sergey Vasilyev,  one of the authors of the edicts, the package of housing edicts  occupies a special place. These are norm-setting documents,  which prescribe incentives for the process of housing  construction. They deal with the rules for the sale of  unfinished apartment blocks and the provision of incentives for  the creation of savings for housing. And in particular on the  enshrinement of housing certificates in law.    During the preparation of the documents it was the edict on  improving the banking system which sparked off the stormiest  debates. This edict, in fact, stipulates the extent to which  foreign banks are allowed to penetrate the Russian market.  Russian commercial banks showed tremendous interest in this  document. As IZVESTIYA has learned, the text of the edict was  reworked after the president's press conference, where he firmly  advocated that foreign banks be allowed access to the Russian  market.    The edict "On Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest  Advertising" can begin working effectively as soon as a number  of amendments have been made to the existing legislation. These  amendments will regulate the work of the mass media and the  advertisers. Meanwhile, this edict already makes it possible to  apply fairly tough sanctions to advertisers themselves, even to  the point of withholding their license.    In addition, restrictions are being placed on the ability of  unlicensed organizations to attract funds from the population.  At the moment only banks, insurance companies, and pension  funds, on the one hand, and joint-stock companies, on the other,  are allowed to do that. Their activity is regulated in the  following way: There are restrictions on the ratio of outside  resources and firms' own resources and there is also a  prescription that a balance and the main technical-economic  parameters must be published in the press. Before trying to  persuade the population to subscribe money to a loan,  joint-stock companies will have to declare their anticipated  profit.    The edict "On Some Measures to Ensure State Management of  the  Economy" ought to have been adopted long ago. Essentially, the  edict is designed to put an end to the absurd situation at  present in which a director can dispose of an enterprise  entirely as though it were his property but without bearing the  slightest responsibility to the actual owner, the state, which  can neither dismiss nor punish a negligent manager.    Mutual relations between the state and the director will  henceforth be regulated not by labor law but by civil law. A  contract will be concluded with a director for the right to  manage an enterprise, the form of which is stipulated by the  edict. The contract may be cancelled if the accords are not  observed.</p>

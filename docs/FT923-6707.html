			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Ugly scrum in South Africa: A symbolic battle for political power at the rugby ground Strange as it may seem for the land that invented apartheid, racial hatred seldom darkens a normal day in Johannesburg. But these are not normal times in South Africa. A raw battle for political power is under way, and the battlefield stretches from township street to rugby stadium. Thousands of rugby-mad whites at Cape Town's Newlands stadium will today have a chance to show whether they value the country's sense of interracial goodwill which has for so long defied the logic of apartheid - but which is under serious strain. They will be called upon to stand and observe a minute's silence for the victims of South Africa's political violence - almost all of them black. The occasion will be white South Africa's chance to demonstrate a spirit of reconciliation. Such gestures have become rare in recent months, whether from average citizens or from political leaders, white and black. The prospects for peace and progress in South Africa will partly depend on the rugby crowd's behaviour. The omens of the past week are not favourable, however. Last Saturday, when South Africa's rugby side met New Zealand's All Blacks, white fans defiled the sporting atmosphere with a loud and emotional rendering of the South African national anthem, a potent symbol of Afrikaner nationalism and for blacks, the ultimate token of apartheid. One liberal spectator tried to convey the ugly tone of the incident: 'People who didn't even know much Afrikaans (the language in which die Stem is written), who had certainly never sung it before, were singing so loud that the veins were standing out on their foreheads.' In the emotionally charged atmosphere of South Africa's first international rugby match for eight years - a match made possible by the anti-apartheid movement's decision to drop sport sanctions against Pretoria - some local newspapers commented that the incident had amounted to an obscene gesture directed at the new multi-racial South Africa. 'The very first chance we get to demonstrate new attitudes, to make some gesture towards reconciliation, we succeed only in showing ugly intransigence,' commented a shamed spectator in the weekly Financial Mail. But the incident reflected more than racial intolerance. It demonstrated an explosive anger among whites at their new and unaccustomed sense of powerlessness in the face of black political power. After 350 years as the dominant race, whites at the Ellis Park stadium found they had to accept restrictions by blacks, in the form of the African National Congress (ANC), which had banned the official display of national symbols, such as flags and anthems, at the match. Their response was defiance - they waved thousands of small flags, and twice spontaneously sang the national anthem, die Stem. It was also played officially, an act of defiance from a renegade rugby administrator. The message from Ellis Park was clear - whites may have voted to abolish apartheid in this year's referendum, but they did not vote for black rule. Ellis Park became just one more battlefield in the contest for power in the new South Africa - a chilling expression of ethnicity which both sides ignore at their peril. That contest, which has led to the breakdown of constitutional talks over the issue of black majority rule versus multi-racial power sharing, sparked a two-day general strike earlier this month and widespread labour disruption. It has left 7,000 dead in black townships since 1990, and has also taken a heavy toll on the country's morale. Immigration lawyers from Australia have found it fruitful to visit Johannesburg again, as white confidence plumbs new depths and professionals plan their escape from a troubled multi-racial future. 'Planning to emigrate?' asks the cheerful voice of the local radio announcer, ready with advice on international removals companies. Business, too, is fed up with political failure at the highest levels, and is casting around for its own separate peace with the unions to permit economic life to go on. Indeed, this month's general strike was nearly averted by a deal between the employers' body, Saccola, and the largest union federation, Cosatu. It involved agreement on a one-day work stoppage and on issues such as training and job creation. The accord failed in the end, but could be revived in future. Businessmen acknowledge such a deal would be largely a stop-gap measure. Business and the unions, on their own, cannot bring growth to an economy more troubled than at any time in recent memory. Real per capita GDP is expected to have shrunk by 9 per cent between 1990 and 1992, according to the Old Mutual, one of the country's leading insurers. Nothing short of a political deal can attract the investment needed for significant economic expansion. Such a deal - either involving agreement on a multi-racial interim government to restore order or a more comprehensive constitutional settlement yielding multi-party democracy - has so far proved elusive. Yesterday's news of a meeting between government and ANC officials is at best only a step to the resumption of talks. Both Mr FW de Klerk, the president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, his ANC counterpart, have repeatedly failed to rise above partisan political concerns in the interest of a broader national agenda. Indeed, Mr de Klerk seems to believe that strengthening his National Party serves the national interest by ensuring a powerful opposition to black majority rule. He also continues to prove unable or unwilling to take sufficiently strong action against his security forces. Both men should take note. Most blacks are fed up with the violence and poverty which for black South Africans are the most salient facts of life after apartheid. They are unlikely to support the open-ended campaign of mass action favoured by ANC radicals. Whites, meanwhile, are at best despondent, at worst angry. South Africa needs a deal soon to restore at least a measure of stability. The country's leaders may find that, if they miss this opportunity for peace, another may not open up for some time.</p>

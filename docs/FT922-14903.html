			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Bookmakers laugh all the way to the poll SNUG AS BUGS in silk-lined counting-houses, the bookmakers are coining money hand-over-fist on the UK election. With the polls still close, the big three bookmaking companies - Ladbroke, Coral, William Hill - are forecasting a record national election turnover of Pounds 6m. There would be a second bonanza if a hung parliament were to cause a fresh election. The mystery is why anybody bets in the face of gruesomely cramped odds and UK betting tax. In earlier times, bookies used to make sophisticated claims for election betting - arguing that it was an investment instrument whereby voters worried by electoral trends could hedge their bets. This week, no such claims were heard. Election betting is now a workaday sub-division of 'sports betting' - snooker, golf, soccer, etc  - whose growth is a counterweight to the slowdown in horse and greyhound betting. Few punters will grow rich on the election. Yesterday Ladbroke, the market leader, was offering odds of 4/9 (stake 9 to win four) on Labour winning most seats, 6/4 on the Conservatives, and 400/1 the Liberal Democrats. Its odds on a hung parliament were evens, while it quoted 6/4 on Labour winning an overall majority and 4/1 on the Tories doing likewise. Labour's odds have shortened dramatically in response to the latest polls. William Hill said: 'This looks like the turning point of the campaign.' 'The Tories have got a mountain to climb if these polls are to be believed.' In truth, the bookies' election odds have nothing to do with psephology, or even reality. They reflect only one thing: the weight of money cascading into the counting-houses. The other beneficiary of election betting will be whoever forms the next government, for the Treasury will collect a windfall - probably more than Pounds 1m - in betting tax. Someone who wagered Pounds 100 with Ladbroke yesterday on Labour winning most seats was risking Pounds 100 to profit by Pounds 44.44 at odds of 4/9. But bookmakers are able to deduct 10 per cent from winnings and stakes, to cover betting tax. So even if Labour wins, the person who bet Pounds 100 yesterday at 4/9 will pay tax of Pounds 14.44, reducing his winnings by 32.5 per cent to Pounds 30. Alternatively, he could elect to pay tax in advance, but only on his stake. If the bet is lost, then his Pounds 10 is forfeited as well as his Pounds 100. Sounds crazy? However eccentric it sounds, some large bets have been struck on Labour. For example, a client of William Hill, a Brighton restaurant owner, has bet Pounds 18,000 on Labour to win just under Pounds 40,000. Over the past two years, the client placed 11 bets on Labour of Pounds 1,000-Pounds 2,750 at average odds of a little under 2.22 to 1. That man was brighter than most pundits and political columnists. But what about the people accepting William Hill's current odds of only 200/1 on the Liberal Democrats winning most seats? Weren't they being robbed given that the true odds against such an outcome were almost certainly in excess of 1m/1? William Hill was unctuous: 'Our current liability on the Lib Dems is more than Pounds 500,000. If they win, that's what we'd have to pay out, so we can't afford to be clever. The Lib Dems have been out to 500/1, but every time we push the price out, the punters come nibbling. There is a man in Edgware, apparently, telling everyone to back the Lib Dems and then go and vote for them. We have got to be careful.'</p>

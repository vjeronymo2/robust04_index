			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 11 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister  Jozef Moravcik said today he did not believe that his  participation in the creation of an alternative within the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) should be a reason for  his resignation as Prime Minister and HZDS Leader Vladimir  Meciar hinted.    "I do not think that I have breached the HZDS principles....  One thing is the prime minister's opinion, the HZDS's opinion  is another thing. We should distinguish between them," Moravcik  told CTK.    He said that further developments depended on tomorrow's  session of the HZDS leadership, which would decide whether the  alternative was acceptable within the movement.    The Alternative of Political Realism was set up by Moravcik,  Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and ten HZDS parliamentarians  on Thursday [10 February].    "Every democratically functioning organization must respect  the principle of protection of a minority opinion. Even if we  do not succeed, this does not mean that we should not be active.  More clear conclusions will be reached at the (March) HZDS  assembly," Moravcik said.    "The movement must unequivocally target certain strata of  the  population, else it will be pushed aside by other political  parties," Moravcik said. "The middle of the political spectrum  is the place which corresponds to the HZDS's goals --  liberal-social orientation," he added.    Moravcik admitted that the alternative, which started to be  created several weeks ago, had negotiated with the opposition.  "We did not make any binding statements because we were not  entitled to. But we must communicate with members of other  parties, this is nothing abnormal, we need to know the political  scene." But he did not say with whom the alternative had  negotiated.    Moravcik said he considered a government formed along with  opposition parties, but without political tops, "an optimum  solution" to the political crisis before early elections, which  he said were "necessary," were held. Moravcik said the most  suitable date for the elections was the spring of 1995.</p>

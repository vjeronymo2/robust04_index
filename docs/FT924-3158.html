			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BTP hits Pounds 10m with help from purchases BTP, the speciality chemicals company, increased pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to September 30 with the help of contributions from two French acquisitions. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said continental Europe accounted for 33 per cent of group sales compared with 24 per cent in the same period of last year. First-half turnover rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 99m. The new adhesives companies joined the chemical division, adding about Pounds 700,000 to operating profit of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.23m). The division had sales of Pounds 55m (Pounds 41.5m). Most of the Pounds 6.3m capital spending went to the biocides division, which saw profits slip to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.04m). Sales rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.6m). Mr Buckley said the most important growth trend lay in the switch from solvent-based to water-based materials, such as adhesives and paints. A new factory near Blackburn would next year start producing a bug-killing ingredient for the water-based products. On the industrial side, the mainly UK profit declined to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 2.15m) on sales of Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 25.3m). About 70 per cent of the sales were accounted for by the fall-arrest, safety equipment business, which was still growing. Another part of the division was being sold. A small amount of interest was received compared with Pounds 602,000 charges in the first half of last year. The Pounds 6.5m cash held in March turned into Pounds 767,000 net debt after a bulge in capital spending to build the new factory. Earnings slipped to 6.96p (7.1p) but the interim dividend goes up to 3.25p (3.1p). COMMENT Nervousness about BTP's resilience caused the shares to underperform the market by more than 20 per cent since June. These results breathed relief into sentiment and the price gained 11p to close at 218p. The two thirds of sales outside the UK have limited recessionary damage so far, although the continental businesses are expected to face tougher conditions. Once again the group has integrated acquisitions well and next year the biocides factory promises to inject more organic growth. Annual pre-tax profit is forecast to rise from Pounds 18.2m to about Pounds 21m, although earnings would do well to top last year's 14.81p - leaving this line a bit droopy since 1990-91. While a prospective multiple of 15 looks fair, there may be a bit more post-results applause. On a longer time scale, the company has a neat trick of converting froth into paper for acquisitions. With a smooth hand-over under way between Mr Buckley and his heir apparent, there seems little to unsettle the BTP fan club.</p>

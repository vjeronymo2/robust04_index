			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: Cash and Costello - Popular music The big man in black with the voice of a Fisherman's Friend says: 'Hello, I'm Johnny Cash', It is a joke, of course. The Godfather of country music has been on stage for around half an hour already at the Shepherds Bush Empire, and no one this side of senility is going to mistake him for for Garth Brooks, Dwight Yoakam or any of the new generation of stetson super-stars. After 40 years in the game, a Cash concert is inevitably a series of myths and rituals. The biggest one of all is that the hero is a touchstone of survival, a man who popped a million pills, drained ten million bottles, played around with women and the law, only to stumble on God at the last chance saloon and win through. We like the legend, even if we know that Cash's criminal act was no more dastardly than plucking a few off-limits flowers, and that he has spent almost 30 years safely married into Country Music's Royal Family, the Carters. And it helps us to enjoy more a reflective musical commentary on his fantasy life in songs about shootings, prison, moving on, and bumming through. The fact is that Cash's brooding bulk and hickory tinged voice make the songs ring true. They might be the short, superficial, 1950s Family Favourites but in his hands they become life. He starts with 'Folsom Prison Blues' and you are there in a cell listening to the freight train whistle past. 'Sunday morning coming down' is the saddest commentary on a no-hoper's weekend drinking spree. And just when the child-like superficiality of 'Ghostriders in the Sky' and 'Walk the Line' start to cloy Cash changes tack, going genuinely confessional with a solo set of fresh material, of heart-baring songs written by that other successful outsider, Leonard Cohen, and the supremely oddball Loudon Wainright III. With the new album plugged June Carter Cash, as buxom and leggy as any Southern matron, casually let drop two knock out family facts. Not only is Mrs Cash's mother a direct descendant of a British Prime Minister (OK, it was the totally forgotten Lord Addington) but that she is currently appearing on the new 20 cent US stamp. June's strident Carter voice does not always gel with Johnny's resounding bass on duets like 'It Ain't Me Babe' but they are a touching sight, and make the concert as uplifting and redemptive as the revivalist gathering underway across the road. The Seventh Day Adventists had one advantage: they were not subjected to the most embarrassing song ever performed by a great artist, 'A boy named Sue'. Only Cash could sing it and survive. Another more newly minted pop icon with an album to plug was in town this week: Elvis Costello. He held a mini residency at the Royal Albert Hall, a suitably establishment venue for the man who raised the intellectual profile of punk. Little has changed in the decade since he last took on London: the flirtation with country music, and the US, seems well over. He was even reunited with his original band, the Attractions, a trio of barnstorming thumpers. Costello's new songs may be crypto-punk in style but they run into the difficulty faced by all established stars: an exhaustion of ideas. Happily protected from emotional turmoil, Costello lacks the map to return to the political and social abuses he attacked in his early songs. 'London's Brilliant Parade' is hardly going to start the revolution. The fluency of his playing, guitar still pointed resolutely earthwards, voice as challengingly bitter as ever, is subverted by the incessant speed and noise. The lyrics are swallowed, which is a pity on songs like 'Shipbuilding', Costello's slant on the Falklands War. A strangely positioned sound system did not help the audience seated at the sides. But if the overall effect was like cowering before a hurricane of unstructured indignation, there was also the pleasure of an invigorating shock. And Costello relents near the end. 'Alison' is an enjoyably lucid relief, with its chilling, put down, lyrics, and 'Accidents will happen' still tumbles over itself towards genius. But Costello, nudging 40, was too much the frantic scatter gun, desperate to prove a point. The arena had been cleared of seats for the Proms but the audience was slow to pogo: a blistering indictment of his performance. This was somehow the great occasion that failed to happen.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Eurodollar latest to delay issue as shares fall This week's fall in share prices has created further turmoil in the new issue market, with Eurodollar postponing its Pounds 100m flotation and a number of smaller issues being pulled. Eurodollar, the UK's second-largest car rental company, had planned to issue its prospectus and pricing details today. But the group, the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year, said that 'in the light of market conditions, it would be appropriate to delay impact day for a short period'. The company emphasised that the flotation had been postponed rather than abandoned and said that book-building with institutional investors was continuing. Eurodollar follows British Printing Company, which recently postponed its Pounds 250m stock market debut. Other casualties include property group London Capital Holdings and three cable companies. But it is smaller companies that have proved most vulnerable to the market downturn. Yesterday the planned Pounds 13.5m flotation of bingo halls group Jasmine was called off. The float, which was being handled by Greig Middleton, was already falling behind schedule and the company said that Monday's stock market slump had 'put the kibosh' on its plans. The company was a management buy-out from Rank and hoped to raise money to pay off the buy-out debt. Pegson, a construction equipment maker, has also postponed its plans for a placing through Granville Davies, which would have valued it at around Pounds 12m. Advisers to Universal Ceramic Materials, whose flotation price was due to be announced on Thursday, were in meetings last night. But, apart from Eurodollar, the larger companies that are in the final run-up to flotation are sticking to their schedules. Exco, the money broker hoping to float with a Pounds 220m valuation, is still looking to price its shares next week. Mr Simon Linnett of sponsors N M Rothschild said: 'We are reasonably confident that everything will proceed according to plan. The reception from institutions has been very good and, as 3i has shown, there is still an appetite for quality new issues.' Pillar Property Investment also confirmed the timetable for its Pounds 175m flotation.</p>

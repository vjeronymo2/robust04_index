The Armenian  government's press-service told SNARK the explosion took place  in the Marneuli region of Georgia, mainly inhabited by  Azerbaijanis. The Armenian specialists have already left for the  accident's place.    Meanwhile, it is reported that a day before the explosion  the  Georgian government had blocked the gas entrance to Armenia,  motivating it by a scanty amount of gas entering Georgia.  During the last two years about 15 sabotage acts were committed  on this pipeline. Despite numerous appeals of Armenian  officials, the Georgian government doesn't provide with the safe  guarding of the pipeline.</p>

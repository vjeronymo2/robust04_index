			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Periods (Peaches)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first interim final rule amended paragraph (a) in &sect;917.442 and paragraph (a) in &sect;917.459 to change the regulatory periods in each of these sections to April 1 through November 23 each year, so that all peach shipments made each season are covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (b) of &sect;917.459 was revised to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh peaches during the April 1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The PCC unanimously recommended this change. Prior to amendment, &sect;&sect;917.442 and 917.459 were effective for the period April 15 through November 23 each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Container and Pack Requirements (Peaches)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound sample for each tray pack size designation. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;917.442 by modifying Table I to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and by adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCC recommended these revised container marking requirements for peaches after a comprehensive review of the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled containers for all peach varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different varieties of fruit during the course of the season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first interim final rule also revised &sect;917.442 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (d) as (e) and by adding a new paragraph (d) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure to be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirement. Under this procedure a sample consisting of one-half of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets the minimum size requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of peaches could be adequately determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce inspection time and inspection costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second interim final rule further revised &sect;917.442 by adding a new proviso to paragraph (a)(1) specifying that the peaches in any volume-filled container need only be filled to within one inch of the top of the container. The PCC recommended these revised pack requirements for fresh peaches in volume-filled containers after a comprehensive review of changes in the peach industry packing practices over the years, and the need to make appropriate changes in the pack requirements to reduce bruising of the fruit due to excessively tight packs. The revision provided handlers with more flexibility in packing their peaches and selecting the appropriate size container for certain volume-filled packs to help prevent fruit bruising.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Grade Requirements (Peaches)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 917.459 specifies grade requirements for peaches in paragraph (a)(1), requiring peaches shipped fresh to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade. The first interim final rule revised paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.459 to provide an additional 25 percent tolerance for fruit damaged by open sutures, but not seriously damaged, in addition to the 10 percent general lot tolerance currently permitted under the U.S. No. 1 grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PCC recommended this change to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. Open sutures are not considered to be a serious grade defect since they affect only the appearance of the fruit. The open suture condition occurs infrequently in peaches and is most likely due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. However, this condition can cause considerable economic loss to growers when it does occur, because it sometimes affects a large portion of their crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

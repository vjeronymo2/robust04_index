			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Showdown at the palazzo: Rifts at the world's oldest bank The whiff of scandal has penetrated the thick stone walls of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world's oldest bank. In five centuries of lending, through the bloody wars between the city states of Florence and Siena and the unification of Italy, its reputation has never faced such attack. Two members of its board were arrested earlier this year after allegedly receiving kickbacks for granting loans. They have been bailed pending trial. Soon afterwards, Mr Carlo Zini, managing director, stepped down, after being told by magistrates that he was under investigation on similar allegations. The inquiries - against the background of Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal - caused a tremor along the Gothic corridors of Monte dei Paschi. Located in a fortress-like palazzo and founded in 1472, it is Italy's second biggest banking group after Banca di Roma in terms of branches. At stake are more than Monte dei Paschi's image and the careers of a few individuals. Concerns prompted by Italy's corruption scandals will also have an impact on a long-running debate in Siena: whether to break the shackles which have bound the bank and city council for centuries. There is no suggestion that the council has been involved in corruption. But investigations across Italy into links between politicians and business could tip the balance in a debate about whether Monte dei Paschi has to change to compete in Italy's increasingly aggressive banking sector. With the Italian government keen to encourage competition, Monte dei Paschi's structure, which dates from its origins as Siena's municipal pawnshop, was looking outdated even before Italy's corruption scandals erupted. Controlled by the city council via a charitable foundation, the bank has neither the freedom of a quoted company to raise capital nor the discipline imposed by a wider shareholder base. The bank's board consists of just four members of the council and four bank representatives. Adding to the pressure for a rethink on Monte dei Paschi's future has been a steep fall in its profits. The recession has forced the bank, like many others in Italy, to increase provisions against bad debt. Last year net earnings fell to just L8bn (Pounds 3.3m) from L238bn in 1991. Monte dei Paschi is now the only big bank left in Italy tied so closely to its historical roots. In January, Turin's Istituto San Paolo, which also started as a pawnshop, was floated on the stock market, allowing it to tap shareholders for money and reducing suspicions that it is susceptible to political influence. Transforming Monte dei Paschi into a limited company is the battle cry for younger managers and some in the banking world outside Siena calling for radical changes at the bank. Such a move would bring tax breaks under legislation meant to encourage banks to move from charitable status and eventually to flotation. 'Executives know the bank must turn into a limited company if it is to remain competitive with other big banks, such as San Paolo, which have already made the change,' says one manager. 'But they can't force the issue. Public opinion in Siena could block any changes that might compromise local control.' Resistance to change has come from the city council, dominated by the former Communist party, which is reluctant to relinquish local government control and sees little necessity for reform of the bank. Mr Pierluigi Piccini, Siena's mayor and the most prominent of the anti-reformers, says: 'Not all successful banks are limited companies. There are plenty of financial institutions in the UK, France and Germany which do very well under municipal control.' He believes there is a close 'moral bond' between the city and the bank, which has, under its charitable status, to offer half its profits to the community. 'We have traditionally refused to take the full proportion of profits we are entitled to, prefering to leave the remainder to the bank to help finance its growth,' says Mr Piccini. The Siennese have traditionally defended the bond between city and the bank as tenaciously as they once fought to remain independent of Florence. In a city famous for its fierce internal rivalry, which finds expression in the twice-yearly Palio horse race, the bank is a symbol of unity. Trying, discreetly, to steer a course between the radical reformers and opponents of change are Mr Vincenzo Pennarola, who took over last month as managing director, and Mr Giovanni Grottanelli de Santi, Monte dei Paschi's chairman, appointed last December. They are keen to take advantage of opportunities for regional and international expansion - Bank of Italy controls on territorial expansion by banks were relaxed in 1990. But Mr Grottanelli de Santi and Mr Pennarola are reluctant to sacrifice the links with the city which, they acknowledge, have ensured the bank's stability since its foundation. They deny reports that they are determined to take the bank public, stressing instead that Monte dei Paschi must streamline its cumbersome structure. The group comprises six, partly overlapping, banks. The parent company has 669 branches, while Banca Toscana, the biggest subsidiary, has a 259-branch network, much of it in the same Tuscan towns as its parent. Last year, regional duplication increased when the bank bought a municipally-controlled savings bank in Prato, also in Tuscany. In northern Italy, Credito Commerciale and Credito Lombardo, the group's two Milan-based banks, also overlap. 'Monte dei Paschi is a very unusual bank,' says Mr Pennarola. 'We have to decide on a future structure and are now preparing various options to put to the board within the next two months.' But with local passions running high, Mr Grottanelli de Santi says steps on restructuring would not necessarily foreshadow the bank becoming a limited company. Conscious of the sensitivity of the issue, he goes out of his way to avoid a public confrontation with the city council. 'We welcome the city's participation on our board,' he says. 'Find me another bank where the managing director or chairman are stopped in the street by old schoolfriends, or even strangers, and buttonholed about yesterday's decisions.' But Mr Grottanelli de Santi's carefully-chosen words cannot hide the debate over the bank's future. This year's corruption scandals have not helped the bank's image over the short term. If public opinion shifts in favour of creating greater barriers between politicians and business, it will test the relationship between the Siena council and reformers such as Mr Grottanelli de Santi and Mr Pennarola.</p>

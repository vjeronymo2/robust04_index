			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Leading Article: The price of coal BRITISH COAL deserves praise for its record profit last year of Pounds 170m. After years of cost cutting, the corporation is now one of Europe's most efficient producers, although it still cannot compete with prices on the open world market. It is ironic that these achievements should come at a time when British Coal's future is so uncertain. The long-term coal supply contracts with electricity generators, which account for more than 80 per cent of its revenues, are up for renegotiation; for the first time they will be struck at a commercial price, rather than one dictated by the government to prop up the coal industry. With these new contracts in place, coal will be returned to the private sector. Still more pit closures are inevitable. The government is right to want to privatise coal as part of its so far patchy strategy to allow market forces to restructure the UK's energy mix. But British Coal has a point when it argues that it is being asked to compete against other fuels whose prices are also artificially set. Nuclear power has a protected status, which may or may not be altered when the industry is reviewed in two years. Then there are the independent UK electricity generators, which will be burning gas obtained on highly favourable long-term contracts. Finally, there is the inadequately competitive structure of the electricity generating industry, where two unregulated giants may be able to crush British Coal in contract negotiations. This is not an argument for rethinking the privatisation of coal - or even delaying it. It has to be recognised that coal is not an attractive fuel: it is difficult and dangerous to obtain and it requires a lot of cleaning to meet air quality standards. The most efficient open-cast mines are also the least environmentally friendly. Coal's main advantage is that it is plentiful, but security of supply is less of a concern than it was 10 years ago, and Britain is fortunate in having abundant alternatives. The government should therefore focus on two points. First, it cannot avoid some interest in the coal contracts, given its importance for the size of the industry and its value at privatisation. It would be a disaster for ministers to revert to the old game of requiring a bloated price, but it would also be unsatisfactory for the generators to use their powers to drive a bargain with damaging long term consequences for consumers. The Office of Electricity Regulation should be asked, exceptionally, to produce and publish an analysis of coal's future in electricity generation, to help government and other interested parties judge the proposed deal. Second, Britain should use its EC presidency to press actions already launched in Brussels against coal protectionism in other member states. EC coal subsidies totalled Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) last year. Germany is a particular culprit, as is Spain, where some mines produce coal at five times the cost of British Coal.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks buy into minerals group TWO French banks, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, have invested CDollars 13m (USDollars 10.4m) in Dia-Met Minerals, a British Columbia company which is at the centre of a stampede for diamonds in Canada's Northwest Territories. The banks have bought 350,000 Dia-Met shares, equal to 3.5 per cent of the total outstanding, in a private placement priced at CDollars 39 a share. The deal was put together by First Marathon Securities of Toronto. Dia-Met's share price has soared in the past year from less than CDollars 5 to a peak of CDollars 60 in the wake of its discovery of diamonds in the Lac de Gras area, 350km north-east of Yellowknife. The company said last May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore had yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appeared to be of gem quality. BHP, the Australian mining group, has rights to a majority interest in the Dia-Met property. De Beers and Kennecott, the North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, are among numerous other companies which have joined the diamond stampede, in which a total of about 23m acres has been staked. Mr John Lydall, First Marathon's mining analyst, said in a report that exploration was still at an early stage and 'a huge amount' of work remained to be done. He said 'this entire exploration play remains an opportunity for prudent speculation'.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV CRITICIZED BUT WINS PARLIAMENT SEAT  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president, won election as a Communist Party  deputy to the country's new parliament Wednesday but not before three party  members had questioned his suitability for office.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of glasnost, the policy of political openness instituted by  Gorbachev, the three had written the party's policy-making Central Committee  arguing that he must also accept responsibility for the country's problems  since he was a member of the leadership in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  </P> <P> The committee, which is holding a two-day meeting on agricultural policy,  nevertheless voted for Gorbachev and all 99 other candidates who were nominated  two months ago. None was opposed, according to reports by the official Soviet  news agency Tass, and all received the approval of at least half of the  participants in the meeting.  </P> <P> But Valentin A. Koptyug, chairman of the party's electoral commission, said  that several of the top party leaders were criticized during the election  process, a contrast to the past practice of unquestioning acceptance of such  Central Committee decisions.  </P> <P> The most criticized apparently was Yegor K. Ligachev, Central Committee  secretary in charge of agriculture and voice of conservatism within the ruling  Politburo.  </P> <P> Koptyug said the commission received 25 letters criticizing Ligachev,  particularly his cautious approach to political and economic reform and his  scathing denunciation of Boris N. Yeltsin, a popular former member of the  Politburo, last summer at a party conference.  </P> <P> The elections have been a valuable political process for the party, encouraging  discussion of both its policies and leaders, Koptyug said in outlining the  criticism the top leaders received. Altogether, more than 12,000 letters,  telegrams and resolutions have been received from party organizations and  members commenting on the party's candidates and election platform.  </P> <P> Constitutional amendments adopted late last year allocate 100 seats to the  Communist Party in the 750-member Chamber of Deputies elected from "public  organizations." Although party members had suggested more than 31,500 people  for those seats, the party Secretariat had reduced them to 314, and the Central  Committee then nominated 100, one for each seat, at a meeting in January.  </P> <P> Those elected as the party's representatives included most members of the  12-member Politburo -- a few are running in local constituencies -- along with  26 workers, 22 professionals and intellectuals, 21 other party officials and 7  farmers.  </P> <P> Allied groups, such as the Communist Youth League and the country's trade  unions, also have sizable blocs in that chamber. In addition, more than 80% of  the candidates running for the 1,500 territorial seats in two other chambers  are also party members, but in many cases face stiff competition.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE IMMIGRATION LAW  REVIEW  </P> <P> California's Roman Catholic bishops, meeting Friday in Los Angeles, unanimously  adopted a resolution urging Congress to review the employer sanctions section  of an immigration law that a General Accounting Office report says has caused  "widespread discrimination" against foreign-looking but legal American  citizens.  </P> <P> The resolution, submitted by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony to two  dozen bishops, welcomed the federal report on the 1986 Immigration Reform and  Control Act released Thursday in Washington.  </P> <P> "Employer sanctions have not only threatened (employment rights), but have  created an atmosphere of fear, mistrust and blatant employment discrimination,"  the bishops' statement said.  </P></p>

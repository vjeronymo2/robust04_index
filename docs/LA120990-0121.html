			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY;  </P> <P> QUINTANA PERFECT WITH NATIONAL TITLE  </P> <P> Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande completed an undefeated cross-country season by  winning the 12th annual Kinney national championship Saturday at Balboa Park in  San Diego.  </P> <P> Quintana, a senior who finished third in last year's final, ran the 5,000-meter  course in 15 minutes 7.22 seconds. He trailed early but rallied after the first  mile to pull ahead of Jason Casiano of Portage, Ind., who finished second with  a time of 15:17.16.  </P> <P> "I made my move when we started going up the hill," Quintana said. "After we  got over the hill, the field started coming back to me and I found myself on  top. I then tried to work the downhill to the best of my ability."  </P> <P> David Hartman of Canyon Country Canyon, who placed third in 15:20.96, said the  fast early pace in the heat caught him by surprise.  </P> <P> "They went out so hard I had to catch up," said Hartman, who was in 11th place  after two miles. "It was a little hot, but I was able to work the hill and make  my move near the end."  </P> <P> Other local finishers included James Menon of San Luis Obispo, who finished  ninth in 15:33.07, and Angel Martinez of San Gabriel, who finished 16th in  15:43.44.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., won the  girls' championship. Fairchild's time of 16:39.26 broke the meet record of  16:40 set by Connie Jo Robinson of Cincinnati in 1981.  </P> <P> Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village was a surprise second-place finisher in  17:38.36. Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands finished fifth in 17:47.50, and  Deena Drossin of Agoura, who won the West regionals last week, finished sixth  in 17:53.07.  </P> <P> "This feels great because it's my first win over Deena in my life," said  Rothman, who finished second to Drossin in the West regional.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: In search of the next Tolstoy - Arkady Ostrovsky looks at the five books on the shortlist for the second Booker Russian Novel Prize Among the many literary jokes of Daniil Kharms, the famous Russian absurdist, there was one concerned with the present state of Russian literature. In it Pushkin sits in his study and thinks: 'I am a genius - fair enough. Gogol is a genius too. But Tolstoy is a genius as well, you know, and Dostoevsky is a genius. God, when will it all end?' And then it all ends. The Booker's establishment of a special Russian Novel Prize seems to refute the Russian absurdist, suggesting that the great Russian novel maintains its tradition of excellence. In establishing the prize, the Booker pursued two aims: first, to help writers whose work could earn little money in Russia's present financial circumstances; secondly, to draw the attention of British publishers to contemporary Russian literature. The author of this year's best Russian novel will receive Pounds 10,000. From the nominated 38 novels there is a shortlist of five. These are Victor Astafyev's The Cursed and The Dead; Semyon Lipkin's Notes of a Lodger; Vladimir Makanin's A Baize-covered Table With a Carafe in the Middle; Lyudmial Ulitskaya's Sonechka and Oleg Ermakov's Sign of the Beast. Vladimir Makanin, 56, is well known to the Russian intelligentsia and belongs to the generation of writers defined by Russian critics as the '40-year-old's'. Makanin was 40 in 1977: the nickname describes not his age, but rather the age of his character. The 1970s, a time of profound stagnation in Soviet society, produced a particular Soviet type: average, faceless, a grey mass, characterless like the thousands of identical flats intended for 'identical' Soviet people. The English reader used to struggling with unpronounceable Russian names may relax with Makanin. His characters do not have personal names. The impersonal 'he' substitutes for the name of the central character. 'He' has nightmares of a similarly impersonal baize-covered table, a powerful symbol of the communist court. Makanin dissects the Soviet system and its mentality like a skilled anatomist. He describes brilliantly the mechanisms of suppression and depicts the types of communist prosecutors who take part in this nightmare-trial. The final scene, in which his character challenges the monstrous table and dies from its touch, is reminiscent of the famous Pushkin poem The Bronze Horseman where the protagonist challenges the menacing statue of Peter the Great. Written in Kafkaesque style, Makanin's novel becomes a startling portrait of Homo Sovieticus. Although almost the same age as Makanin, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, 55, writes in an entirely different style. Her short novel Sonechka describes the life of a fragile, all-forgiving woman, Sonya, who lives with her husband and daughter in a communal flat in post-war Moscow. The quiet and happy life of her family is interrupted by the appearance of a young orphan-prostitute, whom her daughter brings home from school. And even though Sonya's husband, a painter, has an affair with this new 'member' of the family, tolerant Sonya forgives everybody and loves everyone all the same. Saccharine and sentimental, filled with nostalgia, the novel carries a simplistic, unoriginal message: that a person can preserve himself no matter what is happening in the outside world. When in the 1970s Semyon Lipkin, 82, finished his Notes of a Lodger, he must have had little hope of ever seeing it published in Russia. Lipkin was mostly known as a poet and translator. In the late 1970s he joined the famous literary almanac Metropolis, which was soon shut down by the communist party. After that, he was no longer published in the Soviet Union. Born into a Jewish family in Odessa in 1911, Lipkin had experienced most of the events described in his book: civil war, Czarist pogroms, Bolshevik pogroms, the Jewish ghetto, the second world war. The genre is best described by its title: 'Notes'. The novel is rather unstructured, but contains a series of vivid scenes of life in Odessa, where Jews, Russians and Ukrainians all live together. There is a bewildering array of characters. The whole period of Russian history from 1917 to the 1950s is shown through the eyes of scientist Michail Lorenz, who at times has a striking affinity with Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago. Had the novel been published in the 1970s, when it was originally written, it would have had an explosive effect, revealing some of the most secret sides of Soviet history. But it has missed its ideal date of publication; it is now like an old coat which one loves, but would no longer wear. 'O, Russian people, how open and forgiving your heart is] You can touch it with your hands under a coat, feel its anxious beating with your palm, feel its trustful warmth.' This hymn to an open yet mysterious Russian soul, with its touching admiration of the 'saintly' Russians runs through the whole of Victor Astafyev's The Cursed and the Dead. To be fair, there are a few characters in the book who are not strong Siberian boys, but Armenians and Kazakhs. Yet they are there not for their own sakes; they appear simply to show the generosity of Russian people. In a multinational country where 'Russian', 'Armenian', 'Jew' indicate not nationality or citizenship, but an ethnic affiliation, this sentence carries unpleasant nationalistic connotation. Astafyev, 69, represents the so-called 'country prose', a genre which appeared in the post-thaw period and which sympathetically describes Russian rural life. The Cursed and the Dead is set during the second world war on the Russian home front where young Siberian soldiers die not under the German fire, but in the Gulag's regime. A good craftsmen, Astafyev knows how to keep the reader gripped. A shocking description of the cruel, unfair execution of two naive Siberian twins, gives way to a utopian and idealised picture of natural village life. The style is a mixture of a low-key dialogues and biblical descriptions. It is worth noting that Astafyev's main belief - that the salvation of Russia depends on the simple religious Russian people - coincides with the right-wing ideology of the Russian nationalist party. The life span of Oleg Ermakov, 28, the youngest writer in the Booker shortlist has already included a few years of war. Sign of the Beast, his first full-length novel, deals with one of the most tragic periods of recent Soviet history - Afghanistan. Bestial rules of the disintegrating Soviet army, the cruel mistreatment and humiliation of young recruits, the ethnic conflicts, although not news to most of today's readers, are still shocking to hear. But do these disturbing images make Sign of the Beast a good novel, or simply help it to sell? This is an excellent documentary story but not much of a novel. Ermakov's literary devices and metaphysical images of East and West, Taoist and Viking are rather primitive and disrupt the telling of the story. Although I would not call any of the five novels outstanding, Makanin's Baized-covered Table remains the most intelligent and interesting of a bunch. The best novel will be announced at a presentation dinner in Moscow on December 14.</p>

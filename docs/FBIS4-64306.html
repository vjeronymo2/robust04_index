			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>   [Text] The Progress Party [FrP] drops the most in support  while the Center Party, the Christian People's Party, and the  Conservatives gain the most according to Opinion's party  barometer for April.    The April poll is based on 1,005 interviews conducted from  Monday [11 April] to Wednesday of this week. Of those  interviewed, 71.5 percent declared their party preference.    The FrP, which is holding its national congress this  weekend,  drops the most. The party lost 1.3 percent support. At 4.3  percent it is now 2 percent below the very low election result  last September.    The FrP has experienced great fluctuations since its start  together with the Anders Lange Party in 1973. Chairman Carl I.  Hagen's party has now endured a long period of difficulty  holding on to its voters. The trend has for a long time been one  of low loyalty to the party. By now the level is  catastrophically low: 51.3 percent.    This means that only one-half of the voters who say they  voted for the FrP last year continue to support the party. In  comparison, the Center Party enjoys a loyalty of 81.8 percent,  the Labor Party 78.9 percent, and even a party with such big  problems as the Conservative Party has a loyalty percentage of  69.7.    The Conservatives are advancing in the April poll. A likely  explanation could be the national congress held last weekend.  At that time the party finally got its new leadership installed  so that it can now concentrate on its political message. The  background data show that the Conservative Party is now  mobilizing supporters who chose to stay home during the 1993  national election. This is a positive sign for the party. With  a gain of 0.9 percent, the party's current support of 18.3  percent puts it notably above last year's poor election results.    The Center Party also gets 18.3 percent support in April, an  advance of 1.5 percent since the March poll. The party has an  enormously high loyalty level (81.8 percent). The prospects for  the party are definitely positive. The Center Party is getting  voters both from the Socialist Left and the Christian People's  parties. It appears to be perceived as the leading party on the  no side [of the EU issue].    With gains of 1.4 percent, the Christian People's Party is  definitely advancing, following several months of losing  support. The April support of 7.5 percent places the party  almost at the level of support in last year's election.    The Socialist Left drops slightly, but rising loyalty may  mean that the leakage from the Socialist Left to the Labor Party  is about to stop. The Labor Party also drops only a little (0.6  percent), but it is interesting to note that in most polls taken  in the past months the governing party has been dropping. The  background data reveal heightened insecurity and increased voter  leakage to other parties. Future polls will tell us more about  whether or not this is connected to the EU issue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "News and Analysis" feature: "Canceling Books </F> in the United Arab Emirates Discussing Israeli Repression!"]    [Text] In a report from the United Arab Emirates [UAE]  yesterday morning, London radio said the French Government  canceled educational books in the French school in the UAE  because they point to both Israeli repression in the occupied  Arab territories and the Palestinian people's resistance of  occupation. The press report claimed this measure was taken in  agreement with the UAE authorities as part of fighting  anti-Semitism!    The report, in itself, was brief. It, however, has serious  implications. Everyone is aware of the French Government's  current shift in favor of Israel, which reached the extent of  concluding military and nuclear cooperation deals with it. This  recalls the cooperation of the Guy Moliere [name as  transliterated] government in the fifties before and after the  futile Suez aggression. However, the French Government's  cancellation, under the Zionist lobby's influence, of curricula  in an Arab country on the pretext that it is anti-Semitic to  discuss Israeli repression is regarded as extreme deception and  collusion. It also reveals strong hostility to Arab hopes and  aspirations as well as a readiness to cooperate with Israel as  much as possible.    The Western press in general, including the French press,  constantly discusses both Israeli repression and the subjection  of Palestinians to disgraceful ordeals. We, however, have heard  no official in the French Government viewing the Western  reporters' articles and reports as anti-Semitic. Are not Arabs,  the victims of Israeli occupation, entitled to raise their  voices in denunciation and to urge the international community  to assume its responsibilities? Do not both the failure to  brief students on facts and publicity for Israel constitute  absolute hostility to Arabs and their cause?    The French Government's conduct is amazing because it has  apparently bargained the international community's principles  and the values of justice for blind bias toward Israel, thus  relinquishing the friendship of 200 million Arabs in favor of  concealing Israeli crimes and implementing Israel's schemes.    What draws our attention is the fact that this measure  totally conflicts with the recent decisions by the UAE  Government with regard to tightening the boycott of Israel.  This measure also contradicts the UAE's official policy  condemning Israeli occupation and urging Israeli withdrawal and  recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. The  brothers in the UAE are aware of Israel's intransigence and  aggression, knowing that the blood shed in the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre has not yet dried!    The French Government's submission to Zionist blackmail  should not mean that Paris is in a position to determine the  UAE's policy toward Israel, especially since the UAE is not in  need of France as much as France is in need of Arab oil. After  all, Arab dignity remains above all considerations.</p>

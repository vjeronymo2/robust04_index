Commenters asserted that 15 days is insufficient time for the facility to correct any remaining problems and obtain a follow-up survey. They contend it is even less sufficient if the facility disputes the continued existence of the deficiencies and desires a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are not expanding the notice period from 15 days to 60 days nor do we agree that the 15-day notice period is inadequate. We base the 15-day notice period prior to termination on our experience with &sect;489.53(c)(1), which sets forth notice requirements for other providers and suppliers. Moreover, the purpose of the notice is not for a facility to make last minute corrections, but for the government to help fulfill its duty to provide due process to facilities before termination. Facilities generally have had notice of their noncompliance long before the 15 days prior to termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter recommended that, unless HCFA is the only party acting (that is, the State does not terminate Medicaid participation), the State should provide the hearing and final decision. The commenter believed that if HCFA subsequently disagrees with the State's decision, the facility should not be affected. HCFA's action would be against the State alone, for recoupment of Federal financial participation, and should be appealed through the normal Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We assume this commenter is referring to a NF. When a NF's provider agreement is terminated, the appeal procedures which apply depend on who is taking the enforcement action. If the State is terminating a NF and the Secretary is taking no action, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 431 apply. If the Secretary exercises her authority, finds noncompliance, and terminates the NF, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 apply. If a NF is a State-operated entity, the Secretary always takes the enforcement action, and the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 would apply. In the case of facilities which participate as a NF and a SNF (dually participating facilities), where both the State and the Secretary are making enforcement decisions on the Medicaid and Medicare agreements respectively, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 apply. Since nearly 80% of all nursing homes are dually participating, the majority of NFs will appeal their enforcement actions through the Federal appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498. The appeals mechanism for providers adversely affected by the repayment provision would be the same as an appeal of noncompliance which led to termination or other enforcement remedies, except that a State can also appeal the recoupment of FFP under a DAB hearing in accordance with 45 CFR part 16. The recoupment of Federal funds will be one of the results of the termination; however, the noncompliance which led to termination remains the initial determination which is at issue at the hearing, and is the action on which the recoupment of funds is predicated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.452 State and Federal Disagreements Involving Findings Not in Agreement in Situations When There Is No Immediate Jeopardy  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN SIGNS DISABILITY BENEFIT INCREASE, REFORMS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian signed legislation Tuesday to boost disability benefits  for injured workers by 50% while beginning what lawmakers expect to be a  years-long job of overhauling California's $8-billion workers' compensation  system.  </P> <P> The two bills were described as a bipartisan compromise hammered out by  legislators mediating among several of the Capitol's most combative  special-interest groups: employers, labor, insurers, doctors and lawyers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7-Year Logjam  </P> <P> By signing the bills, Deukmejian ended a seven-year legislative logjam that  began when the Republican governor was elected in 1982 and declared that  injured workers would get no benefit increases until the Legislature agreed to  reforms of the system sought by employers and insurance companies.  </P> <P> The maximum benefits, frozen at $224 weekly since 1983, will increase to $336  by 1991 for workers who suffer on-the-job injuries after the legislation takes  effect on Jan. 1.  </P> <P> "This legislation . . . will help to restore some balance and fairness to our  worker compensation system," Deukmejian said before signing the bills at a  ceremony in his office. "It is going to provide additional, much-needed  benefits for injured workers in California. At the same time, it is also going  to bring about some reforms in the system to make it more cost-effective."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), who wrote one of the bills and led  months of public and private negotiations on the issue, said the outcome  represents an "enormously significant victory" for workers and employers.  </P> <P> "These two bills together will help put a crumbling, widely disrespected system  back on its feet," Margolin said.  </P> <P> Margolin said the benefit increase would be funded by "squeezing waste and  fraud out of the system" and by speeding the processing of claims filed by  injured workers.  </P> <P> In exchange for the benefit increase, organized labor and lawyers who represent  injured workers agreed for the first time to limit "doctor shopping" -- the  practice of workers having free choice of physicians to evaluate their  injuries. The legislation also will limit the ability of workers to collect  disability payments for stress-related injuries.  </P> <P> The bills also revamp the vocational rehabilitation system, which employers and  insurers have criticized as wasteful, and implement a new system for  arbitrating disputed claims before they reach the courts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Panacea'  </P> <P> Despite the widely acclaimed gains, representatives of every interest group  involved in the issue conceded that more needs to be done before the workers'  compensation system is returned to satisfactory condition. They said they will  continue to push for the elements of a compromise endorsed by Deukmejian  earlier this year, which would have doubled workers' benefits while  implementing more dramatic changes in the way the system is run.  </P> <P> "This bill is not a panacea," said Joseph Markey, a lobbyist for Californians  for Compensation Reform, a coalition of employers and insurers. "I think it was  as good a settlement as we could come to, given the pressures of the various  interest groups, the politics and the timing."  </P> <P> John F. Henning, secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, said  the 50% benefit increase only "whetted the appetite" of the state's workers for  higher disability payments.  </P> <P> "We want more," he said, adding that organized labor would be willing to accede  to additional employer-demanded reforms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Willing to Live With It  </P> <P> Donald Green, a lobbyist for the applicant attorneys, who represent injured  workers, said the lawyers are not satisfied with the final product but "in good  faith we are going to have to live with it."  </P> <P> Green said the lawyers -- who are in almost constant battle with insurance  companies -- want to see more done to reduce the cost of workers' compensation  insurance, which every California employer is required to provide.  </P> <P> Margolin acknowledged that benefits need to be still higher and that more  changes probably are needed in the administration of the system. But he  predicted that it will be at least three years before all of the parties return  to the negotiating table for serious talks.  </P> <P> The governor also took action on these bills:  </P> <P> Therapist sex -- Signed a measure by Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord) to  make it a criminal offense for a psychiatrist, psychologist or marriage  counselor to have sex with a patient.  </P> <P> Foam food containers -- Vetoed a measure by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese  (D-San Jose) that would have prohibited the manufacture, distribution and sale  of any rigid polystyrene foam food service product or food packaging made with  a chlorofluorocarbons. In a veto message, Deukmejian said the food packaging  industry has already voluntarily eliminated 99% of its use of these chemicals,  which are thought to be contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer.  </P> <P> Professional wrestling -- Signed legislation by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd  (D-Carson) to remove professional wrestling from the jurisdiction of the State  Athletic Commission. Floyd argued that pro wrestling is entertainment, not a  sport, and is not in need of government supervision.  </P> <P> Auto body parts -- Signed a bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to  require auto body shops to disclose the type of parts that will be used to  repair damaged motor vehicles.  </P> <P> Farm products -- Signed a measure by Areias to allow fresh California-grown  farm products to carry a special seal to increase consumer awareness.  </P> <P> Cal Vet loans -- Signed legislation by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) to  increase the maximum value of a Cal Vet home loan from $90,000 to $125,000.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jerry Gillam contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW THE LAW AFFECTS INJURED WORKERS  </P> <P> Here is a summary of how the changes in California's workers' compensation  system will affect workers injured on or after Jan. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> Benefits: Temporary disability and total permanent disability payments will  increase from the current maximum of $224 weekly to $266 weekly on Jan. 1, 1990  and $336 on Jan. 1, 1991. The minimum benefit for most workers, now $112  weekly, will change to $126 or 100% of the injured worker's average weekly  earnings, whichever is less.  </P> <P> Payments for partial permanent disability will increase from $140 weekly to  $148 for workers who are 25% disabled or more. Maximum benefits will be paid  for 694 weeks, up from the current maximum of 619 weeks.  </P> <P> Death benefits for dependents will be boosted to a maximum of $115,000 from the  current $95,000, and the maximum payment for burial expenses will go to $5,000  from $2,000.  </P> <P> Evaluating injuries: Workers not represented by lawyers will choose a doctor to  evaluate their injuries from a panel of three physicians selected at random by  the state from a pool of qualified doctors.  </P> <P> Workers who do have a lawyer will be required to seek agreement with their  employer on a doctor to evaluate their injuries. If they cannot agree, the  worker will choose the evaluating physician but will be limited to one  employer-paid doctor from each medical specialty. The employer also will be  limited to hiring one physician from each specialty to rebut the conclusions of  the doctor retained by the worker.  </P> <P> Stress claims: A worker seeking benefits for a psychiatric injury will now have  to prove that at least 10% of the injury was caused by an actual event in the  workplace.  </P> <P> Vocational rehabilitation: Injured workers will meet with a vocational  rehabilitation counselor within 90 days of their injury, and the counselor will  meet with the worker's physician to speed determination of whether the employee  can return to his or her occupation.  </P> <P> Workers will be presumed eligible for vocational rehabilitation one year after  they are injured.  </P> <P> Once a worker is eligible for rehabilitation, he or she will have 90 days to  apply. After that point, the employer is no longer obligated to provide the  services.  </P> <P> Employees in vocational rehabilitation will continue to receive temporary  disability benefits, but not at the increased rates other workers will get  under this legislation. Vocational rehabilitation participants will get a  maximum of $247 per week.  </P></p>

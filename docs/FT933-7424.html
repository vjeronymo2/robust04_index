			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: All quiet on the Hartstone front ONE Hartstone shareholder summed up sentiment at yesterday's annual meeting before it even began: 'They have got someone at the top now who hopefully knows where he is going]' Even the chairman of the struggling hosiery and leather goods group, Mr Shaun Dowling, who replaced the company's founder, Mr Stephen Barker, in May, was not prepared for such confident support. He described himself as somewhat 'surprised' by the lack of excitement following the roller-coaster performance of the company's shares in recent months. They have fallen from a 12-month high of 307p to yesterday's 61p after three profits warnings and the revelation of pre-tax losses of Pounds 9.9m for 1992 following a spectacular acquisitions spree across Europe in recent years. 'I would not have minded more questions,' said Mr Dowling, who had to answer only two from the small group of shareholders who attended the half-hour meeting. Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the venue, the luxurious 16th-century Hartwell House hotel, once a home of King Louis XVIII of France, which moved shareholders to silence. It may have been Mr Dowling's own manner which one shareholder described as 'intimidating . . . one was not encouraged to talk.' Most of the 20 or so private shareholders who turned up seemed to have suffered from wilful amnesia over the company's recent troubles. 'It's a new board, isn't it?' said one. Mr Dowling said Hartstone had begun the process of disposing of certain non-core businesses. Speculation centres on disposal of one of Hartstone's larger companies. The last shadows of the old Hartstone were dispersed with the announcement that Mr David Gratton, former finance director, was stepping down from the board.</p>

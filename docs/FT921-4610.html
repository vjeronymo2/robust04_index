			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Developing disused collieries TAYLOR WOODROW has won a Pounds 35m contract from British Coal Opencast for extensive mining, civil engineering and restoration work at two disused collieries at Swadlincote, Derbyshire. In Derbyshire, Taylor Woodrow is starting work on winning more than two million tonnes of coal by open-cast methods at two former mines at Cadley Hill and neighbouring High Cross on the A444 route south of Burton-on-Trent. A major part of the contract involves constructing a one kilometre dual carriageway at High Cross after coal extraction has been completed. Due to be finished early in 1995, the roadway, which will serve as a bypass for the village of Castle Gresley, will comprise a bridge and elevated roundabout complex, spanning the main road and rail line. Some two miles north, at the former Cadley Hill colliery, Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering will be undertaking a six-year programme to extract coal and prepare the 128 hectare site for industrial and leisure development. This will involve diverting a main sewer around the perimeter of the site as well as grading and compacting the land. A coal-washing plant will be used to reclaim a 160,000 tonne pre-war coal tip. Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering is undertaking similar coal recovery operations in a derelict colliery site at Abercynon, mid-Glamorgan, and at its open-cast coal site at Garnant, Dyfed, before restoring the land for industrial and agricultural use.</p>

The insurance market worldwide is full of regulations in the  context of protecting policyholders, and the framework talks in  this field focus on what is possible to deregulate, the official  said, requesting anonymity.    Checking the progress of deregulation should be the criteria  which Japan and the U.S. are to set up under the framework  agreement reached in July, the official said.    In this sense, the insurance field is different from, for  example, the relatively regulation-free automobile field, the  official said, indicating the framework yardsticks could vary  for each field.    Nevertheless, he criticized the U.S. for demanding  quantitative benchmarks in the overall framework talks, saying  that private- sector market share is determined by business  efforts and strategies.    Under the July agreement, the two nations are to establish  "objective criteria" of a qualitative or quantitative nature, or  both if appropriate.    The official said the two sides would have to make further  efforts to narrow the gap over the criteria issue at scheduled  meetings led by subcabinet-level talks next week before the  February 11 talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton in Washington.    An agreement is targeted by then in three priority fields --  insurance, automobile and auto parts, and government procurement  of medical and telecommunications equipment.    Asked about the chances of postponing the summit because of  the political turmoil over the tax issue in Japan, the official  said the government is determined to keep the schedule.    The two leaders are also slated to discuss their respective  macroeconomic measures as the framework agreement calls for the  U.S. to take deficit-cutting measures and Japan to boost  domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus.    The deadlocked tax issue is delaying Japan's announcement of  its stimulus package, including tax cuts, and compilation of the  fiscal 1994 budget -- the two major actions which Hosokawa plans  to take before going to Washington.    The official said macroeconomic issues are for reporting and  not for negotiations. The U.S. side recognizes this, too, he  said.</p>

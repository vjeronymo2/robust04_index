			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 9 Jun (EFE) -- A mission representing  Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer today foiled an attempt by  opponents to Balaguer's government to raise electoral fraud  charges against him at the plenum of the 24th OAS General  Assembly, which is slated to close on 10 June.    A delegation of Balaguer's political opponents led by vice  presidential candidate Fernando Alvarez Bogaert has  unsuccessfully tried to participate in the OAS assembly -- which  is being held at the city of Belem, Para State -- through an  invitation extended to them by a Central American country,  possibly Costa Rica.    The attempt was rejected by most of the 34 delegates, who  centered their efforts on the Haitian crisis and the  strengthening of the trade embargo to force the ouster of the  "de facto" Haitian Government, thanks to behind-the-scenes  negotiations conducted by Dominican Foreign Minister Juan  Taveras and other Balaguer envoys.    Mario Read-Bitti, president of the Dominican Republic  Central  Bank, told EFE: "It is surprising that the opposition attempted  to raise a domestic subject here that concerns only the  Dominican people."    When it became clear that Alvarez would not be able to speak  at the OAS plenum, the opposition mission sought to propose a  draft resolution in which the OAS voices concern about the  openness of the vote count conducted by the Dominican Central  Electoral Board.    Diplomatic sources told EFE that although this initiative  also failed OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares may refer to  the Dominican elections in his closing speech on 10 June.    The OAS had sent a mission of observers to oversee the  recent  elections in Dominican Republic.</p>

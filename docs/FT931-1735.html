			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / A race against time: The west must help Russia before it is too late 'The west should by now have learnt the lesson, in other parts of the world, that it is dangerous to go on supporting a foreign leader because his policies fit in with our own interests, or even because he claims his sympathy with our values, if he lacks the support of his own people and therefore cannot apply those values in his domestic policy.' I said this two years ago when I argued that it was a mistake for the west to go on supporting Mr Mikhail Gorbachev when he was clearly far less popular than Mr Boris Yeltsin, and was increasingly resorting to authoritarian methods. Does the same logic apply to Mr Yeltsin now? I think not. We do not know whether the Russian president is now less popular than the parliamentarians he is confronting, but at least, by holding a referendum, he is trying to give us a chance to find out. Meanwhile, his democratic credentials are better than theirs: he was elected more recently, and by a direct popular vote. Many of the parliamentarians were chosen under the old Soviet system, which gave seats to organisations, usually communist-controlled, as well as to territorial constituencies. Politically, Mr Gorbachev in early 1991 was delaying economic reform and trying to hold the Soviet Union together, and to do so was relying more and more on neo-Stalinist conservatives in the party, the KGB and the armed forces. During this past winter Mr Yeltsin too seemed unduly willing to compromise with opponents of reform. But now he has grasped the nettle he deserves support. That said, support should never be given unconditionally. What must concern us is not the man in charge but his policies, and his ability to implement them. The west's interest, as well as that of Russians themselves, clearly lies in the successful conversion of the Russian economy to market principles, so that it can engage intensively in exchanging goods and services with the rest of the world; and in the development of an open society so that the exchange of ideas and information can be mutual too. In the long run both these things, and especially the latter, must involve some kind of pluralist democracy. Whether they can be reached by a purely democratic road is less certain. We may have to accept that some corners will be cut, so long as the overall direction of change is clear. But does it make any difference what we think? Can we, in fact, 'help' Yeltsin, however much we want to? May it not be that, the more audibly and visibly he is backed by the west, the more he will be hated by Russians, who will see him simply as the west's chosen instrument for imposing its own social and political system on them, at the price of terrible hardships, and for obtaining Russian compliance with western geopolitical interests? Clearly there are Russians who see things that way. Some see proposed foreign investment in the Russian oil and gas industry as simply an effort by greedy foreign capitalists to get their hands on Russia's natural resources. But people who think like that will not be won over by a western hands-off policy. On the contrary, such a policy would confirm many Russians in their growing conviction that the reforms are an illusion, doomed to certain failure. It is late in the day, but what could still help the cause of reform would be a spectacular demonstration of the west's commitment to it, done in ways that can be seen to make a tangible difference in a matter of months. Debt relief is essential, because if Russia has to service its debts in full it will have nothing left to spend on domestic programmes, but it is not enough. People will not be grateful for debt relief, because they will not believe that without it they would be even worse off than they already are. Debt relief aside, it is not a matter of handing over cash to Mr Yeltsin or his government. But western governments should be prepared to put their own resources at risk by providing guarantees to private investors. And, while insisting that the Russian central bank stops printing money to keep state-owned companies afloat, western governments must be prepared to help put in place a social safety-net for those thrown out of work as a consequence. To attempt this for the whole of Russia may be too ambitious, but at least it could be targeted at those towns and districts whose entire population - sometimes hundreds of thousands of people - depends on military production. Similarly, there should be a fund to provide housing for Russian professional soldiers (mainly officers) displaced by withdrawal from former Soviet republics or Warsaw Pact members. A big effort is also needed - it seems too obvious to need saying - to improve the safety of Russia's civilian nuclear facilities. These and other items will cost money, but nowhere near as much as we shall end up spending if we have again to defend ourselves against a closed, resentful and revanchist post-Yeltsin regime. In fact, one virtue of the collapse of the rouble is that every US dollar represents a small fortune in terms of Russian living-standards. What matters is that the money should be visible, clearly targeted, and that the various programmes should be properly co-ordinated. At present, western aid programmes are a bureaucratic tangle rivalling that of Russia itself. The Group of Seven countries should set up a single office to co-ordinate all these efforts, headed by a political figure able to cut through bureaucracies, and one in whom ordinary Russians would have some confidence. Why not Baroness Thatcher?</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Bush fights to regain initiative in final TV debate PRESIDENT George Bush last night launched his most confident and pointed attack so far on Governor Bill Clinton, in a late attempt to revitalise his flagging campaign for re-election on November 3 and to dent his Democratic opponent's big lead. After hesitant performances in the first two televised debates between the candidates, Mr Bush took the offensive in last night's third debate to accuse Mr Clinton of trying systematically to take both sides on every issue. 'There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowd. You can't do that as president,' Mr Bush said. Few analysts last night believed that a strong debate performance would be enough to do more than nibble at Mr Clinton's lead in the polls, which in the past 24 hours have shown him ahead by between 12 and 18 percentage points. Yet the president at least dispelled the pervasive reports of recent days suggesting that he had already given up the fight. He met the expectations of his supporters by delivering an attack on his opponent's record as governor of Arkansas and by drawing a philosophical distinction between himself and Mr Clinton, who he said was 'still talking about spending more and taxing more'. In a stinging barb, Mr Bush warned Americans to 'watch your wallet' if Mr Clinton wins. Mr Bush got support from an unexpected quarter when Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate in the presidential election, dismissed as irrelevant Mr Clinton's experience as governor of such a small state as Arkansas. 'I could say I ran a small grocery store on the corner and extrapolate that and say I could run Walmart; that's just not so,' he quipped. But Mr Perot reserved his harshest words for Mr Bush, whom he accused of building up foreign dictators and then seeking to exonerate himself by admitting error. 'Create Saddam Hussein with taxpayers' money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake. Create Manuel Noriega, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake . . . that's leadership, folks,' he jeered. While Mr Clinton appeared at times defensive, many analysts felt immediately after the debate that he had done at least enough to cement his already solid lead in a majority of states. With last night's final debate out of the way, President Bush is heading south to bolster his flagging support in the two Carolinas, Georgia and possibly Florida. Governor Clinton is embarking on a 'winning the west' tour, including stops in Nevada, Wyoming and Montana. Ghost of campaign past drives Democrats, Page 5</p>

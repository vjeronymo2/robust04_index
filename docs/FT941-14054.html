			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Economic growth outpaces forecast: Money supply grows strongly - GDP up 2% / Boost for recovery lifts market The UK economy grew faster than the government forecast last year, adding weight to the Chancellor's view that the recovery is strengthening. The figures came at the end of a week of conflicting economic indicators. Gross domestic product increased by 2 per cent in 1993, the first calendar year rise since 1990, according to preliminary estimates published by the Central Statistical Office. GDP growth, which accelerated in the fourth quarter, was above the 1.25 per cent forecast by the government in March and 1.75 per cent predicted in Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's November Budget. Evidence of economic strength appeared to please the stock market yesterday, although this week it has risen on hopes that a weakening recovery would lead to lower interest rates. The FT-SE 100 index came close to topping 3,500, reaching an all-time intra-day high of 3,496.1. Although it fell back, the index still rose 14.2 points on the day, ending at a record close of 3,484.2. This week the index gained 83.6 points or just under 2.5 per cent. The GDP statistics, allied with reports of stronger-than-expected money supply growth, were among positive indicators this week, countering a slight fall in December's retail sales, and a British Chambers of Commerce report, which had both indicated that recovery might be faltering. However, Mr Clarke said yesterday: 'Two per cent growth in 1993 will be the envy of every major country in western Europe; I trust we can do better in 1994.' Total GDP rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, the seventh consecutive quarter of economic growth. The overall increase since the fourth quarter is 2.5 per cent, slightly up on analysts' expectations. The rise means that GDP has climbed 3.3 per cent since the trough in the first quarter of 1992 and is finally back to the average level for 1990, when the recession began. Economic output was boosted by a strong performance from the oil and gas sector. If oil and gas are excluded, then GDP rose just 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, making it 2.1 per cent up on the same period of 1992. Non-oil GDP in 1993 was 1.8 per cent higher than in 1992, but has not hit pre-recessionary levels. Growth was fairly broadly spread, the CSO indicated, the main exceptions being agriculture, depressed because of the European Union's set-aside policy, and construction, which was flat. Services are still performing more strongly than manufacturing; total service output is now 1 per cent above the previous peak in the second quarter of 1990. Further evidence of growth was provided by M4, the broadest money supply measure, which rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in December, bringing the annual rate up to 5.5 per cent. The figures indicate that money supply growth is accelerating; the annualised rise in the three months to December is 9 per cent. Sterling lending by banks and building societies to the private sector, M4 lending, rose sharply to Pounds 4.1bn in December, compared with Pounds 550m in November. The year-on-year growth in M4 lending was 3.6 per cent in December, up from 3 per cent in November. Mortgage lending by building societies fell back in December. Net advances declined to Pounds 624m, from November's Pounds 800m, while net new commitments fell to Pounds 2.09bn from Pounds 2.78bn.

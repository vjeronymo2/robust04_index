			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Italy taxes patience Sir, Your article ('Exporters warned of payment delays', February 3) on payment delays for UK exporters trading in continental Europe is a cautionary tale. But surely the greatest offenders in this regard are the Italian fiscal authorities, from which it seems to be well-nigh impossible to obtain refunds of VAT incurred in Italy. I have experience of a claim totalling more than Pounds 30,000 for VAT incurred in 1989, which still has not been paid, despite chase-ups and reminders. While EC directives abound, affecting the minutiae of the lives of the humblest European, it would seem that, in regard to VAT legislation, one of the member countries has no desire to comply. Is it not time for Brussels to bring the Italian authorities into line over this matter and insist upon Italy settling VAT claims promptly, as does the UK VAT authority?

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulagin] </F>   [Text] Almaty 6 April, TASS -- Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev spoke of the need for streamlining the earlier  government anti-crisis programme and perking up economic reform  at a meeting on Tuesday with other republican leaders on the eve  of his visit to Japan.    Following the introduction of national currency four and a  half months ago, the Kazakh leader and the government issued  over 200 decrees, decisions and instructions of normative and  executive nature. However, the president claims, there is no  system and purposefulness in implementing mapped-out measures.    Activities of ministries and the government are not  coordinated enough to draft normative and executive documents  and to organise their practical implementation.    Nazarbayev made some important proposals aimed at  accelerating the compilation of a programme to step up reforms.  In the president's opinion, prime attention should be given to  raising prestige and improving the operation of executive organs  and state bodies of administration.    The president noted that it is necessary to synthesize all  channels of financial aid from international organisations and  foreign countries received under the state's auspices by areas,  economic sectors and social spheres of the republic as well as  to hammer out the main principles and mechanisms of its use,  including state structures and other institutions responsible  for the implementation of projects and the return of credits and  loans received for their implementation.    The president also noted the expediency to compile  indicative  five-year plans starting with 1995, to step up support for  privatisation processes and holding structures giving them  greater freedom of actions, to promote the development of  consumer goods production, to boost volumes of processing  agricultural produce and to restructure the operation of the  statistical system which orients itself, as before, only on the  state sector and, therefore, does not give a real picture of the  republican economy.    The president specially stressed that, taking into  consideration the present situation and still entertaining hopes  for the integration within the Commonwealth of Independent  States, the Republic should rely, above all, on its own  capabilities. Kazakhstan must survive in any case, using its own  potential.    The programme to pep up the economic reform will be adopted  in April after its improvement. The president also plans this  month to examine issues of privatisation, adjustment of social  programmes, housing policy and a drive against crime.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: First City Banc plans reshape FIRST CITY Bancorporation, the troubled Texas bank, yesterday put forward a recapitalisation plan which, it said, would bring its finances into line with regulators' requirements. The scheme would involve the disposal of about one third of the bank's assets. However, it would not in-volve assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government agency which oversees the restructuring of troubled banks. The FDIC provided almost Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn rescue package for First City in 1987, and has been anxious to avoid a second major cash injection. Mr Ivan Wilson, the company's new chairman, claimed that over the past year, First City had 'achieved significant reductions in the level of problem assets and resolved its most troublesome litigation'. He said: 'We believe the combination of these two factors should enable us to attract new capital without the need for FDIC assistance.' First City also unveiled second-quarter losses of Dollars 18.5m after tax, against Dollars 58.9m a year earlier, taking the loss after tax in the first six months to Dollars 92.3m (Dollars 130m). First City is one of the largest remaining independent banks in Texas under local ownership. Mr Robert Abboud, the Chicago banker who led the 1987 bailout, resigned a year ago in the face of mounting loan losses. The recapitalisation plan will require approval by regulators and shareholders. A shareholder meeting has been scheduled for December 8. Under the proposals, First City would sell 13 of its banks - about a third of its assets - but retain its banks in the Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Alice, Aransas Pass and McAllen areas. This move, it estimated, should raise upwards of Dollars 210m, while renegotiation of some above-market leases and the settlement of certain guarantees and other obligations to the FDIC, should yield another Dollars 140m of capital. An additional Dollars 100m would be raised by a private placement of stock and a rights offering to existing shareholders.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu article: ""Why Did the PDSR-Opposition </F> Dialogue Fail?"]    [Text] At the news conference of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party of Romania [PNTCD] on 14 March, the  spokesman of that party announced that [PNTCD leader] Corneliu  Coposu will no longer continue the dialogue with the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Also on Monday, during his  news conference, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu said that, in  practical terms, a PDSR-CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]  alliance is impossible. Shortly before that, PDSR leader Adrian  Nastase also expressed skepticism as far as the effectiveness of  the dialogue with the CDR is concerned. From a practical point  of view, these declarations represent the official funeral of  the PDSR-opposition dialogue. I say the official funeral  because as a matter of fact, this dialogue died when the  government reshuffle was announced. At that moment it became  clear that the reshuffle would give a fatal blow to the delicate  process of rapprochement between the PDSR and the opposition,  first of all because the reshuffle defied one of the claims of  the CDR and the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)  [PD(FSN)] -- not to remove Nicolae Spiroiu from the helm of the  Ministry of National Defense -- and second, because the  reshuffle took place in the middle of the dialogue that had just  started between the PDSR and the opposition. The fact that the  PDSR proceeded to a government reshuffle without even bothering  to discuss it with the opposition represented clear proof that  the openness toward the right wing was not taken seriously by  Ion Iliescu's party. The idea of starting a dialogue between  the PDSR and the opposition parties was received with great  satisfaction and mainly with great hopes by the entire Romanian  society. Taking into consideration the dispute between the PDSR  and the nationalist-communist forces, the opening of this  dialogue justified the belief in a major change at all levels of  Romania's political life. While it was taking place, the  dialogue enjoyed the support of independent politicians,  journalists, and the public. A recent opinion poll by the IRSOP  [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Poll] shows that 60  percent of those who were questioned are in favor of a  government that includes both the PDSR and the opposition.  Taking into account also the possibility that this opinion  poll, just like all the others made by the IRSOP so far, might  be just a diversion, nevertheless the 60 percent rate shows us  that Romania's population views the dialogue between the PDSR  and the opposition favorably. The reason for the enthusiasm  brought about by the opening of dialogue can be found in the  complex reality currently prevailing in our country. It is clear  that, in spite of all the propaganda declarations made by Prime  Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and by some leaders of the ruling  party, the serious effects of a political-economic bottleneck  are being felt at all economic levels and by the whole society.  This bottleneck is the result of a slow but continuous change  within the ruling party. The PDSR started off as an  antireformist party in the electoral campaign and won elections  on this basis. Later the PDSR realized the domestic and  international realities that are resolutely demanding the  continuation of the reform. Even if it wanted to act  differently, the ruling party could not oppose some serious but  necessary decisions that have been taken in connection with  increases in prices, unemployment, and in the fiscal area. Due  to its move to the right, the ruling party came into  contradiction with its allies. The current majority coalition  is dominated by nationalist-communist forces. These forces  exist and are felt not only in the Greater Romania Party [PRM],  the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the Romanian National Unity  Party [PUNR], and the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania  [PDAR], but also in the PDSR. As a result of this, all the laws  of the reform have been voted with great difficulty in the  parliament. A significant number of similar laws are waiting in  vain to be discussed. The implementation of the laws of the  reform meets with serious opposition because of the bureaucracy  that engulfs the entire state apparatus and the leadership of  enterprises. This bureaucracy has gotten stronger and reached  spectacular proportions through the alliance of the PDSR with  the left-wing parties. The great majority of those who were  moved by the wave of the December 1989 revolution has been  removed. They were replaced by former second- and third-rate  nomenclatura members of the Ceausescu period. A bureaucratic  mentality is a typical characteristic of those former  nomenclatura members. This means that they are scared of  changes, they lack initiative, and have confidence -- something  they hide with difficulty -- in the economic centralism. From  all this, one can draw the conclusion that no matter how  reformist the ruling party might have become, its intentions are  hampered by an incontestable political reality, namely, the  nationalist-communist character of the majority coalition and  the useless but stubborn resistance of the bureaucratic forces  that are in the middle of a restoration process. Under these  conditions, the political-economic bottleneck is perfectly  explainable. Both economy and politics are virtually paralyzed.  The way out of the blockage could have been achieved only  through a new formula of parliamentary majority, a formula in  which the reformist forces would have dominated the coalition on  which the government relies. This parliamentary majority that  would have been established as a result of the PDSR-CDR and  PD(FSN) alliance would have had also the immense advantage of  boasting an overwhelming proportion in the parliament. The laws  of the reform would have been adopted much more rapidly and much  more efficiently. At the same time, the new coalition would have  created a new atmosphere throughout the entire Romanian society.  Under the power of the new political wave, the reformist forces  in our country would have gained courage, while the bureaucratic  and the antireformist forces would have lost ground.  Unfortunately, not only for our political life but also for the  whole Romanian social life, the PDSR-opposition dialogue did not  justify people's hopes. Was this the normal thing to happen?  Was it normal that the dialogue was not carried to the end?    I believe that, looking logically at our social and  political realities, the answer is affirmative. However, it is  fatal that the dialogue did not to continue. The real reasons  might be the following:    A. The presence of a gap between Ion Iliescu and the PDSR on  the one hand and the CDR-PD(FSN) on the other. In the years  that have passed since the December 1989 events, the  contradiction between the opposition and those who grabbed the  power has increased every day. In the beginning, the FSN and  later the PDSR arranged numerous acts of diversion against the  opposition and used the opposition as a target for violent  accusations. In turn, the opposition contested the legitimacy  of the new leadership and sometimes pleaded for its removal by  force. Under the specific conditions prevailing in Romania  after 1989 December events, the antagonism between the two  political forces overstepped the borders of a normal democratic  confrontation. The more so since in 1990 the battle reached the  level of "who is knocking out whom." At one point, each of the  two forces proposed to eliminate its rival. The fact that the  electorate that supported the two political forces polarized to  an amazing extent made things even more serious. Thus, a gap of  suspicion was created, not only between the two political forces  but also between the two electorates. This gap got broader when  the nationalist-communist forces made an appearance on our  political scene. The PDSR and Ion Iliescu did not have the  power to rapidly detach themselves from these forces.  Therefore, it seemed that the communist-nationalists were  talking in the name of the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. As a result of  it, the violent nature of the nationalist- communist attacks was  perceived by the opposition as coming from the PDSR and Ion  Iliescu. One can not easily overcome this gap. This was  admitted also by one of the PNTCD leaders at the end of the  first round of talks with the PDSR when he said that there is a  difficult psychological threshold to cross. This psychological  threshold belongs not only to the opposition but also to its  electorate. It is extremely difficult to convince your  supporters that it is possible to negotiate with the PDSR and  with Ion Iliescu, when after for years on end you told them that  the PDSR is a neo-communist party and Ion Iliescu must be  removed. However, reasoning in this way, it was still a mistake  to start a dialogue. It would have been much better if, in a  first stage, secret contacts would have been made, far from the  eyes of the public. Some compromise could have been reached,  without the sides having their own electorate breathing down  their necks. Likewise, the rapprochement between the PDSR and  the opposition should have started through temporary alliances,  discussions, and the voting of certain laws that would have been  convenient both for the moderate wing of the PDSR and the  opposition. Thus, a psychological ground would have been  prepared for the opening of an official dialogue. Since this is  not the way things were done, the shock of change of atmosphere  between the two political forces was strong enough to make the  two electorates apprehensive and to make the personal vanity and  interests come out in the forefront.    B. The confusion that continues to prevail within the ruling  party. It is clear that the reason for opening the dialogue was  the presence of a reformist group within the PDSR. This group  is aware of the internal and external danger posed by an  alliance with the nationalist-communist forces. Therefore,  through victory over the whole conservative majority, this group  forced the whole party to get closer to the CDR and distance  itself from the nationalist- communist forces. However, this  reformist group is a minority group within the PDSR. Apart from  being a minority group, it mainly includes opportunist  politicians, who are ready to do everything in order to stay in  power. Thus, the opening of a dialogue with the opposition took  place under difficult circumstances for the reformist group. It  would have been normal for this group to definitively win in the  party and put the conservative majority to its place. There  would even have been a chance for a part of the conservative  group to move toward the left-wing parties. Not being able to  win within the party, the reformist group saw in the opening of  a dialogue with the opposition an opportunity to strengthen its  position within the PDSR. Thus, the opening of the dialogue did  not take place prior to some clarifications in the government  party. The reformist group did not consider the opening of the  dialogue as the final stage in the process of clarifications,  but as a beginning of such a process. Thus, the reformist group  was compelled to hold negotiations with the opposition while  extreme pressure was being put on it by the conservative  majority, and through this majority by the whole PDSR. It is  easy to understand that, in such a situation, the reformist  group had small room for maneuver when it came to accepting  certain compromise with the opposition. That is the reason for  the sudden rigid position adopted by the PDSR during the  negotiations and for that party's apprehension that its move  closer to the opposition should not lead to the definitive  breach with nationalist-communist forces. It is more than  certain that any spectacular modification of the PDSR policy  would have caused the split of the party.    Being apprehensive about the policy promoted by the  reformist group, the conservatives would have filled the ranks  of the PRM, the PSM, and the PUNR. The reformist group would  have faced the risk of losing everything. On the one hand,  because of the psychological gap, the negotiations with the  opposition would have been dragged in time, while on the other  hand the PDSR would have lost its parliamentary majority.  Likewise, taking into consideration the opportunism of certain  leaders of the reformist group, it is easy to understand that,  at one point, they were afraid of the dialogue. The government  reshuffle was the signal that finally this group gave in. It  returned to the previously occupied positions, that is, a  minority position, compared with the majority of PDSR members  and the supporters of that party.    C. The lack of a strong left wing. As I have already  written, the PDSR and the CDR cannot establish an alliance  except when a new disturbing common adversary makes its  appearance. This adversary is none else than the a possible  PSM, PRM, PUNR, and PDAR alliance against the PDSR. However,  these parties are still rather weak and do not dare rise against  the strong protector of the PDSR, namely Ion Iliescu.  Therefore, their recent attempt to detach themselves from the  PDSR, an attempt that was expressed in the PRM leadership's  letter, was quite flimsy. At the first signs of anger showed by  the PDSR and Ion Iliescu, the left-wing allies rapidly calmed  down. Pretending to be satisfied that the reshuffle has solved  their interests, the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and the PDAR  returned to their previously set condition: to humiliate the  satellites of the ruling party. Since the PDSR did not have a  firm and unfailing response to its allies, it would have been a  mistake if it insisted to departing from the left wing and come  closer to the right wing. No matter how discrediting they are,  these allies are still preferable to the opposition. They are  pleased with small measures, while the opposition wants almost  everything. The common adversary of the PDSR and the CDR has  not made its appearance yet. It is still to be seen whether it  is able to appear soon.</p>

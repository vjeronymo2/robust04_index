			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN PARTNERS OFFER TO SWEETEN BID FOR DUNKIN' DONUTS IF LAWSUIT IS WON  </P> <P> A Canadian partnership removed some conditions Tuesday on its $296-million  hostile bid for Dunkin' Donuts and said it would raise the offer to $308  million if it wins a lawsuit challenging the doughnut shop chain's  anti-takeover measures.  </P> <P> DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara  Operations Ltd., said it would raise its price to $45 a share, from $43, if  Delaware's Chancery Court orders Dunkin' Donuts to rescind its employee stock  ownership plan and other defenses.  </P> <P> The Toronto-based partnership's offer originally was contingent on obtaining  75% of the doughnut company's shares. That offer, which was set to expire at  midnight Tuesday, was extended until Sept. 15 and is now contingent on  obtaining just 50.1%, or a bare majority, of the shares.  </P> <P> "What we are saying by dropping the minimum number of shares is that we're  prepared to buy a voting control position and hang around until we get actual  control, which could take a couple of years," said Eric W. Evans, a spokesman  for Kingsbridge.  </P> <P> Dunkin' Donuts, which is based in suburban Randolph, had no immediate response  to the revised offer. The reaction on Wall Street was lukewarm; Dunkin' Donuts  shares rose 37 1/2 cents to close at $37.87 1/2 in over-the-counter trading  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Kingsbridge, the merchant banking arm of investor George Mann's Unicorp Canada  Corp., offered a friendly merger with Dunkin' Donuts at $42 a share in May.  When it was rebuffed, it joined with Cara, the parent company of two Canadian  restaurant chains, to launch the $43-a-share hostile offer.  </P> <P> Dunkin' Donuts has set up a series of tough defenses, including the employee  stock ownership plan, which holds about 16% of its outstanding common shares.  </P> <P> It also has a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," designed to increase  the number of shares in the event of a takeover, making a merger prohibitively  expensive.  </P> <P> And it has sold $28 million of preferred stock, convertible to an 11% stake in  the company, to an avowedly friendly investor, General Electric Capital Corp.  </P> <P> Kingsbridge and Cara have filed suit in Delaware charging that the employee  stock plan and preferred stock sale were improperly put in place solely to  prevent a takeover. The Canadian partners also have asked the Chancery Court to  order Dunkin' Donuts to remove its poison pill.  </P> <P> Last week, the court refused to grant the partnership a preliminary injunction  against the takeover defenses. The case has not yet been scheduled to be heard  on its merits.  </P></p>

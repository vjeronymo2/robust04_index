			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Albanian Parliament  Speaker Pjeter Arbnori left here today for China for an official  visit at the invitation of the Chinese National People's  Congress (NPC).    Arbnori, who is making the first visit of its kind in about  20 years, will be the highest-ranking Albanian official to  travel to China since the Albanian Democratic Party came to  power in 1992.    In a recent interview with XINHUA, Arbnori said the visit  will offer him a chance to learn more about the NPC's work,  China's experience in building the legal system and the progress  in China's economy.</p>

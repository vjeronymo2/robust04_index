			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Russian news leaves Dow sharply lower Wall Street REPORTS yesterday afternoon of political turmoil in Russia sparked heavy selling of US equities, and left blue chip and cyclical stocks sharply lower at the end of trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 38.56 weaker at 3,537.24, but well above its low for the day of 3,507.07. Secondary indices fared better than the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 2.10 at 452.95, while the American SE composite shed 3.96 to 447.09 and the Nasdaq composite 6.65 to 733.56. Trading volume on the New York SE was 300m shares. Monday's big declines in stock and bond prices set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading yesterday. Fresh losses in bonds, and concern about the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, further depressed the market, which failed to respond to some rare good news from the housing market - a bigger than expected 7.8 per cent rise in August housing starts and a strong increase in building permits. Prices fell even further during the afternoon as reports emerged from Russia that President Yeltsin had unexpectedly dissolved parliament and called for new elections. Amid rumours of a possible move by the military to oust Mr Yeltsin, the Dow plummeted more than 70 points. Circuit breakers and late buying, however, helped prices to rally strongly from their lows. The big domestic story of the day was the emergence of the market's first billion-dollar bid battle since the 1980s. Paramount Communications, which only a week ago agreed to be bought by Viacom International, has attracted a rival bid from QVC, the home-shopping network. Late on Monday QVC made an offer for Paramount valued at Dollars 9.5bn, compared to Viacom's original Dollars 8.2bn bid. Amid speculation that a third contender might enter the fray - possibly Turner Broadcasting - Paramount's stock jumped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 77 in volume of 6.1m shares. The news left QVC, quoted on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 1/8 firmer at Dollars 56 7/8 and Viacom, listed on the American Stock Exchange, down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 56 3/4. Turner Broadcasting receded Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8. Among depressed cyclical stocks, Caterpillar fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 77, International Paper gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 60 1/4, Aluminum Company of America slipped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 and General Electric declined Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 96 3/8. Pharmaceuticals staged a recovery from Monday's losses. Merck gained Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 31 3/8, Pfizer Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 60 7/8, Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars 1 at Dollars 38 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 58 3/4. Tambrands dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 42 in heavy trading after the board announced that it had decided not to sell the company, and that instead it was embarking upon a restructuring of senior management. Canada TORONTO fell for the third consecutive day in heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended 15.5 off at 3,937.3 and declines led rises by 515 to 237 after volume of 73.9m shares. Of the 14 sub-group indices, only the golds sector bucked the downward trend, advancing 3.85 per cent as the New York spot bullion price surged USDollars 9.20 an ounce.</p>

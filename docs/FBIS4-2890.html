			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Robert Gallucci, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs,  says that sanctions against North Korea could be imposed if  Pyongyang refused to comply with International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) safeguards.    Gallucci issued the warning at a press conference here  Thursday following a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin  Huasun. "But we believe resolution (of the North Korean nuclear  issue) through dialogue is the best way," Gallucci said.    He noted that IAEA Director-general Hans Blix is to report  on  the problem to the U.N. Security Council next month. The council  will then discuss follow-up measures including sanctions if no  progress is made in the IAEA's efforts to inspect North Korean  facilities, he said.    Gallucci said he has exchanged views not only on the nuclear  row but also on overall security on the Korean peninsula with  Chinese Government officials. The talks were productive and  helpful, Gallucci said, adding that he gives high marks to the  Chinese Government's position. He thus hinted that China was  playing a more active role in trying to influence Pyongyang than  generally thought.    Gallucci said he will continue to have close consultations  with China, Japan and South Korea on the North Korean problem.  He said a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks  could be held if Pyongyang honored its agreement with Washington  reached in New York on Feb. 25, which set two conditions --  acceptance of IAEA inspections and inter-Korean dialogue on  exchanging special envoys.    Asked what the United States would do if China opposed U.N.  economic sanctions against North Korea, Gallucci refused to  speculate on how individual Security Council members would act.    Winding up a three-day visit to China, Gallucci is scheduled  to leave for Seoul Friday.</p>

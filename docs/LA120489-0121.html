			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FDA'S FOOT-DRAGGING ON ALZHEIMER'S DRUG IS PUZZLING  </P> <P> Question: My dad, who lives with me, has Alzheimer's. He had reached the point  where he was disoriented most of the time, especially at night. He would wander  off, and sometimes we'd find him miles from home. But he couldn't find the  bathroom in the house and talked nonsense most of the time.  </P> <P> I managed to get some THA on the "black market" and since starting on it, he  has improved so much that we are in shock! He is never disoriented now and his  sense of humor and joy in family and life are back. It is truly an amazing  difference.  </P> <P> Papa's doctor is monitoring him for elevated liver enzymes, but no problems  have come up. I am angry that this medication isn't readily available, and that  it costs so much the way we have to smuggle it in. When will the FDA allow us  easier access to this lifeline?  </P> <P> Answer: That is a question we too have asked, but the Food and Drug  Administration has failed to answer. Although most patients with Alzheimer's  disease probably won't respond as dramatically to THA as your father has, there  have been enough reports of improvement to warrant speedier action.  </P> <P> Three years have passed since Dr. William Summers reported his landmark study  on THA for Alzheimer's patients. Since then millions of people have continued  to suffer and deteriorate like your father did.  </P> <P> The FDA has a mechanism for allowing access to unapproved medications that seem  promising for life-threatening conditions like AIDS or cancer. We don't  understand why the agency has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of Alzheimer's  victims and their families.  </P> <P> Q. My husband is a pediatrician and washes his hands between every patient. His  hands get very dry and rough this time of year. Last winter he started using  Lac-Hydrin lotion at the office, and that helped a lot.  </P> <P> He recently asked me to replenish his supply. To my astonishment, I discovered  it is available by prescription only. Why is a moisturizer a prescription  product?  </P> <P> A. Lac-Hydrin is also our favorite lotion for dry, cracked skin. The  manufacturer has apparently positioned it as prescription only, even though the  active ingredient (alpha-hydroxy acid) is also available at lower strength in  over-the-counter products like LactiCare and Aqua Glycolic Lotion.  </P></p>

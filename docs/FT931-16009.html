			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / No easy solution to spills at sea: Measures to prevent shipping accidents have failings Gales and bad weather continued to hamper the clean-up process yesterday after the oil tanker, Braer, crashed on rocks to the south of the Shetland Isles on Tuesday. While salvage crews lost hope of boarding the stricken vessel this weekend to pump out oil, environmentalists and opposition MPs demanded to know why two similar disasters should have happened in European waters in the past month. The tanker Aegean Sea broke up off the coast of north-west Spain in early December, causing widespread environmental pollution. In the wake of both disasters, the EC is looking at tightening rules governing tanker traffic. Politicians in the UK are calling on the government to widen the inquiry into the cause of the Braer wreck to cover tanker safety in general. Are tougher controls needed, or would they only further burden an industry which is vital to the world economy, yet labouring under the pressures of recession and low oil prices? The oil and shipping industries are already campaigning against new controls. They point out that tougher regulation - and declining tanker traffic - has meant that the amount of oil spilled at sea has been steadily declining throughout the 1980s. The number of accidental spills has risen in the past couple of years, but remains much lower than in 1974. The oil lobby argues that some spills are inevitable. However the economics of the business has also deteriorated with the sharp fall in freight rates, raising the question of whether forced economies contributed to the recent spate of incidents. Shipping organisations estimate, for example, that freight rates would have to increase three-fold from their current level of about Dollars 15,000 a day for an average vessel to provide shipowners with an adequate return on new investment. Scrap values have also fallen so low that tanker owners may find it more economic to keep ageing ships than to sell them to shipbreakers. Numast, the maritime officers union, maintains that out of the ships checked in British ports in 1991, more than half were found to have defects that could affect the safe operation of the vessels. 'There has been savage cost-cutting in world shipping, particularly in the tanker industry, and we are paying the price for it with a declining safety record,' said Mr Andrew Linington at Numast. Tanker owners agree the ageing of the world's fleet has resulted in more defects. But they say that freight rates have been forced down to such a low level that they cannot afford to modernise their fleets. 'A shipowner is responsible for maintaining his ships at high standard, but he must be given the means to do so,' said Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman of Intertanko, the independent tanker owners' association. There are also signs that cost-cutting has led to the use of cheaper and poorly trained crews. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, 80 per cent of tanker accidents can be traced to human error. Standards of training colleges in countries such as the Philippines, which contributes more seafarers to the world fleet than any other country, vary widely. Although there are international certificates of seamanship, the fact that they are awarded locally makes it hard to enforce uniform standards. If the investigation now underway concludes that the Braer disaster was due to more than bad luck, neither the distressed state of the industry nor its improving record will check public pressure for better controls. Several potential areas for action are being debated. Given the central role played by human error in accidents, maritime unions and shipping representatives demand an improvement in training standards. Such standards are set by the International Maritime Organisation - the United Nations body responsible for regulations on world shipping. But the organisation accepts that its rules, last amended in 1978, are out of date. The IMO is considering updating its training requirements. But this is a lengthy process and could take several years. In the meantime, maritime bodies such as the International Shipping Federation are involved in regional efforts to improve standards, but there has been little co-ordination. However, the IMO has managed to reach a broad consensus on changes to tanker design that will improve safety. Under rules recently passed, it requires all new tankers to be built with double hulls - an extra protective casing which can help to contain spills in an accident - or similar pollution control measures. Under the same new regulations, all tankers older than 25 years must be refitted with additional pollution control measures after 1995. All the proposals have shortcomings. Double hulls would prevent some disasters, but would probably have been irrelevant in the Braer's case, given the force of the waves throwing the boat onto the rocks. Double hulls can also cause other safety problems, such as the build-up of dangerous gases between the inner and outer hull, which could result in an explosion. Worry and frustration about low international standards has led some countries to consider their own regulations, raising fears on the part of tanker owners that a patchwork of different national standards will emerge. The US is the only country to have passed its own rules, which are tougher than the IMO's standards. These were devised in response to the Exxon Valdez oil disaster in 1989. They stipulate that after the next 15 years all ships calling at US ports must have double hulls. The US has also introduced unlimited liability on tanker owners for the entire costs of cleaning up an oil spill and for compensating people whose livelihoods are affected by a spill. Yesterday, European politicians took a step closer to the American model by urging the EC to restrict dangerous cargoes passing through its waters and to adopt improved standards for shipbuilding. Even before the Shetland wreck, the UK had banned loaded tankers through the Minches - the channel separating the Hebrides from the Scottish mainland - for environmental and safety reasons. Present IMO guidelines also advise tankers to keep 10 miles away from the Shetland coast. Environmentalists and opposition MPS would like the UK to put pressure on the EC to ban ships in the region. Route restriction would go some way towards appeasing the environmentalists, and might be enforceable even on a financially precarious oil industry. But the past decade's international experience of trying to tighten regulation and encourage the oil industry to take more care shows that there are no easy solutions.</p>

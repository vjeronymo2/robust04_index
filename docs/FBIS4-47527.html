V. Voshchinnikov and V. G. Farafonov; St. </F> Petersburg University and St. Petersburg Institute of Aviation  Instrument Manufacturing; manuscript submitted 29 Dec 92;  resubmitted after revision 5 May 93; UDC 551.593]    [Abstract] A precise theory of light scattering by  spheroidal particles was used to study the unique  characteristics of radiation scattering by atmospheric aerosol.  The new method utilizes the separation of variables to solve the  problem of electromagnetic plane wave diffraction by a  homogeneous spheroid and is considerably more efficient from a  computational standpoint than the method devised by Asano and  Yamamoto. The expressions for scattered radiation intensity are  elaborated within the framework of a rigorous solution for both  severely oblate and severely prolate spheroids. Numerical  results obtained for ice particles with different shapes and  wave lengths of 10.6 m are discussed. On the basis of the  adduced calculations, it was concluded that the average light  scattering indicatrix is smoother for oblate than for prolate  particles. As a rule, the albedo of the oblate particles was  somewhat greater than for prolate particles of the same volume.  Changing the imaginary part of the index of refraction for the  substance of the particles has virtually no bearing on the  behavior of the normalized functions of the scattering  indicatrix, but does affect the magnitude of the particle  albedo. The polarization of the scattered radiation varies  markedly with changes in particle shape. However, in some cases,  prolate spheroids could be substituted for infinite circular  cylinders. The findings of this study provide a basis for  conducting optical atmospheric sounding experiments that would  make it possible to determine the degree of sphericity of the  scattering particles and their spatial orientation.

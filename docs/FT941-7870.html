			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Standard Life likely to accept new watchdog Standard Life, one of the UK's leading insurers, is almost certain to sign up for the proposed new financial services watchdog in spite of its earlier preference for full statutory regulation. Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director and a former board member of the proposed Personal Investment Authority, said there was only 'an outside chance' that the company would reject the PIA and insist on being regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. He resigned as a PIA director in January over the decision that people working in the financial services industry should not make up a majority of the board, but yesterday highlighted the Treasury's commitment that the PIA should come into existence. 'We will make the best of life the way it is,' he said. 'We will certainly not be making futile gestures.' Mr Stretton added that the only basis on which Standard Life would seek to be SIB-regulated was if it was clear that the PIA faced 'masses of opposition and a community of view (in the industry) about what should happen'. While his comments will be welcomed by the PIA, his view that the establishment of the new regulator did not mean the end of the argument about the direction of regulation is likely to be less welcome. He also highlighted the PIA's costs - involving 18 per cent fee increases - and its streamlined committee structure, which omits a general 'practitioner panel', as two elements likely to cause concern. There were signs of more vigorous opposition to the PIA from the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers which intends today to compare the PIA prospectus with its own charter of seven consumers' rights. It is already clear that the prospectus will not measure up in all respects.</p>

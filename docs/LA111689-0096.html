			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH SWEEPS PAST EL CAMINO REAL, ADVANCES TO FINAL  </P> <P> The top-seeded Chatsworth High girls' volleyball team, despite a 2-0 games lead  against El Camino Real on Wednesday night at Venice High, did not look like a  team about to advance to the City Section 4-A Division final.  </P> <P> During the third game, setter Kris Bassler felt nervous. Middle blocker Lori  Mertes began to panic. Coach Steve Berk wore an expression that said, "Uh-oh."  </P> <P> Maybe the anxiety stemmed from the fact that Chatsworth knew its Northwest  Valley Conference rival as well as a friendly neighbor and recalled losing to  El Camino Real after taking a two-game advantage three weeks ago.  </P> <P> But Chatsworth regained its poise after a 13-4 third-game lead had been  whittled down to 14-10, and the Chancellors won the semifinal match, 15-12,  15-12, 15-10, to become the first Valley-area team ever to make it to the 4-A  final.  </P> <P> "The girls were really convinced they could win," a relieved Berk said.  "Sometimes they have more confidence than me."  </P> <P> The Chancellors (14-2), led by Lori Mertes' 13 kills and Marie Mariano's 11,  had their confidence shaken during the third game against the fourth-seeded  Conquistadores (13-3).  </P> <P> "They really scared us and we started to freak out," said Mertes of the third  game. "But we knew if we stuck together, we would win."  </P> <P> Persistance also paid off for the Chancellors in the first and second games.  Tied, 12-12, in the second game, Chatsworth rallied on a Mertes kill, a Bassler  service ace, and a Conquistadore error.  </P> <P> El Camino Real led, 12-8, in the first game before Chatsworth scored the final  seven points, three coming on Mariano kills. Rachel Berger led El Camino Real  with 13 kills and Lori Dinaberg added seven. Bassler had 20 assists for  Chatsworth.  </P></p>

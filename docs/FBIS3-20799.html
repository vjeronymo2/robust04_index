The following includes the  amended or added provisions, with deletions from the 1989 law  appearing between slashes /.../, and new provisions, or changes  in existing provisions in bold italics.]    [Text]    1. The following provisions shall replace  Paragraphs 30.1. and 30.2 of Law No. 34 of 1989 on the election  of National Assembly representatives, as amended by Law No. 2 of  1990:    ``30.1. Local councils or [local council] executive  committees shall elect the secretaries and two members of  returning boards, based on proposals submitted by council  executive committee secretaries, in due regard to persons  suggested by the various parties. In every local jurisdiction,  each party fielding candidates, and each independent candidate  running in the elections shall designate one additional member  to serve on the returning board. Several parties and independent  candidates may jointly designate members to serve on returning  boards. If in any local jurisdiction the parties and independent  candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on the  returning board, the local council or the executive  committee shall elect three or four additional persons to  serve on the returning board, so that the returning board is  composed of five members.    ``30.2. The municipal council of Budapest, and the councils  of various counties, or the executive committees of these  councils shall elect the secretaries and two members of  individual and regional voting district election boards, based  on proposals submitted by the respective council executive  committee secretaries, in due regard to recommendations made by  the various parties. In every jurisdiction, each party fielding  candidates, and each independent candidate running in the  elections shall designate one additional member to the election  boards. If in any jurisdiction the parties and independent  candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on an  election board, the local council or its executive  committee shall elect three or four additional persons, so  that the election board is composed of five members.    2. The following provisions shall replace  Paragraphs 53.1. and 53.2:    ``53.1. The minister of the interior shall direct the  organizing and technical implementation of state functions  related to the elections, and the activities of  working groups operating alongside the administrative boards /,  as well as the computerized vote tallying system./ The minister  of the interior shall present a report concerning these  activities at a [plenary] session of the National Assembly.    ``53.2. Deadlines, and starting and ending dates specified  in  this Law shall be expressed in terms of calendar dates,  and the order of tallying votes shall be provided in the  form of a decree promulgated by the minister of the interior,  and published by the press.''    3. This law shall take effect upon its  proclamation.    [In lieu of signatures] Dr. Arpad Goncz, president  of the Republic; Gyorgy Szabad, acting president  of the National Assembly  <H6>  LEGISLATIVE INTENT </H6>   1. The expeditious administration of elections  within the constraints of legality demands that the number of  members of the administrative boards involved in the elections  (returning boards, individual and regional voting district  election boards) amounts to at least the minimum number of  members required by law. The mandates of members of  administrative boards could cease for various reasons, and this  could hinder the functioning of administrative boards in the  course of elections. The law provides for the replacement of  members who have dropped out, only on the basis of decisions by  council bodies. Council bodies generally hold meetings once  every three months. For this reason it is appropriate to also  authorize council executive committees to supplement the  membership of administrative boards, because council executive  committees meet more frequently.    2. The computerized vote tallying system is an  extremely costly method to tally votes. For this reason it is  appropriate to provide a simpler method for the tallying of  small volumes of data. Therefore, it is appropriate to authorize  the minister of the interior to decree--immediately before the  elections--the order for tallying votes. The decree must be  publicized in the press.</p>

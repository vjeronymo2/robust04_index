			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: A DELAYED VACATION  </P> <P> When I awakened and saw the pearly sky above the alarm clock that had failed to  ring, I knew I'd missed my flight.  </P> <P> I shouted, bit my lip, punched my pillow.  </P> <P> Then I sat up and faced facts: because of close connections between San Diego  and the British Virgin Islands, my short vacation was in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Even worse, I was flying to Tortola in the Virgin Islands to go sailing with  friends. My delay would affect their plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Check Available Space  </P> <P> I dialed American Airlines and confessed. They were polite, but said that  nothing could be settled by telephone: I must present myself at the airport  within two hours. They would have to check available space for an upgrade to  first-class, even with my thousands of American Advantage miles.  </P> <P> I had carefully packed the night before and laid out the clothes I would wear:  an eggplant denim skirt and jacket over a white linen shirt. A broad-brimmed  straw hat, a string bag and pale beige flats. After dressing, I turned up my  car heater and drove to Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> The airport was quiet. The morning rush had ended. The ticket agent, who took  to his computer to see what could be done, was like a professor who wanted to  let me make up a missed exam. He read his monitor, clucked and shook his head.  He punched more numbers.  </P> <P> "This happens most often when people are going on vacation," he said. "They  relax a little early. People rarely miss business trips."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overnight Necessary  </P> <P> I could start toward Tortola, it turned out, but I would have to overnight in  Dallas or San Juan, Puerto Rico. The agent suggested waiting 24 hours, and this  time getting it right.  </P> <P> I pocketed my new ticket and thanked him for his help. I wondered what to do  next. I had said goodby to the office. I had cut off my chance to return home  immediately by arranging for carpet cleaners that day.  </P> <P> I straightened my straw hat, buttoned my cotton jacket against the February  chill and drove to the harbor-front cluster of shops and cafes known as Seaport  Village.  </P> <P> It was early. Parking was easy. At the bookshop-coffeehouse of Upstart, Crow  &amp; Co. I ordered a tall cup of mocha espresso. I eavesdropped on the patter  of passers-by, happy tourists who had arrived at their destination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shopping Spree  </P> <P> Then I remembered the slogan: "When the going gets tough, the tough go  shopping." I headed for the bright lights of Nordstrom.  </P> <P> A salesperson with curly dark hair said she liked my straw hat. I admitted that  I had planned to be on my way to the Caribbean at that hour but had missed the  flight.  </P> <P> She was sympathetic. Last fall she had missed a plane to Miami, which meant  that she missed a cruise ship bound for Mexico. A travel agent gave her the  wrong flight time. To try to recoup some vacation she flew to Cozumel, Mexico.  </P> <P> "There I was, standing on the beach in the wind and the rain, waiting for my  ship to come in," she said. "It got nearer and nearer and then it began backing  away. It was that hurricane -- Gilbert -- and the ship could not dock.  </P> <P> "The worst part was what happened when I went back to the resort and looked for  the ladies' room. There was a pool of crocodiles just outside the door. With  the winds and the heavy rains, the water level was up and the crocodiles were  trying to crawl out."  </P> <P> She began laughing at the memory. She reminded me that I was on vacation, even  though I had not yet left town.  </P> <P> I checked the movie listings at Horton Plaza and settled for a midweek matinee  with four sailors and a couple of elderly shoppers.  </P> <P> The film fit the occasion: "The Accidental Tourist."  </P></p>

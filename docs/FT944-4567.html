			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / EU set to back Eko Stahl aid European Union ministers are expected today to approve DM910m (Pounds 370m) in state aid for Eko Stahl, east Germany's biggest steelmaker, after the UK dropped its objections. Under pressure from the British steel industry, the UK had argued that the subsidies were not accompanied by adequate reductions in capacity and delayed a deal on the lossmaking plant. However, extensive bilateral talks between the UK and Germany appear to have yielded a solution, with the Germans offering to reduce the extent of commercial loan guarantees given. But while officials in Brussels were last night optimistic that the Eko Stahl deal would be finalised today, there is a chance that Greece will produce a new stumbling block. At a meeting between representatives from the member states in Brussels last night, the Greeks attempted to hold an Eko Stahl deal hostage to subsidy concessions on a Greek shipyard being prepared for privatisation. The Greek move follows action by France to link its approval of the steel aid to a separate dispute over an international pact to cut shipbuilding subsidies. Such behaviour - not confined to Greece and France - was fiercely criticised by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who said he had never seen so many hostages being taken by individual member states. 'It is an indication of the deterioration of the climate in the European Union,' he said. Approval of the Eko Stahl aid will open the way for the takeover and modernisation of the plant by the Belgian steelmaker Cockerill Sambre. It has agreed to pay DM30m for a 60 per cent stake in the enterprise and intends to invest a further DM440m in modernising the mill's blast furnace and building a hot-rolling mill. Apart from the German state aid, the deal involves privatisation of Eko Stahl. Capacity cuts will take place at other east German plants. The UK's objections stemmed from a fear that the aid agreed for the Cockerill Sambre takeover was worth more than that agreed last year with Riva of Italy, which eventually withdrew. It appears that the Germans have agreed to lower the level of guarantees for commercial loans from the original DM200m. Yesterday a UK official said it had sought a reduction to under DM100m.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Sales boost retail volumes: CBI sounds cautious note on 'patchy' improvement in figures AN EARLY start to summer discount sales underpinned the sixth monthly rise in retail sales in June, with the largest shops benefiting most from buoyant consumer activity. The Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday that in the year to June, sales volumes grew at their fastest rate since April 1990. The percentage balance of those retailers reporting an increase in sales minus those reporting a fall, rose to 30 per cent compared with 18 per cent in May and minus 3 per cent in June last year. Yet Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the recent improvement in retail trade was 'patchy', with smaller chain stores and single shops reporting trade levels still below those of last year. 'Though retailers expect a further increase in July, we need to be cautious as expectations have not been fully met in previous surveys,' he said. The news was less encouraging for motor traders. They reported falling sales for the second month in succession compared with a year ago, confounding earlier expectations of a rise. The CBI, in its monthly distributive trades survey, reported that as a result of the drop in car sales, orders placed with suppliers have been reduced and stock levels remain 'adequate' to meet expected demand. Wholesalers fared particularly well in June. Sales rose for the fourth consecutive month and were above normal for the time of year. The survey, conducted between June 15 and July 7, covered 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and motor trading. Its findings also included: Orders and stocks. Although orders placed by retailers with suppliers have been increasing at a slower rate than the volume of sales, the level of stocks has risen. The balance of retailers reporting that the level of stocks in relation to expected demand is more than adequate has risen from 14 per cent to 26 per cent. Stock levels were described by retailers as the most 'excessive' since April last year, suggesting a degree of caution about future sales. Food and drink. Grocers reported a sharp increase in sales in the year to June, as indicated by a strong balance of 43 per cent. They reported sales to be above normal for the time of year for the first time in 12 months. Off-licences reported another significant fall in sales in the year to June. Sales have fallen sharply for every month in the past year. The CBI said off-licences have been gradually losing market share to supermarkets, an effect compounded this year by big price reductions in the larger stores. Clothing and footwear. There was a substantial increase in clothing sales in the year to June, although shoe shops reported an even greater increase. In spite of the good performance last month, both sectors report sales below normal for the time of year. Chemists. This sector continued to report an improvement in sales, and increased the orders placed with suppliers in the year to June. Household goods. After a strong monthly performance, sales are now slightly above normal for the time of year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FASTEST GROWTH SINCE APRIL 1990: ANNUAL SALES VOLUMES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992                      Jun '92   Jul   Aug   Sept   Oct   Nov   Dec  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grocers                       +10    +3     0     +1   +19    +2   +34 Specialist food               -62   -54   -65    -50   -28   -24   -67 Off-licences                  +10    -3   -88   -100   -56   -47   -40 Clothing                       +8   -25   -27    +42    -8   -18    +2 Footwear and leather           +1   -30   +68    +39   -49   +11   +11 Durable household goods       -50   -10    -2    -11    -1   -10   -18 Furniture and carpets          -2   -43   +33    +48   -12   +15    -3 Hardware, china &amp; DIY         -10   -28   -22    -52   +11   -38   -33 Confectionery                 +39   +26   -57    +37    +4     0   +21 Booksellers &amp; stationers      -61    -9   -18     -1   -39   -53   -39 Chemists                      +62   +36   +20    -28   +58   +79    +6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                          Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   Mar   Jun  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grocers                       +44   +30   +42   +24   +21   +43 Specialist food               -11   -13    -3   -31   +49   +18 Off-licences                  -49   -11   -24   -26   -35   -35 Clothing                      +19   +10   +27   +24    -1   +40 Footwear and leather          +28   +74   +37   +43   -55   +43 Durable household goods        -4    +5    +1   +23   +37   +10 Furniture and carpets         -35   +48   +40   +27   +34   +54 Hardware, china &amp; DIY          +6    +6   +46   +29    +3    -5 Confectionery                 -31   +12   +36   +10   +20    +3 Booksellers &amp; stationers      -18   -12    +4   +47   +46   -37 Chemists                      +66   +48   -12   +44   +27   +44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance = % reporting an increase minus the % reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year ago  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

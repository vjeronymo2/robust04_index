			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bayer to pursue control of US brand Germany's Bayer group is to press on with its bid to regain control of the Bayer brand in the US, in spite of yesterday's takeover of Sterling Winthrop, which owns American rights to the name and the cross-shaped trademark. The company said yesterday it would seek 'clarification' from the new owner, SmithKline Beecham of the UK, which has agreed to pay Kodak Dollars 2.93bn cash for its Sterling self-medication subsidiary. Bayer, which had also bid, said it was still interested in 'parts' of Sterling's over-the-counter business in the US, and wanted to discuss the issue of trademark rights. One of the main attractions is the branded aspirin business (the analgesic was invented by Bayer), which generates sales of Dollars 150m a year in the US. Mr Manfred Schneider, the German group's chairman, has said in the past he would swim the Atlantic if it could win him back the rights requisitioned and auctioned by the US government along with the Bayer business during the first world war. However, signs of a tough auction emerged earlier this month, when Mr Schneider said he would pay only a limited premium for the Sterling operations. 'We do not absolutely need the trademark,' he said then. Win or lose, the company said expansion of its non-prescription medicines remained a priority, especially in the US. It is currently represented there by Miles, based in Pittsburgh, which last year had sales of Dollars 6.5bn. According to Fortune magazine, Miles is the 84th biggest industrial company in the US. Bayer extended its reach in the US market earlier this year when it paid Dollars 310m for a minority stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned generic drug specialist. Generics - or out-of-patent products - represent one of the fastest growing segments in pharmaceutical markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Pu Sothirak, minister of  industry, energy, and mines received a delegation from China's  Guangdong Province led by Deputy Governor Liu Weiming at his  office on the morning of 2 April. The excellency said his  ministry plans to cooperate closely with the PRC, especially  with Guangdong, which is a well-developed province. This is  because the ministry has a number factories donated by the  Chinese Government that has now become dilapidated and  inoperative and needs urgent investment.    Liu Weiming disclosed that he intends to build a power plant  in Sihanoukville and factories to produce furniture and process  sugar to meet the people's need and for export. He added that  he also wants to help build bridges and import construction  materials to Cambodia.</p>

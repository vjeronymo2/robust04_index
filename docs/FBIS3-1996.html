			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has made a big  stride in reforming its statistical report system. Following  the implementation of a new report system for state statistics  this year, the State Statistical Bureau will, thanks to the new  report system, be able to know the operation of the market  economy from statistical information which it regularly collects  from grass-roots statistical organs. The implementation of this  new system signifies a transformation in China's statistical  work; statistical work, which was adapted to a planned economy  in the past, will now serve a market economy.    The State Statistical Bureau devised this new state  statistical report system in line with the requirement for  establishing a socialist market economic system and following  the revision and simplification of various specialized  statistical report systems and of various statistical targeting  systems. This new statistical report system enabled the  Statistical Bureau to carry out a major reform of the  statistical targeting system; to unify standards in statistical  work; to smooth out the relationship between specialized  statistical departments; to correct the defects of  compartmentalization and dislocation formed under a planned  economic system which have long plagued specialized statistical  departments; and to raise the level of standardization and the  regularization of the statistical system as a whole. This new  state statistical report system features eight sets of basic  statistical report forms for enterprises, institutions,  administrative units, and fixed-asset investment units, as well  as relevant composite statistical report forms. To coordinate  with the application of the new statistical report forms, the  Statistical Bureau has also set standards for statistical  investigation units, devised a "category and zip code" system  for various trades and professions in the national economy, and  formulated other statistical standards.    A statistics expert pointed out that marketing has been made  the centerpiece of the target structure in the new state  statistical report system and that the past emphasis on  gathering information that reflected the speed of the generation  of output value and output amount has now shifted to an emphasis  that stresses the collection of information that reflects  efficiency -- namely, an emphasis on collecting information on  the relations between input and output, on exchange and  distribution, on the accumulation of surpluses, on production  and marketing, on people, on assets, and on goods. This kind of  statistical report should help permit the better understanding  of the operations of enterprises which are the main players in  market transactions from the angle of macrodecision-making and  macroeconomic regulation and control.</p>

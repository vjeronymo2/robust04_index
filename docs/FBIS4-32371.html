			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, ROMPRES, 22/6/1994 -- Polish-Romanian  relations are based on good, centuries-old traditions, Poland's  Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Olechowski told a ROMPRES  correspondent on the eve of the visit to Warsaw of Romania's  Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu.    "Over the past few years our relations have been normal,  without any tensions or problems, although the contacts at  various levels have not been very intense," the chief of the  Polish diplomacy said.    "Poland wishes that our countries could give a more  substantial core to their bilateral cooperation, mainly in the  economic sphere. One must openly admit that in this respect  Polish-Romanian cooperation is dissatisfactory, and that we must  act together towards improving this state of things. That is  why Mr. Melescanu and I shall sign two important agreements that  will ensure the legal background apt to dynamism the economic  exchanges. We shall also sign a cultural agreement. The  dialogue Poland and Romania are having can be very important in  the context of the general search for means to ensure security  and stability in our region. Our countries have both signed the  documents of the Partnership for Peace. I am sure this is a  good basis for a fruitful exchange of views and swap of  experience in this field too."</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: A taste of funny What would Sir Adrian Cadbury - lead author of the eponymous report on Corporate Governance and former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes - make of brother Dominic's promotion to the executive chairmanship of the firm founded under the family crest? 'He would approve wouldn't he?' says Dominic in the good knight's absence, seeing nothing odd in the fact that the confectionery and beverages outfit now has both an executive chairman and a group chief executive. True, he stresses that David Wellings, the new chief executive who has only been with the firm since 1986, will be the 'ultimate decision-maker'. But it will take a very strong chief executive to stand up to a member of the fifth generation of the founding family who has been on the board since 1974 and has been running the shop for the last decade. While Dominic deserves the benefit of the doubt in view of the group's rejuvenation under his leadership, the move leaves a funny taste - fudge-like, perhaps.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SECRECY KEEPS CLOUD OF DOUBT OVER MENGELE DEATH  </P> <P> Nearly four years after remains unearthed from a Brazilian cemetery were  identified as those of Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious Auschwitz death camp  doctor, the U.S. government refuses to close its books and make public its  final report on the case.  </P> <P> The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations has rejected requests  by a Holocaust survivors group and by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los  Angeles to release the lengthy report under the federal Freedom of Information  Act.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Wiesenthal Center, who  believes the remains are those of Mengele. "Keeping the report a secret  perpetuates a conspiracy theory."  </P> <P> Indeed, fueled in part by government secrecy, theories persist that Mengele may  still be alive.  </P> <P> Those who subscribe to this view say the bones dug up from a cemetery near Sao  Paulo, Brazil, in 1985 and examined by six renowned forensic experts were not  those of Mengele after all, but were part of an elaborate hoax.  </P> <P> The experts, however, insist that the evidence is clear: Mengele died in 1979  and those are his bones.  </P> <P> Among those who dispute the experts are:  </P> <P>  -- Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who once agreed with the experts but who now  says, "I see the whole matter of Mengele in absolutely another light. . . . It  was too perfect."  </P> <P>  -- Menachem Russek, chief Nazi war crimes investigator for the Israeli  government, who reportedly has written a 60-page memorandum contending that the  experts who examined the remains were misled by a sophisticated  sleight-of-hand. Like the United States, the Israeli government has kept its  casebook on Mengele open and has refused to make its report public.  </P> <P> Wiesenthal, in public, and Russek, in private, point to a meeting that is said  to have taken place in Bavaria in 1982 at the home of Dr. Hans Munch, a Mengele  associate at Auschwitz. Present were Mengele's longtime friend and courier,  Hans Sedlmeier, and a Mengele nephew, Dieter Mengele.  </P> <P> At the gathering -- which occurred three years after Mengele's family said he  had died -- Sedlmeier asked Munch what would happen if Mengele turned himself  in to authorities, according to an intelligence source account of the meeting  provided to the United States, Israel and West Germany.  </P> <P> "That does not fit into the logical conclusions" about Mengele's reported  death, said Hans-Eberhard Klein, who heads the Bonn government's investigation  of the case. Klein said Munch and Sedlmeier were questioned about the meeting,  but he declined further comment.  </P> <P> West Germany, however, is eager to resolve the matter. In a telephone interview  from his Frankfurt office, Klein told The Times that he has invited Russek and  Neal Sher, head of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations,  to meet with him in Frankfurt the week of March 20 in an effort to sort out the  Mengele controversy.  </P> <P> Klein also disclosed that he is considering trying to use a new DNA genetic  "fingerprinting" test to determine if the skeleton is Mengele's.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sample of Cells  </P> <P> The new technique relies on the fact that everyone's DNA (deoxyribonucleic  acid), the biologic makeup of genes, is unique. To make a "fingerprint,"  scientists take a sample of cells from an organism -- a single hair or a bone  -- and then extract the DNA for analysis.  </P> <P> Klein talked of taking "bones, parts of teeth or hair roots," taken from the  remains disinterred in Brazil and now in the hands of German forensic experts,  and analyzing them with a view toward determining if genetic tests can be  performed.  </P> <P> Although he said he has "no great doubt" that Mengele is dead, Klein said that  if Simon Wiesenthal and the Israelis "have serious doubts, then I will  investigate them."  </P> <P> The OSI's Sher, who also believes that Mengele died in Brazil, declined to  discuss in any detail why he will not close the case and make public his  report, except to suggest that diplomatic considerations are among his reasons.  He would not elaborate. In the meantime, the ghost of Josef Mengele, the  infamous "Angel of Death," lives on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Born in Bavaria  </P> <P> Born in 1911 in the small Bavarian community of Gunzburg, Mengele was the  eldest of three sons of Karl and Walburga Mengele. His father prospered in the  farm machinery business and, today, Karl Mengele &amp; Sons is the town's  primary employer and one of West Germany's largest firms.  </P> <P> After studying philosophy at Munich University, Mengele went to Frankfurt where  he studied medicine. Attracted to Adolf Hitler's racial purity theories, he  joined the Nazi party and, at 22, was on the staff of the Institute of  Hereditary Biology and Race Research.  </P> <P> According to the records of the Wiesenthal Center, in 1939 Mengele joined the  Waffen SS, the military arm of the Schutzstaffel, which had been formed as  Hitler's personal bodyguard. In 1943, he was promoted to captain and appointed  chief medical officer at the Auschwitz prisoner camp in southern Poland.  </P> <P> By any historical measure, Auschwitz was a ghastly killing ground. Although  exact numbers will never be available, about 4 million men, women and children  -- the vast majority Jews -- were systematically exterminated at the camp  through gassing, shooting, lethal injections and disease. Piles of corpses were  burned daily in the camp's crematoria.  </P> <P> It was Mengele, according to survivor accounts, who often met the cattle  car-like trains filled with prisoners. Standing at attention and immaculately  dressed in his SS uniform, he would wait on Auschwitz's train ramp as the cars  unloaded and, with a flick of his index finger to the right or left, determined  who would live and who would die.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Twins a Passion  </P> <P> Twins, however, were another matter -- and Mengele's passion. Survivors recall  him yelling, "Zwillinge, zwillinge" ("twins, twins"), as he sought to cull  young twins from their mothers. It was on these twins that Mengele performed  some of his most horrific experiments in the name of genetic engineering in his  quest to produce a super Aryan race.  </P> <P> In the prison camp's archives, there are accounts of children being strapped to  operating tables while Mengele probed their inner organs, injected their bodies  with chemicals and pierced their eyes with dyes in an attempt to change their  color. Survivors recall times when he treated them kindly, as if they were his  own children, but they say there was no telling when he would execute a twin on  the spot with the same emotion as swatting a fly.  </P> <P> After the war, he was briefly in American hands but was released, a subject  that reportedly takes up part of the still-secret U.S. report. Mengele's  postwar odyssey ultimately took him to several South American countries,  including Argentina, Paraguay and, finally, Brazil. It was in the Sao Paulo  area, where, for about 25 years, he lived under an assumed name in the secret  care of two European-born couples -- Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert and Gitta  and Geza Stammer.  </P> <P> By 1985, Mengele's memory burned only in the minds of death camp survivors and  a handful of Nazi-hunters. But on Jan. 27 of that year, he was suddenly thrust  into prominence as Auschwitz's survivors roamed the camp's frozen, wind-swept  ground, marking the 40th anniversary of its liberation by the Soviet army.  </P> <P> As the still-standing wooden watch towers, the red-brick barracks, the  underground torture cells, the gas chambers and the crematoria came into view  on television screens around the world, a crescendo of public opinion demanded:  "Where is Mengele? Why hasn't he been arrested?"  </P> <P> The following month, U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith ordered the Justice  Department to make a determined effort to find Mengele. Leading the search was  Sher's Office of Special Investigations. The bounty for capturing Mengele  jumped to several million dollars with new reward money offered by West  Germany, Israel and private donors, such as the Wiesenthal Center.  </P> <P> Then, on May 31, 1985, a surprise raid by West German police on the Gunzburg  home of Hans Sedlmeier uncovered letters and documents leading authorities to  the Bosserts and the Stammers in Brazil.  </P> <P> The Bosserts led Brazilian police to Grave 321 at the Embu Cemetery near Sao  Paulo, declaring that Mengele had drowned at a nearby beach on Feb. 7, 1979. To  cover his identity, investigators were told, Mengele had been buried under the  name of Wolfgang Gerhard, a Nazi who had befriended him and who died in Austria  in 1978.  </P> <P> U.S., Brazilian and West German experts proceeded to authenticate the skeleton  along with photographs and handwriting samples found at Mengele's Brazilian  hideaways. The chain of evidence, in their opinion, was complete. In a June, 6,  1985, report, they declared:  </P> <P> " . . . The exhumed remains are definitely not those of Wolfgang Gerhard. It is  further our opinion that this skeleton is that of Josef Mengele within a  reasonable scientific certainty."  </P> <P> The document was signed by three consultants hired by the Justice Department:  Ali Z. Hameli, chief medical examiner for the state of Delaware; Ellis R.  Kerley, now-retired anthropology professor at the University of Maryland, and  Dr. Lowell J. Levine, forensic odontology consultant for the New York State  Police.  </P> <P> Also signing were three experts hired by the Wiesenthal Center: Dr. John J.  Fitzpatrick, chairman of the radiology division at Cook County Hospital in  Chicago; Dr. Leslie Lukash, chief medical examiner of Nassau County, N.Y.; and  Clyde Collins Snow, forensic anthropology consultant to the Oklahoma state  medical examiner's office.  </P> <P> In recent interviews with The Times, all six said they were as sure today as  they were in June, 1985, when they told journalists that the skeleton was  Mengele's.  </P> <P> "Scientifically," Hameli said, "it couldn't have been" a hoax. "As far as I am  concerned, Mengele is dead."  </P> <P> Indeed, all six expressed surprise when informed that the Justice Department  had not closed the case.  </P> <P> "It seems to me," Snow said, "unless there's something new, it's time for  someone to come to a conclusion."  </P> <P> Among their decisive points in identifying Mengele was a photographic  comparison in which pictures of the exhumed skull were matched on a video  terminal to known photos of Mengele from his Nazi SS file, compiled in 1938.  </P> <P> Also matched was a comparison by West German experts of features of Mengele's  SS photos and what was believed to be Mengele's picture on a 1956 passport  application in Argentina and a picture Wolfram Bossert had taken of the man who  lived in his house between 1975 and 1979.  </P> <P> Additionally, a 30-page report on the skeletal remains underscored that  although 29 bones were missing (the normal human skeleton has 206 bones), there  were still too many similarities to Mengele's physical characteristics for the  remains to be someone else's.  </P> <P> For example, according to the report, Mengele's records showed that he stood  5-feet 8 1/2-inches tall, or 174 centimeters, when measured in October, 1938.  Height calculations from the skeleton performed by Snow and Kerley ranged  between 167.5 centimeters to 179.4 centimeters, with an estimate of 173.5  centimeters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determination of Age  </P> <P> A bone analysis to determine age, conducted by Kerley, resulted in "a 86.7%  probability that the age of this individual at death was between 64.25 and  74.25 years and that the most probable age at death was 69.25 years," according  to a copy of the report in the Wiesenthal Center archives. When he reportedly  drowned, Mengele would have been nearly 68.  </P> <P> Examination of the skull, which had only 10 remaining teeth, showed that the  dead man had a wide gap between his upper front teeth before their removal --  similar to a gap that was shown clearly in a 1938 SS photo of a smiling  Mengele.  </P> <P> For OSI's Sher, though, there was still ground to be covered.  </P> <P> Two months after the Embu Cemetery findings, he told a congressional panel that  based on the experts' conclusions, "I am convinced" the remains are Mengele's.  But, privately, he knew there were doubts -- especially in Israel, a nation  with a substantial population of death camp survivors who had an emotional  stake in the Mengele case.  </P> <P> For that reason, Sher said, he believed that if Mengele's dental X-rays could  somehow be recovered, they would be as good as fingerprints and would be final  proof that the Embu remains were indeed those of the death camp doctor.  </P> <P> As forensic odontology consultant Levine recalled, the problem was that "the SS  dental record was not sufficiently specific to allow positive identification"  of the remains. "It just showed what teeth were filled" and contained no  X-rays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomat's Investigation  </P> <P> That is when Stephen Dachi, the U.S. consul general in Sao Paulo in 1985 and a  dental expert in his own right, came into the picture. After the experts had  packed their bags and left Sao Paulo, Sher turned to Dachi and asked him to  further investigate the case.  </P> <P> Eventually, in what was purported to be one of Mengele's diaries, Dachi  discovered that the writer had told of receiving root canal and upper molar  work by a Brazilian dentist in a town next to Sao Paulo in 1978.  </P> <P> The discovery excited Dachi because handwriting experts had already  authenticated the Mengele diary notes. Ultimately, Dachi said, "that was the  key to the whole question" -- the vital link to the X-rays. "We were 100% sure  the writing in the diary was Mengele's," he said.  </P> <P> Armed with this information, Dachi located the Brazilian dentist, who had a  dental chart belonging to a Pedro Hochbichler, a Mengele alias. Hochbichler had  been referred to a nearby dentist and his X-rays turned up in that dentist's  files.  </P> <P> Odontology consultant Levine, in a telephone interview from his office in New  York State Police headquarters in Albany, said the X-rays "matched up  perfectly" with dental X-rays he had taken of the skull found at Embu. "They  matched up with the person named Wolfgang Gerhard," the name under which  Mengele had been buried, he said.  </P> <P> If the remains exhumed at Embu were part of a hoax, Levine concluded, a Mengele  "clone" was in the grave.  </P> <P> But troubling the critics -- and evidently irksome to Sher -- are other events  linked to Mengele's medical history.  </P> <P> In 1986, Sher sent a Smithsonian Institution anthropologist, Donald J. Ortner,  to Brazil to examine the exhumed remains for evidence of osteomyelitis, a bone  disease from which Mengele suffered as a teen-ager, according to Waffen SS  records.  </P> <P> Because there was no antibiotic to combat the disease at that time, Ortner knew  that osteomyelitis could leave bone scars. But Ortner could not find an obvious  trace of the infection. "The clear evidence wasn't there," he recently  recalled.  </P> <P> Until this day, the Mengele family of Gunzburg has never asked Brazil for the  remains, only serving to further fuel suspicions of the skeptics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Group of Survivors  </P> <P> One of these doubters, Eva Mozes Kor, of Terre Haute, Ind., an Auschwitz  survivor who, as a twin, was one of Mengele's guinea pigs, has devoted much of  her life to searching for the Auschwitz doctor.  </P> <P> In 1984, Kor formed a group called CANDLES -- Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly  Lab Experiments Survivors -- consisting of twins who had been Mengele's  subjects.  </P> <P> In 1987, she filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking OSI's final  Mengele report. Last fall, the Justice Department responded:  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Report Issued  </P> <P> "To date, the United States has not issued a forensic report which either  accepts or rejects the premise that the body located in Brazil was that of  Mengele. . . . The Department has reached no final determination with respect  to Mengele. . . . "  </P> <P> For his part, Simon Wiesenthal says he has information about "a new possible  man in a South American country. They say this is Mengele." He would not  elaborate.  </P> <P> The OSI's Sher said he is proud of the way his office conducted itself during  the Mengele hunt. "This office has earned a reputation all over the world as  being professional and aggressive in pursuing Nazis," he said. "There's no  person more eager to get his hands on a live Josef Mengele than me."  </P> <P> But given the preponderance of evidence declaring that Mengele is dead, he  said, "I don't think it's fair to survivors . . . to inflict on them false  hope. . . . That would be cruel."  </P> <P> Asked about Wiesenthal's new hoax theory, Rabbi Hier said he respects the  Nazi-hunter's position -- but firmly believes that he is wrong. "Simon is very  much his own man," Hier said. "He's been that way for 45 years."  </P> <P> Nothing has changed, Hier underscored in an interview. "There has not been  developed a single solid lead since the reported death (of Mengele) by any  authority in the world," he said. "I think that would be the most decisive  reason to conclude (the case)."  </P> <P> As for the position of some death camp survivors who contend that the wool was  artfully pulled over the world's eyes, Hier said:  </P> <P> "I find it difficult to accept what CANDLES is saying. . . . (But) maybe they  are entitled to that hope. They live with these dreams. Mengele is alive in  them. The Mengele who appears every night in their dreams, he has become a  living person even if the scientists tell us he's dead."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Robert E. Dallos, in New York, and researcher Reane Oppl, in  Bonn, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Making the leap out of the lap of luxury: Under Helmut Werner, its next boss, Mercedes-Benz is expanding its product range At first glance Helmut Werner does not look like a revolutionary. The urbane 56-year-old has worked himself up German industry's corporate ladder with apparent ease, but little in his career has suggested that he would be the man appointed to break the mould at Mercedes-Benz, one of the world's most prestigious luxury car makers. This week, however, Werner announced that Mercedes-Benz had decided to embark 'on a very extensive realignment of its strategic product policy'. The company would transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market', said Werner. Before the end of the decade there would be a Mercedes-Benz people carrier, or multi-purpose vehicle a la Renault Espace or the Toyota Previa. There would be a modern four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle for off-road driving. And there would be a small Mercedes-Benz city car for urban commuting. These would be in addition to the present three ranges of luxury and executive cars. Almost in passing Werner uttered what for a previous holder of his office would have been heresy: Mercedes-Benz's present luxury cars were 'over-engineered' and, if the company persisted with its policy for developing new models, it would be 'priced out' of world markets. He made it clear that the only way Mercedes-Benz could maintain its engineering and quality leadership was if it could also achieve leadership on cost. Gone are the days, apparently, when the charging of premium prices could cover up for costs that were too high. 'No one in the world is prepared to pay for German complacency on the cost front,' said Werner, in a message guaranteed to chill the company's overmanned workforce. Werner does not officially take over as chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, until late May, but he hit the road running this week. He needs to, in order to meet the challenges the company faces in the 1990s. After more than a century during which its three-pointed star has been one of the world's ultimate status symbols, Mercedes-Benz has been shaken by the arrival in force of the Japanese car makers in the world luxury car mar-ket. From a standing start in late 1989, Toyota, Japan's leading volume car producer, has established a luxury car franchise in the US under the brand name Lexus. Last year it sold 92,890 cars in the US, against 63,312 sold by Mercedes-Benz. The German group has also been stung into action by the strength of the negative reaction to its new S-Class range of luxury saloons, launched with much pomp two years ago in Geneva. The company had laboured for five and a half years to develop a successor for its previous 11-year-old S-Class but, by the time it arrived in the marketplace, its bulk made it appear out of tune with an era that was already forsaking conspicuous consumption for other values. Another raw nerve was touched in Stuttgart, with the publication of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dollars 5m, five-year study on the future of the automobile, entitled The Machine That Changed The World. The report exposed the gap in efficiency, costs and quality between the so-called 'lean' car producers, chiefly although not exclusively the Japanese, and the outdated mass producers, mainly the European and American producers. The MIT team had visited a Mercedes-Benz plant in Germany. 'At the end of the assembly line was an enormous rework and rectification area, where armies of technicians in white laboratory jackets laboured to bring the finished vehicles up to the company's fabled quality standard.' The team found that 'a third of the total effort involved in assembly occurred in this area. In other words, the German plant was expending more effort to fix the problems it had created than the Japanese plant required to make a nearly perfect car the first time'. Werner's cultural revolution is now set to address such shortcomings. The first signals that significant reforms were planned had emerged over the past year, as Mercedes-Benz had shaken up its top management team. Helmut Werner himself is the replacement for Werner Niefer, the 64-year-old Mercedes-Benz chairman. Niefer, the pugnacious former Mercedes-Benz apprentice with an often incomprehensible Swabian accent, had worked himself up from the shopfloor to the top of the company. Werner, on the other hand, has the easy flair of an international manager. The executive was courted by Volkswagen while he was deputy chairman at Continental, the German tyre maker. He chose instead to move to Mercedes-Benz at Stuttgart, where he was immediately seen as one of the heirs apparent. Around him Werner is quickly gathering a new generation of managers who mark a decisive break with the past. They include Dieter Zetsche, the 39-year-old director for car research and development. Balding, with a walrus moustache and a liking for brightly coloured ties, Zetsche has replaced the reserved and conservative Wolfgang Peter, the creator of the S-Class, who left the company last year. However, Werner's brave new world will not be won without pain and dislocation. He accepts that Mercedes-Benz still lags way behind its rivals in costs and productivity. Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are to be removed, there will be a 'rigorous pruning' of white-collar central staff. The life-cycles of Mercedes products have to be reduced to about eight years from 11 years, while the development time for new products has to be cut from up to 57 months to less than 44. And the break-even volume for a vehicle line must be reduced to 60,000 a year. Now that he has unleashed his revolution, Werner must show that he can ride it.</p>

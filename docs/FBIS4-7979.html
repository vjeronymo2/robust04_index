			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of </F> the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, by Frantisek Melis;  place and date not given: "I Will Stay Until the  Elections"--reprinted from 29 March issue of Bratislava PRACA in  Slovak]    [Text] [Melis] At its assembly in Trnava a year ago, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] adopted a resolution  on its transformation from a movement into a party. This  resolution has not been fulfilled, however, and, even after its  Presov assembly [on 26-27 March], the HZDS remains a  broad-spectrum movement.    [Meciar] The discussion about the shape the movement should  take is a permanent one. Half of our members and functionaries  are in favor of its transformation into a party and the others  are opposed. They say that they have never been, and will never  be, members of any party. It is premature to say how the HZDS  will evolve because this is also connected with the support of  the changing social base of society and the profile the other  parties will assume. Everything will become more legible after  the elections. We are holding on to the pragmatic center and  will surely eventually shift somewhere, even though the  evolution on the European political scene is taking another  direction, away from the traditional right-center-left division.    [Melis] Judging according to the present [polls on party]  preferences, it can be assumed that you will score another  electoral victory--one, however, that need not be as striking as  that of 1992. The question therefore arises whether you will be  able to set up a new government should the president entrust you  with its formation, as this should be a broad-coalition  government.    [Meciar] Forecasting the outcome of the elections is  premature because it can be influenced by a number of factors.  The present preferences represent a good foundation for  success, but we shall seek the broadest possible support. Two  sorts of decisions will have to be made after the elections:  what the citizen will say and whom I will accept and who will  accept me. There is no point in sitting in the government at  any price and implementing someone else's program. I do not  expect many people to stay away from the polls, nor do I expect  the miniparties to succeed. Those who let themselves be  intoxicated by the vision of getting into the government fast  miscalculated.    [Melis] The government parties want to offer you one seat  each in the leadership of the Supreme Inspection Office [NKU],  in the National Property Fund [FNM] Presidium, and in the FNM  Supervisory Board. Will you accept these offers?    [Meciar] They would be well advised not to corrupt us with  offers of seats in the NKU leadership because we will not  recognize the NKU. The preceding leadership was recalled in  contravention of the Constitution. After all, the National  Council cannot, by means of a resolution, violate the  Constitution and the laws of this state that it had itself  passed. We cannot provide legitimacy to breach the  Constitution. Let them lie on the shameful bed they made for  themselves. Regarding the FNM bodies, we have proposed one  candidate for each of them. We reserve the right to our own  viewpoint when it comes to approving the FNM Presidium.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> REV. ABERNATHY, DR. KING'S CLOSEST FRIEND IN '60S, DIES  </P> <P> The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who fought for civil rights alongside his  friend Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s, died today in a hospital at the  age of 64.  </P> <P> Abernathy died at Crawford Long Hospital, which he entered three weeks ago for  an electrolytic imbalance.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said his heart stopped during a lung scan, and he died while  in an operating room.  </P> <P> Abernathy, a Baptist minister whose grandfather was a slave, was criticized  last year by many for discussing King's alleged extramarital affairs in his  memoirs.  </P> <P> Abernathy was King's closest friend and associate until King was assassinated  in 1968, and helped King found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  </P> <P> Abernathy caused a furor in the civil rights community last fall with a  controversial autobiography, "And the Walls Came Tumbling Down," which referred  to King's alleged extramarital affairs.  </P> <P> Abernathy mentioned in his book that King dallied with various women April 3,  1968, his last night alive. He became the first of the civil rights inner  circle to openly discuss King's alleged marital infidelities, which had been  chronicled by several biographers.  </P> <P> In 1957, King, Abernathy and several other black clergymen formed the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference to boost their struggle for civil rights for  blacks in the South.  </P> <P> King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968, and shortly  thereafter Abernathy assumed the fallen leader's position as SCLC president. He  held the position for nine years, as the focus of the civil rights movement  shifted from voting rights and civil rights to such economic issues as full  employment and anti-poverty programs.  </P> <P> He resigned in 1977 to campaign for Congress but was defeated in the Democratic  primary.  </P></p>

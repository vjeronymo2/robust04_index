			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by T.M.: "Danica Mad at Serbian Leadership"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 3 February -- The Serbian opposition  magazine SRPSKA REC published a scathing criticism of Serbian  policy written by its director Danica Draskovic, wife of  opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. She said that there is no  doubt about who is responsible for the war in Bosnia, that  weapons and ammunition are manufactured in Serbia, and that  everything began because certain people wanted to grab power.  The accusations are directed at Radovan Karadzic and his  associates. Danica Draskovic asks what were the reasons for the  war, since nobody had persecuted Serbs. She compares this  situation to Germany in 1945. At that time too, many Germans  insisted that they had no knowledge about camps and graves. She  believes that many Serbs will maintain the same after a year or  two when everything will be over.    Danica Draskovic also accuses the Serbian Red Cross of  arbitrarily distributing foreign humanitarian aid. This cannot  be concealed, she adds, since even the most progovernment media  admit that 75 percent disappears without a trace. She promises  to inform all humanitarian organizations that the aid meant for  the poorest and most suffering people ends up on the black  market controlled by the Serbian authorities.</p>

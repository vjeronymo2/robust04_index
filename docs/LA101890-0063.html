			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE SENATORS' KEATING TALKS HELD EXTENSIVE  </P> <P> Three senators under investigation for their ties to Charles H. Keating Jr.,  ex-owner of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, had more extensive dealings  with him than they acknowledged publicly, Senate documents show.  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee documents detail efforts made by Democratic Sens.  Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle  Jr. of Michigan on Keating's behalf. They also shed new light on some of  Keating's fund-raising efforts.  </P> <P> The committee's special counsel has recommended the probe of those three be  intensified. He also proposed the investigation be dropped against Sens. John  McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio), the other members of the so-called  "Keating Five."  </P> <P> The documents, obtained by the Associated Press, show:  </P> <P>  -- Keating's fund-raising efforts for Riegle were far more extensive than  previously known, and some information in the documents do not match Riegle's  account in statements to the public and the committee.  </P> <P>  -- Cranston, in a memo, thanked Keating for a $250,000 contribution solicited  by the senator for a voter registration project and at the same time expressed  his pleasure that Keating met with the top thrift regulator to air his  complaints about an examination of his S&amp;L, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of  Irvine, Calif.  </P> <P>  -- DeConcini assisted Keating in his crusade to have former top thrift  regulator Edwin J. Gray -- referred to by Lincoln's owner as a "mad dog turned  loose" -- removed from the examination of Lincoln. After Gray left office, the  senator wrote Keating, "Maybe things will change now that he is gone. I sure  hope so."  </P> <P>  -- A former top U.S. banking regulator, Roger F. Martin, said that just weeks  before the government seized Lincoln, he received "highly unusual" calls from  Cranston and DeConcini at his unlisted home number urging sale of Lincoln  rather than seizure. Cranston's call came after 10 p.m. and DeConcini's at 5:30  a.m. the next morning.  </P> <P> "It sounded to me as if they were reading from the same script or memo," Martin  told the committee.  </P> <P> It was previously known that Keating and associates gave $1.3 million to the  campaigns and favored causes of the five senators.  </P> <P> Cranston spokesman Murray Flander said Wednesday night there was no connection  between any money raised by Cranston and actions taken with regulators by the  senator.  </P> <P> The committee is trying to determine whether there was a connection between  help the senators gave Keating as Lincoln headed toward collapse and the money  he gave.  </P> <P> Lincoln was seized by the federal government in April, 1989, at a potential  cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion, but Keating insisted all along he  was treated unfairly by U.S. regulators.  </P> <P> Keating has been in jail in Los Angeles since his indictment Sept. 18 on state  securities fraud charges.  </P></p>

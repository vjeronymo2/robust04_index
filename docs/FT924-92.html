			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Franco 'to uphold' foreign accords: Collor found guilty by Brazilian Senate BRAZILIAN president Itamar Franco yesterday promised to maintain accords with international creditors and to work with Congress to approve fiscal reform and intellectual property legislation. In his first speech to the nation, he emphasised the need to combat Brazil's social crises. Elected vice-president in 1989, Mr Franco will serve the final two years of the term of Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned on Tuesday. Mr Franco had been interim president since Mr Collor was suspended three months ago to face impeachment on corruption charges. Mr Franco said the recently suspended privatisation programme would be resumed with unspecified new guidelines that 'do not prejudice the nation.' Unnamed 'strategic' companies will not be sold. He offered no outline on trade liberalisation but stressed that 'we cannot allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking that we can construct a modern country by raising economic barriers.' He also said: 'We will guarantee the stability of economic rules and will assure that no arbitrary decisions will be taken,' thereby ruling out shock plans as a means of curing economic woes. Brazil has suffered six economic plans, usually including price freezes, since 1986. Planning minister Paulo Haddad said he will provide details of economic policy at a press conference today Senator Albano Franco, head of the National Confederation of Industry, said that the business community would be reassured by the new president's pledge to avoid price freezes and to support structural reform. The Sao Paulo stock exchange Bobespa Index reacted favourably and increased by 3 per cent. Mr Franco criticised what he called Mr Collor's 'false modernisation' programme, noting its recessionary effects. He recalled that this year Brazil's gross domestic product will be 3.9 per cent lower and per capita income 10 per cent lower than in 1989. He said modernisation and anti-inflation policy could not be based on maintaining high interest rates. The Franco administration hopes to work closely with Congress and leading political parties, reversing Mr Collor's combative approach. The Brazilian Senate found former President Fernando Collor de Mello guilty of crimes of responsibility and prohibited him from holding office for eight years despite his resignation on Tuesday morning. A marathon session, which started on Tuesday and ended early yesterday, resulted in a 76 to three vote in favour of conviction. Mr Collor also faces possible criminal charges for his involvement in an alleged influence-peddling scheme and for having benefited from a multi-million-dollar slush fund run by his former campaign treasurer. In a statement yesterday, Mr Collor said he would appeal against the Senate conviction. 'I resist in the name of democratic institutions,' he said, adding that he was 'a president whose only crime was his unswerving dedication to his duty.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Recently there has been a  gentle tone in President Kim Young Sam's words (called YS  hereinafter) often using rhetoric such as "future" and "advance"  etc. This was rarely seen before. Did he think that he should  now ease the warlike atmosphere derived from the sudden  regulations and stringent audits and inspections and the like?    Last September 23, at the lunch table in the main building  of  the Blue House, YS talked with Chang Sang-tae, the head of the  Dong Kuk Steel Industry group and the 17th person in a series of  dialogues between YS and the various heads of financial cliques.    It is said that the dialogue between the two men of about  the  same age was very peaceful. While they talked about the monetary  real name system and an economy-stimulating plan, etc., YS  suddenly digressed from the conversation, striking newsmen's  ears, "From my childhood I was bred in luxury in the home of an  operator of a big fishery. Frankly speaking, at that time I  lived so happily that I would not envy Mr. So-and-so. Why should  a man like me not be a supporter of capitalism?...." Mr.  So-and-so in his speech refers to the late head of a financial  clique and a famous person synonymous of a rich man.    If reform opponents heard such a story, they might be  displeased with him wondering why should he let the rich be  denounced as moral offenders under his rule. But most ordinary  people would think that from now on he might appease the rich  who cowered before reform."    This is the first time since YS took office that he spoke  such gentle words. [passage omitted]    He spoke especially to assemblymen Lee Sung-yun (the  ex-Deputy Prime Minister) and Chung Ho-yong, among others, who  had suffered from a slip of the tongue in the process of making  public their personal assets.    After a long time, the high-spirited assemblymen began to  appeal for improvements in the monetary real name system and  special attention to economic recovery, etc.    Assemblyman Lee asked him to be more concerned about the  economy, and assemblyman Chung appealed for the opportunity to  talk with an open mind. He probably had much to tell as a person  of the ruined TK group. This peaceful sight was also a first.    Would the flustered assemblymen standing in awe of the Blue  House have touched YS's heart? In the evening of the 23rd, YS  invited all the assemblymen of the Democratic Liberal Party to  the Blue House, holding a similar event as with the Executive  Members of the Party two days prior.    This event was not prepared in advance at all, but prepared  on the spot, because YS was satisfied with the success of the  meeting two days earlier. At the end of the talk, YS once again  said such meaningful words that "thus far the rich might have  been too criticized."    In the first few months after taking office, YS intended to  spread a new sense of value saying that "anyone in our country  should not want to have both wealth and honor, and should now  select one alternative." Six months later, contrary to his  previous actions, in the process of making public the assets of  ranking public officials, YS presented a new philosophy that  "the mere possession of many assets should not prevent anyone  from becoming a public official."    Accordingly, as the assistant Public Prosecutor-General Kim  Do-un becomes a prospective Public Prosecutor-General after Park  Jong-chul resigned, YS heard from aides that "his only weakness  was that he had too many assets" and asked how he got them. The  aides answered that "there was not problem from a moral point of  view because most of them were inherited." YS immediately  promoted and appointed him, saying that "if this was so he was  all right and this was no problem at all."    Judging from such facts, YS seems to be surely changing his  mind or temporarily using new ways to distinguish his supporters  and opponents.    Therefore those who have seen only the strict side of YS,  they say, could not understand his present actions. Let's listen  to a presidential aide. [passage omitted]    According to him, YS may be understood as follows. "They  were  whipped into shape. Because they realize the consequences, they  will behave well from now. I will ease up."    Asked the same question, another aide commented in more  simple terms.    "The same audit and inspection methods as he ordered in the  early days after taking office will be no more. While up to now  he has raised or lowered the standard of audit and inspection  according to the times and circumstances, he has gradually  lowered the standard. In short, he seems to intend liquidate the  past by the end of the year and start with a new hope next year.  This could be regarded as a period of transition."    If so, when would YS's appeasement policy have started?    Last August 12 when the monetary real name system was put in  operation, YS's harsh style began to ease, many people believe.  Even at that time there were a number of busy activities such as  making out the audit and inspection schedule for the latter half  of the year and giving an impetus to the next reform and so on.    But as the days went by, more and more people believed that  the anti-reformers should soon be appeased. Such an opinion was  originated in the belief that if increasing numbers of the rich  and ranking public officials look on national policies with  folded arms and object to the reforms, these reforms might fail.    Accordingly, the aides recommended that YS should surely  talk  with heads of financial cliques and lower the standard of the  audit and inspection.    YS accepted his advisers' recommendations, because he had  already blocked any possible evasion of the law by carrying out  the monetary real name system blitz and making public ranking  officials' personal assets.    He frequently talked with heads of financial cliques. After  he had said that the government investment enterprises and the  employers of funds would extensively be audited and inspected in  the latter half of the year, he only examined in detail the  assets of the high-ranking officials of the related  organizations.    The talk about the tax investigation of the press companies  also became disappeared.    The Blue House also demanded that even the audit and  inspection of local indigenous unrighteousness should be  immediately terminated. The revision of the Fair Trade  Commission Law and the inquiry into the internal transactions,  both detrimental to financial cliques, were greatly lessened.    The more crucial policy tolerating anti-reformers by YS is  obvious by the fact that the Blue House dissuaded the Board of  Audit and Inspection and the Opposition Parties from inquiring  into the ex-Presidents Chon and No who were related to the Peace  Dam and Yulgok Project, saying that "causing a sensation was not  desired." [passage omitted]    Although the malfeasance and corruption was not yet all  exposed, YS has chosen to tolerate and forget the gloomy past  rather than be indignant and instead decided to move forward to  a brighter future. What would have led him to change so?    Han Fei-zi's ruling techniques especially liked by YS are  thought to have led him to do so. [passage omitted]    Interpreted in a modern version, it may mean that when the  leadership of a country such as statesmen, ministers and heads  of financial cliques, etc. do not voluntarily cooperate, the  ruler should yield and choose the next best policy.    Recently YS said to Cardinal Kim Suh-wan who was accompanied  by Cardinal Soka of the Vatican, "There is definitely resistance  (in connection with the monetary real name system, etc.) in our  society. But I think I could conquer such resistance." Once a  financial institution repaid a deposit to a big creditor with  forged documents, defying the import of the money real name  system, YS angrily demanded that such an institution immediately  be chastised as strictly as possible. Despite the proposed  improvements of the monetary real name system, he demanded that  "no additional complementary measures be taken."    But his recent policies are more appeaseable than expected.  He admitted the issue of long term low interest bonds that he  was said to have so stubbornly opposed and included it in the  September 24 measure.    In taking off the thick overcoats of the resisters, he  appears to have made use of the warmth of the sunlight instead  of the strong wind. Therefore some do not think that "YS's  policy change will be permanent."    Such a view is originated in the story that YS does not  yield  in carrying out his affairs. That is why many are afraid of YS.  But it is obvious that the resistants of the reforms made YS  angry. Even judging from his words of "resister so-and-so" when  receiving Cardinal Soka, he seems to have had no intention of  forgiveness. If his recent acts are a temporary strategic  retreat for the purpose of avoiding any head-on clashes with the  resisters, he will watch for a chance to strike back. As many  denounce YS at a meeting of the ordinary assemblymen of the  Democratic Liberal Party, those of the Democratic Faction of the  Party pointed out, "Don't kick up a row without knowing the  truth." This story may mean such a situation.</p>

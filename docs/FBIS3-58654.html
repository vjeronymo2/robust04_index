Ventosa report: "Garcia Vargas Says Society Was </F> Reconciled With Its Armed Forces in 1993"]    [Text] Madrid -- Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  stated yesterday in his speech to the king on the occasion of  Armed Forces Day that 1993 "was the year of Spanish society's  reconciliation with its Armed Forces," thanks to the blue  helmets' conduct in Bosnia-Herzegovina, "although all units have  also contributed to this."    Garcia Vargas spelled out in his speech the measures adopted  by the Defense Ministry during the past year in order to make  progress in the process of reorganization and modernization of  the Spanish Armed Forces, and set out some of the worrying  realities of the international situation, which is in a period  of change "in which uncertainties abound."    Thus, he referred to the "hotbeds of tension caused by  intolerant and aggressive nationalist movements," which make  "more necessary than ever" UN efforts to help pacify them.  Referring to the Spanish military participation under the UN  flag in those international conflicts -- particularly that in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- he said that "our troops' self-sacrificing  work is alleviating suffering, saving thousands of lives, and  gaining distinction which causes us all to owe a debt of  gratitude."  <H5>  European Security </H5>   The defense minister also spoke of the security aspect of  the  process of European building, announcing Spain's support for the  U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which will help bring  four Central European countries closer to the Atlantic alliance;  a matter which will be discussed at the coming NATO summit, to  be held in Brussels next week.    Nevertheless, and still regarding NATO as a "factor of  security throughout the continent," Garcia Vargas said that the  political union "should assume greater prominence through the  Western European Union [WEU] in its dual manifestation as the  European pillar of the alliance and the [European] Union's  security structure."    On this point, he stated that the Spanish contribution to  this new European defense identity will take shape in the coming  incorporation of Spanish units into the European Army Corps and  in participation in the future air-sea force currently being  planned by the WEU.    In the domestic sphere, Garcia Vargas emphasized the  budgetary problems experienced by the Armed Forces in 1993,  which have necessitated revising all their equipment programs.  After giving an account of the main arms projects for this  year, announcing others which will be approved in 1994 -- the  investments program bill and the military service regulations,  and emphasizing the importance of the latest to enter into force  -- the personnel law and the recruitment regulations, the  minister announced that the government will approve "soon" the  joint plan for the reorganization of the three services,  including, among others, the Army's "Lodestar Plan" ["Plan  Norte"].    Garcia Vargas called for "the understanding of territorial  bodies throughout Spain" for this important joint plan, which  will entail a new stage of winding up units, bases, and military  installations, with less geographical dispersal throughout Spain.    The final part of his speech was in fact devoted to Spanish  society's rapprochement with the Armed Forces, manifested in the  offer by many draftee servicemen to take part voluntarily in  international peacekeeping missions "and in Spanish military  personnel's cooperation in humanitarian tasks with young people  in civilian organizations."    On this point, the minister took the opportunity to  criticize  "a section of our young people who maintain an aloof stance  toward the Armed Forces." "Their demurring stance," he said,  "is aimed at a now superseded stereotype of the Armed Forces  which bears little relation to reality." Although the defense  minister maintained that "it cannot be expected" that  "preconceived ideas and social attitudes will pass away  quickly," he showed himself convinced that this current of  insubordination existing in Spain "will also be surmounted."</p>

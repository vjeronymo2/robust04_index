			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Signet chairman's pay jumps 78% to Pounds 512,000 Mr James McAdam, executive chairman of Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, enjoyed a 78 per cent pay increase to Pounds 512,000 last year, according to the annual report. His total pay the previous year was Pounds 288,000. Signet said an increase in Mr McAdam's basic salary from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 300,000 reflected his taking over the group chief executive's role from Mr Gerald Ratner, in addition to the chairmanship, in November 1992. It had been reviewed by external consultants. Mr McAdam was also paid a Pounds 130,000 bonus, reflecting his success in returning the group to an operating profit for the year to January 29, and in meeting targets for control of borrowings and costs. His pension contributions and other benefits increased from Pounds 48,000 to Pounds 82,000.</p>

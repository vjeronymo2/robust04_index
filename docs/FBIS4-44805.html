			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "SNECMA's Mixed Results"; first paragraph </F> is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The group is still hobbled by a huge deficit  of 804 million French francs [Fr], but has improved its  operating results, which are now Fr273 million.    SNECMA's efforts to restructure and adapt are paying off.  Operating results in 1993 totaled Fr273 million, against Fr103  million last year, an increase of 165 percent! This was achieved  despite shrinking sales that fell from Fr13,538 million in 1992  to Fr10,851 million in 1993.    Financial results have also improved, rising from -Fr166  million in 1992 to -Fr40 million in 1993. In all, current  income, which was negative in 1992 at -Fr63 million, grew by  nearly Fr300 million and became positive in 1993 at Fr234  million. "What makes these improvements especially remarkable is  that they were achieved despite a 20-percent drop in sales and  without cutting R&amp;D investment, which held steady at 22  percent  of turnover," SNECMA [National Aircraft Engine Research and  Manufacturing Company] is anxious to point out.    On the other hand, the cost of adaptation measures to SNECMA  and to other companies of the group is one of the main causes of  the severe worsening of extraordinary losses, which plunged from  -Fr570 million in 1992 to -Fr995 million in 1993. After tax  credits, SNECMA's net final losses, which were -Fr593 million in  1992, came to -Fr692 in 1993. But net debt levels were reduced  from Fr2,556 million in late 1992 to Fr1,120 million at the end  of 1993, notably as a result of successful efforts to trim  manufacturing and research and development cycles.    The result is a worsening of net losses (group's share),  which have risen from Fr794 million in 1992 to Fr804 million.  That figure roughly equals the period's extraordinary charges  caused by the rapid drop in sales, which fell from Fr22,838  million to Fr19,566 million, or a decline of 14 percent. Indeed,  SNECMA's consolidated operating result has risen to Fr496  million (Fr118 million in 1992), or an improvement of Fr378  million.    Despite a still high level of indebtedness and interest  expenses, the group has newly rebalanced its accounts, posting a  profit of Fr48 million against a loss of Fr510 million in 1992.  SNECMA management sees no improvement for 1994. It plans to  continue and to expand cost-cutting measures, to offset a new  drop in turnover, which may fall below Fr10 billion.</p>

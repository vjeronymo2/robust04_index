			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Increase found in bankrupt Names the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market - are becoming bankrupt, the Bankruptcy Association said yesterday. Mr John McQueen, chief executive of the organisation which provides advice to bankrupts, said at least 30 Names had become members of his association. Names were approaching the association 'in a state of absolute shock,' Mr McQueen said. 'They can't believe what has happened to them.' Lloyd's stated last month that it had never driven Names into bankruptcy. Instead it offers 'hardship' arrangements - in which Names restructure their debts and agree to accept a modest income and home - to those unable to meet their commitments. However, many Names say that the terms of 'hardship' are excessively onerous. Only 39 Names have so far accep-ted the 'hardship' arrange-ments, Lloyd's announced last month. As many as 5,000 of the society's 30,000 Names, underwriting in the loss-making 1988, 1989 and 1990 years, have borne the brunt of the market's losses. Legal action by Lloyd's seeking to recover money owed to it by Names has escalated sharply over the past three months. Writs have been issued against 159 Names to recoup Pounds 16.5m earmarked by Lloyd's from its central fund to meet claims that the Names are either unwilling or are unable to pay. Since the end of April, 119 writs have been issued, while debts owed by Names to the society have climbed by Pounds 12m. Most of the debts relate to losses incurred during 1988 and in previous years. These actions are expected to increase once the Pounds 2.06bn of losses run up during the 1989 underwriting year feeds through the market.</p>

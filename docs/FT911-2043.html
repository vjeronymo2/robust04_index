			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Testing time for pragmatic Rimmer THE CRUNCH comes today for Harry Rimmer, the moderate Labour leader of Liverpool city council, where six Labour hard left rebels are standing against official party candidates in the local government elections. At present he heads a group of 33 moderates in the 67-strong Labour group. Apart from five neutrals, the rest - who include the six unofficial candidates - are part of a broad left caucus. All have been either expelled from the party or suspended. Mr Rimmer, formerly deputy leader to Mr Keva Coombes, has forced schism on them by imposing rent rises on council tenants and demanding more than 1,000 redundancies to reduce council overstaffing and combat inefficiency. After 47 Liverpool Labour councillors failed in their legal appeals against disqualification from office for financial mismanagement, Mr Rimmer's were the safe pair of hands in which Labour's moderates put their trust when the 47 eventually went. However, he lasted only five months. He believed that the government had assessed Liverpool's spending needs too low and wanted to appeal. The left stopped the process, arguing it gave Whitehall too much say in Liverpool's budget. Mr Rimmer resigned. Mr Coombes became leader, but his attempts to balance left and right proved impossible. After last year's local elections, with enough newly-elected moderates to back him, Mr Rimmer counter-attacked. With half the left suspended from the Labour group for voting not to set a poll tax, Mr Rimmer's camp had a majority, and he forced Mr Coombes out. Since then he has met the left head on. Yesterday he joined the board of the Merseyside Development Corporation, a successful government agency hated by his opponents. Given it was May Day, he could hardly have staged a better demonstration of pragmatism.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Court move on Sunday shopping THE High Court has ruled that the judicial review sought by retailers Tesco Stores and Texas Homecare, which claim they have been unfairly discriminated against by councils enforcing laws banning Sunday trading, should be speeded up. The review is likely to be heard next month. The retailers are seeking a review on the grounds that they have been unlawfully targeted and threatened with trading bans, while smaller businesses are escaping legal action. Mr Peter Lloyd, a Home Office minister, told the Commons yesterday that the government would publish a bill in the next few weeks aimed at sorting out the Sunday trading muddle.</p>

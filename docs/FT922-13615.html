			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Share prices rally in after-hours trading as Tory hopes rise SHARE prices rallied, gilt prices rose, and sterling held firm as the Conservative party edged ahead in the early hours of the morning. After-hours trading - unprecedented in government-backed bonds - saw gilt prices rise about a  1/2 point on the close of the official markets after about 150 seats had been announced. With hopes for a Tory win increasing, the only orders in a rather thin gilts market were to buy. 'Gilts could put on about four points on a Tory win,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu. The pound held firm as news of the better-than-expected Tory performance trickled through. Analysts reported share prices had leapt ahead in the thinly-traded late-night market. The snap reaction at Smith Newcourt, the London market-makers, to the exit polls and first official results, was that the leading blue chips were trading about 3 per cent higher than their official London closing levels. The utilities - water, electricity and power shares - were trading 5-7 per cent higher. Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink, Europe's biggest executions-only dealer, with about 250,000 private clients, said business levels equalled those of a busy trading day. 'It is a unique situation - the first time the public has been able to trade directly in shares while an election result unfolds.' Earlier in the day, before the polls closed, shares, government gilt-edged securities and sterling all rose sharply in London. As voting took place, financial markets reasoned that a Tory defeat was not a foregone conclusion. However, trading in most markets was thin. This indicated the extreme caution about efforts to predict the outcome of the election. Many investors are braced for considerable volatility when the markets reopen this morning. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose by 43.2 to close at 2,436.4, while gilts saw a half-point gain. On currency markets, investors bought the pound in place of the D-Mark and other currencies, on the basis that whichever government is elected is unlikely to opt for a sterling devaluation. The support pushed up sterling by 1 1/2 pfennigs to a London close of DM2.8575. Sterling also rose nearly 2 cents against the dollar, to Dollars 1.7665.</p>

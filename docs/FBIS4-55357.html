			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana May 12 (ATA) -- The latest report of the  British Section of the ISHR [International Society for Human  Rights] (Simon McIlwaine, 31 December 1993) exposes widespread  abuses of human rights by the Greek authorities. Greece  continues to violate the basic human rights of, in particular,  the Macedonian Slavs of northern Greece, and followers of  non-Greek Orthodox religious such as Jehovah's Witnesses. This  is in direct contravention of both the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Greece is currently holding the Presidency of the European  Union.    Firstly by giving some background information on the mix of  ethnic groups living in Greece since its foundation in the  1830's, this report challenges the official assumption that the  Greek state is ethnically homogenous. This presumption has led  to the repeated and official denial of the existence of  minorities which are not of pure "Hellenic" origin. This  obsession with Greek racial identity is embodied in the idea  that Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] is Greek, and Greek alone.    On 20 July 1993 a (Slavonic) cultural festival was held in  the village of Melitis. This involved only the participation of  local musical and dance groups. Before the celebrations began  the local police ordered the musicians to refrain from playing  songs in their own language. When an attempt was made to sing  songs in Slav, the proceedings were forcibly broken up by the  police. According to the report official harassment of the  Slavs has intensified over the past two years.    Official harassment has extended to human rights activists.  During a visit to Greece last year, Professor Eric Siesby,  vice-chairman of the International Helsinki Federation, arranged  by telephone to meet some Slav dissidents, at his hotel in  Florina. An hour after the appointed time his guests had failed  to appear. The professor discovered, to his horror, that his  hotel has been surrounded by armed police, who had monitored his  telephones calls and then deployed to prevent the dissidents  from entering the building.    In March 1993 a Greek court sentenced two Germans and two  Turkish travellers to seven months imprisonment for carrying  posters which read "Freedom and Independence for Macedonia."  Their "offence" was to display the material on board an Olympic  Airways jet before it took off from Athens Airport on a flight  to Frankfurt. The court convicted them of "spreading false  information" and "interfering with air traffic." One of the  convicted was Professor Josef Rochensaus, who told the court  that he was a "free person with the right to freedom of speech,"  which the court ignored.    Macedonian Slavs who leave Greece face a further risk. Under  the Greek nationality law, Greek citizens of non-Hellenic ethnic  origin, who leave Greece may find themselves stripped of their  citizenship in their absence. They may be deemed to have  emigrated permanently from Greece, and as the decision is an  administrative act, it cannot be challenged in the Greek courts.    Greek citizens of Slav or Turkish ethnic origin have gone  abroad for a few months, only to find that they cannot return to  their native country because some officials, has in their  absence, deemed them to have emigrated permanently and thus  relinquished citizenship. Under Law 106841 of 1982, and law  1540 of 1985, Greek citizens of Hellenic descent, deprived of  their citizenship and property rights by such an act can apply  for a reversal of the decision, others are subjected to the  confiscatory effects of the legislation. The report also shows  a growing pattern of evidence of the suppression of freedom of  religion of non-Greek Orthodox believers. Under Article 13,  Paragraph 2 of the Greek Constitution, "proselytism" for  religions, other than the Orthodox faith is forbidden, by the  terms of Article 4 of Law 1363/1983 of the penal code. This law  was introduced when Greece was ruled by the fascist government  in the Metaxas era, which makes it a criminal offence to seek  converts to other faiths.    Over two thousand of Jehovah's Witnesses, Baptists and  Pentecostalists have been arrested in the last ten years under  this law, some four hundred have been imprisoned. Several of  these religious detainees report abuse and beating in jail.    One example of the degree of persecution cited is the case  of  Minos Kokkoinakis. Born in 1909 in Sitia, Crete, he is a  merchant and still lives in the same town. He has been arrested  sixty times since 1938.    Kapeleri Evanggelia, from Platans, has been jailed 13 times  for his activities as a Jehovah's Witness, he has additionally  alleged torture and mistreatment by the police.    George Gerefalakis of Heraklion, Crete, was tried for  "proselytism" on 10th May 1990. He was 86 years old, and  terminally ill with cancer, he had to be carried into court on a  stretcher. His accusers were two Greek Orthodox priests. Mr.  Gerefalakis was convicted as charged and sentenced to seven  months imprisonment. Tragically, he died in jail on 10th June  1990.    The report also examines the fate of religious conscientious  objectors to compulsory military service. By May 1993, the ISHR  had established that there were 388 imprisoned in very poor  conditions.    Other violations on religious freedom include the ban on  employment of non-Orthodox believers as teacher, even in private  schools. One example cited is the case of Valiki Pilaftsgou,  who in October 1991, applied for a permit to teach biology and  French. He was refused because he is a Jehovah's Witness.    Additionally, Greek law imposes restrictions on the  publication, circulation and importation of non-Orthodox  religious literature.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Filatov Active"] </F>   [Text] NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has come to learn that  presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov, who remains in his  position only thanks to the hue and cry raised around his  possible resignation, has lately decided to prove his usefulness  to Yeltsin. According to his plan, the administration's  structure should have a subdivision (some 120 people in number)  that would already now launch a campaign for a new president of  Russia -- Boris Yeltsin. According to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  information, many "democratically" oriented former people's  deputies of the Russian Federation have received an invitation  to join such a service. Some of them have refused, in  unprintable form.</p>

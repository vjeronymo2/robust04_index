			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Management training record mixed MOST British companies believe money spent on management training is money well spent but only half are doing any formal training, according to a survey published yesterday. The survey was by the government-backed Management Charter Initiative, which seeks to improve standards of management training. It found that companies employing more than 500 people had the most managers involved in training while small companies were less actively engaged in formally training managers. Mr Andrew Summers, chief executive of the MCI, said one reason might be that small companies could spare less time for managers to be away from work. Training, he said, should not consist just of sending people on courses. According to the survey of more than 500 organisations, smaller companies were least likely to agree that training increased loyalty or management standards were useful in measuring performance. The business services sector trained more managers than any other, while the machinery, manufacturing and engineering sectors were least likely to be training them. The MCI, through local organisations including Tecs and chambers of commerce, is seeking to influence more companies to improve training. Management Development in the UK.

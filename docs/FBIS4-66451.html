			<p>Stations   <F P=102>   94FE0329H Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Nov 93 p  16 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0329H </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline] </F>   [Text] In FY94, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy  (ANRE) will embark on the construction of a treatment plant for  waste oil and oil-containing sludge from gasoline stations. This  measure was necessitated by the July 1993 revised ``waste  treatment law'' that specifically regulates the treatment of  gasoline station wastes. In the private sector, Ishiyagawa Plant  of Kobe Petroleum Business Co-op Union had been treating  gasoline station wastes without government subsidy.    The ANRE's treatment plant for spent oil and oil-containing  sludge from gasoline stations will be built by providing a  subsidy of &yen;200 million (two-thirds) in FY94 to the  Prefectural Petroleum Commerce Co-op Federation, which will pay  the remaining one-third. Initially, only one plant is planned,  and it is to be modeled after the Ishiyagawa Plant of Kobe  Petroleum Business Co-op Union.    This particular plant, constructed on a 3,205-sq m lot at a  cost of approximately &yen;300 million and in operation since  1974, is capable of treating 550 kl of spent oil and 100 tons of  oil-containing sludge per month. Spent oil is preheated to  130C, dewatered in a flushing tower, and sent to a  stationary separation tank, where the sludge sinks to the  bottom. Oil recovered from this process is converted into heavy  oil, which is used as fuel for public bath houses and  greenhouses.    Oil-containing sludge, together with the sludge separated  from spent oil, is sent to an incinerator for separation of the  oil component from the aqueous component. Processed sludge is  disposed of at reclaimed dumping sites in Kobe City. Processed  spent oil, which may be classified as between A and B heavy oil  grades and which has a low sulfur content of 0.6 percent, can be  re-used.    According to a recent survey by ANRE, the majority of  gasoline stations paid the processor for spent oil processing;  approximately 50 percent of the total spent oil was stored in  drums. The same trend was also seen for oil-containing sludge.  Therefore, the construction of more treatment facilities is  desired not only by regulators, but also by petroleum dealers,  who are concerned about their waste disposal.</p>

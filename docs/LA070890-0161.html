			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 IN 5 GOOD SHOWING  </P> <P> "Survey Shows Agents Left 1 in 5 Unhappy," (June 24) does a disservice to the  real estate profession. Referring to a recent Consumer Reports article, you  state that "during the latter half of the 1980s, real estate agencies left one  in five home sellers dissatisfied."  </P> <P> One might then logically extrapolate that the other four of those five sellers  were satisfied. Admittedly, it would be nice if the positive responses were  higher, but I don't think an 80% client satisfaction rating in a difficult  profession is cause for hanging one's head in shame. I seriously doubt that  bankers, stockbrokers, lawyers and architects would score any higher.  </P> <P> The next time you address this issue, perhaps it would be better that you  direct your attention to the fact that the glass is four-fifths full rather  than one-fifth empty.  </P> <P> BILL SLOAN  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

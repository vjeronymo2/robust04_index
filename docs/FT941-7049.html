			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BAe answers criticism of BMW/Rover deal British Aerospace tried 'for months' to reach agreement with Honda on a reorganisation of Rover Group, BAe shareholders have been told in a letter setting out the details of its intended sale of Rover to BMW of Germany. Asking them to approve the sale at an extraordinary meeting to take place on March 15, Mr John Cahill, outgoing BAe chairman, counters criticism of what has been described as a 'betrayal' of Honda's 15-year partnership with Rover. For BAe to have gone along with Honda's proposals for restructuring would have required it to provide continued 'substantial' financial support for Rover while remaining as a large minority shareholder, Mr Cahill says in his letter. Honda wanted each to hold a stake of 47.5 per cent, with the remaining 5 per cent allocated to Rover's employees. Under the terms of the sale, BMW will buy the entire issued share capital of Rover and Rover USA, which controls Rover's sales activities in North America, for Pounds 800m cash. Of the sale price, Pounds 560m will be payable on completion of the deal, with the balance of Pounds 240m payable on June 30, plus interest from the initial completion date. In addition, BMW is assuming Rover Group borrowings of about Pounds 200m and responsibility for further off-balance sheet funding of some Pounds 700m. Although the sale will generate much-needed cash for BAe, it will also put the group in breach of its own borrowings limits unless shareholders approve further changes on March 15. Its articles of association currently restrict borrowings to a maximum of 150 per cent of adjusted capital and reserves. Since the sale will reduce shareholders' funds by nearly Pounds 500m, this limit will be breached once the sale is completed. Shareholders will be asked to raise the borrowing ceiling to 250 per cent.</p>

However, economic development  will pick up gradually, DIHT General Manager Franz Schoser said  when he presented the traditional DIHT spring survey of  approximately 25,000 enterprises. In his view, there is no  reason to give the all-clear signal for economic development  because orders on hand in the companies are still low,  production capacities are being insufficiently utilized, and the  profit situation is unsatisfactory.    For all of Germany, DIHT expects a growth of 0.5 percent at  best. The DIHT spring survey has come to the conclusion that,  for the first time in an extended period, there are slight  trends of recovery in west German industry. This moderate  confidence is primarily due to increasing exports. The  resulting economic growth will, however, not be sufficient to  bring the reduction of employment in western Germany to a halt  by the end of 1994.    The current stagnation of economic development at a low  level  continues to reveal the processes of structural adjustment in  western Germany, in Schoser's view. Efforts to improve  competitiveness and the quality of Germany as an industrial  location have shown some success; however, painfully achieved  cost reductions are all too often counteracted by additional  burdens imposed by the state. This is particularly due to the  wave of local taxes and fees, which has recently been steadily  swelling. In addition, economic development is hampered by the  relatively low purchasing power, which affects, in particular,  the trade and service sector. Regarding the development of  employment, there is not yet any easing of tension to be seen at  the moment, not to mention a change in the trend. The  forthcoming wage contracts are currently playing a key role in  all plans for personnel by the companies.    The investment climate, which has been rather frosty so far,  has not yet warmed decisively, Schoser noted in Bonn. Positive  corrections in the investment plans can be expected only if the  revival of exports were to be stronger this year than expected.  The current stimuli -- primarily from North and South America  and from Southeast Asia -- are still too weak to act as an  engine for the German economy, especially since demand from  Germany's main export region, Europe, is weak. The assessment  of the situation in eastern Germany, on the other hand, is  generally more optimistic. The confidence dominating there is  primarily based on a clear increase in orders received.  According to DIHT's assessment, even quicker recovery of the  east German companies is, however, still hindered by the  excessively rising wage and ancillary wage costs, which are an  oppressing burden. Many private companies also have an  insufficient amount of capital. Even though investment  activities will remain energetic in eastern Germany in 1994,  especially in the construction sector, the marked investment  dynamism of the initial period after German unification will  abate slowly, because various large-scale investments have been  concluded already.  <H5>  Bright Spot for Exporters </H5>   DIHT still sees tremendous administrative obstacles in the  new laender for exploiting investment potential -- for instance,  in purchasing and utilizing real estate property. DIHT expects  a bright spot for the east German exporters, whose prospects on  the world market are gradually improving. Their importance for  the overall German economy, however, still remains small. The  reduction of personnel will certainly come to a halt by the end  of this year, the DIHT predicts.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Changes in store as CSFB aims to stay in front: Management moves at the investment bank BEHIND the assurances of continuity, changes are afoot at Credit Suisse First Boston, following the announcement last week that Mr David Mulford, the former US Treasury official and erstwhile investment banker, is to replace Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff as head of the London-based investment bank. CSFB is one of the institutions most closely associated with the growth of international financial markets in London in the 1980s, and Mr Rudloff, a highly visible figure in those markets, has been almost synonymous with CSFB. The nature of Mr Rudloff's departure has provoked speculation about what lies in store for the bank he shaped. Mr Rudloff, whose appointment emerged at a board meeting in Zurich on Wednesday, hinted enigmatically: 'You can never pre-judge a board in Switzerland.' In a recent interview in the magazine Euromoney, Mr Rudloff, asked if another career awaited him, replied: 'Perhaps. But there is still so much to build here.' He is to join the board of CS Holding, the majority shareholder of the CS First Boston group, which includes CSFB and its two sister companies. CS Holding reported net earnings of SFr534m (Pounds 244m) in the first half to September 1992. 'This is a transition that was planned - though the timing was not planned,' said Mr Mulford adding that it was Mr Rudloff himself who had precipitated the timing of the change. Mr Mulford had arrived in London only the day before the announcement, from an assignment in Latin America, and admitted to not being fully briefed yet on the operations of the firm he had just taken over, but his early comments will do nothing to dispel the impression that changes lie ahead. The old rivalries remain between the three arms of the group, First Boston in the US, CSFB in Europe and CS First Boston Pacific in Asia, despite a move to bring them all together in 1988 under a common holding company, CS First Boston. 'The period of separateness is clearly over, but it does take time for the culture to change,' says Mulford. He believes he will 'provide leadership in accelerating the global integration of investment banking (at CSFB), which still has some way to go'. There is also a desire to develop CSFB beyond its base as a Euromarkets firm. Mr Mulford refers to a shift from CSFB's core fixed-income underwriting business as a process already underway. He says he 'wants to maintain the leadership position' of CSFB in the traditional fixed income business, but 'there is also growing global investment banking business, which is more diverse. This firm has to broaden the scope of its investment banking business'. This view is shaped by his belief that, during his years away from the industry, the process of 'globalisation' has transformed financial markets, as borders between markets were removed. Mr Mulford has a mandate to develop business in Latin America, where his contacts are excellent (he was the US Treasury's negotiator on the Brady plan). He also has a keen interest in eastern Europe (where CSFB has been one of very few active banks) and the former Soviet Union. He says he joined CS First Boston because he believed it to be the most international of banking groups. 'That (global) business is marketed and managed differently from a traditional Euromarket fixed income business. It is . . . much more complex .' Some observers see the appointment as a victory for the US arm of the business: Mr Mulford was brought in last November as vice-chairman of First Boston in the US. A more integrated firm, they think, will effectively be governed from the US, where the holding company for the three units is based. 'CSFB used to be a very independent, locally-focused firm,' said one former employee. 'That is going to change.' The appointment follows a bad year for CSFB in 1992, when profits slumped, and the US arm of the firm was the main contributor to the group, reversing the trend of the last few years. Management changes elsewhere in the CS First Boston group last week add to the impression that disparate businesses are being pulled closer together. Mr Bob Diamond, who had been in charge of the Asian unit, was moved to New York to run bond trading in the US and Asia. This move towards specialisation - which most other US-based investment banks have already made - raises a question over the position of Mr Allen Wheat, who runs the firm's derivatives unit and only last year was made head of trading in London. He had been widely tipped to succeed Mr Rudloff. Last week's announcement left it unclear if he would now report to Mr Diamond. Mr Mulford said: 'Allen is a very, very important figure, both here and in the group.' But the appointment of Mr Mulford, passing over Mr Wheat, casts doubt over the stability of the firm's senior management. 'Basically, CSFB has been split in two,' says one insider, meaning that the investment banking side will operate under Mr Mulford, while Mr Wheat will run trading operations in London. The appointment of Mr Mulford is undoubtedly the greatest upheaval since the restructuring of the group under a new holding company in 1988. 'I haven't come here to change things,' protests Mr Mulford. But change seems to be on the way, nevertheless.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXIT BY VALVANO LEAVES WOLFPACK IN CONFUSION  </P> <P> Jim Valvano's departure as coach leaves North Carolina State with the twofold  task of finding a new athletic director and rebuilding its men's basketball  program.  </P> <P> "This is a very critical and difficult time for us," said William Burns Jr.,  co-vice chairman of the N.C. State Board of Trustees.  </P> <P> "But I think the university is strong enough. I don't see any problem getting  good people to fill these positions.  </P> <P> "I would hope that the new coach would be a man of high principle, one who  believes in working with young men and encouraging their development and at the  same time winning some games."  </P> <P> Supporters and officials at N.C. State echoed the optimism Valvano displayed  Saturday after he agreed to leave and not sue the school in exchange for  $238,000. Valvano also stands to be paid $375,000 by the university's booster  club, one of Valvano's attorneys said.  </P> <P> Valvano had been under pressure to resign since reports in February that former  players accepted cash and shaved points. Valvano never was implicated.  </P> <P> Much of the rebuilding process, some say, has been left in the hands of Charlie  Bryant, executive secretary of the Wolfpack Club.  </P></p>

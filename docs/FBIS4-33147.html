			<p>BFN     [Text] Unofficial sources have informed EL DIARIO DE  CARACAS that Venezuela is willing to accept a small number of  Haitians who meet political refugee requirements for a short  period of time until the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) finds another country in which they can reside  permanently.    The Haitian issue will be included on the agenda for talks  that will be held in Caracas with U.S. Under Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott. The sources also stressed that the United States  has tried on several occasions to convince the Venezuelan  Government to accept Haitian refugees. The UNHCR also has been  negotiating directly with Venezuela on the issue, and Venezuela  has replied that it is willing to grant temporary asylum because  of the unique situation Haiti is now experiencing.    Talbott will arrive in Venezuela on the evening of 2 June  with a delegation that will include Alexander Watson, assistant  U.S. secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Meanwhile,  U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela Jeffrey Davidow said: "Venezuela is  the only Latin American country that is member of the Friends of  Haiti group. Venezuela has always played an important role in  the fight to return democracy to the island."    The agenda of the Americas Summit, which will be held in  Miami later this year, is another important issue that will be  discussed. Unofficial sources noted that the Unites States is  interested in proposing a "good government" policy; in other  words, it wants to propose a fight against corruption.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Equitable surplus shrinks further EQUITABLE Life Assurance Society, the third largest US insurer, yesterday revealed it saw its surplus shrink by another Dollars 290m in 1991 - ahead of the Dollars 250m 'surplus note' capital injection which Axa, the French insurer provided in early summer. The 'surplus' is essentially the policyholders' cushion, and changes from year to year are the best measure of a mutual company's profits or losses. After adding in the Dollars 250m surplus note injection and the mandatory securities valuation reserve, Equitable's statutory capital stood at Dollars 1.65bn at the end of 1991, compared with Dollars 1.69bn in 1990. Equitable is currently a mutual insurer - that is, one which essentially belongs to its policyholders. It is in the process of converting to shareholder-owned status, and Axa is expected to acquire a very large minority stake at that stage, in return for a total Dollars 1bn investment made last July. Equitable said yesterday it would 'soon' be mailing the hefty documentation on this to more than 2m eligible policyholders entitled to vote on the matter. The documents have been awaited for several days, now and two-thirds of those voting must be in favour. The figures produced by Equitable for 1991 are particularly complex because of the demutualisation scheme. Instead of just providing 'statutory' numbers, filed with the insurance authorities, Equitable is also disclosing how its figures would look of a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis. GAAP accounting, which is more conservative, is used by all publicly-held US corporations. Under GAAP, Equitable shows a Dollars 898.1m loss, with Dollars 307.8m coming from continuing operation, Dollars 561.9m from discontinued operations and a Dollars 28.4m charge for demutualisation costs. The loss for discontinued operations refer to the guaranteed investment contracts, an expensive form of contract, where Equitable has now written off its losses. The write-off was taken in one year under GAAP, but spread under the statutory system. A Dollars 370m write-up of the Alliance Capital subsidiary was also disallowed under GAAP.</p>

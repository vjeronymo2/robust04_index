			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP SUED OVER ALLEGEDLY PHONY TEST DATA;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGES ARE THE LATEST IN A STRING OF ACCUSATIONS  INVOLVING A NOW-DEFUNCT UNIT OF THE FIRM.  </P> <P> The Justice Department sued Northrop for more than $5 million in damages and  penalties Thursday, alleging that the aerospace firm submitted phony test  results on a stabilization device for a Marine Corps jet fighter.  </P> <P> The charges are yet another legal complication growing out of Northrop's  now-defunct Western Services department in Pomona, a small operation that was  the subject of an earlier civil fraud suit and a federal criminal indictment.  </P> <P> The civil suit filed Thursday marks the third time that the government has sued  a Northrop operation for fraud or joined suits filed against the company by  whistle-blowers. Northrop also faces at least three federal criminal  investigations around the country and several other civil suits by former  employees.  </P> <P> Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud counts last month in Los Angeles  and paid a $17-million fine in connection with tests on the same stabilization  device for the Marine fighter involved in Thursday's suit and on guidance  equipment for a nuclear-armed cruise missile.  </P> <P> The civil suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles under the federal  False Claims Act, alleges that the firm falsely certified on at least 59  occasions that the stabilization component for the Marine AV-8B Harrier jet met  government specifications. The government is seeking $4.8 million in treble  damages allowed under the False Claims Act and more than $600,000 in civil  penalties.  </P> <P> The device, known as a rate sensor assembly, is designed to maintain the  stability of the Harrier while it takes off and lands vertically, which it does  by vectoring the thrust of its jet engines.  </P> <P> Under a series of subcontracts issued to Northrop by Honeywell Inc. between  January, 1980, and September, 1986, Northrop was supposed to test the rate  sensor assemblies by vibrating the device and exposing it to extreme  temperature conditions.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Northrop employees adjusted a "shaker table" so that it  would appear that the assemblies were vibrated at a much more intense level  than they actually were and that they met contract specifications when they did  not.  </P> <P> When the firm submitted the first two devices in 1983, it certified that they  had withstood 4,000 hours of vibration and temperature cycling when they had  not done so, the complaint charges.  </P> <P> "The facts demonstrate that the government was ill-served," Assistant Atty.  Gen. Stuart M. Gerson said Thursday in a telephone interview. "I am sure there  are some very fine people at Northrop, but what we are saying is that in this  case and others there was improper conduct."  </P> <P> The Western Services department, where the allegedly improper work was done,  was a small autonomous unit with only several dozen employees. It reported to  headquarters for the Northrop Precision Products division in Massachusetts.  </P> <P> The Pomona operation was shut down by the company after the allegations  surfaced in 1987, and the plant manager was fired along with three of his  employees, a Northrop spokesman said.  </P> <P> The plant manager, Clarence Gonsalves, pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts  in February. In addition, the plant's engineering supervisor pleaded guilty  earlier. But the Justice Department dropped charges against two top Northrop  executives in the case.  </P> <P> The Northrop spokesman defended the quality of the rate sensor device. He said:  "According to the . . . (the Marine Corps), the equipment has performed  satisfactorily in flight operations.  </P> <P> Two former employees of the Pomona plant have also filed a suit against  Northrop, alleging that the firm falsified tests on a guidance device for the  air-launched cruise missile. The Justice Department last year joined in that  suit, which is seeking $90 million in treble damages.  </P> <P> Philip Benson, an attorney representing those employees complained Thursday  that the Justice Department acted improperly by filing the Harrier suit, since  the original information came from his plaintiffs.  </P> <P> "What they have done is rip us off," he said. "I am upset." But Gerson, the  assistant attorney general, said: "In . . . (false claims cases), there are  disputes of who has the primacy. If there is any such dispute here, I am not  aware of it."  </P> <P> SYLMAR FIRM CHARGED -- The company conspired to defraud the government through  false test results on military aircraft parts, the Justice Department says.

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> That's Italian: A low-budget TV show where men and women throw off their  clothes to win prizes is gaining popularity in Italy, despite condemnation by  critics, and might be coming to America. On the "Hit It Big" (Colpo Grosso)  game show, contestants strip down to their underwear, accumulating points as  they peel off layers of clothing to the rhythm of pop music. When the show  first aired three years ago, it was criticized by the Roman Catholic Church,  the press and politicians. But producer Umberto Smaila has sold the show in  Germany and says he is negotiating with American cable television. "Italians  have shown they're very mature. Beyond seeing it as just about naked breasts  and bottoms, they've understood it's just fun, like the Paris Lido," Smaila  said. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PARTY CRASHER SOUGHT IN SLAYING  </P> <P> A suspected gang member is being sought in a fatal shooting at a Lancaster  birthday party, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said today.  </P> <P> Christopher Sanford, 18, died at 9:30 a.m. Sunday at Antelope Valley Medical  Center, about 10 hours after the Saturday night shooting at a home in the 44700  block of Benald Street, Deputy Roger Hom said.  </P> <P> A guest at the party, Sheldon Culver, 24, was hospitalized and in stable  condition with a gunshot wound.  </P> <P> The gunman, believed to be 16 to 18 years old, has not been identified,  deputies said.  </P> <P> Hom said the incident began when three suspected gang members attempted to  crash a birthday party at the Benald Street home. There was a dispute as the  three were being ejected and one of them drew a gun and shot Culver in the  neck.  </P> <P> The three were then chased from the house, Hom said. In front of the home, the  gunman turned and fired a shot at his pursuers and instead shot Sanford, who  had not been involved in the incident, Hom said.  </P> <P> "He just happened to be leaving the party at that time," Hom said.  </P> <P> Hom said the three teen-agers who crashed the party escaped.  </P></p>

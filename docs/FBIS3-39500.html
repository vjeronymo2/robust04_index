"Around the end of the year," economic indicators "did not show  a unified picture; however, the basic trend seems to be upward,"  Rexrodt's ministry now notes.    The economists in Bonn are more worried about the situation  in west German industry. "Orders received and production once  again declined there during the fourth quarter, following an  upswing that was observed during the third quarter." All in  all, adjusted GDP, as a comprehensive expression of the overall  economic performance, "may have declined a bit" during the last  quarter of 1993. As a positive element, the ministry notes  "improved" business expectations in the processing industry.    On 21 January, the ministry said: "The slow climb out of the  deep valley of the recession had already begun in the old  laender last year. During the second and third quarter,  GDP...increased slightly and probably stayed at the achieved  level also during the last quarter of 1993."</p>

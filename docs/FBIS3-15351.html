At a press conference Wednesday [2 March], Vagnorius said  industry production after the 1992 parliamentary elections  dropped 2.5 times and continues to decrease by 10 percent each  month. In his words, if the process is not stopped, the  industry will be in a very deep crisis already this year.    Vagnorius said the average salary has already dropped to a  critical line. In his words, salaries have decreased two times  since the fall of 1992.    The lawmaker said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor  Party cannot be blamed only for lack of competence. In his  opinion, the party in power is so deeply involved in corruption  that it can not make a move without approval of its "sponsors."  Vagnorius, who is one of the leaders of the Conservative Party,  said there is no other way to overcome the crisis but to hold  early parliamentary elections in early 1995.    Some other rightist political forces suggest to elect a new  parliament next fall.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Pork barrel sale PRESIDENT BUSH has taken a calculated risk in allowing, for overtly electoral reasons, the sale of 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. Sacrificing established policy to win votes - or using subsidies to buy them, as with the wheat sales announced separately on Wednesday - is as old as elections themselves. But this job-saving order for General Dynamics threatens to undermine Mr Bush's bold and sensible approach of constructive engagement towards China. Mr Bush's calculation is that the importance of trade with the US, which yielded China a Dollars 13bn surplus in 1991, will dissuade Beijing from retaliation. Since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Mr Bush has struggled to keep China in the fold rather than isolate it. In the face of strong domestic opposition, he has maintained its most-favoured nation trading status while keeping up pressure on human rights. The rationale is to strengthen the hand of economic reformers in China who want to open the country to the outside world, boosting economic freedom. The west's hope is that political freedom will follow. China has not given Mr Bush much in return. Its continuing determination to stamp ruthlessly on any political dissent was underlined this week with the arrest of a dissident on his return to China and the expulsion of his foreign friends. However, broader issues are at stake. Beijing has been exerting pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme, and last week established diplomatic relations with South Korea. In the uncertain security environment in Asia it would be better to enlist the co-operation of the widest range of regional powers including China, rather than sow the seeds of possible confrontation. It is difficult to see how selling fighters to Taiwan fits in with this approach. Washington agreed with Beijing in 1982 to limit and eventually end arms sales to Taiwan. Now it argues that the military balance has been altered by Chinese purchases of advanced fighters from Russia. Taiwan should have the right to defend itself, but this sale will scarcely ensure its long-term security. The way towards peaceful reunification of China, desired by both governments, lies in the investment links which have developed in recent years, between cash-rich Taiwan and the labour-rich mainland. Mr Bush is gambling that Beijing's reaction will consist simply of protests. The Chinese will be uncomfortably aware that Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, has promised a much tougher line against China on human rights issues. However, from the fury in Beijing yesterday it was impossible to tell whether Mr Bush has calculated correctly. The threatened Chinese withdrawal from arms control talks within the UN Security Council would be a serious setback to containment of weapons proliferation. More immediately, the sale could upset current trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Quite legitimately, Mr Bush is pressing for a relaxation of China's import restrictions, which before this week looked set to be granted and would certainly help persuade Congress to renew China's MFN status. Progress on these issues far outweighs the domestic benefits to be obtained from selling a few fighters.</p>

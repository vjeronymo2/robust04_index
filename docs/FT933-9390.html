			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec oil output 1m barrels over quota THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries produced more than 1m barrels a day above its oil output quota in July, Reuter reports from Nicosia. According to the Middle East Economic Survey, the weekly oil newsletter, Opec's July production was 24.64m b/d - about 230,000 b/d above the total for June. Iran's output dropped by 71,000 b/d to 3.62m b/d, but that was still above the country's Opec quota of 3.34m b/d. The newsletter said Kuwait's production rose by 150,000 b/d to 1.9m b/d in July. Kuwait refused to join Opec's third-quarter quota accord in June and insisted on a higher production allocation. 'A large part of the additional supply came from Kuwait - now quota-free and programmed to reach 2.16m b/d by September,' the survey said. Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer and exporter, produced 8.15m b/d in July, but 'actual sales deliveries were reckoned to have stayed within the quota of 8m b/d, with the balance destined for overseas storage', the newsletter said. It suggested that during the third quarter Opec countries would continue producing above their overall quota of 23.582m b/d. 'This is likely to rise further as the third quarter progresses owing to projected higher output from Kuwait and other factors.' The newsletter said Iran's crude exports had consistently fallen this year within the range of 2.7m-2.9m b/d. World oil prices rose by nearly 40 cents a barrel after a surprise announcement that Mr Jean Ping, president of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would join a quota compliance committee meeting in Vienna today. Mr Ping, oil minister of Gabon, will join the oil ministers of Libya and Qatar as well as the secretary-general of Opec, Mr Subroto of Indonesia, for the Vienna meeting to review the group's July production figures. London September futures of the world benchmark crude oil, North Sea Brent Blend, began to move up from just below Dollars 16.30 a barrel on the news. The price rallied to Dollars 16.64 as petrol prices rose on fears of a shortage because of refinery problems in the US. Overproduction by some of the 12 members of Opec has been blamed for the recent slide in oil prices, which fell below Dollars 16 last month.</p>

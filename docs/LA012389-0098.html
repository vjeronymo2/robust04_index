			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALSH TO MEET OWNER ON FUTURE;  </P> <P> 49ER COACH SAYS THEY'LL SEEK 'FORMULA THAT WORKS'  </P> <P> Bill Walsh's future as coach of the San Francisco 49ers likely will be decided  in a meeting with team owner Eddie DeBartolo this week.  </P> <P> Walsh said this morning that he and DeBartolo will talk about the team and  Walsh's role with it before making any decisions.  </P> <P> "We want a formula that works," Walsh said at a news conference less than 12  hours after leading the 49ers to their third Super Bowl victory of the 1980s.  "It does not necessarily need that I be the coach. But we'll see.  </P> <P> "It would be easier to do it (now). But I don't want to leave and then come  back in nine days and say I changed my mind."  </P> <P> Walsh did single out defensive coordinator George Seifert from what he called  "a staff as good as any."  </P> <P> "The single person who made the difference in our organization was George  Seifert," he said. "He's the brightest, best tactician of defensive football  and the players believe in him. I hope he's a head coach (next year). He sure  deserves it."  </P> <P> Walsh deserves credit for building the team of the decade. But he wouldn't put  the 49ers in the class of the four-time champion Pittsburgh Steelers of the  1970s.  </P> <P> "I don't know who will ever break Chuck Noll and Pittsburgh's record," Walsh  said. "That was as great a dynasty as any. The only difference (is faces); we  did ours with three different teams. They had basically the same nucleus.  </P> <P> "Winning four is not motivating me."  </P> <P> Just two months ago, Walsh was ready to give up coaching. The 49ers were 6-5  and rumors that he and DeBartolo were at odds had surfaced.  </P> <P> "Ed really was frustrated after two straight losses. We blew a game to Phoenix  that we led 23-0 and we were so flat we couldn't even play against the Raiders  the next week. Ed was very upset. I was very upset. But never at each other.  </P> <P> "After the Raiders game (a 9-3 loss), I could've told you what my plans were.  They were easy."  </P> <P> They might still be easy, but he isn't saying yet.  </P></p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SALANT APPAREL IN BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Salant Corp. today filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors,  saying weakness in the retail apparel business has made it impossible to pay  its debts.  </P> <P> Ray W. Williams, Salant's chairman and chief executive, said the company  believes it can continue operating while it negotiates with creditors and  attempts a court-supervised reorganization.  </P> <P> Salant accumulated debt in acquiring a much larger apparel manufacturer,  Manhattan Industries Inc., in early 1988. Before taking over Manhattan, Salant  mainly was a maker of private label clothing for retailers, such as Sears,  Roebuck &amp; Co. and J. C. Penney Co.  </P> <P> There are numerous national names under Manhattan, including Manhattan shirts,  Lady Manhattan sportswear, Perry Ellis women's and men's wear and Vera scarves  and apparel items.  </P></p>

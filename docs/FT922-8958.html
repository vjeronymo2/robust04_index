			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (9): Those bottlenecks seem likely to continue - Air traffic control THE BUSINESS traveller hardly needs reminding about the inadequacies of the European Air Traffic Control (ATC) system - the delays are all too real and there is little prospect of real improvement in the next two to three years. Last year in Europe more than 20,000 flights a month in the summer and 10,000 a month in the winter were delayed because of ATC problems. The proportion of flights more than 15 minutes late almost doubled between 1987 and 1991. The Association of European Airlines, representing 22 European carriers, says almost 20 per cent of flights were delayed by more than 15 minutes last year, only slightly better than in 1990 even though 1991 saw a 7 per cent decline in air travel caused by the Gulf War. Last year, 54,000 aircraft hours were lost because of congestion, equivalent to the annual workload of a fleet of 20 short-haul jets. A comparison of times on short-haul routes within Europe shows that flights are now scheduled to take between 5 and 10 per cent longer today than they did 20 years ago, despite improvements in technology. For example, in 1972 a British Airways flight between London Heathrow to Paris Orly took one hour. Today the same flight is scheduled to take five minutes longer - to allow for delays. Unprecedented air traffic growth in the 1980s, coupled with a shortage of air traffic controllers and ageing equipment, has resulted in congestion on the ground and in the skies, and pushed Europe's fragmented ATC system to breaking point, particularly during peak summer periods. With air traffic still growing at about 8 per cent a year, the volume doubles every 10 years. As a result, airlines and civil aviation authorities have warned that Europe faces an air travel crisis in the next few years unless urgent action is taken to harmonise and integrate European ATC systems. According to Mr Karel Van Miert, EC transport commissioner, air traffic delays in Europe already cost Pounds 3.8bn a year and airlines have warned that these threaten to undermine Brussels's efforts to liberalise European air transport. The problems were highlighted in a report considered by transport ministers from the 28 member countries of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) who gathered in London in March. The report said the work needed to harmonise and improve air traffic control in Europe in the 1990s 'will be much greater' and more costly than first estimated. The study, undertaken by Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based government-backed air safety group, examined the ATC systems of the 23 nations which were members of the conference in April 1990 when the European Air Traffic Control Harmonisation and Integration Programme (Eatchip) action plan was agreed (since then five eastern European nations have joined ECAC.) In Europe some 50 ATC centres spread over an area of 3m square miles - roughly comparable in size with the US which operates a single ATC system from 20 centres - handled 4.8m flights in 1990, of which 90 per cent were internal European traffic. In contrast to the US, the European ATC centres 'share one big (technical) deficiency, namely their generalised incompatibility,' said the report. Eurocontrol discovered 31 different systems in the European ATC centres, using computers from 18 manufacturers, with 22 different operating systems and 33 different programming languages. The result, said the report is 'a patchwork of systems, most of which have been developed independently, using different designs and methodologies leading to further incompatibilities.' In addition, of the centres evaluated, Eurocontrol said half had 'significant deficiencies' and almost one in four had 'major deficiencies', while only 17 per cent had no problems. Until fairly recently, attempts to get to grips with Europe's ATC problems had been stalled because of political and other disagreements. As Air Vice Marshal Mike Gibson, director-general of policy and plans at the National Air Traffic Services of the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, says, it has been difficult because 'there wasn't one particular organisation with the right membership and the right expertise'. The European Commission, backed by Germany in particular, had argued for the building of a single new integrated system. However this approach was resisted by others, including the UK, which argued that it was too expensive, bureaucratic and unworkable, raising a number of difficult sovereignty issues. But recently most attention has focused on the ECAC and on the initiative to upgrade the existing ATC systems in Europe and get them to work together. 'What we are trying to do is to get the worst in Europe up to the standard of the best and then to get all of the systems in Europe working together so that, from a user's point of view, there is a seamless system,' explains Mr Gibson. The basis of the plan therefore is a 'programme of convergence,' overseen by Eurocontrol, to harmonise procedures across Europe and improve and upgrade the existing ATC systems with equipment complying to common standards which can then be integrated. The plan embodies a step-by-step approach to integration, setting a series of operational targets such as those for radar coverage and communications. The strategy aims progressively to integrate ATC systems after they are harmonised in the busiest 'core area' - roughly bounded by London, Frankfurt and Paris - by 1995 at the latest and elsewhere by 1998. In March the ECAC transport ministers agreed to extend the plan to harmonise and integrate the operations of ATC systems to the five new Eastern European Conference members, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Since the capacity of the air traffic system depends not only on the en-route air traffic control system but also the operational airport infrastructure, ECAC transport ministers also acknowledged the importance of relieving congestion in and around airports by launching a new airport strategy. Overall, members of the ECAC plan to spend more than Ecu 3bn on air traffic equipment over the next four years. The UK itself plans Pounds 750m of expenditure on the air traffic system by the end of the century, including the building of a new air traffic control centre on the south coast, due to be operational by 1996. At the same time, some progress towards integration of ATC systems has been made in parts of Europe and Eurocontrol has begun the task of creating a single central flow management unit in 1994 co-ordinating airline flight planning throughout Europe and replacing the current five flow management units. In the longer term the ECAC strategy has been designed to accommodate the introduction of new advanced technology systems such as air/ground data links and satellite tracking and navigation systems including the International Civil Aviation Organisation plans for Future Air Navigation Systems (Fans). Satellites, in conjunction with VHF radio, precision landing systems and aircraft transponders which report altitude and other data are likely to revolutionise air traffic control worldwide. For example, developing countries could use satellites instead of expensive ground-based radar systems to build an ATC system at a relatively small cost. The US, which boasts the world's most sophisticated ATC system, will nevertheless also probably begin replacing some of its ground-based navigation systems over the next decade. Spurred by mid-air collisions and increasingly frequent near-misses, the US authorities are already forcing airlines to install traffic-alert and collision-avoidance systems (TCAS) by 1994. After serious concern was voiced about emerging signs of infrastructure deficiencies in the mid 1980s, the US moved quickly to upgrade its ATC system. The number of air traffic controllers was increased, the Federal Aviation Authority was given a bigger budget, and the introduction of a Dollars 2.5bn nationwide air ATC system was accelerated together with a Dollars 16bn programme to cope with aircraft movements projected for the next decade. Even so, there are forecasts that air traffic bottlenecks will continue through the 1990s and that many US airports will shortly reach runway and terminal saturation point. As in south-east Asia, there are substantial plans for new airports and airport expansions - plans that will be closely monitored in Europe.</p>

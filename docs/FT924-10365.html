			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: Hitler's poodle fails to bark / Review of a new biography of the Fuhrer's foreign minister, Ribbentrop RIBBENTROP by Michael Bloch Bantam Press Pounds 20, 528 pages RIBBENTROP's ascent to power was amazingly swift for a successful importer of foreign wines who patronised the arts and counted Jews among his best customers and closest friends. Prodded by his domineering, ambitious and much loved wife, he joined the Nazi Party in May 1932 and was almost immediately recruited for a diplomatic career for which he had neither the intelligence nor the social graces needed for success. Ribbentrop was mocked by professionals, intrigued against by the Nazi leaders with whom he constantly quarrelled and was disliked by subordinates whom he bullied in the best Hitler-like manner. His pomposities and formalities made him a heaven-sent subject for the cartoonist David Low. Ribbentrop's inefficiencies as well as his rudeness, a disguise for a hardly concealed sense of inferiority, estranged him from the senior officials at the foreign ministry. Apart from Wolfgang Michalka's authoritative Ribbentrop und die Deutsche Weltpolitik, 1933-1940 (Munich, 1980), there are no full-scale studies of Ribbentrop's life. Michael Bloch, known for his books on the Duke of Windsor's wartime activities in which Ribbentrop played an important part, has set out to fill this void using an array of printed sources and memoir material. There are rumours of an unexplored collection of Ribbentrop private papers but it would be surprising if Bloch's portrait would need serious retouching. Readers will find scattered nuggets, including a fascinating photograph of Ribbentrop and Hitler at the Berghof. There are some trivial and comic inclusions but also others such as Ribbentrop's part in the 1943 Soviet-German peace talks of more serious interest. Bloch leaves us in no doubt that Ribbentrop's value to Hitler lay in his condition of servitude. The defendant was being honest when he told the judges at Nuremburg that he only reported to Hitler who in turn gave him his orders. Even when pursuing ideas of his own, Ribbentrop would seek the Fuhrer's assent, reversing course at the very first sign of disapproval. Unwilling to take in the reality of the Final Solution, Ribbentrop left the foreign ministry's dirty work in the hands of Martin Luther, a protege of both Ribbentrops. But a personal rebuke from Hitler immediately ended the foreign minister's period of 'wilful ignorance.' His instructions for the rapid evacuation of foreign Jews provided the evidence for one of the Nuremburg charges made against him. How different life would have been for Ribbentrop had he never fallen under Hitler's spell. Bloch argues that despite his servility, Ribbentrop could and did influence Hitler's policies. His extreme anglophobia, the product of failure in London, and his assurances that Britain would not fight fed Hitler's misconceptions in the summer of 1939. Ribbentrop's mania for alliances found fruition in the short-lived Nazi-Soviet pact and in the much sought but much delayed Tripartite Pact of 1940. The foreign minister used his control over the flow of information to protect the Fuhrer from unpleasant truths compounding the latter's errors of judgment. Ribbentrop's powers of persuasion were always limited by the fear of upsetting his leader. This explains, for instance, why he did not press for a Russo-German truce after Kursk. Even in the dock at Nuremburg, Ribbentrop's faith in Hitler's judgment remained unshaken. There is really little new to be said about Ribbentrop's role in the Nazi debacle or about his inadequacies as Hitler's foreign minister. But the limitations of this biography have more to do with its subject than with its author who writes with considerable verve and a sharp eye for the memorable anecdote and quotation. Bloch has tried, and with some measure of success, to breathe new life into this wooden figure. It is Ribbentrop who resists resuscitation.</p>

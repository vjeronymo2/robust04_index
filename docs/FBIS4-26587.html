			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Racing to the Future"] </F>   [Text] The State Council has just issued strict measures to  curb the rampant expansion of the futures market and urged  strict enforcement in exchanges and brokerage firms.    Earlier, the central government called a temporary halt to  the operation of property rights exchanges for rectification.    Meanwhile, fact-finding groups were sent by the state to  local futures and property rights exchanges to collect  information for making further decisions.    Obviously, such measures are not intended to stifle the  futures market or the trade in State enterprises' property.    As a matter of fact, it is aimed at standardizing the  operation of those exchanges and leading them to a healthy track.    In the long run, the central government is encouraging  futures development and trade in property rights.    To open futures markets and property rights exchanges is a  big step toward establishing a framework of the socialist market  economy. It also shows China's determination to embrace a  market economy.    However, their development has been too hasty for the  reforms. Local governments have been rushing headlong to set up  exchanges. As a result, their operation very often fails to meet  standard requirements.    Nationally, there are more than 40 registered futures  exchanges, over 500 brokerage firms, and 174 property rights  exchanges.    The central authorities have reaffirmed that the futures  market and the trade of property rights are still in an  experimental stage. It is necessary to mention that prudence is  the key to their pace of development.    Some local authorities are taking the wrong approach to  futures and property rights exchanges.    Some assume opening futures exchanges will boost their local  coffers. Some tried to get rid of some money-losing state  enterprises instead of trying to improve their management.    Their view has fueled the overheated development of those  exchanges.    In addition, due to lack of relevant laws and regulations,  profiteers take advantage of the loopholes to pocket illicit  earnings in the fledgling markets.    Some futures firms make money simply by swindling their  customers. And some profiteers try to manipulate the selling  price of state enterprises.    Thus, profiteers are often the only beneficiaries while  customers and the state lose out.    As a Chinese saying goes, you cannot draw a circle and a  square unless you have a compass and a ruler. The development  of futures and trade of property rights will suffer setbacks  unless they are placed under proper guidance.    Relevant government departments are drafting regulations on  the management of those exchanges. It is necessary and timely  to lead these exchanges to a path of healthy growth.</p>

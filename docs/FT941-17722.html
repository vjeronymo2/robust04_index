			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Sold down the river for a second bridge: The controversial means of financing a new Severn crossing to south Wales Today the toll for cars to cross the Severn Bridge between England and Wales rises to Pounds 3.40 from Pounds 3.10 - a figure the Royal Automobile Club has condemned as 'extortionate'. For heavy trucks the toll increases from Pounds 9.30 to Pounds 10.10. A small consolation for drivers is that they now have a fine view of where most of the money goes: the privately-financed Pounds 300m second Severn crossing. Three miles downstream from the existing bridge the concrete caissons for the foundations of the new one, some weighing 2,000 tonnes, straddle the estuary like stepping stones. In the middle of the channel the two main pylons are rising at the rate of one metre a day towards their eventual height of 137m. Work on the cable-stayed bridge started in April 1992 and is within budget and on schedule to open in spring 1996. This month the labour force will increase to nearly 1,000 for what will be the peak year of activity. It is one of the largest construction projects in Europe and a prime example of the government's intention to attract more private investment into infrastructure. Severn River Crossing, a consortium of John Laing and GTM-Entrepose of France, is the main contractor, with Bank of America and Barclays de Zoete Wedd as financial partners. The consortium took over the existing bridge in 1992 with a concession to operate both crossings for a maximum of 30 years, after which ownership reverts to the government. Debt finance to build the new bridge is repaid by tolls, which are allowed to rise annually by inflation plus 6 per cent until 1996, then by inflation alone. The new bridge will have three lanes in each direction, a span of nearly 1km and an overall length, with its viaducts, of more than 5km. A toll plaza of 14 lanes will be built on the Welsh side - the tolls, as with the existing bridge, will apply only to westbound traffic. An M4 extension and approach roads to the M5 are being funded by the Department of Transport. The M4 will be re-routed to the new bridge, expected to take 60 per cent of the crossing traffic, and the road via the existing bridge will become the M48. In the hazardous task of building the new bridge, Laing and GTM have to contend with a tidal range of more than 12m, the second-highest in the world after the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. 'The best-read books here are the tide tables,' says Mr Norman Haste, project director. 'With a high tidal range you get very strong currents of up to 10 knots. When it is running at that sort of speed, it is virtually impossible to work on the river.' There are other difficulties. The estuary almost dries out at low tide, leaving only a short time for barges to manoeuvre the caissons, which are pre-cast on either shore. There are also tempestuous winds which regularly cause problems for high-sided vehicles on the existing bridge. In spite of the dangers there have been no fatal accidents so far. Annual traffic on the existing bridge has tripled to 18m vehicles from the 6m when it opened in 1966. Since Severn River Crossing took over running of the bridge queues have been cut by a combination of the introduction of one-way tolls, automatic cash payment and electronic tagging to replace season tickets, and by the impact of the recession. An undisclosed factor is how many vehicles avoid the tolls by making the long detour through Gloucestershire, and then enjoy a free return trip across the Severn. The RAC argues that high tolls are penalising Welsh small businesses and that there has been a big increase in trucks avoiding the bridge, 'with a devastating effect on local communities'. It says the bridge is a 'prime example to the government of what not to do' when it introduces motorway tolling. Severn River Crossing is confident that for most people time will be more important than money. What the tolls on the new crossing will fail to buy, however, is a good view. To counter the high winds, there will be 3m-high screens on both sides of the bridge.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man offer price cut to 180p The flotation price for shares in ED&amp;F Man has been cut by more than 15 per cent from the level indicated three weeks ago, since when the market has fallen by about 6 per cent. The offer price of 180p announced yesterday gives a notional yield of 6 per cent and a multiple of actual historic earnings of 9.5. It values the commodity trader and financial services group at Pounds 462.6m. The prospectus warns that a disappointing investment performance from the group's fund management arm will lead to a 'substantially reduced contribution' from the division this year. In the year to March 31 1994 it made Pounds 25.5m out of a group Pounds 67m. Analysts believe fund management profits may fall by up to 50 per cent but that strong growth from agricultural products and futures broking side will more than make up the shortfall. Group earnings per share are expected to increase by around 10 per cent. Though very low by the standards of recent new issues Man's share rating is in line with that of Exco, the money broker, for its successful flotation in June. Both companies operate in markets with a history of corporate upsets and had to work hard to explain their businesses to institutions. 'In the end Man had a good response from institutions but some thought it was just too much effort to get to know it,' said one of the company's advisers. A total of Pounds 110m of shares are being sold, of which Pounds 27.5m are the subject of a public offer, with the remainder placed with investors at the offer price. The offer is sponsored by Schroders with brokers James Capel. The company is currently owned by 100 of its top managers. Board members are selling less than 8 per cent of their holding and have undertaken not to dispose of any more before the announcement of next year's interim figures. See Lex</p>

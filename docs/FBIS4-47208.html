			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Verk: "....Even Local Governors Into the </F> Cabinet?"]    [Text] ABV has been unable to obtain any official  explanation of why the officially announced visit was postponed.  In the press department of the president of Kazakhstan, they  have said that the summit meeting will from all indications take  place in early July. Some observers conjecture on this basis  that the sides are attempting to use the intervening time to  remove a number of problems related to the package of  Russian-Kazakhstani "military" agreements, in particular  Moscow's leasing of Baykonur and the Saryshagan exercise grounds  in Zhezkazgan Oblast. Negotiations concerning the fate of the  latter facility were recently conducted in the "capital" of the  exercise grounds--the city of Priozersk--by Deputy Prime  Minister Abilsiitov and Russian Air Defense Commander Prudnikov.  It is also likely that President Nazarbayev's recent speech in  our parliament and his promises to review the Law on Languages  concerning the status of the Russian language, and most  important--more vigorous "gestures" concerning the Eurasian idea  in Kazakhstan and beyond--are compelling Moscow to make  adjustments on the fly in its position on the question of dual  citizenship.    At the same time, very interesting events have been  occurring  in the country's domestic political life. The first "salvo" of  personnel rearrangements and reorganizations of government  structures has been followed by a second. Creation of  Minneftegazprom [Ministry of the Petroleum and Gas Industry] can  rightly be considered the most powerful of those "shots." In the  opinion of certain well-informed people, this step, suggested  long ago by the logic of the oil intrigue's development,  signifies an attempt by the central authorities to tighten  control over this priority extractive industry. This was  practically unattainable in the structure of the previous  Minenergoprom [Ministry of Energy Industry], since the newly  founded oil corporations, concerns and joint ventures [JV],  which at the moment are working mainly for the future, were  constantly "tripping over" the coal and power industry people  with their needs of the moment, which does not make them any the  less urgent. It would seem that Minneftegazprom, as conceived by  the new structure's creators, will make it possible to  "resuscitate" oil exploration. The difficulties experienced by  geology today are well known after all. The very identity of the  new minister--former director of the JV TengizChevroil--is also  notable. Now that he is in that position, the American partners  of the Atyrau petroleum workers will feel considerably more  confident.... At the same time, some people also see the purely  political aspects of the ministry's creation. It is worth  recalling, for example, that in the past the present head of the  Russian Government was in command of this very industry. As for  Ravil Cherdabayev's service record, it offers every basis for  such comparisons: deputy chairman of the Guryev Oblast Executive  Committee, first deputy head of the oblast administration,  deputy general director of the production association  Tengizneftegaz. And to top it all off--candidate of economic  sciences, which is very significant in the context of the  shortage of economists on the Olympus of executive government.    As for the rest of the country's energy complex, we can take  a page from the classics and repeat: Its future is both empty  and dark. Judging from the present trend, bringing the power and  coal industries under a common sectoral ministry will no longer  save the decrepit colossus. Many informed people are inclined to  see this as the explanation of why Albert Salamatin, former  minister of industry, refused to head Minenergougleprom  [Ministry of Power and Coal Industry]. Although, from what  specialists say, this man accomplished quite a bit while  "sitting" in the Minprom [Ministry of Industry]. And his  departure, which at first seemed somewhat strange, to head the  Zhezkazgan Oblast administration is by all appearances related  to the government's desire to "restore order" in our copper  "economy."    Incidentally, now that we are speaking about heads. The  rumor  that sprang up early last week that they would soon become  members of the Cabinet of Ministers (see ABV, No. 51) seems not  be unfounded. The "purge of the ranks" before "entry" into the  government helps to explain the simultaneous replacement of  three "governors." We should mention that a similar precedent  occurred only at the end of last year, when four oblast hakims  were simultaneously removed for various reasons.    The striking thing now is that the head of government has  removed his deputies in regions with the poorest economic  situation (and in the case of East Kazakhstan Oblast [VKO], this  applies to the political situation as well). In that same VKO  prices of goods and services have quadrupled in the last year  and a half, and it takes seven minimum wages to buy the food  necessary for elementary survival. Nearly fifty enterprises have  been shut down (partially or completely). And all of this  against the background of intensifying demands of the population  for the region's autonomy, for activation of the Cossacks, and  similar sociopolitical ferment. It is not surprising that  inhabitants of Rudnyy Altay are more and more frequently  inclined to blame all their troubles on the local  administration, and probably indirectly on the higher-ups in the  executive government. In that context, replacing Amangelda  Bektemisov with Yuriy Lavrinenko is apparently supposed to cool  off the passions somewhat, since the VKO belongs to the  so-called "Russophone" regions. Another question: How long is  the inability of the authorities (both local and central) to  protect the social welfare of their subjects going to be covered  up with ethnic compromises?    Last week's retirement of Zaura Kadyrova, minister of social  security, proved that this is by no means a rhetorical question.  No proof is needed for anyone with even a superficial  familiarity with the mores and traditions of the Kazakhstan  political elite: This act has no precedent in our homeland. And  that also goes for the former minister's interview in the  Saturday issue of the government newspaper. The reproaches which  Mrs. Kadyrova addressed to the Cabinet of Ministers as a whole  and to the finance ministry in particular are quite serious. The  latter is essentially accused of having spent up the resources  of the pension fund ("2.2 billion rubles were sold to commercial  structures at low rates of exchange"). The former minister also  made a very significant appeal to the deputies: "I hope that the  parliament will restore the pension fund from the budget. It  must not be involved in commerce in the true sense of that  word." If these hopes are justified, then, in the opinion of  many, there will be occasion to speak of the beginning of a  government crisis in Kazakhstan. After all, most of the recently  elected deputies (as well as their predecessors) are seriously  (more or less, of course) concerned with "protecting the  interests of the voters." And on 7 March the pensioners were  hardly the most vigorous participants in the election. Thus, the  "people's choices" have a 100 percent chance of "scoring points"  with their constituents. Judging by certain steps taken in the  past by our parliamentarians, they will try not to miss that  opportunity.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pearson ahead of City hopes with Pounds 35m PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, suffered a 14 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34.8m for the half year ended June 30  -a better result than the City had expected. Newspapers, books and entertainment all improved their profits despite the effects of recession. 'With the major world economies still in or near recession we have seen no let up in the harsh trading conditions which characterised 1991, and to which the additional burden of a weaker US dollar has recently been added,' said Lord Blakenham, the chairman. He believed the recession in the UK could continue for another two years and that the company was treating the current situation as normal. 'We believe we are in a strong position to live with this recession for some time to come,' Lord Blakenham said. Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director, added that cost-cutting would continue. 'I don't think there is ever an end to cost-cutting,' he said. Group sales for the first half totalled Pounds 694.8m (Pounds 700.4m). Earnings declined to 4.4p (5.1p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at 5.375p. Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, said the results were a little better than expected but he was not changing his full-year forecast of pre-tax profits of Pounds 160m. The share price closed 2p higher at 314p. Trading profits of the newspaper division increased from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 15.1m, an improvement of 9 per cent. The contribution to the division from the Financial Times Group, including the newspaper, business information services and Les Echos, the French business paper, rose by 22 per cent, from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 13.2m. Books swung from losses of Pounds 13.4m to profits of Pounds 2.4m. Most of the improvement came from Penguin, particularly in the US where the publisher currently has seven titles in the New York Times top 50 best seller list. Trading profits from entertainment increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.6m but oil services suffered a 55 per cent drop from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 7.4m as major US oil companies ran down exploration and development. A sharp decline in investment banking to Pounds 7m (Pounds 12.9m) reflected the reduction in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in the UK. Fine china trading profits fell by 59 per cent to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 5.4m), mainly because margins had suffered in difficult market conditions. 'Firm cost control by all our businesses has continued to improve our overall cash performance and reinforce a very strong balance sheet,' Lord Blakenham said.</p>

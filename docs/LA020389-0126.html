			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILLS, THRILLS AT LACMA PREVIEW PARTY  </P> <P> It was a good night for Gronk. A very good night.  </P> <P> Gronk, the artist, who goes by only one name, was savoring the irony of it all.  </P> <P> Yes, of course, he said, it was an honor to see his paintings hanging inside  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. But it wasn't exactly the first time he  had shown there.  </P> <P> "In 1972," the East L.A. artist explained, "I came in the middle of the night  and defaced all the entrances and exits of the museum with spray paint. At that  time no Latino artist had ever shown here. I signed the whole museum as my art  piece. Now they're saying, 'Thank you.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stellar Supporters  </P> <P> Wednesday night's preview reception for "Hispanic Art in the United States, 30  Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors" brought out the usual stellar, sparkling  crowd of museum supporters, but there was something different about this  particular opening. Maybe it was the combination of black tie and black beans  on the menu. Or the sounds of Afro-Cuban music (with a slight jazz overtone)  beating through the Times Mirror Central Court. Or the elaborately painted  chrome yellow 1950 Chevy low rider -- the ultimate custom car, if you will --  parked at the entrance of the Robert O. Anderson Building.  </P> <P> A lot of people didn't know quite what to make of that car. Should they laugh?  Should they try to interpret it? Or what? "Do you have a card?" George Gradow,  who is married to actress Barbi Benton, asked ponytailed artist Gilbert Sanchez  Lujan, who had entitled his art work "Our Family Car" because it really was  before it became an exhibit. "We just bought a ranch in Aspen," Gradow said,  "and that piece would be faaaabulous."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the gallery:  </P> <P> Sculptor Robert Graham, also ponytailed, posed for a photographer in front of a  sculpture, a nude woman, entitled "Fountain Figure 1." His date, who is his  ex-wife, Anne Kresl, said it was she.  </P> <P> Painter Luis Stand of Brooklyn, New York, making his first visit to Los  Angeles, was asked for his opinion of the museum. "I like the idea that it's  located on an area of -- what do you call it? -- tar pits. It's very peculiar,  a prehistoric site in the middle of the city," he mused. So he and artists  Rolando Briseno, also of Brooklyn, and Rudy Fernandez, of Santa Fe, caught a  tour of the La Brea tar pits that afternoon.  </P> <P> Roberto Gil de Montes was complaining that one of his erotic paintings was  removed earlier from the show, organized by the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston,  which has been touring for a year and a half. "I was told the owner of the  piece wanted it back. But I'm the owner."  </P> <P> Gilbert Sanchez Lujan opened the trunk of the Chevy, pulled out some crayons  and drew chili peppers on curator Howard Fox's bow tie. "Gilbert's compulsive,"  Fox said. "Whenever he sees an unadorned surface he has to make it glow."  </P> <P> Like most of the crowd, collectors Morris and Rita Pynoos admitted that except  for the firmly established sculptures of Robert Graham, they weren't familiar  with any of the art on display. "It's very important to know what's going on  besides the right names in the art world," Rita remarked.  </P> <P> "Don't they look a little like the German Expressionists?" Morris pondered.  </P> <P> Observing from the sidelines, Steven Lavine, the new president of CalArts,  said: "I think people are more attentive tonight than I've ever seen them. It's  work they don't know how to look at, so they have to look. There's a higher  ratio of people inside looking than outside eating."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Cold Wind  </P> <P> True, but outside, a cold wind whipped through the reception area. Furs, trench  coats, even long underwear (Hollywood Reporter publisher Tichi Wilkerson  Kassel's solution underneath her Oscar de la Renta beaded jacket and trousers)  were the order of the evening.  </P> <P> As for the youngest art connoisseurs, they were kept warm by their mothers.  Janis Dinwiddie, head of the museum's special events office, cuddled her  2-month-old son, Tommy Steenrod, while Stephanie Barron, curator of Twentieth  Century art, snuggled 10-week-old Max Rifkind-Barron, whom, she noted, was  making his museum debut. Both babies heeded the dress code and wore tiny  tuxedos.  </P> <P> "This show is from my department," Barron said, "and I want to start him  early."  </P></p>

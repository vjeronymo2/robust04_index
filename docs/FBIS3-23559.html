The subunit is manned by  officers with a higher education and fluent in foreign languages.    Vympel's ordeals began with the Union's disintegration,  going  from one department to another more than once. It is now being  prepared be placed under the wing of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, which is generally a logical thing. The unique skills  of the Vympel associates will come in very handy in combatting  organized crime.    There is talk, however, that a national guard for Russia  will  be created out of the subunit. A worthwhile prospect, you will  agree. The catch is that it has never been explained sensibly to  the Vympel associates just what functions the special subunit  will fulfill in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. As a  result there is total uncertainty. According to preliminary  reports, more than 100 of the Vympel staff have already  submitted requests for discharge. What is the forecast? It is  even less comforting. As many as 80 percent of the associates  could leave, in which case there would be only memories of  Vympel, a school of unique combat skills set up and carefully  safeguarded for many years. The professionals estimate that it  would take at least 10 years to resurrect the special subunit.</p>

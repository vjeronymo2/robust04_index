			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Belgrade has abundant petrol despite embargo SANCTIONS against former Yugoslavia have failed to halt imports of oil, which is now so abundant in Belgrade that new petrol stations are opening and the price of fuel has dropped, the UN Security Council was told yesterday. Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairman of the international conference on former Yugoslavia, said it was common knowledge that transit documents were being misused and oil was getting through in ever larger quantities. He and Lord Owen, the other co-chairman, called for urgent UN action to close gaping holes in sanctions by tightening procedures to halt oil supplies particularly on the Danube route. Both co-chairmen opposed lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina, as has been suggested. Mr Vance argued that a relaxation would not only increase hostilities but spread the conflict throughout the region. The Security Council is considering imposing a naval blockade.</p>

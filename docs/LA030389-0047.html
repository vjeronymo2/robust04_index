			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BLAKE EDWARDS' LATEST ONLY 'SKIN DEEP'  </P> <P> Blake Edwards' "Skin Deep" (citywide) has a couple of the funniest moments  Edwards ever devised; it has John Ritter's easy-to-take charm, but it ends up  living up to its title far too closely.  </P> <P> Ritter's Zach has it all. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, a novelist  and screenwriter. He has a bright, attractive wife (crisply played by Alyson  Reed), who's a TV newscaster, a profession that in the movies defines the  successful contemporary woman. He lives the Southern California life style at  its most sybaritic. You have the feeling that this is a man who hasn't stepped  outside Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Malibu for year, except possibly to escape  to other equally luxe locales; by the end of the film you're left feeling that  this may be true of Edwards as well.  </P> <P> The film opens with a hilarious double whammy that starts Zach spinning out of  control even before the laughter starts fading. From then on it's a downhill  slide for Zach. Already plagued by writer's block, he gives in to compulsive  womanizing, followed by incipient alcoholism and eventual impotence.  </P> <P> "Skin Deep" is a film of moments, some of which are terrific, others  considerably less so. The glamour girls, with their great sheafs of shining  hair, are interchangeable, but there are nice turns by Vincent Gardenia as  Zach's barkeep pal and by Nina Foch as his chic mother-in-law, perhaps the only  woman in the world who has never been charmed by him. There's real sweetness  and humor in Raye Hollit's body builder, and once again Edwards proves himself  one of the few American film makers able, or willing, to present a gay couple  (in this instance played distinctively by Peter Donat and Don Gordon) without a  fuss.  </P> <P> As adept as Edwards is at using humor to set off Zach's self-destructiveness,  to capture the dark undertow of high living, he ends up letting Zach off the  hook shamelessly. It's as if Edwards said to himself: "The poor guy has  suffered long enough, and, besides, we're running out of time."  </P> <P> Never has a happy ending been so thoroughly unearned. For all his charm,  honesty and intelligence -- you have no trouble understanding his appeal to a  wide variety of women -- Zach does nothing to help himself as he gives in to  epic self-indulgence. Then in his turnaround, we're given the impression that  stopping drinking and turning out a best seller are snaps for Zach. (That his  wife would even consider taking him back after his progressively outrageous  behavior is also confounding.)  </P> <P> In short, "Skin Deep" is a male sex fantasy that says that if you're  sufficiently rich, famous and good-looking, you can go into the most  self-destructive of tailspins and still land on your feet without any real  effort.  </P> <P> It's chilling to imagine "Skin Deep" (rated R for sex and language, adult  situations) without Ritter, who through sheer dint of his own likability, never  quite loses our sympathy for Zach. (This admittedly may not be true for some  women in the audience; NOW is unlikely to choose the film for a benefit  premiere.) Ritter and Edwards clearly have a strong rapport and plan to work  together again. Perhaps the next time will rate a "10."  </P> <P> 'SKIN DEEP'  </P> <P> A 20th Century Fox release of a Morgan Creek presentation of a BECO production.  Executive producer Joe Roth, James G.

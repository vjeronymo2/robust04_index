			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui  will address the Nicaraguan Parliament on his official visit to  the Central American country next month, a Foreign Affairs  Ministry official said Friday [15 April].    "President Li would become the third foreign head of state  to  give a speech to the Nicaraguan Parliament," said Hou  Ching-shan, an official with the Ministry's Central &amp; South  American Affairs Department, who is fresh from visiting  Nicaragua to arrange Li's trip.    "It would be the highest honor accorded to the head of a  foreign state," Hou said.    President Li will arrive in Nicaragua on May 4 and then meet  with Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Hou said,  adding that a joint statement will be issued following the  meeting.    Li will also visit a Taiwan-owned textile factory that  employ  1,500 workers, making it the largest single employer of textile  workers in Central America.    From Nicaragua, Li will proceed to Costa Rica on May 6 to  attend the inaugural ceremony for President-Elect Jose Maria  Figueres. Li will be awarded a medal by Costa Rica in  recognition of his contribution in promoting ties between the  two countries.    A joint communique will also be issued after a meeting  between Li and the outgoing Costa Rican President Rafael Angel  Calderon.    Accompanying Li on the two-leg visit will be Foreign Affairs  Minister Chien Fu, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for  Economic Planning and Development, and Governor Samuel C. Shieh  of the Central Bank of China.    Nicaragua and Costa Rica, along with five other Latin  American countries, submitted a letter to United Nations  Scretary-General Butros Butros Ghali last August requesting that  the United Nations put the Republic of China's UN bid on the  agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993. The  request was later voted down.</p>

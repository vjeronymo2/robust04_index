			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Monumental Moore in Paris - Sculpture We have come to the point with Henry Moore at which - save for the emergence of a lost or unknown early work, some discovery in the documentation, or some revelation in the personal or professional life - we no longer look forward to any real surprises. The work is known, the oeuvre complete. But that is not to say that its further study and display are beside the point. Indeed its fresh and frequent presentation is, if anything, now more to the point than ever, for the insights and ideas that follow upon each new selection and circumstance. The last big Moore exhibition in France was the full retrospective held in Paris in 1977 , at the Orangerie and along the formal terraces of the Tuileries Gardens. Now comes a quite different exercise: where before rather more than 200 works were shown, with the greater portion indoors, now we are offered a mere 27 in an exhibition conceived entirely for the open air. Where before the few works shown out-of-doors were set out en serie along the high, formal terraces beside the Orangerie, in sensible acceptance of the local opportunity, now we have a display considered closely from the start for the matching of each particular work to its proper place. The gardens of the Chateau de Bagatelle, tucked away on the far side of the Bois de Boulogne, are one of the true Parisian's best-kept secrets, awkward of access save by car or taxi. They are well worth the trouble, even should you suffer the thunder and lightning that marked my own first visit last week. Indeed the drama of the storm was no small bonus, once the rain had stopped, with the skies still black and yet the trees and lawns bright in the evening sun that threw each sculpture in turn into a sharp and high relief. The Bagatelle itself presents an intriguing mixture of French and British taste in garden design and architecture, the chateau an enchanting pavilion put up in 64 days by Beranger for the Comte d'Artois, sister-in-law of Marie Antoinette, the park and gardens laid out in their present form largely by a later owner, Sir Richard Wallace of the Wallace Collection in London. On the one hand are formal terraces, and parterres and rose gardens, on the other the park, with its wide lawns, its trees and pools and sudden vistas, a landscape natural yet controlled, so very much in the English manner. Mixture yes, but hardly conflict, and while the rose garden, spectacular as it is, may be a shade too ordered in its profusion for English eyes, and the one part into which Moore does not intrude, for the rest he is perfectly at home. The Family Group of 1949 and the earliest work in the show, closes off one end of the central walk of the sunken garden, the high wall to one side a cascade of clematis. At once the smallest and yet as truly monumental as any work being shown, it could hardly have been enthroned more sympathetically. The essential adaptability of Moore's work - here an enclosed and intimate monumentality - is not least of the points it makes. The unspoken theme of the show is indeed that quality of the monument, most clearly evident in the later bronzes, when Moore was at last able to amplify the work to whatever size he wanted. It was always his belief that true scale was inherent, that any sculpture would work at any size if it was properly resolved within itself. And so it is that the show is limited to the bronzes of Moore's mature career, from that Family Group, still on a directly human scale, to the massive pieces of his extreme old age, made under his direction but the tiny original maquette his only direct engagement. They are set out for the most part so that each should be seen alone, without distraction or immediate cross-reference to a neighbour, with the visitor led naturally on by the glimpse of another, just caught through a gap in the bushes or away through the trees. And that placement is so beautifully judged that there is no sense of intrusion, even by the largest piece in the middle of a lawn, the installation so cleverly done by the carriers, Momart, that it might almost have all been there for ever. The odd and unexpected effect is that Moore gives quite as much back as he receives, his work informing and celebrating the gardens as they, too, celebrate it. There is no conflict, and it seems even a little hard that after only a summer the show must come down. The City of Paris, the Bagatelle, the British Council and the Henry Moore Foundation are all to be congratulated for so imaginative a collaboration and so special a treat. Meanwhile, back in Paris, Henry Moore Intime may be quite separate an exhibition, but is, even so, a natural and happy pendant. Moore's daughter, Mary, has contrived an extraordinary documentary display not simply of his remarkable personal collection, that ranges from ancient Egypt and the pre-Columbian to Rodin and Cezanne, Degas and Seurat, but also of the furniture of his domestic life, his books in their bookcases, his trophies and souvenirs, chairs and tables, all set up as it was at home. Done with an admirable discretion, it is a touching act of filial piety and a still potent evocation of a personal presence. Moore a Bagatelle, in the gardens of Chateau Bagatelle, Bois de Boulogne, Paris, until October 4 sponsored by Compagnie Generale des Eaux; GEC Alsthom; Shell France; British Steel; British Airways; ICI en France; L'Oreal. Moore Intime: Didier Imbert Fine Art, 19 Avenue Matignon, Paris 8me, until July 24, then to Japan on tour</p>

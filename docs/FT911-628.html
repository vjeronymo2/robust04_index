			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The Property Market: Valuation values come in for scrutiny A SURVEYOR, it seems, is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. As property companies see their balance sheets crumble, they are arguing that the valuers' reliance on market evidence ignores the true worth of their portfolios. Critics say the pitifully low turnover levels this year consist largely of forced sales and are thus a misleading guide to the remainder of the market. 'In the past, valuers may have overvalued,' says Sir Nigel Mobbs, of Slough Estates, 'and the pendulum has now swung rather too far the other way.' Disillusioned investors want changes to the philosophy underpinning valuations. Donald Gordon, chairman of Capital &amp; Counties, is sceptical about the current 'open market' basis of valuation. 'There is no justification for using, as the prime measure of performance, a system which produces such volatility as we have seen in recent years in the values ascribed to long-term property investments - values based essentially on short-term perceptions and interpretations of prevailing economic mood, sentiment and the interest rate cycles at random balance sheet dates,' he says. Instead, he would like investment property to be assessed in terms of expected earnings, discounted using a 'pragmatic' rate of return related to a more stable weighted average. His complaint has stirred controversy and exposed Capital &amp; Counties to the criticism that, following a 13 per cent fall in its investment portfolio in 1990, it is simply making excuses for a poor year. Even those who sympathise with CapCo's argument are shy of advocating a switch away from a market-based valuation system in precisely the year when the property market has collapsed. 'The property business didn't scream when values were high,' says Mr John Parry, managing director of Hammerson. 'I have felt for some years that it should be changed but this is not the time for it to be changed. It should be changed when times are good.' Not all advocates of change, however, risk the accusation that they want to flatter their own balance sheets. Mr Nick French, a lecturer in land management at Reading University, is an enthusiastic proponent of property valuation using discounted cash flow methods. Instead of relying uncritically on market evidence, he believes valuers should be asking: 'Is it realistic? Shouldn't we be looking at other scenarios?' he says. Mr French also argues that the adoption of discounted cash flow techniques would make it easier to compare the performance of property with those of equities and gilts. As a result, it might help property win a larger share of institutional money. Argument about valuation principles is hardly novel. Discounted cash flow methods were the norm before 1960 when the ravages of inflation and the uncertainties of rent reviews forced a change. There was debate after the collapse of the property market in 1973, which was the catalyst for serious criticism of valuations. Indeed, bankers' blind faith in flawed valuations was held partly to blame for the collapse in the property and secondary banking sectors. At that time too, property companies balked at the open market method of valuation. British Land's 1975-6 accounts valued some of its long-term investment property on its 'current actual and estimated income' because 'the valuers stated that they were unable to assess open market value in view of the unlikelihood that the property could be sold at a price reflecting true worth.' This type of argument provokes unease from those who think the market, however quirky and volatile, is the only true judge of value. 'At the end of the day, the value of the property is what someone will pay for it. You can not get away from that,' says Andrew Cherry, who is chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors assets valuation standards committee. Indeed, the argument that prices in the property market are irrationally low risks the accusation of wishful thinking. When erosion of planning controls has led to unprecedented oversupply, it may be suspect to assume that yields will remain inside their traditional range. At times like this, judging the 'right' level of yields is so difficult, the market may be the best arbiter. Defenders of the surveying profession, however, reckon they could - with greater research - become credible judges of future rental values. The criticism about valuation methods is just one several strains facing valuers. The subjective nature of their profession came under intense scrutiny last November, when a takeover battle revealed that one firm of valuers believed Scott's Restaurants was worth nearly three times as much as did a rival firm. Another sign of pressure is the heavy toll taken on surveyors' professional indemnity policies, because of alleged over-valuation of property in the late 1980s bull market. Nonetheless, the problems should not be exaggerated. The accuracy of valuations was found to be remarkably high in 1989 when the Investment Property Databank tested 2,500 valuations against the sale prices they later achieved. Admittedly, the test is likely to be less reassuring when it is repeated this summer. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that valuers have found it hard to keep pace with the ferocity of the downturn in the market and the virtual evaporation of turnover. However, in the exceptionally volatile market that has exposed these weaknesses, it is unclear whether an alternative approach to valuations would be much less controversial.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties Year to March 91      -11.8     -16.4     -11.0          -13.6 Quarter to Mar 91      -2.5      -4.6      -2.4           -3.4 Month of March 91      -1.0      -1.2      -0.7           -1.0  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

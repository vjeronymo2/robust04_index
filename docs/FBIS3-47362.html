			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The likelihood of a  negotiated settlement to the Cambodian conflict grew slim  Tuesday as a war of words erupted over proposed peace talks,  with co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh accusing the Khmer  Rouge of deceit. [passage omitted]    "It is clear that the party of Democratic Kampuchea (DK or  Khmer Rouge) is not sincere in its supposed desires for peace  and national reconciliation," a statement from the prince said.    A contradiction in the Khmer Rouge's support for a proposal  from King Norodom Sihanouk to end the conflict between the  guerrillas and the government revealed their insincerity, the  prince said.    "The simple proof is that, while declaring they accept all  the elements of His Majesty the King of Cambodia's proposal, the  Khmer Rouge do not want to recognise the Royal Government of  Cambodia and at the same time they insist that they become  members or advisors to that same government," the prince said.    In a clandestine meeting on December 17, the prince and the  guerrilla leader agreed to set up a working group to discuss  implementing the king's proposal where in exchange for ceasing  all guerrilla activities, opening up their zones and merging  their fighters with the national army, "acceptable" members of  the Khmer Rouge would be given senior government posts.    In his statement, the prince dismissed Khieu Samphan's  accusation that he had reneged on an agreement over the  composition of the working group.    Khieu Samphan said the two leaders had settled on a formula  where the group should either consist of representatives from  just the Khmer Rouge and the royalists or if the Cambodian  People's Party (CPP) were to be included, then the third party  in the coalition government, the small Buddhist Liberal  Democratic Party, had also to be represented.    But the prince -- who recently appointed just two  representatives, cabinet ministers Veng Sereivut from FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] and Sok An from the CPP -- said he  told the guerrilla leader that the king's proposal "clearly  referred" to talks between the "DK and Royal Government," not  between the guerrillas and individual parties in the coalition  government. [passage omitted]    The government has up to 2,000 troops poised ready for a  final attack on the radical faction's key base at Anlong Veng  near the Thai border in northern Siem Reap province, the  minister said.    Meanwhile, a former prime minister of the  Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime, Pen Sovann, criticised  the notion of bringing Khmer Rouge officials into the government.    "Their hands are soaked in the people's blood so we should  ask the people whether we want to welcome them," Pen Sovann, who  was ousted from his premier post in a 1981 internal party feud,  said.</p>

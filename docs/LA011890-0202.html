			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COMPROMISE PLAN ACCEPTED FOR PARK  </P> <P> After two years of debate and review, city officials have selected a compromise  plan for a 10-acre park on the ridgeline at Top of the World.  </P> <P> "I think it was a good compromise," Councilman Neil G. Fitzpatrick said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It will be tucked pretty well in and open space wraps all around it."  </P> <P> The revised Alta Laguna park plan, to include a regulation-size baseball field  and a six-court tennis facility, tot lot, parking, view sites and a trail  around the outside, will be developed at the end of Alta Laguna Boulevard next  to hundreds of acres of open space, Fitzpatrick said.  </P> <P> Originally conceived as a 15-acre facility with a soccer field on a five-acre,  mini-park site and an adjacent 10 acres purchased by the city, the plan was  scaled down to satisfy objections of environmentalists and Top of the World  residents, despite pleas from parents and sports enthusiasts for a larger park.  </P> <P> Opponents of the park have questioned the need for the facility and expressed  concern over loss of wetlands, the aesthetics of drainage devices, traffic and  the loss of designated open space.  </P> <P> "The City Council simply ignored the wishes and desires of those most affected  by the park," said Robert May, a Top of the World resident. "People who live  here on Alta Laguna wanted the park maintained on five acres and opposed any  encroachment on the greenbelt and over-concentration of sports in one  neighborhood."  </P> <P> But Fitzpatrick said the decision was fair.  </P> <P> "The proponents gave a much stronger argument and obviously people who  participate in sports didn't get all that they wanted either," he said. "The  opponents came across as fairly selfish. I honestly believe the majority of  people who are concerned about the park will enjoy it.  </P> <P> "The sun will still set up there."

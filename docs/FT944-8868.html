			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Norway warned on EU entry The head of Norway's leading bank warned yesterday that staying outside the European Union could damage the country's oil and gas industry, the biggest in western Europe. The anti-EU campaign maintains that membership would threaten Oslo's control over its North Sea oil and gas production, which accounts for 16 per cent of gross national product. But Mr Finn Hvistendahl, president of Den Norske Bank, said Norway's oil production was declining and that gas, which relies on European markets, would take over as the main earner from the North Sea. It was vital, therefore, that the EU's long-term energy policy, currently being formulated, put a heavy emphasis on the use of natural gas. 'If Norway remains outside the EU, it will reduce our possibility to influence the increase of gas consumption. There is no guarantee that the EU will increase its dependence on energy from countries outside the EU while it can develop nuclear power and maintain coal production,' Mr Hvistendahl said.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP peak in heavy trade There was heavy activity in BP shares, which outperformed the market throughout the day to touch an all-time high of 429p in mid-session, before settling 2 easier 418p as the market became increasingly excited about this Thursday's presentation to analysts. Turnover reached 8.9m shares. Dealers were said to be expecting plenty of good news from BP on the exploration front, particularly regarding its recent drilling success in Colombia, via the Cupiagua gas field discovery. And there are high hopes for more positive news from BP's operations west of the Shetlands, as well as from Vietnam and Azerbaijan. Further details from the Ciusiana oil field in Colombia are awaited. Helping the stock continue its recent good progress yesterday was a suggestion that one of the UK market's leading securities houses, said to be Smith New Court, had published a positive note on BP. Another story in the market was that BP may be considering buying in some of its own shares, to mop up its growing cash flow, although analysts tended to disregard that theory. It was also announced that US holdings in BP have fallen to 20.65 per cent, or 1.13bn shares, down from the 26 per cent-plus figure of early 1993. 'The Americans have found a ready market for BP stock in the UK where underweight funds have had to pay up and, more to the point are still paying up,' said one oil analyst.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION PILL  </P> <P> As a native California woman, I was proud to learn that physicians of my state  who met in Anaheim took a progressive stand on the abortion issue (State  Medical Group Urges Tests of French Abortion Pill, March 6).  </P> <P> I realize the manufacturer of this product has been harassed, much as women  exercising their legal right to surgical abortions have been, but I hope the  pharmaceutical company will show the courage these women have shown and begin  procedures to market RU-486 in the United States.  </P> <P> Availability of this product, that women can use in privacy, will help to take  abortion out of the public and political arenas.  </P> <P> MARTHA ABELL  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

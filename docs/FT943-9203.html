			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Thomas Cook buys Barclays' travellers cheques subsidiary Thomas Cook, the world's second largest supplier of travellers cheques after American Express, said yesterday it had acquired the third biggest supplier, Interpayment Services. Neither side would disclose how much Thomas Cook was paying for the Barclays Bank subsidiary. Interpayment is the world's largest issuer of Visa travellers cheques, generating annual sales of about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in 145 countries. The deal increases Thomas Cook's share of the Dollars 54bn travellers cheque market from 17 per cent to 30 per cent. Thomas Cook is 90 per cent owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank, Germany's third biggest bank. Mr Alex Jablonowski, managing director of Barclays Global Services, said that the sale was part of the bank's strategy of focusing on its core businesses. Barclays, which this week announced first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.04bn, would not say what profit the travellers cheque subsidiary had generated. Mr Graham Rider, Thomas Cook's managing director of financial services, said that the deal would enable the company to sell travellers cheques through many more banks than is possible now. Thomas Cook's cheques carry its own logo, together with that of MasterCard. In Europe, the cheques also carry the sign of euro travellers cheque International (etcI). Mr Rider said many banks around the world would sell either MasterCard or Visa travellers cheques, but not both. The acquisition would allow Thomas Cook to sell Visa cheques as well as MasterCard, he said. Mr Rider said that the Thomas Cook MasterCard and the Interpayment Visa brands would continue to operate separately. They would have discrete sales and marketing strategies but would use the same distribution and processing facilities. Barclays said it would continue to sell Visa travellers cheques through its branches and customers would not notice any change. The acquisition goes some way to helping Thomas Cook close the gap on American Express, its traditional travellers cheque rival, which has 44 per cent of the world market. A history of Thomas Cook, written with the company's co-operation, concedes that American Express invented the travellers cheque in 1891. American Express admits, however, that persuading Thomas Cook's offices around the world to honour its cheques was a crucial step towards their wider acceptance.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDHAM HILL RECORDS REPORTED TO BE FOR SALE;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE ASKING PRICE IS ESTIMATED AT $50 MILLION. SOME SAY THE  MARKETER OF NEW AGE MUSIC MAY BE OVER THE HILL.  </P> <P> Windham Hill Records, one of the leading marketers of New Age music, an  increasingly popular genre of light, hypnotic instrumentals that critics  derisively call "yuppie elevator music," is up for sale for $50 million,  according to top industry executives.  </P> <P> Capitol Records is among those reportedly negotiating with the Palo Alto  company, which had estimated sales of $25 million in 1989.  </P> <P> Capitol officials declined comment. But Anne Robinson, president and chief  executive of Windham Hill, acknowledged that her company has been talking to  several interested buyers in recent weeks, although she declined to elaborate  on how serious the talks were.  </P> <P> "Our distribution agreement with A&amp;M Records expires at the end of March,"  Robinson said. "We have been approached by a number of parties interested in  either distribution (of our records) or acquisition of our company. I can't say  any more than that."  </P> <P> The possible sale of Windham Hill comes at a time when prices for record  companies have soared to astronomical levels and would continue a trend of  consolidation in the music business.  </P> <P> Since the introduction of compact discs in 1983, at least seven prominent  record companies have been completely or partially acquired by large media  companies vying to expand their market share. Windham Hill's distributor,  A&amp;M, which was acquired by Polygram last fall for an estimated $500  million, was the latest.  </P> <P> "Let's face it; this is a seller's market right now," said Bob Reitman, general  manager of Windham Hill's chief competitor, Milwaukee-based Narada Productions.  "People want to buy record companies, and they are willing to pay a lot of  money."  </P> <P> As media giants have gobbled up most of the remaining major independents,  attention has begun to focus on smaller, specialized labels, experts say. And  the interest in Windham Hill, which pioneered New Age music 14 years ago, is  just the latest evidence that New Age is moving into the musical mainstream.  Windham Hill was launched with an unorthodox marketing campaign that included  mail-order sales and distribution through bookstores.  </P> <P> The mostly instrumental music, which has been described as a light and mellow  mixture of classical piano, jazz fusion and even the sounds of wind, running  water and chimes, has been chided by music critics as bland and uninventive.  </P> <P> But there's no denying its popularity with yuppies: Windham Hill says the  average age of its customers is about 30, and most are affluent urban dwellers.  Such consumers spend an estimated $100 million to $150 million a year  purchasing New Age music, industry officials say.  </P> <P> Although those figures pale beside the record industry's $6.2 billion in sales  last year, New Age music has attracted more attention in recent years.  </P> <P> In 1988, Billboard magazine formally recognized the category when it began to  rank the top New Age records.  </P> <P> Today there are about half a dozen major New Age record companies, and the  category has grown so popular that the National Academy of Recording Arts and  Sciences has begun awarding a Grammy for the best New Age music. The group  Shadowfax was last year's winner for their album "Folksongs for a Nuclear Age."  </P> <P> Yet the genre still suffers image and marketing problems that keep it relegated  to the music industry's backwaters.  </P> <P> Suzanne Doucet, president of the New Age Music Network in Los Angeles,  estimates that only about 40% of New Age records are distributed through music  stores. The remaining 60% are sold through bookstores and other alternative  outlets because many record store owners are unsure how to effectively market  the music.  </P> <P> "The word 'New Age' is a real red herring because, when some people hear it,  they start thinking about stuff like Shirley MacLaine, meditation and crystals  and other negative connotations," said Roger Lifeset, an independent New Age  record promoter in Agoura Hills. "But if you don't label it and treat it simply  as music, it is much easier" to sell, he said.  </P> <P> Yet just as New Age music seems to be catching on, its main pioneer -- Windham  Hill -- may be losing steam.  </P> <P> Several of its artists, including Liz Story and Grammy winners Shadowfax, have  left in recent years. And Windham Hill's best-selling artist, pianist George  Winston, hasn't released a record in five years.  </P> <P> Although Larry Hayes, vice president of marketing for Windham Hill, said his  company had its best sales year ever in 1989, many question Windham Hill's  dominance today.  </P> <P> Allan D. Chlowitz, general manager of KTWV, says Windham Hill records account  for a dwindling share of his radio station's play list. And Narada Records,  with a roster of 16 artists and 11 albums on Billboard's chart, now claims to  be the top New Age record company.  </P> <P> "Windham Hill started out owning the field," said Chlowitz. "But they are not  the leaders today they were for many, many years."  </P></p>

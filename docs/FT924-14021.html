			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Two months' work needed WHEN and if the US and EC reach accord, at least two months' work will be required by negotiators in Geneva before the 108-nation Uruguay Round can be completed. Other outstanding issues include: Agriculture: Japan and South Korea want to maintain their rice import bans. They, and some other countries with supply management systems, oppose draft proposals for minimum market access and conversion of all import restrictions to tariffs. Market access: An EC/US deal would set the framework for other country-by-country talks. But any accord on zero-tariff sectors would have to be agreed with others and there would have to be bilateral talks on products not covered by the US/EC bargain. Poor nations want better access for textiles and tropical products in rich-country markets. Intellectual property: Even if the copyright wrangle between the US and EC is settled in Brussels, Washington will still be pushing for changes to the draft intellectual property agreement to give greater protection for pharmaceutical patents in developing countries. Services: The US and EC are not satisfied with offers from many developing countries to liberalise their services sectors, especially in financial services. The US wants better offers on basic telecommunications from almost all trading partners. Maritime nations want the US to include shipping in a services accord. Multilateral Trade Organisation: Negotiators are under pressure from environmental groups to make the MTO 'greener' and are still wrangling over details of this proposed umbrella body for Gatt and the new agreements on services and intellectual property. Dispute settlement: Many developing countries want a formal commitment from the US not to use its powers of unilateral retaliation in return for a strengthened multilateral disputes procedure.</p>

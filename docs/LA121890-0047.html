			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> AMBULANCE FIRMS SEEK RATE INCREASES  </P> <P> The three ambulance companies that serve Ventura County will ask the County  Board of Supervisors Tuesday to allow them to charge 10% more for their  services.  </P> <P> Because the ambulance companies operate under a contract with the county,  supervisors must approve rate increases.  </P> <P> In May, 1989, the board approved a 22% increase, the first jump in five years,  county Emergency Medical Services Administrator Barbara Brofuehrer said.  </P> <P> Ventura ambulance companies need to raise their fees primarily because of a  jump in fuel prices and higher personnel costs, Brofuehrer said.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, emergency transportation would increase from $232.50 to  $256 and non-emergency transportation would jump from $175 to $193. Ambulance  paramedic charges would go from $250 to $275. The new prices would be effective  the day the increases are granted by the supervisors. JOEL BRAND  </P></p>

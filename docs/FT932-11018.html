			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Opportunities for teleworking Technology can bring little comfort to most of the 900 or more miners at Grimethorpe colliery in South Yorkshire, which has ceased production of coal. But for a few, the local Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council's plans to set up a remote office in the redundant National Coal Board offices in Grimethorpe could provide a ray of hope. 'We're hoping to set up a workshop community where local people are employed doing work which is outsourced from other organisations,' says David Bramall, manager of the microsystems centre, part of the council's economic development department. 'They will work remotely for the parent organisation.' Bramall hopes the centre will provide 20 jobs to begin with and will be in full swing within a year. He believes many jobs - technical helplines, for example - could provide worthwhile employment for local men. They could handle calls from around the country while accessing data held on a database sited remotely. The problem the council faces is ensuring they can provide a service for potential customers at a competitive market rate. The project has already secured some EC funds under Mitre - market implementation of teleworking in rural environments. 'Barnsley is semi-industrialised and quite remote,' explains Bramall. 'The coalfields never needed good communications. All they needed was a railway to get the coal away.' But Bramall is still concerned that the cost of the equipment for remote working could make services economically unviable. The cost of each workstation, says Bramall, is about Pounds 2,000. There is the additional cost of the phone lines needed to transmit voice and data calls simultaneously using ISDN (integrated service digital network). Each line costs Pounds 400 to install, plus the price of the calls. Bramall is investigating ways of cutting costs. One potentially useful communications technology is where users only pay for phone lines in use - not for the 24 hours every day when they are available. At the end of the day, says Bramall, 'what we want to do is try and lift people's spirits a bit.'</p>

The  central bank plays a dominant role in the new financial system.  Therefore, to gradually establish a strong central bank  regulatory system and increase the capability of the central  bank in exercising macroeconomic control is of primary  importance in reforming the financial system.    Reform of China's financial system began in the late 1970's.  After 14 years of efforts from 1978 to 1992, a financial system  with the central bank as the leading body and state-owned  specialized banks as the dominant parts and with various  diversified sectors co-existing and coordinating with each other  has been basically formed. The financial system has developed  considerably in terms of variety and quantity. Prior to 1978,  there was only one People's Bank of China and several rural  credit cooperatives in the country. As of now, in addition to  the People's Bank of China, there are four specialized banks,  namely the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of  China, the People's Construction Bank of China and the  Agricultural Bank of China; and 10 nation-wide and regional  commercial banks, namely the Bank of Communications, the  Zhongxin Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank of China, the  Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Guangdong  Development Bank, the Fujian Development Bank, the Huaxia Bank,  the Pudong Development Bank of Shanghai and the Zhejiang  Commercial Bank. There are also over 80 securities companies and  a large number of financial companies and modernized financing  and leaseholding companies. In addition, there are many urban  and rural credit cooperatives in various cities and towns. Since  the approval of the first foreign-funded bank in Shenzhen,  foreign financial institutions have set up more than 90 branches  in China. As of now, China has basically changed the "large and  consolidated" banking system to one of many financial  institutions working side by side. This kind of reform and  exploration are aimed at keeping abreast of the economic  development in the past with emphasis on planned economy.    The party's 14th National Congress explicitly put forward  the  need to establish a new system of socialist market economy.  Apparently the financial system with emphasis on planned economy  in the past is unable to keep pace with the new changes. Efforts  must be made to change this economic system in accordance with  the requirements of the socialist market economy. It is similar  to the fact that people need to change their own clothes to keep  pace with the climatic changes in spring, summer, autumn and  winter. The first thing to be affected is the change of the  functions of the people's bank so as to establish a strong  central bank regulatory system.    The central bank plays a leading role in the new financial  system. Its major functions should be: lead and control all  financial institutions in the country, scientifically formulate  and implement financial and monetary policy, control the supply  of currency and ensure the basic stability of currency value;  and supervise and control financial institutions, ensure safe  and effective operations in the financial system.    Under the conditions of the socialist market economy, the  People's Bank of China has always regarded the task of  increasing efficiency in exercising macroeconomic control as its  major goal. However, the dual target of achieving both economic  growth and currency stability and that of accomplishing both  overall control and structural readjustment constitutes the  major reason for the weak macroeconomic control of the central  bank.    For a long period, China has always adopted monetary  policies by ensuring both economic development and price  stability. However, in practice, the governments in various  localities, on the one hand, often attach more importance in  economic development and sedulously work hard to seek high rates  of economic growth. They often use investments with poor  economic results to achieve their goal for economic growth,  resulting in the excessive issuance of currency and causing  inflation. On the other hand, due to lack of an efficient and  flexible mechanism to regulate currency and credit, a tendency  to restrain economic growth which causes economic decline often  prevails in order to stabilize the currency value. This not only  prevents the national economy from developing healthily, but  also loses public support and causes economic instability. Since  the implementation of the reform and opening up policy, the  readjustment in 1981, the tightening of the money supply in  1985, the improvement and rectification campaign in 1989 and the  strengthening of macroeconomic control in 1993 all fall into  this category. Naturally the macroeconomic control this year is  different than those in the past. It is not an overall  retrenchment, but a kind of structural readjustment. Therefore,  the central bank should undoubtedly regard the task of  stabilizing the currency value as its major target, and promote  economic growth while ensuring the stability of the currency.    In a socialist market economy, it is an usual or even common  phenomenon that the total social demand exceeds the social  supply. Often the growth of the total social demand is quite  strong. In view of this situation, the people's bank must change  from attaching importance to both overall control and structural  readjustment to placing emphasis on overall control in order to  do a still better job in maintaining currency stability. That is  to control the total amount of currency supplied by the whole  banking system. Currency is created by banks in the form of  loans. To place the total amount of loans under control is the  key in controlling the supply of currency. The people's bank  must issue or withdraw the basic currency according to the rise  or fall of commodity prices, the rate of growth of the supply of  currency and the amount of excess deposits.    With the deepening of reform of the financial system, the  people's bank should work hard to change from its direct control  of the amount of loans to the use of economic, legal and  administrative means by carrying out open market operations,  keeping adequate reserve funds for deposits, determining the  proper interest rates, loan ceilings and exchange rates. On the  basis of the conditions in market development, it should  gradually attach more importance to indirect control and  eventually regard indirect control as its principal measure.    The people's bank must strengthen the control of the basic  currency, reduce the amount of uncovered advance and gradually  give priority to selling and buying state bonds, financial  bonds, using them as securities for loans and handling note  discount businesses.    Another major function of the central bank is to supervise  and control the financial institutions, and ensure that the  financial system is safe and sound in operation. All branches of  the people's bank must pay full attention to supervising and  controlling the financial system and conducting investigation  and study. With the gradual establishment of the socialist  market economy, the deepening of the reform of the financial  system and the development of banking businesses, the number of  regional financial institutions with the status of a legal  person is increasing, and there are more and more banking  business activities. As there is more competition among  financial institutions in various districts and regions,  contradictions among the financial institutions, between the  financial institutions and the enterprises and among individuals  have continued to emerge. On the other hand, the basic task of  the commercial banks is to do financing, while their major  target is to make maximum profit. However, there is a  contradiction between profit-making and the need to ensure  repayment. The risk of investments and loans with larger profits  is often poor, while safe investments are always less  profitable. Financial institutions must achieve balance and make  the best choice among factors of safety, liquidity and  profitability. Thus, the central bank and its branches must use  various methods to exercise strict supervision and control over  the business activities of various monetary institutions.  Meanwhile, they must also keep their eyes on various  unauthorized, illegal fund-raising and financing activities in  all localities.    First of all, a direct and effective measure is to  strengthen  the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and  the management of risks. The basic principle in strengthening  the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities is  as follows:    1) It is necessary to restrain the use of funds by means of  the sources of assets.    2) It is essential to establish structural correspondence.  That is, the utilization of long-term capital must correspond  with the stable sources of such capital.    3) It is imperative to make the best use of funds.    4) It is necessary to divert risks. It should be stipulated  that loans to any client should not exceed a certain percentage  of the client's capital. Efforts must be made to avoid extending  exorbitant loans to one enterprise only. The principal measure  in strengthening management of risks for assets is to divide the  bank's assets into different categories, estimate risks of such  assets and adopt different forms of management for the assets of  different risks. Working out a regulation on the rate of  abundance of capital and determining the risks of assets are  something fundamental in doing management of risks for assets.  If it is said that the asset liability ratio management  emphasizes quantitative control, the assets risk management is  mainly aimed at exercising an overall qualitative control over  the bank's assets and liabilities. The management of risks for  assets is a complex system engineering project. Its entire  process involves the forecast, prevention and diversion of risks.    Next, to make the reform of the financial system a success,  it is necessary to improve legislation on banking. While  implementing a reform measure, it is essential to formulate a  complete set of relevant laws, regulations, systems and methods.  Right now, the state is working on the "Law of People's Bank of  China," the "Banking Law of the People's Republic of China,"  "Insurance Law," and the "Law of Bills" and some relevant rules,  regulations and measures. They are aimed at helping financial  institutions carry out and manage their businesses, supervising  and controlling them according to law, maintaining financial  order and stability and ensuring the safety of the financial  system. For example, in light of the interest rate war among  some financial institutions in the province during the first  quarter of this year, the branch of the People's Bank of China  in Henan Province had enacted a 50-article regulation to  strengthen the control of interest rates, stopped the war on  interest rates and curbed the competition among various  financial institutions in the province.    During the period of transition from planned economy to  socialist market economy, the situation is usually complicated  in the realm of financial affairs. It often involves important  issues of policy. Each reform measure must be formulated and  implemented in close touch with reality. All kinds of  contradictions and problems in economic and monetary affairs  must be studied and analyzed timely, accurately and completely;  and measures taken to resolve them. China is a vast country.  Situations differ in thousands of ways in the eastern and  western regions, special economic zones, the coastal and the  inland areas, economically developed districts, and old  liberated, minority, border and poverty-stricken regions. The  task of the people's bank and its various branches in conducting  investigation and study remains arduous. Only by doing a good  job in conducting investigation and study, will it be possible  for us to build a solid foundation for scientifically  formulating and implementing the currency and credit policies  and strengthening macroeconomic control. Meantime, we will be  able to help the various localities to develop their economy,  and assist enterprises and relevant departments to strengthen  their management, become market-oriented and improve their  economic efficiency.    With the deepening of the financial structural reform, banks  are playing an increasingly important role in the national  economy and gradually becoming important sectors of the state in  exercising macroeconomic control. As a leading department in the  new financial system, the People's Bank of China must closely  follow the guideline laid down in the "Decision" adopted by the  3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress, further  change its functions, and genuinely shoulder the glorious duties  and missions assigned it by the Party Central Committee and the  State Council.</p>

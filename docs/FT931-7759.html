			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith set for Mirror talks MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, is to meet members of the Mirror Group Newspapers board over the next few days to discuss whether the group will continue to have a close relationship with the Labour party. The move follows an assurance by Mr David Montgomery, MGN's chief executive, to the four banks which are majority shareholders in the group that the Daily Mirror would remain a left-of-centre newspaper. The banks believe a rightward shift in political orientation would damage MGN as a business.</p>

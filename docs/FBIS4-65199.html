			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Open Heart--The Liberals Have Had </F> Their Fill of Him: Only Juergen Moellemann Thinks Himself  Indispensable"]    [Text] Juergen Moellemann's office is draped as if he were  the federal chancellor--so big is the German flag which the FDP  politician has planted next to his desk.    In the tiny Bonn representative's cubicle the bombastic flag  appears a sheer parody. It is out of all proportion--and that is  why it suits Moellemann.    The FDP [Free Democratic Party] land chairman of North  Rhine-Westphalia knows about the lofty effect of national  symbols. But he does not know what a thin line separates the  lofty from the ridiculous.    So it appears simply comical when he--after the  embarrassingly close reelection at the Dortmund land party  congress on the weekend before last--announces he will "decide"  only in May whether he will be a candidate for the FDP presidium  at the party congress in Rostock.    His opponents found it just as amusing that he--after the  resignation of Education Minister Rainer Ortlieb--informed the  German public that he had been asked, but was ready to assume  the office only under certain conditions. "If he had taken it  on," says an influential party caucus colleague, "he would have  fallen on his face."    Even his mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, was furious when  Moellemann traveled across the country announcing that the FDP  must proclaim its honorary chairman as presidential candidate.  This is what Klaus Kinkel meant when he thundered at the  Dortmund party congress that "there was too much chatter."    Moellemann was deeply wounded that the party chief dressed  him down in public: "That was a demonstrative affront." He felt  his offer of comradely cooperation had been meant seriously.  Kinkel's threatening answer ("I shall take you at your word, Mr.  Moellemann"), and the storm of applause caused by it, knocked  for a loop the chairman of the FDP land association with the  largest membership. "There he hit me with a straight right."    But Moellemann would not be Moellemann if he did not simply  swallow the insult. No one has to explain to him how to turn big  defeats into small gains.    An embarrassing ballot result? Are 59.6 percent not a  majority?    His relations with Kinkel? If the party chairman declares  important political decisions--such as the issue of the  presidency or the coalition statement--to be an executive matter  and takes them on himself, so be it. But then, in Moellemann's  logic, he also has to suffer the consequences by himself.    Is it not true that he tried repeatedly to have personal  talks with the chairman, to signal his willingness to cooperate?  He had tried to gain access to him "with an open heart," but  nothing had transpired except for a noncommittal "Mr.  Moellemann, we need you." Still, he does not want to stay on a  confrontational course: "We will just have to try again," he  forces himself to say, "for the sake of the FDP."    Had he not warned them? Had he not made noises against the  premature coalition announcement in order to avert danger to the  FDP? Had not the parliamentary caucus chairman, Hermann Otto  Solms--who called Moellemann's criticism "damaging to the  party"--said the same thing on this subject, but without being  reprimanded?    He did not miss what started to happen in Dortmund: "I don't  sit on my ears." First came the letter by the parliamentary  caucus chief, publicly calling for coalition discipline. Then he  heard how General Secretary Werner of Cologne was being  belabored to run as an opposing candidate.    On the Wednesday before the party congress, members of the  Cologne bezirk committee talked for hours with Hoyer in the  Ratskeller at Cologne's Alte Markt, to persuade him to run. But  he did not want to. Kinkel had let him know that, although he  had nothing against an opposing candidacy, he wanted to keep  Hoyer as general secretary.    "If Werner had run," bets Cologne Liberal Walter Klein, "he  would have been elected and Moellemann would be gone."    But it was not only the intrigues in the land association,  not the "operative preparatory work," and not the blows by  Chairman Kinkel which almost shot down the superliberal from  Muenster.    He was punished because, even in the disguise of Cassandra,  he was never seen as the friend concerned about the party's  welfare, but rather as some well-known variant of Juergen  Moellemann: the frustrated man who never got over the fact that  Kinkel instead of him managed the rise to the top; the  know-it-all who appears aggressively dogmatic even when he is  right; the agile public relations leader whom one cannot take  into one's confidence or tie him into it because he publicly  talks about joint agreements for his own advantage.    It agitates him greatly that he has become dispensable in  Bonn, within the coalition as well as in the party. And it is no  consolation to him at all that he is experiencing personally  what he has been predicting for his party in the fall election:  That no one who does not maintain his profile is any longer  important in Bonn.    The advice of a friend, to throw in the towel and use his  talents for his own gain, has no effect on him whatsoever. To  quit politics? "I cannot do that," says Juergen Moellemann, "for  I have been associated with the club too long."</p>

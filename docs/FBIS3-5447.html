The Department of Information says a total of 223 Thai  workers were persuaded to work in Shenzhen, Guangzhou [as heard]  Province, the People's Republic of China. Each worker was  charged a commission of 50,000 baht. When the workers arrived  in Shenzhen, the broker seized their passports and they were  later abandoned by their employers.    The office of Thai Consulate General in Guangzhou has worked  with Chinese authorities in repatriating Thai workers late last  year by China's Southern Airline.

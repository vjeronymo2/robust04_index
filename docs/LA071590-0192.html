			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OWNERS IN FIRE-PRONED AREAS WARNED  </P> <P> Last month's wild fires in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Bernardino  counties -- all allegedly deliberately started -- underscore the impact that  arsonists have on the lives of many Southland residents.  </P> <P> According to Mike Harris of California Fair Plan in Los Angeles, residents of  hillside and other fire-prone areas should begin their anti-arson battle by  monitoring all suspicious activity in their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "If you see suspicious looking people or vehicles in your neighborhood, notify  the police immediately," Harris said. "If you see smoke or someone cooking in  an area that is not a camp site, notify the authorities."  </P> <P> Many communities in fire-prone areas have established citizen patrols,  neighbors who volunteer one night a week to patrol their neighborhood looking  for suspicious activity, Harris said.  </P> <P> Residents can also band together with their fire and police departments and  other community representatives to form an arson task force, keeping all groups  apprised of various anti-arson activities, he said.  </P> <P> Finally, communities can initiate arson hot lines and rewards for information  leading to the conviction of arsonists. There is already one such hot line,  Harris said, (800) 47ARSON, that offers a $500 reward for the arrest and  conviction of arsonists.  </P> <P> Besides patrolling the neighborhood for suspicious people, residents should  make certain that physical conditions in the area will make it difficult to  sustain a brush fire, according to David H. Crocker of the Western Insurance  Information Service, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Taking steps to prevent losses in fire-prone hillside areas is better than  collecting insurance proceeds after the loss, he said. The following  precautions should reduce fire losses:  </P> <P>  -- Keep the area around your house clear of brush. A state law requires that  all flammable vegetation be removed within 30 feet of all structures. It's  better to keep brush clear within 100 feet to create a fire break. A free  brochure on fire-retardant plants is available from Western Insurance  Information Service at (800) 397-1697.  </P> <P>  -- Establish an escape route from your house and your neighborhood.  </P> <P>  -- Establish a "telephone tree." Collect the work phone numbers of all your  neighbors and leave them with a neighbor who is home weekdays. In the event of  fire, this neighbor can alert everyone at work.  </P> <P>  -- If you have a wood shake or shingle roof, consider installing a roof  watering system. Soakers and flooders are better than sprinkler-type systems.  </P> <P>  -- Better yet, replace a wooden roof with a tile or composition roof that  won't readily support combustion of wind-driven embers. Many communities ban  wood roofs on new houses, but don't require owners of existing homes to install  fire-resistant roofs. David M. Kinchen  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALKOUTS AT SCHOOLS CALLED AT A 'CRISIS'  </P> <P> As sit-ins or walkouts hit 15 additional Los Angeles school district campuses  in the ninth day of a widening student revolt, the political and administrative  apparatus of the city's huge school district launched a series of new  initiatives to respond to what the school board president termed a "crisis."  </P> <P> Friday's protests involved an estimated 4,300 students -- the largest  single-day total yet -- and included a dozen high schools and three junior high  schools from Carson to Granada Hills and East Los Angeles to Venice. Most of  the demonstrations continued to be peaceful, and no injuries were reported.  </P> <P> However, the potential for the student-led protests to get out of hand was  dramatized at San Fernando High School, where hundreds of students decided to  march down the center of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Some threw rocks and bottles  at police who ordered them to return to school. Other protesting San Fernando  High students swarmed en masse into a convenience store and stole items off the  shelves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Serious'  </P> <P> "This is getting very serious. . . . I think we're reaching the crisis point,"  said school board President Roberta Weintraub.  </P> <P> The dual theme of the protests, which are an outgrowth of a bitter labor  dispute between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers,  remained the same. Students support teachers' demands for higher pay, but they  want their official midyear grades filed with the district.  </P> <P> Teachers, as a pressure tactic on the board, have threatened to withhold  student grades from the district if a contract settlement is not reached by  next Friday. Students would be able to obtain grades from teachers on  unofficial, union report cards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> College Admissions  </P> <P> Despite assurances from teachers that students will not be affected by the  action, many students, particularly high school seniors, are demanding that the  grades be filed. They fear that they may be put at a disadvantage in the  competition for college admissions if preparation of official midyear  transcripts is delayed.  </P> <P> A flurry of new efforts surfaced Friday to address the protests and the  slow-moving contract negotiations that have been going on for almost a year. It  was not clear, however, whether the efforts were producing actual progress  toward halting the protests or resolving the underlying labor dispute between  the school district and teachers. But they were clearly the result of the  spreading student demonstrations and represented some of the most visible  movement in weeks toward accelerated bar gaining.  </P> <P> Three board members -- Warren Furutani, Julie Korenstein and Jackie Goldberg --  held a press conference to declare that it is time for around-the-clock  bargaining between board members and leaders of United Teachers-Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Things have taken a decided turn for the worse," said Furutani, a Harbor-area  representative. "We can't stand by while the situation continues to  deteriorate."  </P> <P> Union officials quickly endorsed the move.  </P> <P> Furutani and Korenstein called for an emergency school board meeting and  bargaining through the weekend, but late Friday, Weintraub said some board  members were not available and the matter will not be taken up until the  board's regular meeting Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widespread Disbelief  </P> <P> In another development, Weintraub, acknowledging widespread disbelief of the  district's claim that it lacks the money to significantly improve its pay offer  to teachers, called for an independent audit of the district's books. The  auditor, she said, should be selected jointly by the school board and the  teachers' union. The matter is expected to be taken up Monday.  </P> <P> Because of the protests, administration officials also said they plan in the  coming days to make an unusual mass mailing to all parents in the district. The  mailing, officials said, is expected to explain the district's position in  negotiations and assure parents and students that the district will do  everything possible to fulfill its legal obligations.  </P> <P> But, in an effort to boost its side, district spokeswoman Diana Munatones said  the letter may also warn that the district does not recognize the union report  cards and that withholding of grades could harm some students.  </P> <P> It was not clear Friday whether the student protest tactic of skipping homeroom  period -- during which the official attendance is taken that determines state  funding for the district -- was having a significant financial effect. The  district loses $15 for each student not present. Homeroom attendance was down  at some schools Friday, but officials had no estimate of the impact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Appeal  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Wayne Johnson, president of the teachers' union, issued a new appeal  for students to stay in class and stop the walkouts, "because they are not  accomplishing anything."  </P> <P> Johnson also sought to place responsibility for the protests on Supt. Leonard  Britton, who he accused of being "very irresponsible" earlier this week.  Britton, in well-publicized remarks, warned that some college-bound students  could be harmed if grades are not filed with school offices.  </P> <P> The union insists that no harm will result and that grades will be forwarded to  college admissions officials. Johnson said if the teachers capitulate on the  grade issue, the only collective-bargaining tactic left would be a strike.  </P> <P> But board member Alan Gershman insisted that the contract and the grades are  separate issues and the key to ending the protests is release of the grades.  </P> <P> "There would be no more problem if the teachers do what they are supposed to  do," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE THEY STAND  </P> <P> </P> <P> SALARY INCREASES  </P> <P> BOARD: 6% increase first year at a cost of $69 million, 5.2% in each of the  second and third years, more if additional state funds are available. Estimated  total cost is $420 million.  </P> <P> TEACHERS:12% first year. Estimated cost is $138 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TERM OF CONTRACT  </P> <P> BOARD: Three years. School board says it needs extended period of labor peace  to work on improving educational quality.  </P> <P> TEACHERS: One year. With passage of guaranteed school funding, teachers believe  more funds may be available in coming years and do not want to agree to lower  increases now.  </P> <P> AVAILABLE MONEY  </P> <P> BOARD: To go above the current offer will require cuts in a variety of  administrative and curriculum-development programs that would eventually hurt  students.  </P> <P> TEACHERS: The district has plenty of money buried in its $3.5-billion budget to  meet teacher pay requests.  </P> <P> POWER SHARING  </P> <P> BOARD: More decision-making authority over spending and instruction should be  pushed down to the neighborhood school level. Teachers, parents and principal  would share power on new school councils, but principal would have to agree  with council before any changes are made.  </P> <P> TEACHERS: The district should move ahead now with so-called school-based  management. Decisions should be made by school councils, with teachers having a  majority of voting positions and principals having no veto.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREPARATION TIME AT GRADE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> BOARD: Giving elementary school teachers paid preparation time during the  school day would cost $82 million in the first year, and appears to be too  costly.  </P> <P> TEACHERS: Like junior and senior high teachers, elementary teachers need time  set aside for instruction preparation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DOCKED PAY  </P> <P> BOARD: There is no basis for paying teachers for duties they have not performed  as part of their boycott of yard duty, parent conferences and other activities.  </P> <P> TEACHERS: District is illegally withholding millions of dollars from teachers  and every penny will have to be released before a settlement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff writer Steve Padilla contributed to this story.  </P></p>

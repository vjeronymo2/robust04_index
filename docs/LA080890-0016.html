			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BAIL FOR SUSPECTS IN SLAYING WAS AN ERROR, D.A. SAYS;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE COMMENTS FOLLOW PROTESTS THAT THE $20,000 BOND FOR 2 WHITE  TEEN-AGERS IN THE DEATH OF A BLACK MINISTER WAS RACIST.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office conceded Tuesday that  prosecutors erred last week when they recommended only $20,000 bail for two  white youths charged in the shooting death of a black minister but denied that  the decision was racist.  </P> <P> "There should have been no bail," said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the  district attorney. "Our bail schedule calls for no bail in a murder case.  Therefore, we feel that the recommendation of the $20,000 initial bail was  unjustified. However, it has been rectified."  </P> <P> The review of the decision to allow low bail was prompted by protests by  ministers and community activists in the northeast San Fernando Valley who  reacted angrily after learning that the suspects in the July 28 slaying of Carl  White, pastor of the Apostolic Temple Church, were initially granted $20,000  bail. They called the low bail "lethal racism."  </P> <P> Prosecutors allege that White was shot in the back of the head during a dispute  with Philip J. Dimenno, 19, and Dana L. Singer, 18, both of Northridge. The  suspects allegedly went to White's house in Chatsworth to discuss a minor  traffic accident that had occurred the night before. They were arrested three  days after the slaying.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Billy D. Webb, head of the San Fernando office, said he made  the decision to initially seek the unusually low bail for the two college  students because they lived with their parents, had strong ties to the  community and did not appear to be a danger to the public if released. A  background search by police had turned up no prior record for either of the  suspects at the time.  </P> <P> However, a day after bail was set at $20,000, police discovered both had been  cited earlier this year when they were caught trespassing at a city park while  armed. Police also learned the gun used to kill White was stolen, and Singer  had stolen credit cards in his possession. The bail was vacated at prosecutors'  request and Dimenno, who had already been released on bail, was rearrested.  Both suspects are being held without bail pending their arraignment next  Monday.  </P> <P> Webb's decision was reviewed Monday night by Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard W.  Hecht, chief of branch and area operations for the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, the recommendation that bail should be set in the amount of  $20,000 was a mistake and I told Mr. Webb that," Hecht said. "It was a  discretionary call by him. I understand his reasons. But, in terms of the  amount of bail, that was a mistake."  </P> <P> Hecht said he found no indication that Webb was racially motivated. He  described Webb as an American Indian who is sensitive to minority issues.  </P> <P> "I regret the issue of race was raised here," Hecht said. "I don't find that to  be true. Mr. Webb was not aware of the race of the victim until after the bail  recommendation had been made. No one asked the question during the discussion  because it was irrelevant."  </P> <P> No disciplinary action will be taken against Webb, officials said.  </P> <P> The announcement by the prosecutors' office did little to mollify those who had  called for an investigation.  </P> <P> "It is so easy to say they made a mistake," said Bishop Milford Harvey of the  Unity Life Christian Center in Lake View Terrace. "But they are professionals  and I believe it was a decision that was intentionally made because of the  racial situation."  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals prices more volatile - Market report This week's rise in base metal markets continued yesterday but trading became more active and markets more volatile as the higher levels brought in trade and chart-based selling and profit-taking. COPPER at one stage looked to be headed for a test of resistance around Dollars 1,920 a tonne for three months delivery, which would have signalled a run-up to this year's high near Dollars 1,940. But determined selling sent the price back to Dollars 1,906 a tonne before it steadied in after hours trading to Dollars 1,910, up Dollars 14 on the day and Dollars 64.50 on the week so far. The ALUMINIUM market was encouraged as VAW and Hoogovens became the latest companies to contribute output cuts in line with the agreement reached by world producers in Brussels last month. The three months price traded up Dollars 28 to Dollars 1,315 a tonne before ending Dollars 1 below the peak. ZINC continued to track copper and aluminium but was also encouraged by its own constructive chart pattern. The three months price ended at Dollars 990 a tonne, up Dollars 13, after reaching Dollars 992 during the day. Among the precious metals PLATINUM was fixed in the afternoon at a fresh six-month high of Dollars 404.50 a troy ounce, Dollars 3.75 up from Wednesday, as support continued to be derived from apprehension about possible disruption during the South African elections. GOLD closed Dollars 2.50 up at Dollars 386 and ounce and cash SILVER gained 8 cents at Dollars 5.34 1/2 an ounce. Gold's firmness was encouraged by the Bundesbank's half per cent discount rate cut and news of only a 0.1 per cent January rise in the UC consumer price index, compared with a forecast rise of 0.3 per cent. But some London dealers thought it would be a 'false move' for gold to rally now as it had not fully tested its apparently solid support under Dollars 380 an ounce. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ploughed higher in the afternoon, boosted by a more buoyant New York market following Wednesday's technically inspired setback. But the near May position encountered difficulty in breaking through the previous high of Dollars 1,228 a tonne where it peaked before closing Dollars 14 up at Dollars 1,227. COCOA futures recovered after a weaker morning. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SALE OF EASTERN'S SHUTTLE TO TRUMP WINS FIRST OK  </P> <P> The U.S. Transportation Department gave tentative approval Wednesday to the  sale of the lucrative Eastern Airlines shuttle to flamboyant real estate tycoon  Donald J. Trump.  </P> <P> The price tag for the sale, which was announced in October by Trump and Texas  Air Corp., Eastern's parent company, is $365 million. The shuttle, Eastern's  only profitable operation, has hourly, non-reservation flights between New York  and Washington and New York and Boston.  </P> <P> Observers have called the deal a coup for Trump, who probably would expand the  shuttle's service to Atlantic City, the East Coast's gambling mecca. Trump owns  two large hotel-casinos there and has a 12% stake in Resorts International,  which is building a casino and hotel in Atlantic City.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department said it found Trump's plans for operating the  carrier to be sound financially and that his key personnel have the necessary  managerial and technical skills. The Trump Shuttle still must pass a safety  review by the Federal Aviation Administration before the sale can be completed.  </P> <P> The way was cleared for the transaction to move ahead when a federal court last  month denied the objections of labor unions that challenged the sale as a  union-busting tactic by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air. The unions had  maintained that the sale was part of a plan by Texas Air, which also owns  non-union Continental Airlines, to dismantle Eastern.  </P> <P> Separately, industry sources said Wednesday that Eastern, in another  divestiture move, is close to selling its operations at Philadelphia to USAir  Group for about $80 million. Eastern, which has lost more than $1 billion in  the last 10 years, in August eliminated service to 14 cities, closed its Kansas  City hub and dismissed 12% of its work force.  </P></p>

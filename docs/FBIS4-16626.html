			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Stepanenko: "Vyacheslav Kebich: I Have Not </F> Sold Belarus Out"]    [Text] Minsk -- Before leaving for the meeting of heads of  state and government in Moscow, Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of  the Belarus Council of Ministers, held a press conference for  local and foreign correspondents devoted to the agreement  concluded 12 April on unifying the Belorussian [Belarusian] and  Russian monetary systems.    "As far as the accusations that I have sold out Belarus or  handed it over to somebody are concerned, I can state officially  yet again that I made my choice and have no regrets. This was  the choice of my life, and I am prepared to sacrifice everything  to see it all through to the finish, since I am profoundly  convinced that union [soyuz] with Russia will be our salvation  and our children's salvation."    The prime minister talked in detail about how the agreement  had come about. The work began two years ago, he noted, but it  has been particularly intensive for the past eight months. The  Belorussian side submitted 30 versions of the agreement during  this period. Vigorous opposition from certain forces within both  Belorussia and Russia had to be overcome.    As PRAVDA has already reported, the agreement is in two  parts. The first applies to the unification of monetary systems,  while the second applies to matters with a direct bearing on  customs operations, duties, and the status of Russian troops on  Belorussian territory. The articles in part two of the  agreement, which envisage the lifting of trade duties and  payments to allow Russian goods to transit Belorussian territory  or to allow the Russian side to lease strategic installations,  come into force 26 April.</p>

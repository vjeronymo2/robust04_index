			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jibril al-Rajub, 'Arafat's adviser </F> on the territories, in Tunis, by Rafi Rosenfeld -- live]    [Text] [Rosenfeld] There has been great optimism in  Israel in the past few days in anticipation of the resumption of  the Israel-PLO negotiations. Does your organization in Tunis  share this sentiment?    [Al-Rajub] I think it does. Agreement still has to be  reached on the number of policemen and their weapons, and we  expect this issue to be resolved tomorrow.    [Rosenfeld] Israel does not think the number of policemen  and their weapons are a big problem. Do you share this view?    [Al-Rajub] We do see this as a problem, but if Israel thinks  it is no problem, then it can be solved within the next 24 hours.    [Rosenfeld] How many Palestinian policemen does the PLO want  in Hebron?    [Al-Rajub] Listen, we too do not insist on any particular  number. So, if the Israelis think this is no problem, we will  be able to find some compromise.    [Rosenfeld] It has been said here that a deal can be  clinched within a few hours.    [Al-Rajub] I hope so. If it is wrapped up today, we will  start the Gaza and Jericho negotiations tomorrow.    [Rosenfeld] With regard to the Gaza and Jericho  negotiations, there is no certainty that all the problems will  be solved by 13 April -- the date on which the first part of the  agreement is supposed to be implemented. Will the PLO insist on  this date?    [Al-Rajub] Listen, I think we cannot solve all the problems  by 13 April, and even in a year and in two years, there will  still be difficulties to be overcome. But if we can enter on 13  April, it will help both sides to overcome the difficulties.    [Rosenfeld] Then you insist that at least Palestinian  policemen enter the territory on 13 April, or that the State of  Israel make at least a symbolic step on that date.    [Al-Rajub] Yes, Israel must make the fist step. In my  opinion, Israel must make many steps before 13 April.    [Rosenfeld] Such as?    [Al-Rajub] First of all, the introduction of policemen.  Second, the release of prisoners. Third, Israel must start  bringing deportees back home. I think there are many steps that  need to be taken.    [Rosenfeld] The big question is naturally the Army's  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Judging by this morning's  press reports, there is no certainty that all the difficulties  will be ironed out and an agreement will be signed by 13 April.  What will happen if no agreement is signed by then?    [Al-Rajub] The failure to sign an agreement for this day is  unfortunate, but if we start before 13 April, a positive  atmosphere will be created and there will be a favorable  attitude for the peace process and the leaders on both sides,  helping them overcome the difficulties and sign an agreement  within a short time.    [Rosenfeld] Jibril al-Rajub in Tunis, thank you very much.    [Al-Rajub] You are welcome. Shalom.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading Strong two-way business in stock options led to a rise in turnover in the traded options market, reversing the recent dull performance of the sector, writes Joel Kibazo. Total volume in the traded options reached 40,297 contracts, a significant jump from Monday's poor 16,634 lots. Trading in the FT-SE 100 option, however, was poor with a mere 6,762 lots dealt against 7,283 on Monday. The Euro FTSE option saw 3,005 contracts traded. It was the stock options that generated the majority of the day's volume. Amstrad led the league table with business amounting to 9,654 contracts by the close. Most of the day's activity was centred on the June 93 calls and puts. This was followed by Asda, in which 5,005 lots were transacted. Dealers spoke of a buyer of the April 60 calls and a seller of the April 50 puts. Tesco was also active, business reaching 2,728 lots, as was Grand Metropolitan on 2,025. In stock index futures, trading in the December contract on the FT-SE was said to have been featureless. Having opened at 2,720, it retreated to the day's low of 2,713 at 9.30am before recovering to attain the day's high of 2,730 at around 11.30am. It finished at 2,721, off 10 from the previous close but at a four-point premium to the underlying cash market. Volume in the December contract came to 7,638 lots, and in the March contract it reached 3,786.</p>

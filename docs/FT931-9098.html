			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Tapie sells control of Adidas for DM615m MR Bernard Tapie, the French businessman and politician, has sold control of Adidas, the German sporting goods group, for DM615m (Pounds 260m) to a consortium of investors including Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the UK-based advertising group, and a number of French financial institutions. The French conservative opposition has called for an official inquiry into the deal, which involves Mr Tapie, recently reappointed as Socialist minister for towns, selling shares to a consortium including three state-controlled companies - Credit Lyonnais, Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP). The Adidas controversy comes shortly after the outcry over the sale of Yves Saint-Laurent, the fashion house chaired by Mr Pierre Berge, a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, to Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group. Mr Tapie, who needs to raise capital to reduce his debts, has for months been trying to find a buyer for his Adidas shares following the collapse of an earlier deal with Pentland, the UK consumer products company. Adidas has had a tough time in the three years since Mr Tapie took control. To meet fierce competition from Nike and Reebok of the US, Mr Tapie has rationalised operations in the face of fierce union opposition, but Adidas still saw net profits fall from DM52m in 1990 to DM15m on static sales of DM3.35bn in 1991. Under the terms of yesterday's deal Mr Louis-Dreyfus will leave Saatchi to take over as chairman in April, with a 15 per cent stake in the Adidas holding company. Credit Lyonnais will raise its holding from 10 per cent to 18 per cent, as will AGF from 5 per cent to 17 per cent and UAP from 5 per cent to 7 per cent. Coatbridge and Omega Ventures, two investment funds, will take 15 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively. Bull, the French computer group, saw sales fall 9.7 per cent from FFr33.45bn in 1991 to FFr30.18bn (Pounds 3.78bn) last year. However, the group improved its operating margins during the year. Bull's operating losses, which will be announced when its results come out in early March, are estimated to have fallen from last year's FFr1.5bn to below FFr1bn.</p>

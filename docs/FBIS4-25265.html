			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Wu Yi,  minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said during  a recent interview with reporters that in the first 4 months of  this year, China's foreign trade developed very rapidly; imports  and exports increased significantly, and, in particular, exports  development accelerated; and that the state's foreign exchange  balance has increased.    Wu Yi said that this year, China's foreign trade has been  developing rapidly, healthily, and in a coordinated manner. It  mainly has the following four characteristics:    --Import and export trade grew significantly. According to  statistics from the customs department, total import and export  value reached $57.84 billion, an increase of 21.1 percent over  the same period of last year, and this speed was quite high  compared with the same periods of recent years.    --Exports accelerated. In the first 4 months of this year,  export value reached $28.04 billion, a 22 percent increase over  the same period of last year. What is noteworthy is that the  general trade export, which had not performed well in recent  years, grew rapidly, with an increase of 30.5 percent,  surpassing the 22.1 percent growth in the processing trade  exports. This was a good trend not seen in the past few years.    --Imports slowed down. In the first 4 months of this year,  the import value was $29.79 billion, 20.3 percent increase over  the same period of last year. Judged from absolute value,  import and export volumes were very close, and judged by  development trends, a balance between import and export is  feasible.    --Settlement of exchange is bigger than sale of exchange,  the  foreign trade situation in the whole country is quite good, and  the state's foreign exchange reserve is bigger than earlier this  year.    Wu Yi said frankly that China's foreign trade and economic  work is also faced with some difficulties and problems, and the  more acute ones are: Enterprises still have a tight supply of  circulation funds, purchase price of export commodities are  increasingly too rapidly, and foreign trade and export lack  staying power.</p>

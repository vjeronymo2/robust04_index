			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Savchenko, deputy head of the oblast </F> state administration, by Vasyl Chepurnyy; place and date not  given: "`Chernihiv Oblast's Role in Ukraine Is Like Alaska's in  the United States'"]    [Text]    [Chepurnyy] Your words are rather harsh and unexpected. Can  you please explain?    [Savchenko] I have made this comparison because,  unfortunately, our oblast finds itself in a much worse situation  than other oblasts. Despite the fact that, like Alaska in the  United States, it supplies vitally needed raw materials --  timber, flax, and agricultural goods. Judge for yourself.    Our oblast is an agricultural region and so our income is  obviously seasonal. After bringing in the harvest, we dutifully  sell it to the state and put aside some money to buy equipment,  fuel and lubricants, and fertilizers. But this money is  instantly eaten up by our raging inflation. Half the population  lives in rural areas, whereas the lack of parity in the prices  of industrial and agricultural goods has produced a situation in  which industrial production accounts for nearly 70 percent of  the gross national product. Just three years ago, it amounted to  40 percent, while agricultural output accounted for 60 percent.    The oblast has few hard-surface roads, schools, medical and  preschool institutions, and cultural facilities. But our  invariably "holey" budget, multiplied by inflation and the  seasonal nature of agricultural production, prevents us from  rising to the level of other oblasts. The budget is also weak  due to a bias in setting the rates of excise taxes, enterprise  taxes, and value-added taxes.    In accordance with the "Law on the State Budget of Ukraine  for 1993," our oblast kept only 23.1 percent of the value-added  tax and 50 percent of the excise taxes and enterprise profits  tax collected on its territory. Meanwhile, Zhytomyr, Sumy, and  Kiev oblasts received the full amount. We, on the other hand,  have been put in the same category with Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk,  and Zaporizhzhya oblasts, all of which have a powerful  production potential.    As a result, our level of social development lags  significantly behind average indicators for Ukraine as a whole.  For example, while the national average of apartments equipped  with gas is 46.6 percent, only 28.9 percent of Chernihiv  Oblast's apartments have gas. The number of physicians per  10,000 residents is 44 percent nationally and 31 percent in  Chernihiv [as published], the number of children provided with  permanent preschool institutions -- 49.4 and 48 percent,  respectively. The list of examples could go on and on.    In the past, as we know, there were state orders for both  agricultural and industrial production. There was a relatively  firm arrangement: we gave the state potatoes, flax, grain, etc.,  and the state provided us with industrial goods, equipment, fuel  and lubricants, fertilizers, and consumer goods. Moreover, at  stable and more or less affordable prices. Not once did we fail  to execute the state order! Now they take from us, but give us  nothing in return. What we have now is something skewed,  something that is no longer even a state order, but simply a way  of pumping out agricultural production.    We are trying to develop our processing industry to involve  a  higher degree of processing, but this requires lumber, meat,  butter, sugar, grain alcohol, and hides. The oblast has all of  these things and moreover in large amounts. But the state order  takes everything.    [Chepurnyy] Your economic service prepared a study that  clearly shows that in terms of per capita national income  Chernihiv Oblast has surpassed such powerful oblasts as Luhansk,  Donetsk, and the Crimean Republic. This is simply hard to  believe.    [Savchenko] It is hard to believe because the miners are  creating an uproar across the entire country, even though their  demands are harming not only the economy of the whole country  but also the residents of Donetsk Oblast by driving up inflation  with their high wages. The Crimea is snuggling up to Russia and  also making a fuss. Whereas our oblast is very docile--except  for the famous slogan, "Who ate my meat?" during the notorious  "sausage revolution," we have not been heard from in the  political chorus.    he result has been that Luhansk Oblast, for example,  receives  327,000 karbovantsi per resident in financing from the state  budget, while Chernihiv Oblast gets only 251,000. Even Poltava  and Zhytomyr oblasts receive 275,000 and 295,000, respectively.  Other oblasts receive subsidies from Kiev, while all we get are  promises.    [Chepurnyy] The solution, presumably, does not lie in  stretching out your hand to the state and saying: "Give!"?    [Savchenko] Of course not. There should be normal economic  relations in our dealings with the center and with other  oblasts. What has happened instead is that we cannot collect  what is owed us for the meat, butter, and other agricultural  goods that we delivered in government orders to Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine's southern oblasts.    I have said on many occasions that the Donetsk miners do not  travel to the Kuzbas to get coal for their homes, schools, and  enterprises. They burn the coal they mine. Why is it then that  we, Chernihivites, must give up all the oil that we pump in the  southern part of our oblast and then have to go looking over  hill and dale for what we need ourselves? And, moreover, have to  overpay insane prices for it. And, moreover, have our  environment polluted by the development of oil and gas fields.  That is why the oblast state administration requested that at  least 20 percent of the oil be left in the oblast to meet local  needs. We went from one high office to another and managed to  get all of five percent. Clearly, this amount is not sufficient  for our needs. Nonetheless, the State Committee on Oil and Gas  found an excuse to reduce our already meager shipments. They are  sweeping our forests clean to obtain timber for mines, but our  oblast gets no preferential terms when buying coal. Right now  the Chernihiv Thermal Electric Power Station has only 30 percent  of the coal it needs.    Let me add a few words about sugar and grain alcohol  [spirt].  We need these as much for purposes of forced barter as for our  own consumption. I say forced because you need five times as  much fuel to grow potatoes and flax as you do to grow grain  crops. Thus we have a senseless situation. They take our oil  while we have to go looking for foreign oil in order grow  potatoes and flax for Ukraine. Or is it that our country no  longer needs these things?    [Chepurnyy] Incidentally, statistics indicate that Donetsk  Oblast owes us huge sums of money for meat and butter.  Apparently we are feeding the miners free of charge to enable  them to strike on a full stomach and in comfort?    [Savchenko] The trouble is that Chernihiv Oblast itself  needs  assistance as a region that suffered from the Chernobyl  catastrophe. Nor is it only a matter of Chernobyl. We also  require special treatment because Chernihiv Oblast is where the  process of depopulation in Ukraine began at the beginning of the  seventies--in other words, the death rate exceeded the birth  rate.    [Chepurnyy] Let us return to your comparison of Chenihiv  Oblast to Alaska...    [Savchenko] We are not demanding special treatment; we need  to be treated normally. To begin with, those governing  structures that decide he fate of the people must adhere to  economic laws and take into consideration the peculiarities of  socioeconomic development of both industrial and agrarian  regions. Otherwise it will be quite a while yet before we  achieve the standard of living that even the Eskimos in Alaska  enjoy.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Observer: Heavy going Interest in the OECD secretary-general stakes is hotting up ahead of next week's annual meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is unclear whether the winner will be announced at the meeting or whether the race will be extended. But students of racing form believe that Jean-Claude Paye, the current secretary-general, lies well back in the field while Lord Lawson, the former British chancellor of the exchequer, has been catching up fast on Don Johnston, the North American favourite. However, Johnston's trainer, Canada's Foreign Affairs department, desperate to disprove gossip that Johnston is finding it heavy going, has been circulating a 14-page collection of Johnston's thoughts. These include extracts from his memoirs, Up the Hill, and gems from a recent speech to the Ontario Sewer and Watermain Contractors' Association.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE OF FOOD-COSMETIC DYE RED NO. 3 CURBED BECAUSE OF CANCER FEARS  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration banned about one-fifth of the uses of the  color additive Red No. 3 on Monday because it has been shown to cause cancer at  high doses in laboratory rats.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said, Red No. 3 may no longer be  used in any cosmetic product, including lipsticks, powders, blushes, shampoos,  skin care lotions or bath oils.  </P> <P> It is also excluded from use in cake frostings, cough drops, herbs and spices,  flavorings, some processed fruits, chewing gum, cake mixes and dietary foods.  Even the wax on cheeses may no longer contain the red dye, Corwin said.  </P> <P> The cancer risk is considered so small that the FDA said existing products that  contain the color may be used. The ban on Red No. 3 will apply only to new  manufacturing.  </P> <P> The FDA action prevents the use of the red dye in products where the color is  mixed chemically with another additive.  </P> <P> Direct addition of the dye to a product will continue, but the FDA announced  its intention to halt this use eventually.  </P> <P> Red No. 3 is one of seven primary colors approved for food, drug and cosmetic  use.  </P></p>

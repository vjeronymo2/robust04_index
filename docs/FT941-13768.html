			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Observer: Concert party Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, is always banging on about the virtues of a free press. But not all his officials agree, judging by an unusual alliance to stop the film premier of the BBC documentary, Chairman Mao: The Last Emperor in the colony's Foreign Correspondents Club. It's no great surprise that Xinhua News Agency, China's official mouthpiece, didn't want the club to show the offending film tonight. But the FCC was piqued to find the local Hong Kong censor was also being awkward. Such interference has upset Philip Bowring, the ex-editor of the Far East Economic Review and FCC president, who opines that Hong Kong's tough censorship law is an example of the sort of legislation the governor ought to be repealing, not enforcing. No doubt Patten can be relied upon to turn a blind eye if he wants to keep opinion formers on side.</p>

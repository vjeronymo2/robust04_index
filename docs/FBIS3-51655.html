He  admitted, however, that the police are investigating the  possible existence of a rebel group ideologically similar to the  Peruvian guerrilla group "Shining Path."    Santos Vera said today that for the time being no indication  has been found to confirm the existence of such a rebel group,  allegedly called "Red Sun."    Santos Vera, who will stay in Chile until 21 January, added  that the alleged Ecuadoran rebel group has so far not carried  out any political propaganda operation or armed action.    The minister said that Ecuadoran Indians are organized in  different groups, participate in the social life of the country,  and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen's policies seek to  integrate them into the mainstream of Ecuadoran society.    The minister said that Ecuador is "an island of peace"  compared to neighboring countries, obviously referring to  Colombia and Peru, although without naming them.    Santos Vera said that the police have not detected a  "Shining  Path" organized infiltration movement in the Ecuadoran Andean  Altiplano region.    The minister said that the police under his command remain  alert to detect any infiltration, adding that when any of them  is found out they are sent back to Peru.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Tough sanctions against Haiti enforced TOUGH international sanctions against Haiti went into force yesterday as the country's former president, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide (pictured above), agreed to meet members of the military government that ousted him, Reuter reports from New York. The sanctions - aimed at pushing the government into restoring democracy and returning the president to power - took force a minute after midnight. They impose a global oil and arms embargo against the Caribbean nation and freeze financial assets held abroad by the government and the country's ruling elite. However, hopes of a quick settlement of the political crisis hit a stumbling block later in the day when Fr Aristide demanded that talks with the military rulers should centre on his speedy return to power. A statement from Fr Aristide's government-in-exile said he would only meet military leader General Raoul Cedras, who led the September 1991 coup in which Fr Aristide was forced into exile, if the general agreed the talks would centre on the president's immediate return and the departure of the military high command and the Port-au-Prince police chief.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Borzyuk, who is head of the Orel  organization of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR],  and Vladimir Novikov, chairman of the Udmurt regional  organization, have today announced their departure from the Duma  faction of the LDPR. This was reported by INTERFAX and  ITAR-TASS agencies.    Vladimir Borzyk said his decision was made because he  disagreed with the populist actions of LDPR leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, who was inflicting damage not only on the party  itself but also on the principles of morality and ethics common  to all mankind. At the same time, Vladimir Borzyuk noted that  he stll considered himself an adherent of the LDPR Charter, and  in his future activity as a deputy outside the faction he would  pursue the program with which the LDPR had gone to the elections  on 12 December last year and from which, in his opinion,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had deviated.</p>

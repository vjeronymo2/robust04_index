			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Laporte emerges as Evode's white knight LAPORTE, the UK's second largest quoted chemicals group, yesterday emerged as a potential white knight for Evode, the chemicals and plastics group, fighting off a hostile bid from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate. Evode is in an advanced stage of discussions with Laporte, which is close to making a recommended bid above Pounds 1 a share. The news took Wassall by surprise. It had just announced its final offer of 95.2p a share. Wassall's cash and share offer values Evode's ordinary and convertible preference shares at Pounds 113.2m. It is also offering a cash alternative valuing Evode's shares at 92p, compared with an original offer of 80p. By last night Laporte had spent Pounds 4.45m buying 6.1 per cent of Evode at Pounds 1 a share. Mr Ken Minton, Laporte's chief executive, said: 'The worst thing for the UK chemical industry is for it to be carved up like a dead rabbit. Evode requires a combination of chemical expertise and the right management which we are offering.' After tracking Evode for seven years he said he recently concluded that two companies would make an 'excellent fit' and started serious negotiations about making a recommended bid for Evode before Christmas. Laporte's expected bid would include a mixture of equity and cash aimed at ensuring that Laporte's resultant gearing was not much above 50 per cent. Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said: 'Evode will continue to defend the company vigorously against any inadequate offers, into which category Wassall's final offer firmly falls.' He declined to comment on the talks with Laporte. Wassall has asked Evode for any new information it might have given to Laporte. Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief executive, said he was determined not to overpay for Evode. 'We have walked away from private deals in the past because the price was too expensive.' Wassall updated its forecast for pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 1992, saying it would now make Pounds 17.5m for the full year. It recently received more than Pounds 50m of its rights issue which it could use on other deals if it fails to get Evode. Background, Page 16; London SE, Page 30; Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ATAC requested that Standard Nos. 106 and 116 be amended in two primary ways. First, the petitioner suggested that Standard No. 106 be amended to require brake hose compatibility with a fluid with DOT 5 (silicone) brake fluid characteristics. ATAC stated that the U.S. Army adopted DOT 5 silicone brake fluid as its standard operating fluid for its motor vehicles with hydraulic brake systems. After replacing the brake fluid with DOT 5 fluid in some of its vehicles, the Army had operational problems with aftermarket procured hydraulic brake system components. The Army believed it had traced the problem to excessive swelling of elastomeric seals and cups within the hydraulic brake system master cylinder. The swelling appeared to be caused by incompatibility problems between the DOT 5 brake fluid and brake system components made of rubber. Since Standard No. 106 does not test brake hose and hose assemblies with a referee material brake fluid representing DOT 5 (silicone) fluid, ATAC suggested amending Standard No. 106 to require brake hose compatibility with a silicone fluid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, ATAC suggested that Standard No. 116 be amended to require that master and wheel cylinder cups made of ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) be compatible with a DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5 brake fluid referee material, and to include specifications for these EPDM and other rubber components. The tests in Standard No. 116 that measure the effect of brake fluid with rubber are run with SAE referee material SBR cups only. ATAC believed that the aftermarket EPDM brake system components it encountered were incompatible with the DOT 5 brake fluid in its vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believed that the issues raised by ATAC warranted further consideration. Thus, NHTSA granted ATAC's petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rationale for Termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to its petition, ATAC provided further information to NHTSA indicating that its problem had been resolved. Tests conducted by the Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, implied that there was some confusion as to what actually caused the problem in the braking systems of the vehicles in question. Nevertheless, ATAC informed NHTSA that it solved its problem by using only military specification (MIL spec) brake components and brake fluid in ATAC vehicles. ATAC indicated that EPDM and SBR components that met the Army's MIL&hyph;C&hyph;14055, ``Cup, Hydraulic Brake Actuating Cylinder, Synthetic Rubber'' specification perform satisfactorily with silicone brake fluid. ATAC further indicated that if MIL spec MIL&hyph;C&hyph;14055 were used for parts procurement, it would avoid any problems of component deterioration in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA supplemented this information with data for non-military motor vehicles. NHTSA believed that if brake fluid compatibility problems similar to those experienced by ATAC were occurring in non-military vehicles, the public would have reported some of these incidents to NHTSA's Auto Safety Hotline. The Hotline is a comprehensive database that encompasses over 250,000 consumer calls, dating back to 1981, relating to vehicle and component performance and complaints. Approximately 35,000 of these calls are about brake-related performance. NHTSA conducted a database search for all complaints relating to brake fluid in passenger cars, light trucks, buses and heavy trucks, and found no evidence of a safety problem. The agency found only 17 complaints that referred to ``brake fluid'' as the basis for the complaint. The majority of the complaints referred to contamination problems (water, fuel, and other fluid intrusion into the brake fluid). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, approximately 8 of the 17 complaints concerned vehicles that had traveled fewer than 50,000 miles. Because of their relatively low mileage, NHTSA does not believe these vehicles had anything other than the original brake fluid in them. Given the preponderance of vehicles manufactured with DOT 3 fluid over vehicles manufactured with DOT 5 fluid, the agency believes the original brake fluid in the vehicles in question was DOT 3 fluid, not DOT 5 fluid. There was one complaint referring to a problem with ``silicone'' brake fluid and brake system components, involving an antique Jaguar car and a certain brand of silicone fluid. A single complaint in a database as encompassing as the Hotline complaint file does not indicate the possible existence of a significant safety problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, there is no evidence of a safety problem regarding the compatibility of silicone fluid and brake system components. NHTSA believes that if there were a safety problem with brake fluid and component compatibility, evidence of the problem would have appeared in the ten years since ATAC's petition was received by NHTSA. No such evidence has manifested. Accordingly, the agency is terminating this rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117 and 30166; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: October 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27261 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: National Power moves into Portugal A consortium led by National Power, the electricity generator, yesterday completed the purchase of the 600MW Pego coal-fired power station in Portugal from Electricidade de Portugal. The completion represents National Power's second foray overseas and follows a Dollars 160m (Pounds 107m) acquisition in the US. The company has said it expects to invest Pounds 1bn abroad by the end of the century as market opportunities in the UK diminish. In Portugal the company is investing about Pounds 40m initially. It will own 45 per cent of the Tejo Energia consortium which will own the Pounds 710m station. The other shareholders are Endesa of Spain (35 per cent) and Electricite de France (10 per cent). EDP retains 10 per cent of the station which is about 100 miles north-east of Lisbon on the Tagus River. Following completion of the deal Tejo Energia entered into a 28-year power purchase agreement. The first 15 years cover an exclusive supply from Pego to EDP. For the remaining 13 years there is an option to sell the output to third parties 'at no increased risk to the consortium'. National Power said performance tests had been completed on the plant's first 300MW generating unit. It is now operational and providing revenue. The second unit will continue to be constructed by EDP and will be completed by 1995.</p>

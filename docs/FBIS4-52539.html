			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] As of 1991, North Korea had 5,059 kilometers of  railway trackage, or 78 percent of 6,462 kilometers in South  Korea. In North Korea, 3,280 kilometers, or 65 percent of the  total length of railways, were electrified. The rate of  electrification is high compared with South Korea. Nevertheless  North Korea's railways are not playing their proper role.    First, 98 percent of the railways in North Korea are  single-track. Regardless of improvements made in the efficiency  of transportation on single-track railways through  electrification, the more North Korea depends on railways for  long-distance freight transportation, the more frequently the  trains need to operate (dependency on railways in freight  transportation is said to have risen from 88 percent in 1988 to  90 percent in 1992). The greater the frequency of train  operation, the greater the number of intermediate stations  needed, and consequently, the longer the stoppage-time required.  Therefore, the efficiency of electric rail transport is bound  to fall, despite electrification's purpose having been to  improve the speed of train runs. When freight transportation  depends so much on single-track railways, any distribution  system North Korea has is far from adequate. [passage omitted]    According to So Yong-chol, a former North Korean guard and  guide for south-bound spy missions who defected to the South  across the armistice line in September 1989, "between Kaesong  and Wonsan there is no means of transportation other than the  railway. The train leaves Kaesong for Pyongyang at 1845 daily."    It is hardly understandable why there is only one train run  a day between Pyongyang and Kaesong, if we assume that  materials are transported and delivered in North Korea in a  quantity commensurate with the scale of the North Korean  economy. The trains should run far more frequently. As of 1991,  the total length of expressways in North Korea was 354  kilometers and the total number of motor vehicles was 270,000  (there are 4.25 million in South Korea).    Assuming one-tenth of these vehicles, that is, 27,000 are on  the Pyongyang-Nampo, Pyongyang-Wonsan, Pyongyang-Kaesong, and  Pyongyang- Huichon expressways, linking major industrial areas  and urban centers, simple arithmetic indicates that about four  vehicles should be seen on these expressways for each 100  meters. Supposing trucks run on the expressways at 60  kilometers per hour, at least 2,000 trucks could be seen per  hour. Granting that the North Korean authorities are limiting  the operation of trucks in order to prevent increases in oil  imports, the volume of materials transported that can be  projected from the actual observations of the defectors and  travellers provides sufficient ground to raise doubts about the  actual scale of the North Korean economy. [passage omitted]    North Korea's explanation of [the lack of traffic and  activity in Pyongyang] is rather ironical. They say that the  stores in North Korea play the role of a distributor who  distributes goods to local inhabitants, instead of keeping  stocks of goods on a regular basis so that he might sell  articles to the customers from time to time as they come.  People come to pick up their items at a given time when those  items are available; that is why on ordinary days there are  very few customers visiting the stores. If this is true, we  cannot but be curious about whether there are sufficient means  of transportation necessary to distribute all the daily  necessities and whether such means are in an operational  condition.

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: Magic runs out THE INFINITE PLAN by Isabel Allende HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 382 pages WHEN The House of the Spirits, Isabel Allende's first novel, appeared in 1985 there was the definite sense of a major talent unfurled: a new writer with a knack for haunting imagery and a consummate gift for telling a good story. It seemed to matter little then that the novel owed a good deal to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, that its array of autobiographical fragments was skillfully pasted into a frame of magic realism with the family saga of One Hundred Years of Solitude as its archetype; the recipe was a compelling and effective one, and manages to retain its potency still on re-reading. Nothing, though, that Allende has written since has come close to generating the power and vision of that first book. Of Love and Shadows, set in an unnamed, but typically repressed South American country, turned out be a mundane romantic thriller, flecked just occasionally with descriptive, lyrical passages recalling the power of its predecessor but never its sharp focus. Eva Luna and still more its codicil The Stories of Eva Luna cleaved closer again to Marquezian models, but both failed to make their sweet-sour mixture of violence and sentiment gel into a credible or even convincingly incredible world. Now comes The Infinite Plan, and Allende's limitations as a novelist seem all to clear. The South American backdrop has been abandoned altogether; the novelist's own peripatetic life history - which has taken her from Peru where she was born through Chile and Venezuela - has brought her and her fiction to California, where the realities are different and the magic realities different again. The scheme is another family saga; the ambition is undoubtedly epic. The protagonist is Gregory Reeves, raised in the Hispanic quarter of Los Angeles as the son of a travelling evangelist, who ranges the western states in a dilapidated charabanc retailing his Infinite Plan of deliverance. The Reeves caravanserai attracts the exotic, the eccentric and the arcane, and gives Allende a perfect platform for some colourfully sketched vignettes and satirical observations on modern West Coast life. Yet the description and characterisation never raise themselves above the level of cliche and stereotype; the plot creaks, the motifs are reinforced with the subtlety of a steamhammer, and a novelistic struture that attempts two narrative streams running in parallel blurs into incoherence. The final message of The Infinite Plan - that life is great in the Great American Dream if you can only stick with it and win your struggle against adversity  -is sickeningly pat, and makes one despair that Allende can ever recapture the elegance and beauty of her first work, or transplant it successfully to a new environment.</p>

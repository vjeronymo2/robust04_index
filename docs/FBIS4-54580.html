			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans Van den Broek, European Commission </F> member for external political relations, by Josef Vesely in  Prague on 28 April: "The Requirements for Admission Into the  European Union Are Clear, Says the Belgian Commissioner"]    [Text] Prague--The criteria for admitting countries like  the Czech Republic into the European Union have been  sufficiently clear since the Copenhagen summit of the so-called  Twelve last June. This statement was made yesterday by Hans Van  den Broek, European Commission member for external political  relations, in an interview granted to MLADA FRONTA DNES  following a symposium organized by the Konrad Adenauer  Foundation and the Bohemia Foundation.    He added that the basic requirements for admission consist  of  stability in the institutions guaranteeing democracy, the  existence of a law-governed state, the observation of human  rights, protection for minorities, and the ability to come to  terms with the competitive pressures of the market within the  Union. The candidate must also identify with the aims of the  Union.    "We will no longer place new requirements on the candidates  from your region because you would consider this to be an  obstacle. And perhaps this would also bolster certain  nationalist and sectarian tendencies. Moreover, there is also  another side to the coin--the Union's further enlargement  depends on our ability to absorb new members at the appropriate  moment," said Van den Broek.    [Vesely] How do you perceive the obligation to identify with  the aims of the European Union?    [Van den Broek] Each country that wants to become a member  will be invited to sign a whole set of regulations, laws, and  obligations, including the Maastricht Treaty. This defines the  future of Europe. We also want to develop new spheres of  cooperation here. Among other things, we intend to establish a  monetary union and formulate common security and foreign policy.  Later, we should move on from coordinating defense policy to a  real common defense.    [Vesely] Of course, it may transpire that a specific country  will not want to commit itself so heavily.    [Van den Broek] If someone were to tell us that he has  difficulty in fulfilling this or that aspect and, therefore,  that, at the moment, he is only interested in the economic or  trade aspect, or, as the case may be, that he has not yet  sufficiently adapted his laws to those valid in the European  Union, then I believe it would be possible to reach an agreement  with him on conditional admission. A transitional period would  be determined, during which the issue would be resolved.  However, in no way would it be acceptable to us if a candidate  were not to adopt as his own the fundamental principles on which  the European Union is based. And it will not be at all possible  for him to refuse to share our final political aims, aims  derived from everything that has already been achieved.    [Vesely] What do you think of the suggestions to establish a  kind of intermediate stage that would bridge the period between  association and full membership?    [Van den Broek] Our immediate aim is to put into practice  everything on which we have already reached agreement. We will  certainly still have a great deal of work with this, especially  in intensifying the political dialogue. The European Union,  therefore, has proposed, for example, that a meeting be held  annually involving the heads of government, foreign ministers,  and, as the case may be, the policy directors of ministries. We  want to have joint working groups to deal with specific foreign  and security policy issues. Here, we are distinctly aware of the  common interest of the Czech Republic and the other Central and  East European countries, on the one hand, and the European  Union, on the other.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Russia pinpoints revenue loss: Health services abuse funds, regions fail to pay taxes Glaring abuses of state funds by health services and the withholding of taxes by a handful of big Russian regions were singled out yesterday as reasons for Russia's inability to honour expenditure commitments. A Finance Ministry report presented at a cabinet meeting to review the state of the economy said the government had simply slashed expenditure to make up for the failure to collect 40 per cent of tax receipts in the first half of this year. That figure in itself is encouraging given the fact that only 30 per cent of taxes were collected in the first quarter of 1994. One example of abuses of funds the government identified was that of medical institutions which had spent the money not on health care but on financing private business activities or buying cars instead of medical equipment. Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, two semi-independent republics within the Russian Federation, were the biggest non-payers of taxes among the regions, together withholding more than Rbs400bn, compared to the budget's total projected revenues of Rbs124,000bn. The credibility of the government's own promises to combine reforms with a fight against abuses has come into question following its recent decision not to abolish quotas on oil exports as promised from July 1. This crucial foreign trade reform, which would have increased tax revenues and removed a big source of corruption, was postponed until at least January 1995 without explanation. But reformers within the government and the president's administration blame the government's vulnerability to powerful vested interests, including the handful of companies currently enjoying exclusive export rights and those of officials who receive bribes in return for the allocation of quotas. 'This was too juicy a morsel to give up for certain interest groups,' explains Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Boris Yeltsin. At yesterday's meeting - missed by Mr Yeltsin, who was said to be suffering from a cold - Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin trumpeted the government's achievement in driving inflation down to 6 per cent in June, although officials have warned that it is likely to rise to double-digit figures by the autumn.</p>

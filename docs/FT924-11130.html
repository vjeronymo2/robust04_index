			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Paribas Paribas has certainly got its come-uppance. Yesterday's embarrassing offer to Italcementi and Mediobanca means the French bank has to hand back FFr500m of the FFr6bn it received for a controlling stake in Ciments Francais, as well as subsidising the French cement company's treasury operations. Less financial engineering and more attention to basics like due diligence is the obvious lesson. The proposed settlement clearly leaves a hole in Paribas' earnings, which in the absence of significant operating profits were always expected to be reliant on capital gains this year. While there may be other deals in the pipeline to fill the gap, the market would still be unwise to expect more than FFr1.5bn. Such disappointments may already be in the price, but the wider issue is the damage which the episode could do to Paribas' relations with international investors. It may be another sign that the portfolio strategy works well in a bull market, but that it is much harder to carry off with conviction in current market conditions.</p>

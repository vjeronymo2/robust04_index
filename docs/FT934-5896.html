			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield shares fall 26p after profits warning Shares in Burnfield fell by 30 per cent yesterday after the electric surface heating and industrial controls and measurement group issued a profits warning and said that Mr Ian Staples, chief executive, had resigned by mutual agreement with immediate effect. The West Midlands-based group's shares closed down 26p at 57p, a new low, after the board forecast a Pounds 500,000 second-half pre-tax loss and said it intends to cut the final dividend to 0.85p from 4.1p last year, making a total for the year of 2.5p (5.75p). The Pounds 500,000 pre-tax loss expected for the six months to December 31 mainly reflects Pounds 1.5m of non-recurring costs. The group reported a Pounds 1.27m pre-tax profit at the interim stage so full year pre-tax profits are expected to total Pounds 750,000. The second-half non-recurring charges include the costs of redundancies and reorganisation at Isopad, the surface heating business, and Budenberg, the measurement equipment business acquired in 1991. They also cover the withdrawal from a possible acquisition and management reorganisation costs including a Pounds 115,000 payment to Mr Staples. The group's main problems centre on the Budenberg pressure gauge and calibration equipment business which has been affected by low levels of demand in the UK and continental Europe since the first quarter, compounded by losses incurred through the introduction of a new range of pressure gauges. As part of series of management and board changes Mr Clive Snowdon, Burnfield's finance director, has been appointed managing director. Mr Brian McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings, remains non-executive chairman.</p>

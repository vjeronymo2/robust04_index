			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Homestake Mining silences its critics - The rapid recovery of North America's oldest gold producer How quickly times have changed for Homestake Mining, North America's oldest gold mining group. Today, some analysts wonder whether it will spend wisely the money it is earning or borrowing. Two years ago, some of the same analysts worried about its losses and its debts. At that time, Homestake refused to follow the example of most Australian and North American precious metals groups and hedge its production, in spite of a steadily falling gold price and even though selling its gold at the spot market price was barely profitable. Homestake merged with Corona, a Canadian gold group, in July 1992. This made it one of the world's biggest gold producers - with operations in Australia, Chile and Mexico as well as North America - but Corona brought with it a big burden of debt. Corona was a relative newcomer to the gold scene, run by speculators. Critics of the merger said there was no way the corporate cultures would mix. They predicted disaster. Mr Harry Conger, Home-stake's chairman, can be forgiven for smiling when he says results from the Corona merger are better than expected. Corona had more debt than it could afford. Homestake's production costs were too high. But putting them together enabled Homestake to absorb Corona's USDollars 227m of long-term debt and have relatively modest gearing. Mr Conger emphasises the merger did not bring the Corona management style with it. 'Corona had two management styles, one at board level, one at the operating level. We brought in only operating people.' For example, Corona hedged a great deal of its production but Homestake sticks firmly to the view that its shareholders do not want it to hedge. However, as half Homestake's gold is sold outside the US, Mr Conger believes it is reasonable to protect the company by hedging against severe swings by Canadian and Australian dollars against the US currency. One big benefit from the merger was that it brought Homestake the services of Mr Peter Steen and his team from Corona. They brought with them 'new eyes, new approaches' that have helped to turnround Homestake's fortunes. Even at the 150-year-old Homestake mine in the Black Hills of Dakota, where they have gone down 8,000 feet to dig out the gold, the new approach is working. Mr Conger is devoted to the mine but he would not tolerate losses for ever. Mr Steen closed some of the marginal areas. The workforce was reduced to less than 1,000 from 1,400 five years ago but output increased. In 1992, the Homestake mine produced 397,000 troy ounces of gold at a full cost of Dollars 337 an ounce. Last year it produced 448,000 ounces at Dollars 288 an ounce. 'Homestake is still the company's biggest single gold producer and gives the biggest operating profit,' Mr Conger points out. The Homestake group's costs have come down. Last year's 1.9m ounces were produced at a cost of Dollars 282 an ounce, down from Dollars 303 in 1992. Cost-cutting and a gold price rise put Homestake back into the black in 1993. Net income was Dollars 52.5m against a Dollars 175.8m loss in 1992 and a loss of Dollars 261.9m for 1991. Group management has been restructured and simplified. The gap left by Mr Steen's recent departure at short notice to become president of Lac Minerals, the beleaguered Canadian mining group, was quickly plugged. Mr Jack Thompson was appointed president of Homestake and, meanwhile, Mr Conger at last set a date for his retirement - early in 1996. Now, he says, the most important task for Homestake is to add new long-life gold reserves with lower total costs than present production. Although Homestake is relying on exploration success to secure its long-term future, it has sacked geologists, closed exploration offices and cut the budget. Homestake previously spent about Dollars 30m a year and Corona Dollars 6m on exploration. But Mr Conger admits Homestake has not been particularly successful since finding the McLaughlin mine in California in the late 1970s. So the approach has been changed. The combined exploration teams of 260 people have been reduced to 120 and, instead of having several site offices, there is a centralised exploration team in Reno, Nevada. The budget has been cut to Dollars 15m in North America and Dollars 3m in Australia. 'The idea is that, when prospects are identified, promising projects will get extra money,' says Mr Conger. Homestake just might have struck lucky again at its Eureka property in Nevada. Preliminary drilling indicates there is gold along a 37-mile strike and some tests show very high grades. Homestake expects to have its Eskay Creek polymetallic mine in British Columbia in production by the end of 1994 to produce about 210,000 ounces of gold and 9.4m ounces of silver annually for 10 years. Corona was involved in a bidding war for Eskay and in 1991 and 1992 wrote off Dollars 176m on the project. Homestake has had better luck. The capital cost of bringing Eskay into production has been cut by Dollars 150m to Dollars 60m because it has been found the ore can be sent directly to smelters for processing rather than being upgraded into a concentrate (an intermediate material) at the mine site. Mr Gene Elam, Homestake's chief financial officer, says the group has Dollars 200m cash and a line of credit for Dollars 150m. Total debt is Dollars 185m but there are no debt repayments until 2000. The present gold price provides Homestake with annual free cash flow of about Dollars 90m a year, so it should soon be free of net debt. The dividend has been doubled to 20 cents a share, a level shareholders have not seen for several years.</p>

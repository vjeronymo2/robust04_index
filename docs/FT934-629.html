			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Borden denies talk of merger Borden, the US food and chemicals group, yesterday denied that it was engaged in any discussions concerning a possible sale or merger. Early this week speculation about such a proposal surfaced in the US press. Hanson Industries, the US arm of the British conglomerate, was reported to be considering a Dollars 3.2bn offer for Borden, which has suffered from declining profits and shrinking market shares for its diverse range of products in recent years.</p>

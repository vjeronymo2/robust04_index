			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Clinton favours a strong dollar: Incoming US administration flies conservative fiscal colours A STRONG dollar and a relatively conservative fiscal policy seem likely to form a central part of the Clinton administration's strategy for improving long-term economic performance. 'I'm for a strong dollar,' declared President-elect Bill Clinton during a debate about exchange rate policy at the economic conference in Little Rock, the capital of his state of Arkansas. Mr Clinton, however, added the proviso that the dollar could be strong in the long term only if supported by 'the underlying competitive reality of our economy'. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary designate, said he wanted the US to 'reinvigorate' the Group of Seven club of leading industrial countries and help find ways of stimulating growth in Europe and Japan. But he signalled that the US would not have credibility abroad unless it put its fiscal house in order. Mr Clinton's remarks on the dollar were a response to Professor Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who urged a substantial devaluation of the dollar against Asian currencies over the next three years. Mr Dornbusch said financial markets were likely to anticipate a stronger dollar as the US economy recovered but that 'we cannot afford that'. Mr Dornbusch said a devaluation against Asian currencies was as necessary today as was the devaluation of the dollar against European currencies in the 1970s following the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system. Mr Clinton, however, seemed to lean towards the position of another speaker Mr Jeffrey Garten, a professor at Columbia University, who said a weak dollar was a 'quick fix that doesn't work'. Mr Garten pointed to the example of Germany and Japan as countries that remained competitive despite long-term currency appreciation. Mr Bentsen seemed unimpressed by a call from Prof James Tobin, the Nobel laureate from Yale University, for a fiscal stimulus of Dollars 60bn a year for the next two years. 'I've become much more sympathetic to the executive arm of government recently,' he said. Mr Robert Rubin, nominated as head of the new White House National Economic Council, pointedly asked Prof Tobin what impact a big fiscal stimulus would have on business confidence and long-term bond yields. Most financial market analysts fear the impact would be negative on both counts. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director designate, said Congress 'loves to pass the sugar but hates the vinegar'. Any fiscal stimulus thus had to be tied into a long-term deficit reduction programme. Mr Clinton said reducing the growth of health care costs was the key to long-term deficit reduction. This had to be a priority in the first six months. On regulatory and environmental policy, Mr Clinton said: 'my strong preference is for market incentives over command and control.' He added that he did not intend to 'micro-manage' the economy, having been on the receiving end of oppressive federal regulations as a state governor. 'I know what it is like to be governed.'</p>

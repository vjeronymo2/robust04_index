			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, Hamas representative in </F> Lebanon, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given]    [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] There were reports recently about the  existence of an Islamic-Islamic dialogue in which you were  involved. What is the dialogue about and has it had any results?    [Al-Liddawi] The Palestinian problem is going through its  most critical phases at present. Years of suffering and  sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our Palestinian  people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored and there is  no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream of returning  to the homeland and establishing their independent state on all  the national soil.    Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great  sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the  squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to  protect our people's right to their territories and homeland.  The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult  all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to  discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was  not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal  to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated  squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be  involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot.    [AL-SHIRA'] With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas meeting?  How do you justify the methods followed, specifically those in  Egypt and Algeria?    [Al-Liddawi] As written in its charter, Hamas believes that  Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it belongs to all  Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and to all Muslim  generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden of liberating  it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims.    On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid  ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to  liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's  legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the  Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine.  Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the  Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences  with some of them over ideas and ideologies.    As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas  policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is  based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the our  Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same  time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to  the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of  them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and  deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to  plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences.    [AL-SHIRA'] You stand accused of impeding the work of the  Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of an  alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad  relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one  of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied  territories?    [Al-Liddawi] Everyone knows that Hamas was the first to come  up with the idea of bringing the 10 Palestinian groups and other  forces that reject the settlement process together for the sake  of joint Palestinian action. We are serious about heightening  the Palestinian groups' action and developing their methods of  political confrontation in order to abort 'Arafat's defeatist  policy. We made several proposals when we started the move for  a framework of a Palestinian forces' alliance. We presented  serious ideas in several working papers but we met many selfish  and subjective obstacles from some groups. The delay in  reaching agreement on the alliance was probably caused by these  groups' study of the plan and not Hamas.    Regarding the issue of electing a leadership that would act  as an alternative to 'Arafat, we believe that we must first have  more jihad work to abort the liquidationist plan while  simultaneously embarking on a gradual rebuilding of the PLO  institutions. We agreed on this with the other groups. I do  not think that we disagree with those who say that the  Palestinian people need a wise leadership that will save it from  this gloomy fate, but at the same time we want to rebuild the  PLO institutions gradually rather than leap into the unknown.    The reports that the reason Hamas has no desire to elect an  alternative leadership to 'Arafat and is opposed to holding  elections outside the occupied homeland for that purpose is  because it fears that it will not get very much support outside  the territories are not true. Hamas has no fear about this  because its increasing influence inside Palestine is the same as  its influence outside. Though it does not have an  organizational framework abroad, Hamas is still capable of  having an effective popular and organizational presence. This  only requires a clear organizational decision to publicize all  Hamas members and supporters abroad and overnight we would  become the strongest Palestinian organization inside and outside  the territories. But we reject partial elections. We are  seeking comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian  people, wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal  elections that do not bring the best for our people or which are  held through popular conferences where the conferees are not  allowed any freedom of opinion.    As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained  by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to  discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media  and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do  not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an  end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will  embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of  us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The  DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis  of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are  both going through such difficult times.    [AL-SHIRA'] You are part of an alliance of Palestinian  groups. However, the narrow and self-promoting tactics you  followed when election lists were being prepared for the  formation of Palestinian institutions inside the homeland led to  wins by 'Arafat's supporters. Are you going to continue these  tactics? And, how will this affect other Palestinian groups  opposed to 'Arafat?    [Al-Liddawi] This is completely untrue. Hamas is fully  committed to furthering its alliance in the elections in all  syndicates and electoral constituencies. We have already won  elections in many institutions in alliance with other  Palestinian groups. Hamas has never followed any self-defeating  self-serving tactics. Maybe others did, but not us. Hamas has  long suffered from such practices and sees them as detrimental.  There are many indications of this. In an effort to reinforce  our alliance, we call on our brothers in other Palestinian  groups to coordinate openly with us in all matters concerning  elections. This will strengthen us and help us defeat 'Arafat,  his supporters, and their capitulationist line.    We and other Palestinian groups have agreed to act as equals  within the framework of our alliance. We are all politically  equal. There is no difference between one group and another. No  group is entitled to veto another. Everyone has the right to  express their own views. Each of us has its own vote, and  decisions are made on the basis of consensus, not majority.    As for the elections, Hamas is ready to merge its lineup  with  like-minded Palestinian groups in any location. Every group  will get as many seats as justified by its representation and  any prior agreement. But Hamas is the only active group in  several areas, and it is only logical that we should run on our  own in such cases.    [AL-SHIRA'] Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger a  Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The elements  of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid this  scenario?    [Al-Liddawi] As I said in my last answer, we seek closer  coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously with  other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We want  to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want to  contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the joint  coordination committee. We should not pay attention to press  reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on the  fire.    With more understanding, coordination, and working together,  we will avoid becoming a second Kabul. We have to remember that  the enemy is doing everything it can to foment sedition and  trigger infighting among us.    [AL-SHIRA'] There were attempts to initiate a dialogue  between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.  How far have these attempts gone?    [Al-Liddawi] There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat until he  withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the Oslo  agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat following  his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo agreement.    But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members  inside  the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any  further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the  two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the  struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every  possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs.    [AL-SHIRA'] You have been equated with the Zionist  hardliners  who reject the negotiations. Could you respond to this?    [Al-Liddawi] Where and how are we equal? We are endeavoring  to regain our usurped rights in Palestine, all of Palestine, and  we are using all legal and legitimate methods in our struggle  against our enemy for the sake of recovering our legal rights.    As for the Zionist hardliners, they are unjustly trying to  keep Palestine as their homeland. They are using all unlawful  means to achieve their designs and are being assisted in this by  the Zionist government.    Finally, we reject the existing negotiations, which are  bound  to forfeit all the Palestinian people's rights and waste all  their sacrifices from the long years of suffering and  persecution. God willing, we will continue our jihad and our  work until the occupation is driven from our land.</p>

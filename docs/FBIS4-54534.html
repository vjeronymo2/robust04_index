			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report to the Polish Sejm by Prime Minister Waldemar </F> Pawlak--live]    [Text] Mr Speaker: May it please the House! As you know,  thousands of enterprises, schools, universities, and private and  state companies worked yesterday. Millions of Poles, to the  best of their abilities and skills, were building our common  life. Really a lot of good things happened yesterday. However,  yesterday will remain the day of strikes and conflicts. I do  not want to assess reasons for this strike because I was brought  up in different conditions and with a different system of  values. That is why agreement, cooperation, goodwill, and  working together are closer to me then conflict. In my opinion,  competition is not about putting each other down and destroying  an opponent. Even during a time of conflict, it is possible to  be partners and not opponents.    Today's strikes are not only a political game. Behind the  majority of strikes, even those of manipulation, there are  difficult, often dramatic, situations of employees who  participate in them, although they would rather not strike.  There is a common opinion that strikes are organized in  strategic industries because that is where their effects are the  most visible and painful for the country. The fact is that  employees in those industries are not paid badly today. But  they think that the situation may change for the worse, they are  afraid of restructuring and redundancies, and they are worried  about the future. The government repeatedly stressed that our  main concern was to secure jobs. If anyone was threatening  redundancies, he was simply lying.    May it please the House! Let us ask now what caused the  current strikes.    A complete presentation of the current situation of the  state, of the reforms and plans for the coming years will be  presented to the House after the first six months of 1994.  Today, I would only remind you that results of the first  quarter of this year could be described as very good. We have  achieved the most dynamic growth in production in 20 years and  the lowest inflation in the past seven years.    Last year, after the introduction of preferences for  enterprises, which demonstrate income figures and reinvest this  income, we have the situation where it is profitable for  enterprises to pay taxes. As a result of this and other  changes, budget revenue went up 15 percent in comparison with  the first quarter of last year. In February of this year, in  accordance with the government's proexport policy, we had a  surplus in foreign trade for the first time in 20 months. In  the first quarter of 1994, the foreign currency reserves have  increased.    In connection with the government's debt-reduction policy  and  preferences for well-managed enterprises, a dramatic improvement  in efficiency can be observed. We achieved those results by  introducing and maintaining a certain financial regime. As you  know, we did not immediately abolish the excess wage increase  tax. We did not immediately implement other election promises.  But we increased the lowest old age and disability pensions.  We took care in securing budget revenue and, at the same time,  creating opportunities for investments.    On the other hand, decisions regulating custom duties and  discouraging smuggling and other economic crimes were important  for the government's economic policy. I hope the House will  share the government's opinion that careful modification of  policies without excluding the past positive trends, so  modification without shocks and leaps, also contributed to  positive economic results in the first quarter of 1994.    May it please the House! If all trends from the first  quarter proved to be permanent, it would mean that we are coming  out of the recession faster then the developed West European  countries. This would also mean that those people who up to now  have not yet felt it in their homes will feel it in the second  half of the year or next year. If one immediately adds that,  over the past two months, among other things, in recognition of  our economic achievements we have achieved a reduction of debts  in the London Club and agreement to a second stage of reduction  in the Paris Club, then probably no one will hold it against me  for saying that a dozen or so days ago, we had the full right to  be optimistic in looking at our future.    But good economic results do not come of themselves, nor  are they given once and for all. They can quickly be eaten away  and, worse still, squandered through, for example, economic  disorder. We have been brought face to face with just such a  danger. Strikes, particularly in the brown-coal power industry,  are today increasing the costs of using imported energy.  Tomorrow they may lead to the return of economic crisis, the  collapse of weaker enterprises, the squandering of what we are  already achieving at such cost.    Ladies and gentlemen deputies, may it please the House!  Solidarity at the turn of 1980-81 bore our common dreams of  democracy and a new system of government. Then came years of  tough trials and many disappointments. There are also many  things we cannot be satisfied with today, but times have changed  and Solidarity is not the same as it was then. We have  democratic institutions for resolving disputes and many legal  forms of vindicating one's rights, or convincing other people of  the legitimacy of one's own interests.    Why, in this situation, is the harshest form of protest  being  used? Why is the blow aimed not where people have the most  difficult lives but where it causes the greatest  disorganization? Why do the Solidarity leaders not want  negotiations as partners with the government? Why do they not  want talks along with the other trade unions, but organize...  [pauses] confine themselves mainly to drawing up sole  legitimate demands, attempting to humiliate the government, and  showing contempt for the remaining trade unions?    For many months now, negotiation teams have been operating  with the participation of the main trade unions, the employers,  and the self-governments. A number of agreements have been  signed--one can point, in particular, to housing construction  and health care. The only trade union not taking part in this  work is Solidarity, and maybe that is why there are such strong  protests because the representatives of that trade union are  simply not aware how far advanced the agreements and the search  for solutions are.    We do not want to present those solutions as the best and  the  only ones. We want to agree on them through consultations and,  on this, we want to build our program for the next years,  1995-97.    In the past few days, various emissaries are said to have  gone to workforces that want to work, with the order: Tomorrow  you go on strike. How are they so sure of their rights to  decide for others? Those people who censor and shorten  government communiques are behaving similarly, as if no room  could be found for half a page, a page, or even two pages of  text presenting the government's position, among so many pages  undermining the government's position.    You can read the details in one of today's newspapers who  really would be hurt by that. It is a pity that the reality our  government faces means that my statement today in the House will  most probably not be published in full anywhere.    In a television program a few days ago, one of the young  strike organizers said that a change of the Sejm law was not a  problem; it was just the matter of coming into agreement here.  That was the case in Poland when the democratically elected  Sejm and senate did not exist and when a lot had to be changed,  although, even then, not everything had to be destroyed.    Today we are wiser because of our experience, and we should  protect democracy even before ourselves. We should defend Sejm  powers that are undermined by those representatives of strike  committees who think agreement between their committee and the  government is enough to decide matters that are within the  authority of the parliament.    Ladies and gentlemen! Saying this as one of you I cannot  help  being under the impression that we are responsible. May it  please the House! There are situations when it is difficult to  find a good solution. One of them is the way wage increases  should be controlled. We are looking for such a control system  that does not hinder the dynamics of economic growth and  improvement of the society's welfare and one that does not  threaten a return of inflation and a wasted opportunity for  coordinated development.    We know the dispute surrounding these matters as the dispute  about the "popiwek" and the "neopopiwek" [wage control] laws.  The government's position on this matter is as follows: The  government intended and still intends to abandon administrative  forms of wage control in the state sector by the end of 1994, at  the latest. During this period, we intended to bring in  different, more flexible forms of wage control, of increasing  the independence of enterprises in managing their own wage  funds. After President Walesa questioned the wage control act,  after my meeting with the leaders of 16 trade unions, and after  serious discussion, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers we  drew up the conditions under which the risk of managing [wage  funds] already in 1994 without such a law could be taken. Here  they are; the sequence is also a result of today's circumstances:    First, it is a question of joint responsibility, including  the trade unions, and a halt in particular to strike pressure  for wage increases.    Second, transferring wage negotiations to the work of the  tripartite commission, invested with very firm powers by the  Sejm law safeguarding the representative character of the trade  unions and the agreement... [pauses] the implementation of these  decisions through workplace collective agreements.    Third, the commercialization of enterprises, and therefore a  move to the formula of enterprises adapted to a market economy,  on the basis of the commercial code.    And even if there were strong arguments for taking the  courageous risk of abandoning the "popiwek," today those  arguments are overwhelmed by the situation we are dealing with  because the fundamental fear that a lack of statutory wage  control does not safeguard us from a spontaneous increase in  wages becomes a particularly strong argument in these  circumstances.    There are various versions of the wage control law. There  were, after all, very tough solutions, which led to a  stratification of incomes because small enterprises could not  afford to pay the "popiwek." There were those, too, that,  despite the very difficult economic situation, simply did not  pay the wage tax and increased wages.    Today, we have to deal with the fruits of this law. And now,  when the Sejm has introduced solutions wherein the law on the  control of wages relates solely to those enterprises in which  the state has 80 percent of the capital, more than 80 percent,  the law does not relate to the cooperative movement, does not  relate to enterprises in which the average wage is less than 75  percent of the national average. Very little is said of this.  And today, those who so consistently struggle against this  "popiwek" forget where they were during the time when the  previous law was in force, and where they will be when the lack  of this control brings about a still greater stratification of  incomes. What will they use to explain themselves to all those  who have maintained discipline, in many enterprises, so that  enterprises could develop, that they again remain behind because  the structure of the market quite simply does not allow them to  so quickly increase incomes as in those that have a structurally  good position on the market. In this situation, we acknowledge  that a quick forsaking of the law on wages control is associated  with a real return of, a real risk of a return of, inflation. A  return to excessive imports and the possibility of the  manifestation of other consequences that may disturb the rate of  growth that has been attained this year. An unprepared  forsaking of wage controls also threatens that which the trade  union leaders are aware of, an increase in unemployment and a  fall in real incomes. Will trade unionists today declare  responsibility for what will happen later, or will it again be  the case that the entire responsibility will fall solely and  exclusively on the government? That, too, is why we accepted  without opposition the initiative of a group of Polish Peasant  Party deputies bringing under consideration of the Sejm the law  on the control of wages. The Sejm speaker decided that it  should be considered under an accelerated procedure. The  government treats this law as a last resort that must be used if  needed for defense against the threat of inflation. It is not  appropriate to use it at a time when this threat does not exist.  Nonetheless, in light of the recent strikes, the government  does not intend to seek the suspension of the process of  introduction of this law. As I have already said, for the  period until the end of 1994--and I expect the acceptance of  parliament and the president. In the system of democracy we are  constructing, the government is responsible for the economic  development of the country.    May it please the House! One of the postulates is the demand  for the immediate introduction of the enterprise pact. This is  a demand addressed to the Sejm, which of course does not  immediately introduce anything.    Let me recall that it was as early as 4 November 1993 that  the government submitted the first five laws on the enterprise  pact. The two most important ones for employees generally have  already been passed. On 29 December, the law on the protection  of employees' claims in case of employer's insolvency was  adopted. On 4 March, the law on the enterprise welfare fund was  passed. Two other laws were considered by a Sejm extraordinary  commission. They are: the law on the financial economy of a  state enterprise and on the division of profit in certain state  treasury companies. As regards the fifth submitted law,  amendments to the labor code, the commission did not do any work  on it after the first reading.    The final law that belongs to the [enterprise] pact is the  law on privatization. This bill is to be considered by the  government in May of this year. In it, among other things, we  envisage the transfer of the ownership transformation initiative  to the enterprise bodies and administrative control over  decisions made in this respect. We have also been considering  the possibility of increasing the number of shares given free of  charge to employees, farmers, and fishermen. Does the protest  also concern these changes? Let us ask the employees directly.    This bill will be submitted to the Sejm in May. Who, then,  needs to be prompted out loud in the case of the enterprise  pact, which is directed at the government? Probably only those  who do not remember or do not wish to remember that, at the same  time, the government proposed and the parliament passed the law  on the indexation of old age and disability pensions, which  raised the lowest benefits; the law on the determination of  remuneration in the public sector; a number of financial laws  that guaranteed income for the state budget as well as  concessions to the investors. Generally, the coalition  government submitted 68 and the Sejm passed 26 new laws. Each  of these laws addresses certain needs; each of them is also a  subject of social scrutiny.    We are building the program for the years 1994-97 together  with the trade unions, employers, local governments. We are  also inviting solidarity to start our joint construction program.    People have the right to demand that restrictions be  abolished, but these very same people do not want to live on a  volcano. They expect the government to provide peace and  security and that tomorrow will be better than today. Our  government is in a position to implement such a program.  Consistency and prudence in the transformations are some of the  conditions.    Mr. Speaker, may it please the House! In a few days, we will  have another 3 May anniversary, the anniversary of the great  opportunity and the great tragedy.    There is a great opportunity before Poland. I believe that  we will not destroy it through unnecessary resistance and a lack  of ability to compromise. I believe that common sense will  prevail. I am convinced that the place of strikes and the  philosophy of who does what to whom will be taken by talks,  including talks at the tripartite commission, which are being  continued at this moment by the trade unions and representatives  of employers with the government. This is a commission we wish  to put on a statutory basis, a commission that will function  according to the principle of respect for partners and the  principle of representativeness. Let us reject mutual  reservations, and let us consider together what to do so as to  strengthen our achievements hitherto and resolve those problems  that still await resolution.    Ladies and gentlemen, before us we have a few days off--not,  fortunately, on account of the strikes. Before us we have  anniversaries that are important for our country. Although I  began my speech today with fear that yesterday was a day of  conflicts, I hope that this will also be the start of their  effective resolution. [applause]</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Craxi caught in cross-fire of Milan scandal THE effects of the two-month-old Milan corruption scandal, centring on pay-offs for public contracts being funnelled to political parties, have finally reached Rome and are likely to influence the choice of Italy's next president. At the same time the Milan municipal council is expected to resign as a result of the scandal, and an interim council of 'technicians' be appointed under Mr Giampiero Borghini, the socialist mayor. Milan magistrates are expected to decide this week whether to make a formal request to parliament for the waiving of immunity on Mr Carlo Tognoli, the outgoing Socialist minister of tourism, and Mr Paolo Pillittieri, returned as a Socialist deputy in the April 5 general elections. Mr Tognoli, mayor of Milan from 1976-86, and Mr Pillittieri, mayor of the city from 1986 until late last year, have been notified by magistrates that they are under investigation for alleged illegal receipt of funds. Both men have denied any wrong-doing. They are the most senior figures yet to be involved in the investigation and Mr Pillittieri is the brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader. Since the arrest on February 17 of Mr Mario Chiesa, a prominent member of the Socialist party and allegedly the central figure in a large municipal corruption network channelling funds to political parties, almost 20 people have been charged with corruption and abuse of office. Magistrates appear to be establishing an ever-widening network around Mr Chiesa, head of the Pio Albergo Trivulzio, the city's oldest charitable institution. With the arrest last week of two senior figures belonging to the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the charges of corruption now include the whole ideological spectrum. A former Christian Democrat party official has also been charged with corruption. However, the main political attention has focused on the Socialist party and its leader, Mr Craxi. Mr Craxi has long made Milan his power base and the city has been the show-case of post-war Socialist administration. The people now under investigation have all been closely connected with Mr Craxi. Even though the charges have not been proven, Mr Craxi's reputation has been badly damaged. Mr Eugenio Scalfari, the editor of Italy's largest selling daily newspaper, La Repubblica, and an old enemy of Mr Craxi, said over the weekend the Socialist leader was no longer qualified to stand either for the presidency or the premiership. Before the April elections Mr Craxi had seemed the person most likely to head the next government. In a damage limitation exercise, the Socialist party has appointed a special commission of inquiry into the activities of its Milan section. But if magistrates decide to press for charges against Mr Tognoli and Mr Pillittieri the damage will be hard to limit. Once a request to waive immunity has been placed before parliament, the process normally takes a month to consider.</p>

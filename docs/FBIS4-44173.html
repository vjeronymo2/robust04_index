			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in his </F> office, by Arlette Chabot and Alain Duhamel -- live]    [Excerpts] [Chabot] Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. We  are going to look together at the reports from our special  correspondents in Rwanda. I will, of course, ask you first of  all to tell us how you assess the beginning of Operation  Turquoise, is it going as you hoped, and it is slightly better  understood today, in your opinion?    [Balladur] I believe so. I believe so. Why did we decide to  launch this operation in Rwanda? Because the whole world, the  whole of France was moved, shaken by the pictures which we saw,  and it seemed to us that the French Government could not remain  indifferent or inactive, and thus that France, along with others  -- but with France taking the initiative -- should organize an  international humanitarian operation.    Having said that, it was necessary to take precautions in  order not to be dragged into what is a internal civil war in  Rwanda. That is why we established a certain number of  principles, which I outlined to the National Assembly: We are  there to carry out a humanitarian operation and for this reason  alone; we are there for a limited period of time; we are waiting  for reinforcements from other nations, and we hope that by the  end of July the United Nations will take over from us.    [Duhamel] A question everyone is wondering about in this  case  is that, since, as unfortunately everyone has seen, there have  been appalling massacres, and no doubt hundreds of thousands of  people have been killed, why were we not able to make this  decision earlier?    [Balladur] I believe it is better to have made it when we  did  than not to have made it at all. Obviously, we could have made  it earlier, you are right, Alain Duhamel, we could have made it  earlier, we could have made it sooner.    We made a certain number of contacts beforehand, but in the  end it appeared to us that we were going to have to set the  example, and this is what we did, but at the same time we had to  take precautions to avoid our soldiers being needlessly put into  dangerous situations. So, I repeat, there is no question of  their taking part in the internal fighting, there is no question  of their becoming a buffer force. They are there for a  humanitarian purpose for a limited period of time, and for this  alone, and I hope that the example which France is setting will  stimulate other countries around the world to ensure that others  quickly take over.    [Chabot] You say that in fact the French troops are not  there  to form a buffer force or to take part in the fighting, but what  happens if, for example, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  advances, takes Kigali, and in advancing they come extremely  close to the French troops. How are they to react?    [Balladur] We will review the situation at that time. I  would note one thing: The RPF which was very reticent -- not to  use a stronger expression -- with regard to the French  operation, has been saying for the last 24 hours that it  realizes that we are there for a humanitarian purpose, for a  humanitarian purpose alone, and that under these circumstances  it had fewer reservations -- I am not saying that it approves of  it, but that it had fewer reservations -- concerning the  operation which we are carrying out.    [Duhamel] Can one say that with regard to the question of  the  French humanitarian operation in Rwanda, there is complete  agreement between the president and the government, point by  point?    [Balladur] I spoke with the president about it, about 10  days  or so ago, I think, and we both agreed that there was good  reason for intervention, and we defined the mission together in  a perfectly precise way in order not to be dragged -- and this  was my express wish -- not to be dragged in any further than  necessary.    [Duhamel] A question which is often asked is that France --  and you are no doubt going to tell me that this was in the days  before your government, but in any case France had, let us say,  good relations with the previous government in Rwanda, and it  was the henchmen of this previous government who behaved in an  appalling manner. In your opinion, do we basically bear a  portion of indirect responsibility?    [Balladur] No, I do not believe so, and, furthermore one of  our first actions, 48 hours ago, was to go to the assistance of  the Tutsis, to clearly demonstrate that our goal was to carry  out an operation aimed at defending everyone. We do not want to  take sides with one against another.    [Chabot] Are not some people saying basically with regard to  this operation in Rwanda, perhaps we could do some thinking  about France's policy in Africa and what kind of cooperation we  should be giving? Does this in fact seem to you to be an  occasion for doing some thinking about that?    [Balladur] It is certainly an occasion for doing some  thinking, but, you know, things are clear and straightforward:  France aspires to be a world power. This is its ambition and  its pride, and I want it to maintain this ambition, and the main  sphere of its action is Africa, where, according to a tradition  which now dates back many years, it has a distinguished role to  play, especially in francophone Africa, so, because it is  Africa, because Rwanda is a francophone country, we could not  remain indifferent. However, we have to define and conduct this  operation in such a way that we are not dragged in any further  than we wish. [passage omitted]    [Duhamel] You have known Jacques Delors for a long time,  for at least a quarter of a century?    [Balladur] Yes, for a good 30 years.    [Duhamel] Do you think that he would be a fierce contender  for the candidate or the candidates of the majority, whether you  are one or not?    [Balladur] I do not have any judgement to pass on this.    [Chabot] Would you like him, for instance, to stay in  Brussels -- as some of the European Union [EU] do, the Greek  Government for instance, who yesterday asked him to do so  because there is a difficult succession problem? Do you think  that this is a good idea?    [Balladur] If I did, what conclusions would you draw and  which ulterior motives would you attribute to me?    [Chabot] About the EU...    [Balladur, interrupting] I believe that we have dwelt on the  subject at length.    [Duhamel] About Europe, there has been a summit. This summit  stumbled on one point, the election of Jacques Delors'  successor. Could they [changes thought] there were 11 countries,  including France, which agreed that the Belgian prime minister  should succeed Jacques Delors. There was one country, Great  Britain, which opposed this. Would it be conceivable to have  new conditions: one country against 11?    [Balladur] I cannot answer you just like that, Alain  Duhamel,  you will understand that. What is needed, I think, is for us to  reach a general agreement and I hope that each and every one  will be aware of what is at stake. The stake is that Europe  must not appear to be divided: People would not understand it.  There is a candidate, who received a very significant number of  votes. He is a very competent and valued candidate.    [Duhamel] The Belgian prime minister, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene.    [Balladur] This is all I have to say. I hope that this issue  will be settled on good terms, I do not like personality  conflicts on the whole. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed incorporating the above provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding temporary management in &sect;&sect;488.206, 488.210, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 488.215.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Denial of Payment for New Admissions As a Remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that a new &sect;488.217 be added to part 488  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to set forth denial for payment for all new admissions as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For all new admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, HCFA will and the State must deny payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the last day of survey identifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The survey agency has cited a facility with substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care on the last 3 consecutive standard surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the facility achieves compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility prospectively from the date that it determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that compliance has been achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Denial of payment for new admissions in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic categories or requiring specialized care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who have certain specified diagnoses or special care needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when HCFA or the State finds that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The facility is not currently able to provide care for these individuals; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Caring for these individuals will adversely affect care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to other residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the facility achieves compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility prospectively from the date that it determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that compliance has been achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Directed Plan of Correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A) permit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary and the State, respectively, to provide for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified remedies. At &sect;488.224, we proposed adding a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directed plan of correction as a remedy in which a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be required to take action within specified timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the plan of correction developed by HCFA, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency, or the temporary manager (with HCFA or survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency approval).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The directed plans of correction would set forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected correction actions which the facility must take to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve compliance and the dates by which the actions must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Use of State Monitoring As a Remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;&sect;488.206 and 488.222, we proposed that, if State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring is used as a remedy, State monitors would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be onsite as frequently as necessary to oversee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the correction of specific deficiencies cited. This remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differs from traditional revisits by the survey agency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that State monitors are onsite, as necessary, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections are being made, as opposed to a revisit which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs after corrections are completed, and serve to confirm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the deficiency has been removed. We said that State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring must be used as a remedy when a survey agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited a facility with substandard quality of care on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last three consecutive standard surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that individuals serving as State monitors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to be employees or contractors of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State survey agency, and maintain professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications needed to address the specific nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies. The State would be responsible for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the monitors are appropriate health care professionals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A State monitor could not function as a consultant to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility nor could the State monitor be an employee of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. We concluded that a monitor serving as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultant to a facility would potentially put the State in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a situation of defending the monitor's recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than making the facility responsible for correcting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its deficiencies. Additionally, a monitor employed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and working for the State would constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Civil Money Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At &sect;488.230, we proposed allowing civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties to be imposed for noncompliance regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not the deficiencies constitute immediate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious threat to resident health and safety. However, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed at &sect;488.230(b) that civil money penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be imposed during the pendency of a hearing on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition of that remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

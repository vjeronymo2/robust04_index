			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SWIM COACH FACES SEX CHARGES  </P> <P> A children's swimming coach who met a 13-year-old girl on a so-called telephone  "talk line" faces six felony charges of sexual misconduct with a minor,  officials said.  </P> <P> Joseph Patrick Pennels, 27, a longtime coach of the Moreno Valley Marlins swim  club, was charged last week with six felony counts of lewd and lascivious acts  with a child under 14, Riverside County Assistant Dist. Atty. Guy Pittman said.  </P> <P> Each charge carries a maximum penalty of three, six or eight years in prison.  Pennels has pleaded innocent.  </P> <P> The girl's mother contacted police late in November after she discovered her  daughter missing from home late one night and found a letter in the girl's room  that led her to believe she was having a physical relationship with Pennels.  </P> <P> The Moreno Valley Marlins is a private swim team for youngsters 5 to 18 years  old. The team competes in the San Gorgonio swim league. Pennels resigned this  month "for personal reasons," team spokesman Chris Jones said.  </P></p>

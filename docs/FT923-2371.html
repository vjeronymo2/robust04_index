			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Camdessus predicts a strengthened EMS MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, predicted yesterday that the European Monetary System would emerge strengthened from the crisis of the past few days. But he blamed unbalanced German policies for the underlying strains in the currency markets. 'Too much of a burden' had been placed on the German monetary authorities and 'not enough emphasis put on budgetary instruments,' he declared. Mr Camdessus did not criticise Britain, which he praised for having taken vigorous steps to reduce inflation. 'I would not say that I am pressing for any kind of adjustment effort for Britain.' Taking a broader view, Mr Camdessus said the root cause of turbulence in foreign exchange markets was excessive reliance on monetary, as opposed to budgetary, policies. 'If we have problems, it is because we have delivered only half what we promised to do,' he added, in a reference to US as well as European economic policy. Leading countries should not use evidence of a 'hesitant' world economic recovery as an excuse for delaying action to reduce budget deficits. Strong, immediate steps to consolidate budgets were an urgent priority. Vigorous action to liberalise labour markets was also needed if resumption of world growth was to bring about significantly higher employment. He took a resolutely optimistic view of likely developments in the EMS, as did Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs. 'No one wants to see turbulence in currency markets, because it can have spill-over effects into other financial markets if it's not addressed. It has been addressed,' Mr Mulford said. It was hard to judge the effectiveness of the combined lira devaluation and German interest rate cut agreed last weekend, because the turmoil in foreign exchange markets in the past week had been exacerbated by the prospect of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, due on Sunday. 'I think the actions taken in Europe in the past 24 hours have been the right ones because, in a sense, they suspend judgment on those issues until we can pass this event, and they take the pressure and the tension out of the system.' Mr Mulford said the dollar's revival since the weekend showed that its earlier weakness was purely a residual effect of European tensions, not a judgment on the fundamentals of the US economy. 'The present level of the dollar is one at which the United States is competitive,' Mr Mulford added. Mr Camdessus praised European Community ministers for unanimously restating their commitment to the EMS. With this decision, 'the system has once again demonstrated its remarkable resilience.' It was encouraging that countries had reacted flexibly and co-operatively to foreign exchange turmoil and had not resorted to exchange controls. The latest strains did not imply that the EMS should revert to its pre-1987 rules of operation when relatively frequent adjustments of parities were normal. Rather, they illustrated the advantages of moving ahead towards greater economic and monetary integration.</p>

Beside him two other generals and a captain  of the Russian Army have received notices from district  authorities to vacate the apartments they are occupying. In  this connection the commander of the North-West Group of Troops  has sent a letter to the prime minister of Latvia.    The letter stresses that the ultimatum demand to vacate  apartments containing a threat to use force, is especially  characteristic of two Riga districts. All these apartments  belong to the Russian Defence Ministry Residential Foundation  and their further use is a topic to be discussed at talks  between the two countries.    One of the notices has been signed by head of the Vidzem  District of Riga Andreis Ruchs, who had organized a scandalous  action against two generals a month ago. The Latvian Government  had relieved him of his post. But he has been once again  nominated to this post by deputies of the district. That is why  the republican prosecutor's office has asked parliament to  permit a criminal case to be lodged against him. But it turned  out that Sejm (parliament) does not have the judicial right to  do so.    That is why, while discussing the prosecutor's request, Sejm  would rather send a letter to the commission and recommend it to  prepare amendments to the law on the deputy status. Until then  Ruchs and his followers will remain free to add other Russian  generals to their list, who in their view, are liable to be  deported from Latvia.</p>

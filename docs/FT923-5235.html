			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Letter: Mrs Quayle and 'real' options for women Sir, At the Republican national convention, Mrs Marilyn Quayle stated that though a career was a real option, 'most of us love being mothers or wives, which gives our lives a richness that few men or women get from their professional accomplishments alone'. ('Discordant tones over family values', August 21). Has it occurred to Mrs Quayle that many women with, dare I say careers, lest I be labelled a feminist, do not have a choice as to whether or not they work? For some women it is an actual financial need. Where is it written that being a mother, a wife and a professional are mutually exclusive? Please do not speak for all of us, Mrs Quayle. You may represent a majority of the women on Walton's mountain, but I hardly think you represent all American women in 1992. Eileen M O'Connor, 20 Edgewood Road, Glen Ridge, New Jersey 07028 USA</p>

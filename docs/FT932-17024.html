			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National establishes mortgage insurance offshoot ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender, yesterday disclosed that it had established a captive insurer to provide its mortgage indemnity insurance. Abbey last month announced its intention to write its own mortgage indemnity insurance. It has established a subsidiary, Carfax Insurance, in Guernsey with working capital of Pounds 10m. It will be managed by Willis Corroon Management. Abbey was now starting talks with re-insurers. It was confident about the outcome, and there was no question of returning to previous arrangements for mortgage cover, held with a panel of insurers. The move marks the first break with traditional insurers by a large mortgage lender as a result of the re-negotiation of mortgage indemnity terms over the past year. Insurers have both raised rates and made terms more restrictive. Mr John Bayliss, deputy chairman, said the company had been offered terms which were 1.5 times as expensive by its panel of insurers and which provided only 65 per cent of the cover under traditional mortgage indemnity terms. He said Abbey would not charge its traditional commission on mortgage indemnity cover payments made by borrowers, and therefore the amount available to provide cover on its properties would rise by 30 per cent. 'This will give us a competitive edge because we will be able to look at our own book and possessions and balance our cover. It will be cheaper in the long term,' he said. Mr Bayliss said that Carfax could be made into a close company in two or three years time if a foreign insurance company entered the British scene offering better terms than the traditional mortgage insurers. A number of building societies have also made inquiries about establishing captive insurers to replace traditional contracts. But they are limited because they are barred from owning more than 15 per cent of a non-life insurer.</p>

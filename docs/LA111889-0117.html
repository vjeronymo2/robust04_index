			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS PLANNING TO RESTRICT DUAL TRADING  </P> <P> The federal agency that regulates the nation's futures exchanges said Friday  that it will ask those exchanges to restrict the controversial practice of dual  trading.  </P> <P> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also released its long-awaited study  of dual trading, which involves traders who execute trades for themselves and  their customers on the same day.  </P> <P> The study found that dual traders are not "a critical ingredient in providing  liquidity and low-cost trade execution."  </P> <P> Critics of dual trading, which is not illegal, claim that it poses  conflict-of-interest problems for traders who might try to make a profit  trading for themselves ahead of their customers.  </P> <P> This practice, known as front-running, is banned.  </P> <P> Front-running is among the many fraud schemes alleged in the indictments of  more than 40 traders at the nation's two-largest futures exchanges in Chicago  this past summer.  </P> <P> Based on the study, as well as on the Chicago indictments, the CFTC said its  staff was preparing "proposed rules that would require exchanges to restrict  dual trading on a provisional, phased-in basis."  </P> <P> CFTC Chief Economist Steven Manaster said, however, that developing those rules  "will be a lengthy process."  </P> <P> Legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending before Congress.  </P> <P> "Dual trading exists in all markets," the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said in a  prepared statement, adding that the exchange "after its own study, has proposed  to deal with any real or perceived problems with dual trading through the  enhancement of the audit trail. Both the House and Senate have also adopted  this approach."  </P> <P> An audit trail is an anti-fraud device to reconstruct a trade to determine when  it occurred and who was involved.  </P> <P> "We will review the CFTC's report on dual trading and make comments to any  proposed rules at the appropriate time," the CME statement concluded.  </P> <P> Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified  price at a certain time in the future. Futures contracts are used by producers  of such commodities as soybeans or gold to lock in a favorable price down the  road.  </P> <P> And speculators, in turn, buy and sell those contracts to profit from  constantly changing price differences.  </P> <P> Supporters of dual trading claim it helps keep trading costs down and keeps the  markets liquid when there is little trading, especially in small, low-volume  markets.  </P> <P> "It had been argued that dual traders might be superior providers of liquidity  or that dual traders might be superior in terms providing customer service and  on that basis were kind of super traders -- they were absolutely essential to  whatever was going on in these markets," Manaster said.  </P> <P> But he noted that the 47-page study, conducted by the CFTC's Division of  Economic Analysis, found that the "vast majority" of dual traders tend to  specialize in trading either for themselves or for their customers. Dual  trading is really a sideline for most floor traders, constituting only about  10% or less of their business.  </P> <P> The study also found that:  </P> <P> * There is no statistical support for claims that dual trading increases in  low-volume months;  </P> <P> * Dual traders "do not, on average" get better quality trades for their  customers than brokers who trade only for customers.  </P> <P> * Dual traders do not help make the market any more liquid than "exclusive  traders," or those who don't engage in dual trading.  </P></p>

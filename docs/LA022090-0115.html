			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 DEAD IN FLOOD-BATTERED SOUTH; MORE HEAVY RAIN MAY BE COMING  </P> <P> Flooding continued Monday across the South, with at least six deaths blamed on  high water, and about 7,000 residents of east-central Illinois at Champaign  remained without electricity after snow and ice storms knocked out power lines  last week.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said that a new round of storms, possibly  producing heavy rainfall, could reach the South by Wednesday, with a threat of  more flooding.  </P> <P> Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes in Mississippi,  Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina.  </P> <P> The floods since late last week have been blamed for six deaths in Georgia,  Mississippi, Alabama and North Carolina. One man was reported missing Monday in  Georgia.  </P> <P> In Copperhill, Tenn., raw sewage from a storm-damaged waste treatment plant  bubbled in the streets of the flood-ravaged old mining town of 418 people on  Monday, forcing families to boil their drinking water. The mayor imposed a  dusk-to-dawn curfew for the third day to prevent looting.  </P> <P> The rain-swollen Ocoee River rampaged from its banks Friday and inundated  Copperhill's business district with 8 feet of turbulent waters. The flood  swamped 34 homes and 50 businesses, 90% of Copperhill's business district, and  water rose to the second-story levels of some buildings.  </P> <P> Monday, business owners mopped mud from their stores, and some said they had  yet to decide whether to open again.  </P></p>

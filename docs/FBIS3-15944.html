			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a third reading the Riigikogu [parliament] has  adopted a law on collecting, registering, maintaining, and using  materials of foreign countries' security and intelligence  organizations which operated in Estonia, and which were put  together prior to 1 January 1992. The law deals with materials  both located in Estonia or removed from here, which contain  information about the local population's activities and  repressions, as well as materials dealing directly with foreign  countries' intelligence activities.    According to the law, these materials are the property of  the  State of Estonia. The collecting, registering, maintaining, and  using of intelligence materials are the tasks of the state  secretary and the archives department's director general.  Everyone has the right to familiarize themselves with the  materials kept about them at the archives. Everyone who has  materials about foreign countries' intelligence services in  their possession must inform the archives department within  three months from the inception date on the law on intelligence  materials and hand them over by the date set by the department.    Enn Tarto, who presented the law and who is chairman of the  temporary commission investigating the activities of foreign  countries' intelligence and security services, told ETA that the  law regulates first and foremost the use of materials of the  former USSR State Security Committee and its subsiduaries, as  well as those of other countries' intelligence. According to  Tarto, the law will also protect people from incorrect quoting  and extracting material out of context. Tarto acknowledges that  even though Estonia made repeated applications for the return of  all intelligence materials removed from Estonia to Russia, the  return of such materials is possible on the strength of the  basic agreement on a mutual exchange of culturally valuable  articles concluded in 1993.</p>

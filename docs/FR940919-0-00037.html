			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, EPA views the following measure as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions in Telluride: Colorado regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan_Specific Regulations for Local Elements, II. Telluride Nonattainment Area,'' which requires continued implementation of local programs to control solid fuel burning devices, eliminate coal burning, and prohibit installation of additional solid fuel burning devices. The RACM (including RACT) provisions in the SIP are described further in the TSD associated with EPA's June 23, 1994 proposed rulemaking on this SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed rulemaking for the Telluride moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 32397). EPA has reviewed the state's documentation and concluded that it adequate justifies the control measure to be implemented. The implementation of Colorado's PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment plan for Telluride will result in attainment of the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is approving the Telluride PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plan's control strategy as satisfying the RACM (including RACT) requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also finds that the State of Colorado's December 9, 1993 submittal of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area meets the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Specifically, section II.B. of the State regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan-Specific Regulations for Local Elements'' provides that, upon the determination that the area has failed to attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS or make reasonable further progress (RFP), the following will be implemented: (1) 0.30 miles of dirt roads within the Town of Telluride will be chip-seal paved, and (2) either 2.0 miles of unpaved San Miguel County gravel roads at the Ski Ranches Subdivision or 0.75 miles of private dirt roads at the Hillside/Gold King Subdivision (each within the Telluride nonattainment area) will be chip-seal paved. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and regulation and concluded that they adequately meet the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. By this action, EPA is approving the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA announces a clarification to the Telluride moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area boundary, which is based on a legal description of the map outline of the area, as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Telluride nonattainment area begins at the intersection of Colorado State Highway 145 and the Telluride service area boundary, as it existed in 1991. The western edge of the nonattainment area until it meets Remine Creek is defined as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (10): Fresh sense of urgency - Unemployment 11 per cent of the workforce - it is not surprising that initiatives to tackle unemployment will play a key role in the economic debate in Denmark this autumn. Indeed, there is a new sense of urgency about the problem because there is no sign of the jobless total coming down through any cyclical upturn in the economy. Unemployment has been rising steadily over the past five years from 220,000 in 1987 and the hope was that this year would see the peak. But that now looks unlikely, not least because of the recent turbulence in international financial markets and its impact on leading trading partners such as Sweden and the UK. Predictions that next year's jobless total will fall to 285,000 now look too optimistic Many certainly feel that the government should be doing more to get unemployment down. The country now runs a substantial current account trade surplus, so it is felt there is more room for manoeuvre than there has been in the past. There is also an argument that the country has paid a substantial price for getting inflation down to the 2 per cent level, and that employment should now be given increased priority. In fact, the current thrust of government policy is not so much directed at new job creation as at the reform of the unemployment benefit system and at getting better value from the DKr40bn a year already spent on unemployment. A special committee, the Zeuthen Committee, has recently looked at ways in which the financing of the benefit system might be reformed. At present, the state pays two thirds and employers and wage-earners the other one third. Without presenting it as a specific proposal, Zeuthen suggests that a new system under which the state, employers and employees each paid one third of the unemployment bill, might be better. This is certainly something which Mr Knud Erik Kirkegaard, minister of labour, would like to see. 'I want employers and employees to have more responsibility for the unemployment system,' he says. 'Then when they are bargaining over wages and working time, they know that the effect of their decisions could have a direct impact on unemployment and their payments into the system.' Neither the unions nor the employers totally reject reform of the current system, although both have made their support conditional. The unions say it must not leave their members worse off, so there have to be cuts in income tax. They also want reform to go hand in hand with a broader overhaul of active labour market policy. Employers, on the other hand, insist the measures do nothing to harm their international competitiveness. If reforming the finances of the system is one priority area, the other is activating the unemployed, either by finding them temporary jobs or through education and training schemes. This is because it is felt the jobless would stand a better chance of getting regular employment if they spent their time out of work actively rather than passively, and because some fear the current system does not provide enough incentive for people to find a job. Youth unemployment, in particular, is an area for concern because 20 per cent of the under-25s are either out of work or involved in training programmes. A recent report from the Social Commission, which looks specifically at the question of youth unemployment, proposes cuts in some benefit levels, to provide more incentive for young people to take up training or temporary jobs. At the same time, it says more trainee jobs and places within the educational system need to be provided. The government has already set up a number of pilot schemes to promote practical training and employment in the private sector, hoping to win broad-based political support for more permanent measures to be introduced next year. It is also planning specific investments in infrastructure which will be outlined in its 1993 budget. But it is not clear how much impact these measures will have on the overall unemployment total. Mr Kirkegaard is reluctant to commit himself to specific job reduction targets, saying that too many forecasts have proved inaccurate in the past. But he does believe it will be possible to create an average of 25,000 new jobs a year to bring unemployment down to about 130,000-150,000 by the year 2000. Many of those jobs will come in the service sector, he believes, catering to an increased number of pensioners, for example. The broader hope, however, is that recent upward pressure on the jobless total will subside naturally simply because the growth that took place in the size of the labour force in the 1980s will not be repeated in the 1990s. Indeed, the size of the labour force has already stabilised and it is expected to decrease later in the decade.</p>

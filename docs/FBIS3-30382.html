"I've heard he is fed up," Pieter van Wullften Palthe,  chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights told a press  conference. "We are all disillusioned but I hope it's not a  reason for giving up," Wullften Palthe said, adding that the  resignation could be announced during the commission's current  annual session, which started Monday.    Appointed in August 1992, Mazowiecki has prepared several  reports on human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia.  [passage omitted]</p>

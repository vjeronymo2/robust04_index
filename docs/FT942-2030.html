			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian directors face share register call The Securities Institute of Australia, representing professionals working in the nation's securities industry, has called on the Australian Stock Exchange to set up a register of directors' shareholdings 'so that the market can publicly track the stockmarket dealings of company directors'. Directors of Australian companies are now required only to notify the company involved if they buy or sell its shares, and there is no formal requirement for them to tell the stockmarket generally. The SIA is proposing that Australia follows the US model and places a legal obligation on directors to notify the stock exchange of any share dealings. The proposal is the latest in a series of moves by local fund-managers, the ASX, and other market professionals, aimed at improving the corporate governance and disclosure standards of the Australian market. Mr Kerry Packer's Sky Channel has signed an agreement with the Australian Jockey Club, allowing the former to beam Australian horse racing into Nevada casinos from next month. Mr David Dodds, Sky's managing director, said there will be a 90-day trial of the satellite broadcasts, and linked betting operations. Racing in the US ends in the early evening and the notion is that, because of the time difference, Australian races could take over.</p>

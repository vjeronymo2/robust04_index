			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of UN Security Council President on Replacement </F> of Fuel Rods Refuted"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The United Nations  Security Council, on May 30, according to a scenario which had  been worked out by some member states, published a statement of  its president groundlessly slandering the DPRK and containing  the unreasonable claim that the fuel rods must be replaced  strictly in compliance with the practical demands of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the opportunity of  selected separation and preservation of fuel rods might be lost.    This is entirely wrong for the security council, said a  spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea in a statement published on June 1.    If things were to take a correct track, the security council  should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters  of the agency secretariat, the spokesman said, and went on:    Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency  several times to take necessary measures such as its presence  and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of  inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty  as an international organisation. This was what some quarters  of the secretariat did.    The UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with the  DPRK, should have taken issue with some officials of the IAEA  Secretariat who laid huddles in the way of the DPRK's peaceful  nuclear activities, framed a sinister political intrigue to  shift the blame on to the DPRK and transferred the problem to  the United Nations.    If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft  of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable  attitude, we will no longer feel any need to be restricted by  such pressure.    It is more than intolerable that we have suffered from big  obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the  unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us  again, we will no longer fall a victim to the unreasonable  demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything.    This is the unshakable will of the Korean people, who regard  independence as their life and blood.    If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the  technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods  were gone or the UN Security Council put pressure on the DPRK,  threatening "sanctions" under that pretext, we cannot but take  decisive countermeasures, rather freeing ourselves from such  unreasonable restrictions than suffering from them, and we will  be left with no other choice but to go over to the continuous  process of the peaceful nuclear activities.    We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the  intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in  a peaceful way through dialogue. But we will counter without  slightest compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure  on us, ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.</p>

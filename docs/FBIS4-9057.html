			<p>BFN     [Text] Lityomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- In their  first one-hour meeting here today the seven Central European  presidents delivered only general opening speeches in which they  dealt with closing ties between the Central European countries  and their gradual integration into the European Union.    President Vaclav Havel told journalists that they would deal  later in greater detail with concrete political questions, such  as the former Yugoslavia or relationship to Russia. "This was  only the beginning, not the climax of the meeting. We will  carry on our discussions," Havel said.    He stressed the meeting did not mean that "we are colluding  against any one else or that we think we are better." The  meeting is only to express the closeness of cultural traditions  and history.    The meeting has brought together the presidents of Austria,  the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak  Republic and Slovenia.    German President Richard von Weizsacker said that Germany  wanted to help bring the region closer to Western Europe.    Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that if it appeared  that  integration into Europe was an illusion, it was necessary to be  striving for it on the Central European level at least.    Polish President Lech Walesa submitted the idea of "United  Nations of Europe". Pointing to the very differing levels of  individual countries, he proposed to make out a list of the  conditions of integration and to mark the conditions which  individual countries had already fulfilled. He came out in  favor of "seeking unity while specificities are preserved."    Hungarian President Arpad Goncz pointed out that regional  and  pan-European integration were complementary. He described  future Europe as "a large region" whose parts are at various  levels of development.    Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the purpose of the  Litomysl meeting was to promote trust among the participating  states which would contribute to "Central Europe becoming a zone  of greater stability and security than thus far."    He said the term of security was a "comprehensive" one and  mentioned fears of nuclear energy. Klestil said that nuclear  energy and particularly Austria's disagreement with the  construction of the nuclear power plant at Temelin, south  Bohemia, would be discussed "bilaterally."    He confirmed that Austria, if it becomes a member of the  European Union, would support other Central European countries'  effort to enter the Union.    The need to successfully solve the problem of ethnic  minorities in Central Europe was pointed out by Slovak President  Michal Kovac. He said conditions to eliminate this burden from  Slovak-Hungarian relations would be better in the wake of the  internal political changes carried out in Slovakia in March.  Kovac said this would help Slovakia join the European Union.    Havel said he strongly supported all integration processes,  irrespective of how they may be called. He stressed that the  present offered the first ever chance "for all [in Europe] to  live in peace and security."    Goncz said he had invited the presidents to a similar  meeting  in Hungary next year.</p>

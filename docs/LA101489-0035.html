			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK, ON THE RISE, DOWNS OAK PARK, 27-10  </P> <P> Oak Park High got a look at the future.  </P> <P> It wasn't a pretty sight.  </P> <P> Playing Friday night against perennial doormat Moorpark High, the visiting  Eagles were beaten, 27-10, in a Tri-Valley League game.  </P> <P> Surprising Moorpark is 5-1 overall, 1-0 in league play. Oak Park, which  finished second in league play last season, fell to 4-2, 0-1.  </P> <P> The Eagles can probably expect more of the same in years to come. Moorpark is  growing as a community, the high school is getting bigger and its football team  is likely to keep getting better.  </P> <P> "We lost our first game last week and people doubted we had the talent to play  with good teams," Moorpark quarterback Robert Hernandez said. "This was a big  game for us."  </P> <P> Hernandez led a balanced attack as he ran 16 times for 61 yards and completed  six of 10 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown. Running back Tony Upshaw rushed  15 times for 46 yards.  </P> <P> Eagle quarterback Mike Stern completed seven of 14 passes for 105 yards but  threw two interceptions. The remainder of Oak Park's offense was provided by  Kent Richter, who rushed 19 times for 69 yards.  </P> <P> The Eagles drove 50 yards early in the first quarter and Stern kicked a 27-yard  field goal for a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> The remainder of the first half resembled a track meet as Moorpark raced to  three scores.  </P> <P> First, Victor Magdaleno kicked a 32-yard field goal to tie the score.  </P> <P> Next, Hernandez drove the Musketeers 66 yards, completing passes of 28 and 17  yards. Jeff Cox, who finished with 10 rushes for 65 yards, scored on a one-yard  dive.  </P> <P> Oak Park couldn't move the ball, and on Moorpark's next possession, Cox broke  around right end for 26 yards. A few plays later, he scored again and Moorpark  led, 17-3.  </P> <P> A Hernandez interception in the third quarter led to Oak Park's only touchdown.  Stern ran six yards for the score.  </P> <P> Magdaleno kicked a 27-yard field goal and, on the ensuing possession, Oak Park  tried a flea-flicker that ended with wide receiver Jeff Gibbons throwing the  Eagles' third interception. Hernandez threw 10 yards to Tom Uphoff for a  touchdown to ice the game.  </P></p>

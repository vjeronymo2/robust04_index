			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Deficit on trade outside EC falls sharply THE UK'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Community shrank by Pounds 324m last month, according to official figures released yesterday. The deficit on visible or merchandise goods was Pounds 1.02bn in January, compared with December's record Pounds 1.34bn deficit. The last time there was a surplus on UK trade with non-EC countries - which accounts for less than half of total overseas trade - was in the fourth quarter of 1986. Imports and exports remained at historically high levels with the value of exports reaching a record Pounds 4.29bn in January. The value of imports at Pounds 5.31bn was the second highest level ever recorded. The record high was in December when import values were Pounds 5.44bn. The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items such as aircraft, silver and precious stones, also narrowed to Pounds 776m in January, from Pounds 1.04bn in December. The Central Statistical Office gave no figures for trade with the EC as a new system called Intrastat is being introduced for measuring intra-EC trade, in line with the single market. The CSO said it expected to present the first results of Intrastat towards the end of July. In December, the last month for which a full set of figures is available, the UK's visible deficit with the EC was Pounds 541m and with the whole world Pounds 1.88bn. Statisticians stressed that it was not possible to infer from the latest non-EC trade figures what was happening to trade in the community. The CSO said devaluation of sterling had yet to make much impact on exports. The government said in the Autumn Statement in November that it did not expect exports to benefit from devaluation until the first quarter of this year. In the three months to the end of January the value of exports to non-EC countries grew by 6 per cent, compared with the previous three-month period. Import values grew by 14 per cent. Trade volumes showed a similar trend. Last month import and export volumes reached record levels. A breakdown of trade by area shows that the UK has a negative balance of trade with all areas outside the EC except the oil exporting countries. The deficit on visible trade with the US and Canada widened to Pounds 182m in January from Pounds 123m in December. In the latest three months the deficit was Pounds 367m compared with Pounds 44m in the three months to October. The 'real' or constant price estimates of the UK national accounts and other economic statistics will be re-based on the year 1990 in August this year instead of 1985 as at present, the Central Statistics Office said yesterday. The re-basing is expected to add about half a percentage point to the estimate of growth of UK gross domestic product between 1986 and 1991.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES           Balance-of-payments basis seasonally adjusted (poundsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Excl oil &amp; erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991         44,477    53,884    -9,407    38,289    45,252    -6,963 1992         46,573    56,510    -9,937    40,522    48.187    -7,665 1992 Q1      11,288    13,618    -2,330     9,832    11,550    -1,718      Q2      11,641    13,898    -2,257    10,106    11,820    -1,714      Q3      11,556    13,678    -2,122    10,048    11,676    -1,628      Q4      12,088    15,316    -3,228    10,536    13,141    -2,605 1992 Jul      3,887     4,619      -732     3,379     3,882      -503      Aug      3,834     4,532      -698     3,307     3,890      -583      Sep      3,835     4,527      -692     3,362     3,904      -542      Oct      4,021     4,828      -807     3,470     4,175      -705      Nov      3,968     5,045    -1,077     3,454     4,314      -860      Dec      4,099     5,443    -1,344     3,612     4,652    -1,040 1993 Jan      4,296     5,316    -1,020     3,734     4,510      -776  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

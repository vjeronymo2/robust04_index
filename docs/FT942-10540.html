			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Unit trust sales help Pearl to Pounds 130m Pearl Group, the life and general insurer, achieved a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 130.3m for the year to end-December, helped by a steep rise in unit trust sales which offset a sharp fall in single premium business. Mr David Gordon, chief actuary, said the prime cause for the fall in single premium products was the closure of Pearl's intermediary sales unit, as the company focused on its core business areas of the home service operation - selling products through branches and home collection. The fall in new single premium business had a sharp impact on the total premium income of the ordinary branch business which fell from Pounds 942m to Pounds 786.4m . Industrial branch business held up rather better, slipping only from Pounds 203.2m to Pounds 195.9m. Mr Gordon said the group had made 'appropriate' provisions in respect of its possible exposure to compensation as a result of mis-selling of pension transfers. Pearl, a part of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, has a large share of the pension transfer market, with an estimated 50,000 cases. Total premium income fell to Pounds 982.3m (Pounds 1.15bn), with new single premium business dropping to Pounds 407.8m (Pounds 619.8m). New annual premium business stood at Pounds 107.1m (Pounds 109.7m). Profits from general insurance rose from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 21.3m while profits from unit trusts rose from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 6.3m.</p>

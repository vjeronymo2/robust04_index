			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NCAA PUTS MISSOURI BASKETBALL ON PROBATION  </P> <P> Missouri's basketball team was put on two years' probation today, banned from  the NCAA Tournament in March and hit with severe restrictions on recruiting and  scholarships.  </P> <P> About an hour later, the school announced that assistant coaches Bob Sundvold  and Rich Daly had both resigned, effective at the end of this season.  </P> <P> Haskell Monroe Jr., Missouri chancellor, said at a news conference the coaches  resigned voluntarily and that they would coach the current season because  "there have been enough disruptions in the program."  </P> <P> The NCAA said Missouri was guilty of major violations between 1985 and 1989  concerning recruiting, benefits for athletes and academic irregularities.  </P> <P> In addition to the postseason ban for the 1990-91 season, Missouri cannot  provide expense-paid recruiting visits during 1991; only one member of the  coaching staff can engage in off-campus recruiting and evaluation for 1991; and  the school can give only one basketball scholarship during the 1991-92 academic  year and no more than two in 1992-93.  </P> <P> Wednesday, the NCAA placed the Illinois basketball program on probation for  three years, including an NCAA Tournament ban next March. Also, the school is  banned from off-campus basketball recruiting and from paying for visits by  recruits to its campus the first year. The school also will be limited to  awarding just two basketball scholarships in each of the first two seasons of  the probation.  </P> <P> Chuck Smrt, NCAA director of enforcement, said the penalties against Missouri  were lighter because the school had no history of NCAA violations and accepted  responsibility for violations that were uncovered. Illinois was hit with NCAA  sanctions five previous times since 1967.  </P> <P> The probe began nearly two years ago into the basketball program of Norm  Stewart, who has a 552-273 collegiate record in 29 years and a 455-231 record  in 23 seasons at Missouri. He is the winningest Big Eight Conference basketball  coach, with 197 victories.  </P> <P> The NCAA announcement said Stewart "delegated many of his responsibilities to  his assistants, and neither the assistants nor the head coach maintained  records, checks and balances or identifiable processes for institutional  control, which could have been used to reconstruct their actions."  </P> <P> Sundvold and Daly were not named in the NCAA release.  </P> <P> The investigation began in February, 1989 after a tape-recorded conversation  became public between Sundvold and the mother of former Missouri player P.J.  Mays.  </P> <P> The next day, Stewart collapsed on the team plane en route to Oklahoma for a  Big Eight Conference game. He missed the rest of the season while undergoing  treatment for ulcers and colon cancer and Daly took over the team, directing it  to victories in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.  </P></p>

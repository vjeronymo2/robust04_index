			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tighter margins behind Pounds 55m deficit at British Steel LOWER DEMAND and continuing excess capacity worldwide lie behind yesterday's announcement by British Steel of a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for 1991-92, a 9 per cent fall in turnover, and a final dividend cut from 5.75p to 1.5p. The year ended March 28 was a testing one, said the company, with big reductions in selling prices in most product areas. Turnover fell from Pounds 5.04bn to Pounds 4.59bn, reflecting the lower prices, although deliveries of steel products were stable at 12.2m tonnes and exports from the UK rose from 4.9m tonnes to 5.6m. The overall effect on costs of inflation and exchange rates was virtually neutral, but severe price competition cut deeply into margins, more than offsetting the significant benefits from cost reduction and improved operating efficiency. Trading profit dropped from Pounds 323m to Pounds 17m but, after exceptional and other items, British Steel had a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss compared with a profit of Pounds 254m in 1990-91. Exceptional items of Pounds 100m (Pounds 192m) related largely to the closure of the Ravenscraig steel plant in Scotland but included a provision for future cost reduction measures. After tax and minorities, the loss attributable to shareholders was Pounds 34m, compared with a profit of Pounds 193m. Losses per share were 1.7p, against earnings of 9.65p a year earlier. In the UK, British Steel said, the economy was particularly weak, causing demand for the company's main products to fall 11 per cent to 9m tonnes. This represents a 22 per cent fall from the peak year of 1988-89. UK market share slipped last year to 56 per cent from 57 per cent in 1990-91. The cut in the final dividend reduced the annual pay-out to 4.5p (8.75p) and reflects uncertainties about the projected economic background and concern about the timing of the recovery. Sir Robert Scholey, chairman, reminded shareholders of his statement at the half-year stage that a marked improvement in trading prospects would be needed to keep an appropriate balance between operating cash flows, investment requirements, the cost of continuing rationalisation, the payment of dividends and the need to maintain a robust capital base. 'As yet,' he said yesterday, 'the timing of recovery in the UK is uncertain and any such recovery could be overshadowed by the reduction in demand in other major markets, especially mainland Europe, and the prevailing level of world steel prices.' Given the severity of trading conditions, he added, the preservation of cash was of great importance. Accordingly, the capital investment programme has been cut to Pounds 200m in 1992-93, with spending limited to finishing big schemes in progress, together with environmental and essential small schemes focused on cost-cutting with quick paybacks. On the outlook, the company said difficult conditions were expected to persist throughout 1992-93. While steel demand in the European Community was likely to remain flat, all producers recognised the need to improve selling prices. British Steel said it would continue to reduce costs, improve product quality, streamline further its management procedures and look to develop more attractive relationships between the steel mills, distribution outlets and customers. As for the balance sheet, the company said it remained strong. Net borrowings at the year-end were Pounds 11m, against net funds of Pounds 342m at the start of the year. The movement of Pounds 353m included capital spending of Pounds 255m (Pounds 459m in 1990-91).</p>

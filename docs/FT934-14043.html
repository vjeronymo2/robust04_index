			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Do It All Yesterday's statement from W H Smith and Boots on the future of Do It All had the feel of a holding action. Perhaps that was inevitable, given that press chatter was in danger of crowding out reality. Yet since discussions about closing sites or assigning leases to others are at an early stage, the vagueness on the cost of rationalisation leaves many questions unanswered. There seems little alternative but to wait and see, since Do It All is hardly going to compromise its negotiating position with potential buyers by going public at this stage. Nevertheless, with many sites on long leases, the costs of disposal could well be considerable. They are clearly high enough to rule out the pain of total closure at this stage. On the other hand, the increased spend on converting more stores to the new trading concept is welcome. Both partners are now prepared to back their faith that part of the chain can be made viable with some new cash. At the previous rate of roll out, the new trading concept was in danger of becoming an old trading concept before half the stores had been converted. But the rest of the do-it-yourself market is hardly going to stand still while Do It All fiddles. The so-called category-killing retailers in the US have made their way by combining price and range with service, a trend which will catch on in the UK. Do It All's recovery still turns on the questionable assumption that it can become sufficiently different to escape the shadow of its more successful rivals.</p>

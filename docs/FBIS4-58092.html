			<p>BFN     [Text] Druze leaders on the Golan Heights and in the  Galilee have urged the Israeli Government, if its transfers  Druze villages to Syria as part of a settlement, not to  differentiate between the villages.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that on the map prepared  by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] within the framework of the  plan called Majdal Shams First, three Druze villages -- Majdal  Shams, Mas'adah, and Buq'ata -- will be transferred to the  Syrians, while 'Ayn Qunyah, which is situated on lower terrain,  will remain with Israel.    The Druze are demanding that the villages not be divided up  and that all the lands that belong to them be transferred to  Syria. Several Druze families on the Golan Heights have bought  land in various locations in the Galilee in order to move there  if the Golan is returned to Syria. Other Druze families are  looking into that possibility and also the prospect of buying  land on the Karmel. Our correspondent notes that Druze leaders  are helping the Golan Druze.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0705 GMT on 30 April in  a similar, but longer, report on the proposal adds: "Mt. Hermon  and the road leading up to it, will of course remain under  Israeli control. Israel is offering al-Asad two options, the  first of course, preferable to us: Take the Druze villages  first, we tell him, without the move being preceded by a  pronouncement that we are conceding our sovereignty over the  Golan Heights. The Israeli carrot to that option is a readiness  to implement it immediately within three months. Al-Asad is a  tough customer, therefore it is more reasonable that he will  prefer the second option: The word first will be fortified by a  Knesset resolution which recognizes Syrian sovereignty over the  entire Golan Heights. What will sweeten Rabin's bitter pill is  the fact that not a single Israeli settlement will be evacuated,  just as in Gaza and Jericho First."]</p>

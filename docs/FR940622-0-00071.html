New &sect;&sect;489.24 through 489.27 are added to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;489.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of a hospital that has an emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare benefits and regardless of ability to pay) comes by him or herself or with another person to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment of a medical condition by qualified medical personnel (as determined by the hospital in its rules and regulations), the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists. The examinations must be conducted by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws or rules and regulations and who meet the requirements of &sect;482.55 concerning emergency services personnel and direction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As used in this subpart_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capacity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred individual. Capacity encompasses such things as numbers and availability of qualified staff, beds and equipment and the hospital's past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comes to the emergency department <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means, with respect to an individual requesting examination or treatment, that the individual is on the hospital property (property includes ambulances owned and operated by the hospital, even if the ambulance is not on hospital grounds). An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment. In such situations, the hospital may deny access if it is in ``diversionary status,'' that is, it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, however, the ambulance staff disregards the hospital's instructions and transports the individual on to hospital property, the individual is considered to have come to the emergency department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emergency medical condition <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (i) A medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain, psychiatric disturbances and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Serious impairment to bodily functions; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) That there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) That transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hospital <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes a rural primary care hospital as defined in section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hospital with an emergency department <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a hospital that offers services for emergency medical conditions (as defined in this paragraph) within its capability to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

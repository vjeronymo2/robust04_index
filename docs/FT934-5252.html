			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Kohl's party tries to avoid state poll Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats will try to prevent an early election in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt after a financial scandal precipitated the resignation of the entire government at the weekend. Elections are not due until next June as part of a marathon of federal and state elections being held against a background of declining support for the established political parties, in western, and particularly in eastern Germany. Instead, the CDU, in an attempt to limit the political damage, has nominated Mr Christoph Bergner to replace Mr Werner Munch, the outgoing prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt, and form a new government. The state audit office had last week confirmed that Mr Munch and three other west German ministers together paid themselves in excess of DM900,000 (Dollars 532,500) over a period of two years.</p>

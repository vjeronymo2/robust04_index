			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (3): Delay will not hamper trade - Europe: customs union is proving a slow process The long countdown to customs union between Turkey and the European Union is entering a final, decisive stage. The two have set a deadline of January 1, 1996, to eliminate nearly all trade barriers between them  - 30 years after talks first began. Turkey's invasion of Cyprus and its 1980 military coup halted progress. Return to civilian rule and co-operation in the 1990-1 Gulf War revived negotiations. Many obstacles remain. Turkey's parliament is slow in enacting European legislation, especially competition and intellectual-property laws. Brussels opposes Turkey's demands for participation in EU decision-making processes. The European parliament may withhold ratification in protest at Turkey's bad human rights record. However, trade seems certain to continue growing. Over half Turkey's exports go to the EU, which supplies just under half its imports. Turkey is the EU's tenth largest trade partner. European companies invested Dollars 8.16bn in Turkey in 1980-83, two-thirds of total foreign direct investment. Although Europe scrapped trade barriers for Turkish goods 20 years ago - only agricultural products and textiles suffer significant limitations - Turkey still levies tariffs on European imports. Its average weighted protection against EU products is 12.8 per cent, compared with 17.2 per cent for third countries. European companies therefore stand to gain most from customs union. A European Commission official says: 'This is a fast-growing market. About 15-20m Turks have a European-type lifestyle. This is a great market for European producers.' He also argues that Turkey will benefit because 'customs unions always increase trade. There will be more investment, co-operation, joint ventures, marketing alliances, more research and development.' Customs union should also close what he calls Turkey's 'very big familiarity gap' with Europe. He says: 'Turkey feels unloved, unwanted. Political, social, economic (ties) that come with customs union will have great impact.' Many Turkish businesses feel they have little to fear from European competition, because productivity in many industries - textiles, white goods, consumer electronics - is already high. Still, all will feel the pressure from Europe's larger, more sophisticated and better-run companies. Sectors with the most trade protection will suffer the most. The car industry, with a hefty 39-106 per cent tariff barrier, is a prime candidate for opt-out clauses in the customs union negotiations. Mr Ali Tigrel, ambassador-at-large for European affairs, says he will push for 'derogation' privileges for certain industries, but will not say which. Brussels, meanwhile, has already warned that it will limit Turkish access to its textile market unless Ankara abolishes tariffs and adopts its competition laws. Turkey hopes customs union will lead to full EU membership. It has already applied twice for membership, without success. Mr Tigrel says: 'Customs union is the cement of the European Union.' Turkey also hopes to unlock large aid transfers from Brussels, blocked by Greece since it joined the EU. But even Mr Tigrel recognises that Turkey's 'increasing element of political uncertainty clouds everything and makes my life more difficult.' However, he claims that parliament's delay in approving laws is not a critical obstacle to customs union, as long as it adopts essential competition rules and shows it is making progress in adopting other laws.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hollas ahead to Pounds 255,000 PROFITS OF Hollas, the textile, garment importing and mail order group, rose to Pounds 255,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30. That marked an improvement of 8.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 235,000 and came from turnover of Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 18.54). The directors explained that the fall in turnover reflected direct or commission business replacing conventional sales in the garment importing division and did not reflect a lower level of overall activity. The interim dividend is held at 0.6p from same-again earnings of 0.3p. Mr Tony Lawson, chairman, believed the joint venture with Kleen-e-ze, announced last October, was a 'substantial' step forward for Hollas. The shares rose 2p to 16 1/2 p.</p>

In respone to this request, Japan  will study the possibility of providing full-scale aid on the  basis of the "Fukuda Doctrine," which advocates Japan's aid to  Southeast Asia. Da Nang City is also included in another  project for building a highway, which will start from suburban  Bangkok and reach Vietnam via Laos. Therefore, when these  projects are completed, a new gateway to Indochina from the sea  that may function equally as Bangkok, will appear in central  Vietnam.    Vietnam is a country consisting of a long strip of land that  extends south and north, and it can be roughly divided into the  Hanoi-centered northern region; the Ho Chi Minh-centered  southern region; and the central region in between. However,  since development and investment have been concentrated on the  northern and southern regions, they have fallen behind in the  central region.    Da Nang City, with a population of about half a million, is  known for the fact that military facilities, such as naval ports  and airports, were built by the U.S. forces during the Vietnam  war, and the city's outer port is known as an excellent natural  port. However, since these facilities have not been fully  utilized for trade, serious deterioration in the economy has  been noted recently.    Meanwhile, due to the rapid growth of the Asian economy, the  Thai Government, which is concerned with the overcrowded  situation at Bangkok port, has started paying its attention to  Da Nang port, which is geographically accessible. This year,  the Thai Government has made a proposal for using the Da Nang  port on various occassions such as during its influnetial  ministers' visits to Vietnam and at a forum sponsored by the  Asian Development Bank. Realizing the importance of the  comprehensive development in the central region, including Da  Nang port, the Vietnamese Government has also started working  out its own development program.    Aside from the proposal for developing Da Nang port, the  Thai  Government is also studying another "Indochinese Gateway"  project. Based on the recommendations of the Japan International  Cooperation Agency, this project aims at building a highway,  which will connect a new industrial port located east of Bangkok  with northeast Thailand and Laos. Since this project is  believed to cover even Da Nang City in Vietnam, it will  eventually be linked with the Vietnamese Government's program  for developing its central region in a comprehensive way.    In 1977, then Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda announced in  Manila  the "Fukuda Doctrine," which promises Japan's overall  cooperation in developing Southeast Asia. Since then, Japan has  been promoting its diplomacy toward Southeast Asia based on this  doctrine. When Japan became once again the biggest ODA supplier  in 1992, it spent most of its ODA aid, amounting to $11.33  billion, in Southeast Asia and East Asia.    However, due to such issues as sanctions against the  Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and its delayed payment to the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Japanese Government  stopped providing its aid to Vietnam for 14 years up to November  1992. Therefore, economic aid to Vietnam has been almost  overlooked. In particular, no nations, including Japan, have  ever provided any full-scale economic aid to Vietnam's central  region.    Since a large gap in the economic growth has recently been  observed between the central region on the one hand and the  northern and southern regions on the other, it is observed that  from a long-term viewpoint, it has become indispensable for  Vietnam to work out a master plan for developing its central  region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>   [Text] Exiled unionist Han Dongfang has decided to base  himself in Hong Kong to continue his battle for worker rights in  the mainland.    Mr Han, whose passport was invalidated by Beijing last year,  said he would no longer try to return to the mainland through  the border checkpoints or other channels.    "It's their (the Chinese Government's) fault to force me to  stay in Hong Kong. I've tried my best to return home ... now I  hope they will do some remedies to their wrongdoings," he said.    Now a researcher of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial  Committee on China's labour movement, Mr Han added that  returning home was no longer his first priority.    "I've discovered that Hong Kong can provide a better  environment and convenience for my work," he said.    Mr Han, however, reiterated that his long-term plan was to  return to his motherland.    "My ultimate goal is staying neither in the U.S. nor in Hong  Kong. I was left (by the Chinese Government) here and I'm now  here just because Hong Kong is much closer to the mainland."    The activist is very busy with his newsletter, which focuses  on the problems confronting China's labour movement.    The publication has 1,000 to 2,000 copies per issue sent to  the mainland, Mr Han said.    "So far, I've received 15 responses from the mainland about  my work. They are all very encouraging," he said.    He denied that his expulsion had separated him from the  workers in China and disqualified him from being a labour  activist.    "I've been one of them (Chinese workers) for more than 10  years. I understand the relationship between the management and  employees. The nature of the labour movement is more or less  the same despite some superficial changes," Mr Han said.    "Also, I still maintain communication with mainland workers.  I know where strikes have taken place and the reasons behind  them."    After a one-month visit to the United States for the birth  of  his second son, Yuchen, Mr Han returned to the territory on May  14 to renew his three-month work visa.    On the subject of China's Most Favoured Nation status with  the United States, the unionist said conditions to ensure  reasonable wages for Chinese workers and industrial safety  should be attached to its renewal.    "Actually, trade itself is abuse of human rights if workers'  interests are not protected," he said.    But Mr Han did not rule out that unemployment would result  if  the preferential trade status was removed.    Yesterday, Mr Han revealed that the wife of his lawyer, Zhou  Guoqiang, who filed a lawsuit against the Chinese authorities  for the "unlawful" invalidation of Mr Han's passport, had  disappeared.    He did not eliminate the possibility that the wife, Wang Hui  was, arrested.</p>

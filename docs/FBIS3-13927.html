Defense  establishment sources now say that the Syrians are directly  connected to yesterday's attack in which two Nahal Brigade  soldiers were killed. Our military correspondent Yariv  Ben-Yehuda reports:    [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] There is a direct link  between the Syrians and the Iranians on the one hand and  yesterday's events and the Hizballah attacks on the other Deputy  Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur stated today. Both countries  support Hizballah and have some sort of hidden competition going  on between them as to who will extend it more support in weapons  and other areas.    [Gur] There is no doubt whatsoever that there is a direct  link between the Syrians and Hizballah. We have had countless  evidence that if the Syrians wish it, Hizballah will hold its  fire. One cannot say they are the sole influence on Hizballah  since the Iranians also have a say there, but there is no  question that the Syrians have a great deal of influence over  Hizballah's actions.    [Ben-Yehuda] Hizballah has been showing signs of having  regained its strength since Operation Accountability. Deputy  Minister Gur said Hizballah has improved its method of operation  and has recently acquired sophisticated weapons.    [Gur] Hizballah's ability is quite considerable. In the  past year it acquired modern and sophisticated weapons. It has  also adopted a more sophisticated method of operation.  Therefore, its ability to operate can not be dismissed. This  necessitates us being constantly on alert and thinking of ways  to overcome these new factors.    [Ben-Yehuda] Gur was visiting Eti Kohen, the woman wounded  in yesterday's terrorist attack near the settlement of 'Ateret.  He added that it is not yet clear what additional waves of  terror are to be expected in the wake of the massacre in Hebron.  He went on to say that there are currently large numbers of  troops in the field and that the security forces have been  adopting numerous and diverse measures to guarantee maximum  security.

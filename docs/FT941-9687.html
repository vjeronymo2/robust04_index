			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / US may use sanctions over Japan trade rift The US will begin a review today of trade and economic measures that might be used against Japan in the wake of the failure of Friday's bilateral summit to resolve differences over how to secure greater US access to Japanese markets. After a farewell breakfast with President Bill Clinton on Saturday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, warned the US not to impose trade sanctions. His aides hinted that Japan would take the US to Gatt or take retaliatory measures of its own in the event of excessive US action. A US official said the administration would be 'clobbered' in Congress and by business if it did not respond. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, will undertake the initial review. The first concrete US response may come tomorrow when Mr Kantor's office is to pass judgment on a complaint from Motorola that Japan has not lived up to the terms of the 1989 agreement granting the company greater access for its cellular phones in the main urban corridor from Tokyo to Osaka. Other options under consideration include Mr Clinton invoking, by executive order, the 'Super 301' provisions of US trade law. Under 'Super 301', countries deemed systematically to discriminate against US goods and services are identified by name, setting in motion a process that can lead to sanctions. The US is also expected to keep the pressure on Japan to further stimulate its economy. It may also seek to drive the yen upwards. On Friday Mr Clinton had included the exchange rate as one of the 'objective criteria' the US wanted applied. Both leaders went out of their way on Saturday to emphasise that in matters other than trade the relationship was in good shape. There were domestic political plaudits for both leaders from Friday's failure. Mr Hosokawa returned home yesterday to general support for his tough line against numerical targets for US imports' share of the Japanese market, while Mr Clinton heard a prominent critic, Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, commend him for not settling for a 'bad agreement'. He predicted 'a breather' before the US acted, using existing statutory powers. Mr Takeshi Nagano, Nikkeiren employers' federation chairman, urged both countries to 'continue their dialogue from the viewpoint that the US-Japan relationship is the most important bilateral relation for both countries'. Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce, hoped the US would show 'good sense', while the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association also hoped the US would not resort to sanctions. But Mr Hosokawa will also come under pressure to stimulate domestic demand, on top of last week's Y15,250bn (Pounds 94.6bn) pump-priming package, to increase Japanese demand for imports. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and one of Mr Hosokawa's closest political allies, said: 'On our own initiative, we should draft plans to further open our market and increase domestic demand.' The opposition Liberal Democratic party also welcomed Mr Hosokawa's rejection of US demands. Plaudits pile up for hardline Hosokawa, Page 4 Lex, Page 14</p>

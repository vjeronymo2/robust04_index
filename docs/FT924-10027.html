			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Beating off big Brazil breakaway THERE is growing irritation with the distortion by which the richer and more populous south of Brazil subsidises the poorer north and north-east, yet receives less political representation. This resentment is taking shape as the government of Rio Grande do Sul state prepares a court action challenging Brazil's federal structure, demanding greater political representation for the south to avert the spread of separatism. The south and south-east are the richest parts of Brazil, accounting for 75.9 per cent of national GDP and 85m of the total 146m population, yet they are outweighed politically by the centre, north and north-east, which provide just 17.9 per cent of GDP. One reason is a constitution giving each state, no matter its size, at least eight members in the House of Representatives in the federal Congress. Southerners say, half in jest, that Brazil would be a very rich country if it lopped off everything north of Rio de Janeiro. This sentiment is more serious among the 9.2m people of Rio Grande do Sul. Local businessmen talk bitterly about subsidising 'indolent north-easterners' who 'damage Brazil's image'. Their wrath is understandable. Rio Grande do Sul seems like another country compared with the hungry north-east. The state, one of the richest regions in Latin America, boasts social indicators worthy of the developed world, with average life expectancy of 72 years and 89 per cent literacy. Some 81.3 per cent of households have telephones. Porto Alegre, the state capital, with its modern architecture and tree-lined roads, could fit easily into Europe. Telephones work, appointments are kept on time and cars stop at traffic lights and crossings. Such is the growing mood towards separatism in the region that four movements have arisen. Mr Irton Marx, president of the Pampa Movement, says: 'Separatism is the only way for Brazil to shake off its backwardness.' The movement runs a state-wide TV campaign: 'Enough of being ashamed abroad by being thought swindlers, underdeveloped and primitive'. Mr Marx claims to have 780,000 signatures for his proposed referendum on separation of the three southernmost states  - Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana. Southern feelings run very high now because of a fiscal reform before Congress. Rio Grande do Sul is one of the highest contributors to federal revenues, but a low recipient. Mr Alceu Collares, state governor, says: 'We send 15.5 per cent of state GDP to Braslia and only get back the equivalent of 9 per cent. If this, and the political discrimination, is not altered we could face an unstoppable separatist campaign.'</p>

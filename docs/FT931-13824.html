			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Electron House jumps 44% ELECTRON HOUSE, the Reigate-based distributor of electronic components which has undergone substantial restructuring in the last few years, yesterday reported a 44 per cent gain in interim pre-tax profits and is raising the dividend. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 595,000 to Pounds 854,000 in the six months to November 30, helped by higher sales, operating profits from continuing operations, and lower interest. Earnings per share were 1.68p (1.03p) and the interim dividend is up by 5 per cent to 1.05p (1.00p). Sales from continuing operations increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 29m) and generated Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 815,000) of operating profits in the first half. Discontinued operations added sales of Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 31.1m) and Pounds 162,000 (Pounds 948,000) to operating profits. Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the results provided further evidence of the benefits of the restructuring and were 'particularly encouraging' given the prolonged depressed economic conditions. He said:'These results demonstrate that we continue to increase market share while maintaining tight control of overheads. Every sector of the group increased its sales and profits in local currency over the same period last year.' The group completed the sale of its high volume, low margin Bytech computer wholesaling business in August. The purchaser paid Pounds 5m for Pounds 4m of net assets and assumed over Pounds 5m of bank borrowings. As a result Mr Leigh said the group's borrowings had fallen to just under Pounds 4m and gearing had been cut from more 110 per cent at the end of May to between 30 and 40 per cent. Interest costs fell from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 732,000.</p>

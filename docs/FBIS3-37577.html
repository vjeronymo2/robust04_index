			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, February 18 (TASS) -- The draft federal law  "on the status of a deputy of the Council of the Federation of  the first convocation and the status of a deputy of the State  Duma of the first convocation of the Federal Assembly of the  Russian Federation" was today approved by the Russian State Duma  (the lower chamber of the parliament) in first reading. Taking  part in the bill's elaboration were 19 lawyers -- members of the  Russian parliament.    The law lays down the rights, duties, and responsibilities  of members of both chambers of the Russian parliament. It also  stipulates the basic rights and guarantees of parliament  members, proceeding from Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution.    Now the bill will have to be thrashed out in the committees  and commissions of the two chambers of the Russian Federal  Assembly (parliament), in the factions and parliamentary groups  of the State Duma. Then, not later than March 10, their remarks  and suggestions will be summed up by the State Duma's  parliamentary committee for organisational affairs. After that,  the bill will be submitted for second reading.    The document consists of five chapters and 41 articles. It  is worth noting that deputies of the two chambers of the  parliament, as approved during the first reading, shall enjoy  the right of immunity throughout their term of office. They  cannot be detained, arrested, or searched, except in cases when  they are caught red-handed. They cannot be subjected to  personal examination, except cases envisaged by the federal law  in order to ensure the safety of other people. The right of  immunity covers also the homes and offices of parliament  members, their correspondence, the means of communication they  use, and also the documents belonging to them. The question of  stripping an MP of immunity shall be decided by a corresponding  chamber of the Federal Assembly at the request of the  procurator-general of the Russian Federation.    Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the  State Duma are exempted from military service and military  training sessions for their entire term of office. They are to  furnish information on their incomes and property status to the  state taxation service and corresponding bodies of the Council  of the Federation and the State Duma (the two chambers of the  Russian parliament).    Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the  State Duma shall have the right to interpellate the president  and the government of the Russian Federation, the ministries,  departments or any other executive agencies on questions within  the competence of those bodies at any time they deem it  necessary.    It remains to be seen whether or not these provisions will  remain in the final text of the law after the second reading.</p>

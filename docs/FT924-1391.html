			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery bill does not allay fears of voluntary sector leaders THE bill has not allayed the fears of voluntary sector leaders that the lottery will damage charities' fund-raising activities, Alan Pike writes. Ms Judy Weleminsky, director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said the lottery was an ambitious and bold scheme, but a number of safeguards for the voluntary sector must be addressed by MPs. Charity managers have two related concerns. One is that the lottery will reduce their income, particularly from sources like street collections and small charity lotteries. The other is that national lottery proceeds will not compensate for such a loss because charities will be only one of several causes to benefit. Some charity managers believe the voluntary sector's income will be reduced unless 50 per cent of distributed lottery proceeds go to charities. Mr Frank Flannery, managing director of UK Charity Lotteries - a charity-owned organisation that runs lottery games - said provisions in the bill to increase prizes in charity lotteries were a 'totally inadequate safeguard.' There was a grave danger that Pounds 260m currently raised by charity lotteries would be completely wiped out by the national lottery. The Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers said the voluntary sector would be able to support the Bill only if the government provided compensation for the potential downturn in charities' income.</p>

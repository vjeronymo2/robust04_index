			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A recovery in the bond markets helped stock index futures to reverse an earlier slide after the March FT-SE 100 contract crashed through the 3,200 support level, writes Joel Kibazo. After a volatile session, the March contract closed at 3,227, having touched a low for the day of 3,163 at an 11-point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was high, reaching 35,441 contracts. Dealers attributed the recovery to short-covering from independent (local) traders and further gains in after-hours trading indicated that a strong rally was likely to occur today. Early in the session, March tumbled in hectic trading after European bond markets fell sharply on higher than anticipated German money supply figures. The FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract on the Liffe ended at 3,900 on volume of 36 lots and the same contract dealt on the OMLX finished at 3,902.5 on 58 lots traded. The traded options sector was also busy and turnover rose to 67,008 contracts. Most of the activity was in the FT-SE 100 option, which saw 40,277 lots dealt. BT was the busiest stock option with a total of 3,455 contracts transacted, followed by Land Securities with 1,743. Barclays and Abbey National were also active.</p>

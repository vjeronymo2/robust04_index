			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: A very British 'Pinafore' - Operetta The one puzzling thing about Sunday's concert performance of this 'Entirely Original Nautical Comic Opera' was why it should be in the London Philharmonic's 'International Series'. The cast was British as could be, and the conductor too, and most of the (sensibly reduced) orchestra. To other questions there were obvious answers. Why do a concert Pinafore at all? Because it will fill the Royal Festival Hall, if it has enough singers with Names. Why should singers who have earned their Names in grander music bother with G&amp;S? Because they think it will be fun, and it is nice to sing to a happy audience. How can they be so sure that the audience will be happy? Because nearly all the latter have it heard it many times before - they have probably sung in it; and if few modern singers with Names can mimic the vintage D'Oyly Carte style, their modern Personalities should make piquant compensation for any falling-away from orthodoxy. And so they did, and it was fun. Roger Norrington conducted the piece at a brisk clip. Though three of the announced soloists had dropped out of play, their replacements - just slightly lesser Names - gave full measure: Neil Jenkins as a fervent, upstanding Ralph, David Thomas adapting his Handelian bass manners to ripe Edwardian melodrama for Dick Deadeye, Marilyn Hill Smith a model of D'OC diction and innocence as sweet Josephine. Her sire Captain Corcoran was David Wilson-Johnson, her nearest competitor in the diction-stakes, artful about underlining any political innuendo with a newly up-to-date echo (as Gilbert's lines seem regularly to have). The Butterfly and the First Lord of the Admiralty were Sarah Walker and Benjamin Luxon, both of them emitting Personality on an expansive, shamelessly appealing scale. The London Philharmonic Choir, reduced but energetic, sang the crew of the Pinafore and the sisters, cousins and aunts with a will. By sheer talent and cunning, Gwion Thomas almost turned the Boatswain into a major character; and in the still smaller roles of Hebe and the Carpenter, the young mezzo Ruby Philogene and bass Jonathan Best were disproportionately good. All in all, the performance was engaging enough to silence quibbles. I append one plea nevertheless, about diction. Not unlike Walton's Facade, the G&amp;S operettas make great play with setting Gilbert's consciously clever, scansion-heavy texts to deceptively simple music with an easy flow. The apparent clash between those things, and the witty accommodation that Sullivan engineered between them, is the heart of the matter. No doubt the old D'OC company preserved its authentic' stagings too long - but its practised, ultra-lucid, front-of-the-mouth delivery still seems the best way of bringing G&amp;S to full comic life. That is vanishing now. We shall come to miss it.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Personal View: Rail privatisation's difficult journey On April 1, British Rail is to be split asunder. A radical re-structuring of passenger and freight services, track and rolling stock provision and a variety of other services and maintenance activities will form the prelude to the government's ultimate goal of privatisation. Will it work, or will it turn out to be an April Fool? At first sight the changes next month are a cleverly contrived continuation of the fundamental organisational changes introduced in April 1982 and April 1992. The 27 profit centres set up two years ago will become the basis of 30 (25 passenger train operating units and five freight) separate businesses for franchising. There will be more private sector involvement in management and private risk capital will be introduced. Additionally, the 'internal market', whereby the profit centres sell services to each other, will be extended. The 1992 changes gave the managing director of each passenger railway business - InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways - direct control of their own infrastructure and supply of train services. A separate Central Services organisation was also established, selling services to the individual railway businesses in an internal market. Benefits have begun to show; for example, staff numbers on the Gatwick Express have fallen by 25 per cent since April 1992, assets are being used more intensively and marketing initiatives introduced. But there are problems with the new proposals. The first is psychological. The business managing directors, before they took direct control in 1992, could not influence the production of railway services sufficiently to achieve what their marketing studies showed passengers wanted. The present changes are being imposed against strong opposition from experienced railway managers. Moreover, the reorganisation is too soon after that of April 1992, which involved a huge effort. Another problem is operational. Great concern has been expressed about the split in ownership and control between Railtrack (which assumes responsibility for stations, track, signalling, timetabling, operating control and safety) as an intermediate supplier and the train operating units as train service producers. A railway is above all a systems business, in which all the principal activities are interlocked. Moreover, passengers are part of the production process. Unlike Marks and Spencer, or even a 'just in time' supply of components for manufacture, any accident, mismatch or misunderstanding between the suppliers and producers will immediately affect them. The greatest problem is economic. The Pounds 100m or so InterCity annual profit will be turned into a loss because of infrastructure and rolling stock leasing charges, and subsidy will be required. Even the Pounds 10m profit for the coveted Gatwick Express will be extin-guished. These seemingly high costs arise because the infrastructure capital value was put at Pounds 6.5bn and the Treasury imposed a 5.6 per cent required rate of return, increasing to 8 per cent. Additionally, bureaucracy and transaction costs of the new system will be high, and safety controls will be more expensive and complex than the present 'safety validation' procedures. Moreover, railway revenues tend to track fluctuations in gross domestic product. In a downturn, unless train services can be cut (and remember Railtrack decides the timetable) and rolling stock handed back, franchisee profits may disappear. Private sector franchisees will only be interested if they can see where the profits will come from. Costs in the train operating units are already being cut. More cost savings and revenue improvements are in the pipeline. So what leverage will be left for the private sector with franchisees controlling only some 20 to 25 per cent of total cost due to infrastructure and leasing charges? Subsidies may be granted, but they are politically vulnerable (and the government's contribution is planned to be cut by two-thirds by 1996-97 anyway). The benefits are that the train operating units will be much smaller businesses than the present ones, with greater freedom for innovation. Staff can be more closely involved and costs will be more exposed. Even so, the scope for substantial profit improvement by private franchisees is narrowing. Perhaps the most likely outcome is that BR will continue to be the predominant owners, with their staff as management franchisees at the heart of the railway system and the private sector round the periphery. In these circumstances the Railtrack monopoly will be forced to bow to their demands.

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / City backs increased powers for police on terrorism THE overwhelming majority of leading City companies and organisations want greater police powers and formal co-ordination of security arrangements after the Bishopsgate bombing, according to a poll conducted by MORI for the Financial Times. Two-fifths also favour excluding cars from certain City areas which may be at high risk, at a time when pressure is growing on the government to find new ways to tighten security to prevent future IRA attacks. Nearly two-thirds said they would be 'very' or 'fairly likely' to contribute to increased policing costs related to preventing terrorism, while 31 per cent agreed businesses in high-risk areas should pay an extra premium for terrorist cover. The poll was based on interviews this week with representatives - many with top executives - of 103 leading City banks, professional firms and regulators. Forty-seven per cent said they 'strongly agreed' or 'tended to agree' that London would lose its position as Europe's premier financial centre if the bombing campaign continued. But none of the 12 non-UK banks questioned said it was likely to reduce operations in London because of the risk of further bombs. Two said it was 'not very likely' and 10 'not at all likely'. Mr Paul Downes, deputy chief executive of Georgeson, a public relations company, said: 'I don't think anybody is going to be put off for ever. It is not going suddenly to cause them to switch location. But it makes people nervous.' Thirty-nine per cent of the organisations surveyed were damaged by the blast, with 15 per cent describing the effect as 'substantial'. More than a quarter said that some employees were not able to work on the Monday after the Saturday bombing. Fifteen per cent said none of their workforce was able to work even by Wednesday.

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: FALLBROOK  </P> <P> Opponents of a proposed landfill on Aspen Road will hold a protest walk at the  site, starting at 10 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Walks ranging from 100 yards to 3 miles -- around the perimeter of the proposed  dump -- are planned, said Gib Lee, organizer of the protest.  </P> <P> Opponents of the Aspen Road landfill say it would worsen the area's air quality  and endanger the ground water, which is tapped by neighboring Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> The Aspen Road site is one of three being considered by county officials -- the  others being in the Pauma Valley east of Interstate 15 and near Warner Springs  -- to accommodate North County's trash as the existing landfill in San Marcos  approaches capacity.  </P></p>

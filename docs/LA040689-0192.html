Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TEMPERATURE HITS 101 ON THE THIRD DAY OF RECORD-SETTING HEAT SPELL  </P> <P> The mercury shot up to record highs in Los Angeles today for the third  consecutive day, and thousands fled to the beach but found only a sandy  furnace.  </P> <P> By 1 p.m. the temperature was 101 degrees downtown, breaking the April 6 record  of 91 set in 1932 and tied in 1962.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service predicted Los Angeles' Civic Center would end the  day with a high of 102. The overnight temperature at the Civic Center fell only  to 73 this morning.  </P> <P> About 25,000 people were already gathered on Santa Monica beach by mid-morning,  but the temperature there was 80 degrees at sunrise and neared 100 before noon,  lifeguard Randy DeGregori said.  </P> <P> The spring heat wave was spawned by a high pressure system expected to linger  over the West for several more days, forecaster Michael Lewis said.  </P></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Dan-Air parent and Virgin in merger talks: Joint venture could provide one solution to UK-based airline's financial problems DAVIES &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of Dan-Air, the UK-based airline, has begun preliminary merger discussions with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline. This follows the collapse of talks between Dan-Air's parent and British Airways earlier this month. Davies &amp; Newman is interested in finding a buyer or in forming a partnership with another airline to stave off financial difficulties. The UK recession has had a severe effect on the airline. Davies &amp; Newman is expected to show a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 7m in 1992. At the time of its refinancing a year ago it forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m. British Airways is understood to have held 'very detailed discussions' with Dan-Air over several months about either a merger or some form of partnership, according to one City of London source. The talks were called off about a week ago and no formal reason for ending discussions was given. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, was unavailable for comment yesterday. A merger or partnership would provide one solution to Dan-Air's financial problems. Although the group has very little borrowings at the end of the peak travel season, its position deteriorates during winter. This raises questions over whether its Pounds 35m borrowing facility will prove sufficient and whether it will breach a banking covenant linked to 1992 profits. A return to the market to raise funds looks unlikely because the share price has fallen well below the 50p rescue issue price. Davies &amp; Newman came close to collapse a year ago, but was refloated in October 1991 with a Pounds 49.3m share issue. The group reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 35.4m in 1991. Mr David James, the company doctor-chairman, warned in May that weak economic growth would have an adverse effect on the airline. 'In our listing particulars we drew attention to the fact that passenger traffic generally grows at twice the rate of gross domestic product. Whereas we had adopted the widely expected GDP growth of 2.6 per cent to give passenger growth of 5.2 per cent, the growth so far in 1992 has been negligible.' Dan-Air's attractions to a would-be buyer include its strong position at Gatwick airport and its range of European routes. It is Europe's 12th largest airline. Its share price has recovered in the past few weeks from a low of 11p. At Friday's close of 19p, its market value was Pounds 21.8m. A recent buyer of the shares said the gamble was more to do with a possible deal with another airline than on recovery hopes behind the rescue share issue.</p>

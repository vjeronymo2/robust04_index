The agreement was  reached by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez and  General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander of the Armed Forces.    Gen. Discua Elvir explained that the practice of deploying  hundreds of soldiers to the country's urban centers to capture  youths and forcibly take them to military units will be  suspended. This practice has been constantly criticized by the  media, parents, and human rights defenders, who term it  kidnapping. The youths were taken to the military units and not  given the opportunity to contact their parents about their  situation. Military service in Honduras is for a period of two  years.    Today's agreement states that the practice will be stopped,  while a commission of civilians and military personnel will draw  up a new plan.    Gen. Discua Elvir told a news conference at the Government  House that the establishment of the Educational Voluntary  Military Service [Servico Military Voluntario Educativo] and the  Constitutional Military Service [Servicio Militar  Constitucional] has been proposed to President Reina Idiaquez.    Neither Discua Elvir nor President Reina told the media what  each proposal entails. They said the proposals will be  developed by the governmental commission that they appointed.  The Honduran president told the news conference that the  military sector realized that the forcible enlistment of youths  was "negative and harmful to the Armed Forces."</p>

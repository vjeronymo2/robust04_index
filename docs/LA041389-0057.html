			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ON HOLD SINCE JAN. 4;  </P> <P> FATE OF BORDER CRIME SQUAD IS STILL UP IN AIR  </P> <P> Top San Diego police and U.S. Border Patrol officials met Wednesday and  discussed the future of an embattled border anti-crime squad, but authorities  said no decision had been made on the future of the unit.  </P> <P> Police Chief Bob Burgreen and Dale W. Cozart, chief Border Patrol agent in San  Diego, both accompanied by top aides, discussed the issue and agreed to meet  again next week to ponder the squad's fate anew, said Police Capt. Dick Toneck,  department spokesman.  </P> <P> "They're looking at a whole series of new ways of doing business, or maybe  going back to the old way," said Toneck, who supervised the unit during the  year he served as captain of the police southern division.  </P> <P> The unique law enforcement squad -- known as the Border Crime Prevention Unit  -- has been largely on hold since Jan. 4, when Border Patrol officers assigned  to the outfit shot and killed two Mexican men who, according to U.S.  authorities, attacked the officers with screwdrivers and a knife. After the  shootings, the Mexican government, citing what it considered an excessive use  of force, requested a thorough investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims Rejected  </P> <P> An attorney representing the families of the dead men then filed two  $15-million claims against the patrol, contending that the pair were shot as  they were running back to Mexico. U.S. officials, acknowledging that the men  were shot in the back, said the shootings nonetheless appeared to be justified  by the threat. Federal authorities have rejected the claim by the dead men's  families. The families' attorney, Marco Lopez of San Diego, plans a civil suit.  </P> <P> In the midst of the controversy, U.S. authorities took the unit out of action,  saying its methods were being re-evaluated. The squad, whose members have been  assigned to other duties, has now been inactive for more than three months, the  longest such break since the outfit was formed five years ago.  </P> <P> The unit, whose members patrol in uniform, is a successor to the undercover  squad of San Diego police officers whose exploits during 1976-78 were  chronicled by author Joseph Wambaugh in the book "Lines and Shadows." That  outfit was disbanded in 1978, after several highly publicized shooting  incidents, when then-Chief of Police William Kolender determined that the duty  was too risky. After it was taken out of action in 1978, there was no border  anti-crime squad until the current unit began patrolling the border in early  1984.  </P> <P> The furor surrounding the January shootings also prompted an inquiry by the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was probing possible civil rights  violations. The inquiry has been completed and its results will soon be  forwarded to the Justice Department in Washington to determine if any further  legal action is warranted, said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman in San Diego. He  declined further comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unit in a Unique Position  </P> <P> The border unit is composed of about a dozen police officers and Border Patrol  </P> <P> agents, all of whom volunteer for the assignments, working four-month shifts  and patrolling the border area in the evenings. The squad is designed to cut  down on crime against the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who  enter San Diego from Mexico each year, often hiking through rough canyons or  traversing the hazardous Tijuana River area, where many are victimized by  thieves. The unit is in the unique position of defending people who are, by  definition, lawbreakers.  </P> <P> However, the unit has amassed a record of violence that critics say is  excessive. In its five years of existence, officers assigned to the squad have  shot 44 suspects, 18 of whom have died, at least half shot from behind, many  shot numerous times. The dozen or so lawmen assigned to the unit at a given  time have killed more people during its five-year history than the entire San  Diego police force, which is composed of more than 1,500 officers, during the  same period.  </P> <P> In each fatal-shooting case, the uniformed officers said they were attacked in  the border darkness, provoking their response. U.S. authorities have denied  that the officers deliberately act as decoys -- the provocative operating  method of the previous border unit that was eventually disbanded.  </P> <P> Roberto Martinez, representing the American Friends Service Committee, social  action arm of the Quaker Church, has called for the disbanding of the squad,  which he maintains is too violent and has shot too many innocent victims. But  authorities in San Diego, maintaining that each person killed was indeed a  violent thief, have said they plan to redeploy the unit, although how it will  eventually be constituted remains unknown.  </P> <P> "We're trying to make it more safe and more efficient for the agents out  there," said Norbert Gomez, a Border Patrol spokesman.  </P></p>

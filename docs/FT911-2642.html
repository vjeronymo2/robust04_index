			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: An insatiable demand for new paper - The recent spate of cash calls on shareholders THE SPATE of rights issues in the UK equity market since the start of March seems to show no sign of abating. So far this year Pounds 3bn has been raised, but despite the cash calls the FT-SE 100 index has risen by more than 15 per cent. With the stock market having already reached some equity strategists' forecasts for the end of the year, the continued demand from companies for new equity might be expected to put a damper on share prices. However, the amount of cash raised through rights issues is not surprising - although it is already nearing the Pounds 4bn raised in 1990 and exceeds the Pounds 3bn total for 1989. At the start of the year, for example, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, was expecting Pounds 6bn to be asked for during the year. County NatWest was predicting that issues would total Pounds 20bn over 1991 and 1992. So Pounds 3bn in four months is a not an unexpected amount. On the other hand, Nomura, the securities house, suggests the market had also been looking for some big takeover bids to put some of the cash back into the stock market. So far nothing sizeable has been seen, and if some big bids do not appear soon the market could become nervous. Nonetheless, the supply/demand balance does not seem to be a problem. Institutional liquidity, which was unusually high at the end of last year, has fallen to a more normal level and no lower. Investors are not short of cash to invest in rights issues - or in government sales of gilts and its BT shares - if they think there is a case for putting money into the market at all. Since companies are making rights issues to take advantage of the high level of the market, should the market fall or the take-up of shares by investors slacken, the number of issues ought to dry up. Equity strategists do not expect the rights issues to trigger a fall in the market, although there have been famous occasions when one big issue coming on top of a stream of lesser calls has cracked the market - such as Hanson's Pounds 519m rights in June 1985 and National Westminster Bank's Pounds 714m call in May 1986. So long as the issues are from companies which investors regard as worthy, and issuers do not get greedy on price, there appears to be demand for new paper. It is the institutions' propensity to invest rather than the weight of cash calls that could cause problems for the stock market. If investors began to worry about fundamental concerns such as the economic recovery, interest rates and inflation, sterling and the trade balance, and the looming general election, then they could resist future rights issues.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY DECISION DUE WEDNESDAY ON FIRE SPRINKLERS  </P> <P> After weeks of intense lobbying by home builders and fire officials, county  supervisors are expected to consider Wednesday the controversial issue of  whether automatic fire sprinkler systems should be required in all new homes in  unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> Fire officials say sprinklers are essential because they save lives by putting  out fires before they spread.  </P> <P> But home builders have been lobbying for a no vote. They say that sprinkler  systems will make housing even more unaffordable and are unnecessary because  new homes are already fire safe.  </P> <P> It is an emotional issue because so many people die in fires -- 10 people  killed in the county last year and more than 6,000 nationally.  </P> <P> Besides requiring sprinklers in all new single-family homes in the county, the  proposed changes to the county's uniform building code also call for sprinklers  to be installed in existing homes if enlarged by 50% or more, when that brings  the total size to more than 3,600 square feet.  </P> <P> The changes would also require fire sprinklers in all new multifamily  buildings.  </P> <P> Most builders agree that the impact of the proposed codes would be felt most in  the South County, which has the largest expanses of unincorporated and  undeveloped land. According to state Department of Finance estimates, Orange  County is 60% built out, with much of the projected building activity through  2020 expected in the southern and eastern parts of the county.  </P> <P> "We are lobbying in the interest of reason and the interest of safety," said  Michael Lennon, director of community affairs for the Building Industry Assn.  He said sprinklers would increase the cost of new homes in a housing market  that is already very expensive.  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors staff members told The Times that lobbying by developers,  home builders, the Building Industry Assn. and fire officials has been intense  since the proposed code changes were first made public last month.  </P> <P> "I think this is a very serious issue, and I am not taking it lightly,"  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said.  </P> <P> He said he has spent considerable time listening to the arguments from the  Building Industry Assn. and developers, as well as from Larry J. Holms, county  fire chief.  </P> <P> Riley, the outgoing chairman of the board, said late last week that he was not  sure how he or other supervisors would vote when the issue comes before the  board Wednesday. But he said a compromise might be reached by requiring home  builders at least to offer sprinkler systems to buyers.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Don R. Roth, who will take over as chairman this week, said:  "There is no outcry from the public demanding fire sprinklers in all new  single-family houses. The public is very, very complacent about this issue."  </P> <P> Chief Holms and county Fire Marshal William L. Wright said fire protection  officials have failed to educate the public on the need of sprinklers in all  buildings. That, they said, is the main reason for the complacency and lack of  public outcry.  </P> <P> The Building Industry Assn. said the cost to equip a new home with sprinklers  reaches into the thousands of dollars, which might be enough to force even more  people out of an already-unreachable housing market.  </P> <P> Lennon, the builder group's public affairs chief, said more than 85% of county  residents can already no longer afford a new home at today's prices.  </P> <P> Lennon said his organization -- which represents home builders, subcontractors  and suppliers -- strongly supports the current California-wide building codes  created by experts, including fire officials, which he said addresses all  safety issues -- including fire.  </P> <P> Those codes require smoke detectors, which, according to county statistics,  have cut residential fire deaths in half.  </P> <P> But Holms, who has been a firefighter for 30 years, said installation of  automatic fire sprinkler systems in new homes is a safety issue that involves  the very young, the very old and those who are incapacitated.  </P> <P> "My strong personal feelings about this issue have developed over many years --  and (during) the many times I have stood overlooking debris with families who  have lost loved ones or all their personal belongings in a fire," he said.  </P> <P> "The longer I am in the business, the more personally committed I become. It is  so needless. Why should a child die because it is in a crib or an older person  because they can't walk or run?"  </P> <P> Smoke detectors let you know there is a fire, he said, and sprinklers put the  fire out.  </P> <P> Holms said he understands the concerns of developers and builders, who are  under pressure from all sides to add this and add that.  </P> <P> But, he said, "my sympathy only goes so far."  </P> <P> If the sprinkler systems were approved, Holms said, they would be included in  about 60,000 homes from now until the county is fully developed.  </P> <P> "That could make the lives of at least 180,000 people safer," he said. "We are  talking about the kids of our kids."  </P> <P> What's more, the requirement could be cost effective, fire officials said. With  sprinklers in enough homes, the need for fire protection could decrease. Each  fire engine costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the price tag for each  additional firefighter, benefits included, can reach $180,000 a year.  </P> <P> "It is a one-time cost to put sprinklers in a new home, but fire losses occur  year after year," Fire Marshal Wright said.  </P> <P> He said adding sprinklers in new homes would help "put a cap on fire protection  costs."  </P> <P> Wright estimated that it costs about $2,000 to include a sprinkler system in a  new home, which he said is a small sum when the average county house costs  $238,000.  </P> <P> It would cost about $3,000 to retrofit an older house, he said.  </P> <P> Most of that additional cost would eventually be returned to the homeowner  through lower insurance costs. More than 20 insurance companies offer premium  reductions of 5% to 25% for homes equipped with automatic sprinkler systems,  Fire Department officials said.  </P> <P> The issue over whether builders should be required to put sprinklers in new  homes has been argued before. Supervisors put off deciding whether to require  them in all new single-family homes in the unincorporated areas in 1987 because  they said state and federal regulations were expected soon. These never  materialized.  </P> <P> Sprinkler systems are already required in all new family homes in San Clemente,  Anaheim, Dana Point, Placentia, Cypress, Stanton and Seal Beach. Los Alamitos,  according to fire officials, requires the systems in new homes because of  water-pressure problems.  </P> <P> A study of the last 82 years in Australia and New Zealand, cited by the League  of California Cities, shows that 99.8% of the time, sprinklers controlled or  extinguished structure fires.  </P> <P> The league's report also pointed to Disney World-Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.  Developed in the mid-1970s, the project provided the latest in fire protection,  including sprinklers in every building of more than 1,000 square feet, smoke  detectors, regular inspections of equipment and employee training programs.  </P> <P> According to the league's report, the theme park, which has a daily population  of 200,000 people, has had no fire injuries or fatalities, and its annual fire  loss is less than $5,000.  </P></p>

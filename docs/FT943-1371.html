			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: De Klerk confident on SA debt rating Mr FW De Klerk, the South African deputy president, yesterday said he was confident the credit rating reviews being conducted by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's would result in a BBB, or investment grade, rating for the country's international debt. He brushed aside news that the London-based credit rating agency IBCA had only awarded an inferior BB, or sub-investment grade, rating on Thursday. The IBCA rating was greeted with disappointment in South Africa because many fund managers are not allowed to buy sub-investment, or junk bonds, but there was little surprise in the international markets. The South African government is seeking ratings from the international rating agencies in order to facilitate its return to tap the international bond markets, to fund its reconstruction programme. Speaking in Edinburgh to European securities analysts, Mr De Klerk expressed regret that South Africa's political transformation had not yet been adequately recognised by the markets. 'I find it strange that the financial markets should reflect a scepticism on the government's ability to govern the country efficiently and prudently. This is unfair to the government of national unity and has no basis in fact,' he said. He insisted the government would maintain fiscal discipline and would not repeat the populist mistakes of other countries in funding the reconstruction and development programme. Higher interest rates would increase debt service costs and thus would lead to a slight expenditure overrun for 1994-95 but steps would be taken to finance it on a sound basis. Mr De Klerk said the South African authorities would not spring a surprise on the nervous markets by an early abolition of the financial rand system. They were keen to change as soon as possible - but would not be rushed.</p>

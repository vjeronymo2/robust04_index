			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux doubles net result Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities, construction and communications group, yesterday confirmed it more than doubled net profits, to FFr804m (Dollars 137.4m), in 1993 and expressed optimism about prospects for the current year. Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said the worst of the economic recession was over, and outlined 'considerable opportunities' in the public works and utilities markets. 'In France, and in the European Union, infrastructure programmes, including motorways, high speed trains and airports, will soon be launched', he said. Mr Monod said the group's construction activities would be reinforced through the merger between its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose subsidiaries. The group is proposing a dividend of FFr16.50 for last year, compared with FFr15 in 1992.</p>

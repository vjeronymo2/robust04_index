			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Summer Festivals: Culture over the continents - Our critics offer a rough guide to a civilised holiday AIX-EN-PROVENCE July 11 - 28 Ancien Palais de l'Archeveche, 13100 Aix-en-Provence, France. Tel: (16)-4217-3434 An attractively diverse trio of operas this year: Weber's musically abundant Euryanthe, Handel's magnificent Orlando (with Felicity Palmer), both in new productions, and a Don Giovanni revival. Among the concerts are a Berlioz Enfance du Christ in the Cathedral and Campra's L'Europe galante in the Archbishop's Palace theatre; among the many choice recitalists attracted to this choicest of festival locations are Wilhelmenia Fernandez, Andreas Schmidt, Gundula Janowitz and Lella Cuberli. ALDEBURGH June 11 - 27 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk IP15 5AX. Tel: (0728)-453543 The first of this year's two operatic events is a concert revival of one of Britten's less acclaimed works, the 'television opera' Owen Wingrave, long overdue for re-evaluation; the second is Monteverdi's Orfeo (also in concert), given by students of the Britten-Pears School conducted by a tenor who is himself a famous Orfeo - Anthony Rolfe Johnson. Performing luminaries include Julian Bream, Peter Serkin, the Borodin Quartet, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Thomas Allen; composers under the spotlight include Peter Paul Nash, Takemitsu - and, of course, the founding genius himself. BAD KISSINGEN June 25 - July 18 Stadt Bad Kissingen, Postfach 2260, D-8730 Bad Kissingen, Germany. Tel: 971-807110. Fax: 971-807191 The chief attraction of the 'Kissinger Sommer' is its setting in a north Bavarian spa town. The Regentenbau - a former royal house - incorporates four splendid concert halls, and there is also a fin-de-siecle theatre. This year's attractions include operatic concerts with Margaret Price, Cheryl Studer, Edith Wiens and Katia Ricciarelli; a staged production of Handel's Tamerlano; song recitals by Emma Kirkby, Gwyneth Jones and Wolfgang Holzmair; and symphonic concerts conducted by Lorin Maazel, Kurt Sanderling and Gerd Albrecht. BATH May 21 - June 6 Linley House, Pierrepoint Place, Bath BA1 1JY. Tel: 0225-463362/466411 The last Bath festival under the directorship of Amelia Freedman, founder of the Nash Ensemble, focuses on the music of Grieg (a 1993 anniversary composer), Schumann and Robin Holloway (two Nash concerts in the opening weekend). Other attractions are the front-rank pianists - Brendel, Alexeyev, Pizarro, Kovacevich, Joanna McGregor, Schiff, Melvyn Tan - among this year's crop of recitalists, and a clutch of Norwegian groups (the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, Norwegian String Quartet, Norwegian Chamber Orchestra) to add authenticity to the Grieg celebrations. BAYREUTH July 25 - August 28 Kartenburo, Bayreuther Festspiele, Postfach 100262, D-8580 Bayreuth, Germany. Tel: 921-20221 Interest this year focuses on a string of debuts. The east German dramatist Heiner Muller tackles his first-ever opera production, Tristan und Isolde, to be designed by another Bayreuth debutant, Erich Wonder. After a decade as Bayreuth's reigning Kundry, Waltraud Meier attempts the soprano heights of Isolde, while Siegfried Jerusalem tackles his first Tristan. Daniel Barenboim returns to conduct his second Bayreuth Tristan. In Parsifal, the new Kundry is Deborah Polaski, while Poul Elming and Linda Finnie join the cast of Lohengrin. BERGEN June 2 - 15 Bergen International Festival, Box 183, 5001 Bergen, Norway. Tel 5-216100 Fax 5-315531 Bergen is celebrating two landmarks - the 40th birthday of its festival, and the 150th anniversary of its most famous son, Edvard Grieg. The Norwegian Ballet presents two new Grieg ballets, while orchestras from Bergen and Trondheim play the major symphonic works. The festival also showcases leading Norwegian instrumentalists - including cellist Truls Mork, pianist Leif Ove Andsnes and violinist Arve Tellefsen. Dmitri Kitaenko conducts a Schnittke world premiere, English National Opera gives two performances of Jonathan Miller's mafioso production of Rigoletto and Ingmar Bergman brings his Stockholm production of Ibsen's Peer Gynt. BERLIN August 31 - September 30 Berliner Festspiele, Kartenburo, Budapester Strasse 50, D-1000 Berlin 30, Germany. Tel: 30-254890. Fax: 30-254 8911 This year's festival is a meeting point between Europe and Japan, with performances by the Tokyo Ballet, the New Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo, traditional Kabuki and Noh theatre companies and other Japanese ensembles. There are concerts conducted by Abbado, Ashkenazy, Barenboim, Maazel, Norrington, Sanderling and Tennstedt, plus Beethoven piano recitals by Brendel and Pollini, and a visit from the Paris-based Peter Brook Company with L'homme qui, the British director's latest theatre piece. BREGENZ July 20 - August 23 Bregenzer Festpiele, A-6901 Bregenz, Postfach 311. Tel: (5574) 4920-228 The opera festival on the Austrian corner of Lake Constance continues to solidify its connection with front-rank British opera producers. This year's operas are Nabucco on the floating stage, in a production by David Pountney, and Giordano's Fedora indoors, in a Jonathan Miller production with Mara Zampieri. BUXTON July 14 - August 1 Buxton Opera House, Buxton, SK17 6XN Turbulence behind the scenes preceded the finalising of this year's programme: Jane Glover departed from the post of Artistic Director before actually occupying it, in circumstances of some controversy. With her departed an attractive-looking opera-plan; what replaces it has - intentionally but at the same time disappointingly - a bought-in look: a Jonathan Miller production of Cimarosa's Secret Marriage borrowed from Opera North, and another Miller production (distinctly mediocre and poorly cast) of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda borrowed from Monte Carlo Opera. Buxton's days as a source of home-generated festival-opera excitements seem to be gone for good. CHELTENHAM July 3 - 18 Festival Box Office, Town Hall, Cheltenham GL50 1QA. Tel: 0242-523690 An exciting 'first' for Cheltenham - the specially-commissioned premiere of Michael Berkeley's first opera, the Kipling-inspired Baa Baa Black Sheep (given by Opera North) - ties in with an Cheltenham ambitious project, the larger examination of works by both composing Berkeleys, Michael and his late father Lennox (a long-time Cheltenham favourite). Among the many other British composers prominently featured are Nigel Osborne, David Blake and John Casken; otherwise, the mixture of orchestral and chamber music has the familiar Cheltenham profile. COVENT GARDEN May 17 - 31 29 Shelton Street, London WC2H 9PU. Tel: (0839-600-600 for info,and 071-497-9977, bookings) This London enterprise started small, has grown increasingly ambitious and, in 1993, with sponsorship from BOC, spreads itself out in various Covent Garden locations. Siting a new Magic Flute production (conducted by Jane Glover) in Freemasons' Hall and one of the G &amp; S Trial by Jury in the Bow Street Magistrates' Court may prove to be brilliant feats of imagination or else mere gimmicks; but the two-week programme is also filled with fare, mainly opera- or voice-oriented, of solider, simpler attractions - such as Monteverdi's Vespers; Purcell's Fairy Queen; Handel's Belshazzar; and young singers in recital, all in St Paul's Church, and several music-theatre programmes by bold young companies in the Donmar Warehouse. DRESDEN May 20 - June 6 Direktion Dresdner Musikfestspiele, Postfach 6, D-8016 Dresden. Tel 351-486 6666 The appointment of Michael Hampe as festival director, together with Dresden's suitability as a festival setting, augurs well for the future, but this year's programme is hampered by lack of funds and hotel accommodation. The emphasis is on dance, with guest productions by Nederlands Dans Theater; Polski Teatr Tanca; Lar Lubovitch Dance Company; the Stuttgart Ballet; and Bavarian State Ballet. Peter Ustinov stages a double-bill of Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Rakhmaninov's Francesca da Rimini. Visiting orchestras include the Royal Philharmonic and Hungarian National Philharmonic, while the Dresden Staatskapelle offers a Strauss and Schumann programme under Sinopoli. The festival's most enchanting venues are the former court palaces and country houses outside Dresden. DROTTNINGHOLM May 20 - September 4 Drottningholms Teatermuseum 'Forestallnigar', Box 27050, S-102 51 Stockholm. Tel: 08-660-82-25 Elisabeth Soderstrom, much-loved Swedish soprano, takes over this year as artistic director of the world's most important 18th-century theatre still in action. Gretry's beautiful Zemire et Azor and Martn's Cosa rara are performed by the Drottningholm-based company, Haydn's Fedelta premiata by Stockholm Royal Opera forces; ballet and recital programmes fill out the schedule of the first Soderstrom-devised festival season. EAST MIDLANDS DANCE FOR '93 May 20 - 23; and August 31 - September 4 Derngate Theatre, 19 Guildhall Rd, Northampton, NN1 1dp. TEL: 0604-26222 The excellent and lively Derngate Theatre will host a variety of dance performances this summer as part of the Dance for '93 celebrations in the East Midlands. Events will include the Royal Ballet of Flanders with Dracular May 20-23; and Stars of American Ballet from 31 August-4 September. EDINBURGH August 15 - September 4 21 Market Street, Edinburgh EH1 1BW. Tel: 031-225-5756. Fax: 031-226-7669 Edinburgh looks in particularly good shape this year. The 1992 Festival made a large enough surplus to pay off the accumulated deficit and the early bookings for 1993 are surprisingly heavy. This is excellent news for Brian McMaster who had to throw his first festival together quickly last summer, but is able to present a more considered programme this year. The international element is all pervading. Music: Given McMaster's background running Welsh National Opera it is hardly surprising that the music programme is particularly strong. The main theme is a juxtaposition of the music of Janacek and Schubert, through 13 concerts and recitals, culminating in a concert performance of Janacek's first opera Sarka and Schubert's rarely performed opera Die Freunde von Salamanka. There is a small homage to Verdi, with a concert performance of his first opera, Oberto, and Peter Stein's production for the WNO of his last, Falstaff. In addition Scottish Opera is presenting a new I Due Foscari, and there is a performance of the Requiem. A third strand is an exhaustive look at the work of the young Scottish composer James MacMillan. Other music includes the UK debut of the Canadian Opera Company with a double bill of Schoenberg's Erwartung and Bartok's Bluebeard's Castle, directed by the notorious Robert Lepage, and visits from the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Oslo Philharmonic and the South West German Radio Symphony Orchestra. Theatre: The drama slot is also impressive this year and very international, with four of the world's leading directors mounting productions. In addition to Lepage's operatic double bill, the American director Peter Sellars is responsible for The Persians, a modern version of Aeschylus' tragedy by Robert Auletta, and Robert Wilson is bringing over the Hebbel Theater of Berlin in Gertrude Stein's 1938 version of the Faust legend, Dr Faustus Lights the Lights. The Persians is a co-production with the Salzburg Festival, and perhaps the biggest event of this year's Edinburgh was also seen at Salzburg last year: this is Peter Stein's production, in German, of Julius Caesar. With 200 extras for the crowd scenes this needs a big venue and for the first time the Festival is using the Royal Highland Exhibition Hall at Ingliston. At least 2,000 tiered seats will be installed. McMaster is keen to put a spotlight on overlooked playwrights. Last year Granville-Barker got the treatment; this year the German Jakob Lenz, a contemporary of Goethe, is singled out, with the Glasgow Citizens presenting The Soldiers and two other Lenz works done by London's Gate Theatre. Visual Arts: This has always been the weak link at Edinburgh, with the local art institutions doing their own thing and largely ignoring the Festival. McMaster has put his resources behind one large show, The Waking Dream: Photography's First Century. It is the property of the Gilman Paper Company and reckoned to be the greatest private photography collection in the world. The show comes from the Met in New York and goes on to St Petersburg; this is its only British viewing. Dance: Edinburgh Festival treats dance shabbily yet again this year, with only two dance companies. The good news is that the Mark Morris troupe returns, after last year's success, with the ravishing Love Song Waltzes at the Playhouse (August 17,18,19 evenings) with a fine quartet of singers also in attendance, and shows new Morris pieces on the evenings of August 21, 22, and 23. On August 28 and 29, the Bill T. Jones troupe will be on view at the King's Theatre. Extras: Scottish Variety Theatre hopes to recapture the 'Fabulous Fifties', the last days of the music hall, with appearances by Jimmy Logan, Walter Carr, the Tiller Girls, and others. Late night events include traditional Scottish story telling, Catalan protest songs by Lluis Llach, and French songs from Felicity Lott.</p>

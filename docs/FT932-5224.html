			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand rejects farmers' plea for flea THE NEW Zealand govern-ment yesterday refused to bow to demands from farmers to introduce the myxomatosis flea. The farmers say the flea is needed to kill millions of rabbits which are devastating parts of the South Island's alpine country, but the government argues that it might endanger the native bird, the kiwi. Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture, said it was possible that the myxomatosis flea would also attack the kiwi, the flightless bird that is New Zealand's national symbol. 'And I don't want that on my conscience,' he said. It had been a difficult decision, he said, and he knew it would enrage South Island farmers. 'But we simply could not guarantee that there was no risk to the kiwi.' 'It is known that unlike other birds, the kiwi has the same body temperature as the rabbit, and parts of body are covered with hair-like feathers that are very similar to rabbit fur.' Mr Falloon promised that the government would spend an additional NZDollars 1.3m (Pounds 460,000) on the search for other ways to to cope with the exploding rabbit population and with the high cost of alternative pest control measures. Rabbits are causing multi-million-dollar losses to South Island high country farmers through erosion.</p>

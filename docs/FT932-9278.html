			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: High price of buying in UK Sir, The current controversy over compact disc pricing in the UK versus the US is not the only pricing issue for which we should feel some vexation. Returning last week from Tampa, Florida, with a local paper shows me that tyres for my car quoted in the UK at a discount rate of Pounds 120 each are readily available at an advertised rate of Dollars 86.95, excluding tax, in both cases. On the face of it less than half UK cost. A domestic washing machine compares approximately at the same numerical price in sterling as in US dollars. My customers in the US are satisfied that the FOB (freight on board) UK prices for electronic component hardware leaving this factory are the same to UK customers. Meanwhile we pay through the nose for essential items such as tyres and domestic appliances, not to mention cars, made in Europe if not UK. Who's kidding who? W H Wilkes, managing director, Redpoint, Swindon, Wiltshire</p>

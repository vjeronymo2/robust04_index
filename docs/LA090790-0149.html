			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TODAY  </P> <P> Southern Section  </P> <P> Canyon (1-0) vs. Hart (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At College of the Canyons: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> This isn't as much a game as it is an event in the Santa Clarita Valley. "Wait  till you see it," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. "In this community, you will  be there." Canyon has added more intrigue to the rivalry with its stunning 40-0  win over Honolulu St. Louis at Aloha Stadium last week, snapping that school's  55-game winning streak. Tailback David McDivitt, coming back from a severe  concussion suffered over the summer, rushed for 207 yards against a defense  that allowed just 178 rushing yards in 1989. But in Hart, Canyon faces size,  speed and talent and a team the Cowboys have not beaten in three years. Mike  Herrington, in his second year as Hart coach, is trying to become the first  Hart coach to defeat Canyon twice in a row since Welch arrived at Canyon nine  years ago. Hart senior lineman Tim DeGroote (6-foot-3, 260 pounds) is a  potential high school All-American and George Kase (6-3, 220) has a  school-record 18 sacks as an end and also will play tight end this year. Even  Welch appreciates Kase's style, calling him a "wild, crazy and marvelous  football player." Hart quarterback Ryan Connors, who led the sophomore team to  the Foothill League title last season, will make his varsity debut before an  expected crowd of about 8,000.  </P> <P> Westlake (0-0) vs. Buena (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At Ventura High: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Last year, Buena won this shoot-out, 35-30. Again, it could be a high-scoring  affair. Westlake's potent offense is led by senior quarterback Todd Preston,  who has thrown for 3,152 yards and 25 touchdowns in two seasons. Seamus  Gibbons, who caught 36 passes last year, was projected as Westlake's  multipurpose offensive threat but has been slowed by a knee injury. He is  expected to play but is not in top condition. Receiver Erik Holcomb (34  receptions) and tight end Dave Monheim (31) provide Preston with reliable  targets. Buena lost many of its skill players from last year's 6-5 team that  finished second in the Channel League. But the Bulldogs have a large,  experienced offensive line that is led by tackles Steve Sawyer (6-3, 260) and  Phil Kurta (6-2, 220), center Greg Lyle (6-1, 195), and guards Pat Kelly (5-11,  225) and Brent Tingle (5-9, 175). "We expect them to have a solid offense and  aggressive defense," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks (0-0) vs. San Marcos (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At San Marcos: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks has the Marmonte League's toughest nonleague schedule, and it  kicks off with the Royals, who should be strong contenders for the Channel  League title. Thousand Oaks also will play host to Buena, another Channel  League contender, and will travel to Canyon, the Golden League favorite. "It's  just a killer schedule," Coach Bob Richards said. Yet the Lancers, the  defending Marmonte champions, are expected to hold their own. Offensively,  Thousand Oaks is led by quarterback Scott Peterson, tailback Cory Bowen and  receiver Jeff Watts. Richards says the Lancers' traditionally strong defense  might begin the season slowly because of inexperience. But Richards also  believes that the Lancers will have a potent offense from the start. San Marcos  is led by tailback Mark Castelo, a 5-10, 175-pound senior who rushed for 1,700  yards and 22 touchdowns as a junior. Quarterback David Lopez was a second-team  all-league pick last season and is considered the league's best at his  position.  </P> <P> Camarillo (0-0) vs. Oxnard (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At Oxnard: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Camarillo has not beaten Oxnard since 1984, when the Scorpions won the Coastal  Conference championship and handed the Yellowjackets a 49-7 defeat in the  second round of the playoffs. Oxnard has beaten Camarillo five consecutive  times, but that streak might end because Camarillo has its most talented team  in five years. Tight end Eric Swendemen (6-4, 225) and two-way tackle Eric  Jensen (6-3, 220) are attracting Division I interest. Senior quarterback Corey  Tucker will lead a wishbone offense with the aid of sophomore tailback Fehel  Campbell and junior fullback Tag Johnson. Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson says  Johnson (5-11, 200) is the best fullback Camarillo has had in at least five  years. Oxnard's dynamic duo of fullback Bryant Taylor and quarterback Johnel  Turner, who accounted for more than 2,000 rushing yards last season, has moved  on to Moorpark College. But senior tailback Kenyon Lewis (6-2, 190) is one of  the best backs in the Channel League. Larry Bumpus, a sophomore, will start at  quarterback for the Yellowjackets, who are inexperienced and expected to finish  in the bottom half of the league standings. "They're supposed to be a little  down, but they're a big school and they always have a lot of speed," Thompson  said. "I'm sure they'll come up with a very good team."  </P> <P> Redlands (0-0) vs. Crespi (1-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At Pierce College: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> After defeating Kahuku High, 21-14, in Honolulu last week, Crespi will turn its  attention to Redlands, ranked third in the preseason Southern Section Division  I poll. "We've been so busy since we got back that we haven't had the time to  focus on them," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. But expect Redlands tailback Marcus  Rogers to be foremost on Lins' mind tonight. The 6-0, 155-pound senior, a  Division I choice at defensive back, gained 177 yards and scored both  touchdowns in the Terriers' victory over Crespi in last season's opener.  Cornerback Shawn Collins (6-0, 155), whose brother Mark is a cornerback for the  New York Giants, quarterback Julian Burrola (6-1, 178) and fullback Mike Dragna  (5-8, 175) also return for Redlands. Crespi will rely on the arm of junior Cody  Smith, who completed 14 of 25 passes for 195 yards and three touchdowns against  Kahuku. Wide receiver Ryan Kieling caught eight passes for 104 yards and two  touchdowns against Kahuku and sophomore tailback Torie Lee rushed for 89 yards  and had two receptions, including a 45-yard catch in the fourth quarter for the  winning score.  </P> <P> Lynwood (0-0) vs. Notre Dame (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At Notre Dame: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> As far as preseason tests go, Lynwood will be more like a final exam for Notre  Dame. First-year Lynwood Coach Bob Carpenter inherits 14 starters from last  year's 5-5 team, which handed Division III champion Paramount its only loss  last season. "They've got a good group of athletes," Notre Dame Coach Kevin  Rooney said. Lynwood figures to be Paramount's major challenger in the San  Gabriel Valley League and is ranked eighth in the preseason Division II poll.  "They run a lot of the option and it's difficult to defend. We can't give up  the big plays." Rooney is especially concerned with the quickness of Eugene  Jackson (5-10, 175), an All-Division III selection at defensive back last  season who will start at quarterback, and running back Theodore Anderson (5-10,  180). Lynwood's offensive line will be anchored by 6-5, 270-pound William  Goode. Notre Dame's defense will rely on returning ends Anthony Rodgriguez  (6-2, 190) and Paul Garcia (6-4, 217) and newcomer junior Greg Winter (5-10,  170). Steve Colella (6-5, 205) will start his first varsity game at quarterback  for Notre Dame, but he has been impressive in summer passing leagues. Kirk  Miller (6-1, 185), who averaged 22 yards a reception last season, and Vinnie  Orlando (6-0, 170) will be Colella's primary targets.  </P> <P> Newbury Park (0-0) vs. Chaminade (0-0-1), nonleague  </P> <P> At Chaminade: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Chaminade defense was its best offense in its opener in Hawaii last week.  The Eagles needed a fumble recovery by Bill Blair in the final two minutes  against Konawaena to forge a 6-6 tie but missed an opportunity to win when Amy  Cook missed the extra point. And the Chaminade offense, which gained only 198  yards and had five turnovers, was its own worst enemy. Quarterback Jeff Meyer  (6-0, 180) passed for 126 yards but threw two interceptions. Newbury Park Coach  George Hurley considers the Panthers' defense to be his team's strength -- as  it was last season. John Obringer (6-0, 195), Jeff Epstein (6-3, 220), Sean  McKeown (6-3, 220) and nose tackle Todd Bisacchi (5-10, 195) are the mainstays  of the defensive line. Offensively, Newbury Park shows promise at the skill  positions with wide receiver Jason Smith (5-6, 150) and running back Walter  Thomas (5-6, 150). Quarterback Zak Sutton (5-7, 140) is untested but has shown  potential during summer passing leagues.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep (0-1) vs. St. Monica (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At Culver City High: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Montclair Prep is without its superstar tailback Derek Sparks. On  Wednesday, Derek and his cousin, Leland Sparks, were pulled out of school by  their uncle, Jerome, and apparently will return home to Texas. Montclair Prep  is left with a gigantic hole in the backfield. Coach George Giannini's  response? "I would think that any good young football player in the San  Fernando Valley who would like to gain 2,000 yards this year would apply to  Montclair Prep," he said. Until those applications start flowing, Giannini will  go with either Greg Cole or Eliel Swinton at tailback. Swinton, a sophomore, is  the younger brother of Washington State standout running back Rich Swinton, a  Montclair Prep graduate. Fullback Neimad Durham is doubtful because of an ankle  injury. The Mounties lost their opener, 28-7, to Farrington High of Hawaii.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill (0-0) vs. South Bakersfield (0-0), nonleague  </P> <P> At South Bakersfield: 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Quartz Hill quarterback position, in doubt at the start of practice, has  been won by junior Jake Haro, who "looked really good in practice," according  to Coach John Albee. Quartz Hill defeated South Bakersfield last year, 17-0, at  Quartz Hill. South Bakersfield, a powerhouse a few years back, has not been as  strong of late. Still, Albee says, "it should be a real good opener for us."  </P></p>

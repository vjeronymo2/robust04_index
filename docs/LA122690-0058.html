			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWL GAMES;  </P> <P> HE DOESN'T THROW HIS WEIGHT AROUND;  </P> <P> FREEDOM: OREGON DEFENSIVE END LABOUNTY RELIES ON TECHNIQUE AND SPEED RATHER  THAN SIZE TO BECOME TEAM'S ALL-TIME SACK LEADER.  </P> <P> Matt LaBounty's story is an old one. Maybe it's corny and, in these  recruiting-mad days, unlikely. But it's all his.  </P> <P> The University of Oregon coaching staff found him by accident. Studying the  films of a prized recruit, they kept noticing this skinny guy from the other  team making all the big plays.  </P> <P> Soon enough, they forgot about the first player and began to focus on LaBounty,  then a 6-foot-4, 210-pound offensive lineman for San Marin High in Novato.  </P> <P> LaBounty was all over the field, knocking people down, getting up and doing it  again on the next play.  </P> <P> Well, the coaches said, if we could get a little meat on those bones and drill  him with some solid technique, we might be able to make something out of him.  </P> <P> They plotted further: We'll have to get him off the offensive line, maybe to  defensive end.  </P> <P> The best part? No one else showed much interest. He was theirs for the taking.  </P> <P> He was an all-league offensive lineman his senior season at San Marin, but only  Washington State and Oregon State showed even lukewarm interest before Oregon.  </P> <P> Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, having seen him only only on film, decided to take a  closer look and arranged for LaBounty to visit Eugene. One look around the  campus, and LaBounty, still surprised anyone was interested, was sold.  </P> <P> LaBounty became Oregon's career sack leader in 1990. He also has been named  second-team All-Pacific 10 Conference.  </P> <P> A junior, he has managed to gain a few pounds along the way, beefing up to 251.  Oregon coaches no longer refer to LaBounty as their "scrawny" defensive end.  Now, he's "undersized."  </P> <P> Brooks will also call him surprising, along with aggressive, durable and tough.  </P> <P> LaBounty has started 23 consecutive games at defensive end. He will be trying  to improve his school-record 20 1/2 career sacks in start No. 24 when Oregon  plays Colorado State Dec. 29 in the Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> He has done this despite being outweighed by at least 40 pounds -- often it's  50 or 60 -- in every game.  </P> <P> "I can't really say he's ever been dominated, even when he was a redshirt  freshman," Brooks said before a recent practice at UC Irvine. "He still runs  around like he weighs 210. Even though he's bigger now, he hasn't lost any  speed."  </P> <P> Without great girth, LaBounty gets by on technique. Often, he is tougher on  himself than opposing quarterbacks.  </P> <P> "It just kills him when he doesn't do something right," Brooks said.  </P> <P> Some ends overpower offensive linemen on their way to a sack or a tackle.  LaBounty simply is not strong enough, or big enough.  </P> <P> So he studies films all hours of the night, stays as low as possible and runs  around opposing linemen instead of trying to go through them.  </P> <P> "Basically, I got here by luck," LaBounty said. "I don't know how to explain  it."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but now that he has arrived, there is no holding him back.  </P> <P> In last season's Independence Bowl, LaBounty chased Tulsa quarterback T.J.  Rubley from sideline to sideline, forcing an incomplete pass. Oregon, playing  its first bowl game since 1963, won, 27-24. LaBounty finished his sophomore  season with 6 1/2 sacks.  </P> <P> LaBounty's 10 sacks this season are two short of the school record of 12 set by  Mike Walter in 1982. The Ducks have set a school team mark with 39.  </P> <P> None was bigger than LaBounty's sack of UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox late in  the Nov. 3 game at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.  </P> <P> Oregon had stopped UCLA's rushing game, eventually limiting the Bruins to 71  yards. But Maddox passed for 332 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Late in the game, he was moving UCLA toward another score when LaBounty slipped  past center Aron Gideon and dropped Maddox. It gave LaBounty the school career  record and helped preserve a 28-24 victory.  </P> <P> And to think his only goal has been to start for three seasons at Oregon.  </P> <P> "I'm just so thankful to be playing," he said. "Everybody in college knows  somebody they played with who would have given their right arm to play college  ball.  </P> <P> "I couldn't ask for more, except maybe to play in the Rose Bowl. And I still  have a chance to do that next year."  </P> <P> LaBounty still remembers his high school days, when he tried all summer to add  bulk.  </P> <P> He once weighed 220 going into the season, but the extra pounds melted away  during two-a-day workouts and he dropped to 207.  </P> <P> "It was all just fat," he said, laughing.  </P> <P> There was something more beneath the fat, even if LaBounty couldn't recognize  it.  </P> <P> "When I watch my high school films," he said, "I don't know what they saw."  </P> <P> Most likely, it was simply potential.  </P></p>

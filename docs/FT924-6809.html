			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ACT metamorphosis attracts admirers - Profits of up to Pounds 10m are expected from the computer group ANYONE wakening from a decade-long slumber might wonder what the fuss over ACT Group is all about. The Birmingham-based computing services company is expected today to release interim figures showing growth and profitability that would be the envy of larger competitors. Nothing very unusual about that, the erstwhile sleeper might think. ACT was always a quality stock. But in those ten years the sleeper would have missed a remarkable metamorphosis. The company has gone from computing services to hardware manufacturing under the Apricot banner and back again to computing services under its original name, the barely profitable hardware arm disposed of to Mitsubishi Electric of Japan. The quality of the company's earnings over the past 30 months is convincing observers that ACT is fast becoming a kind of computing services company new to the UK; a supplier of packaged software with a range of products international in appeal and broad enough to protect its profitability in the worst trading environment the industry has ever experienced. It is expected to announce pre-tax profits of between Pounds 9.5m and Pounds 10m, up as much as 30 per cent on the same period last year, which itself was boosted by Pounds 1m from the sale of shares in SD-Scicon, another services company, to Electronic Data Systems. European services companies have traditionally been weak in the package business, having neither the homogeneous market nor economies of scale (or, sadly, the money-spinning ideas) which have been the keys to the success of US packaged software companies like Microsoft or Lotus. There are only a few exceptions: Micro Focus of the UK, whose software engineering tools are the justification for its Pounds 24-plus share price, or SAP of Germany whose corporate accounting package is used by a clutch of international companies. ACT, however, now derives more than half its profits from the package business. Through a combination of internal development and acquisition, it has built up a portfolio of products in a diversity of market sectors. The City seems encouraged to believe that ACT has got the recipe right, predicting pre-tax profits for the full-year of about Pounds 22m on sales of more than Pounds 150m, the second year in succession in which profits will have risen by about 30 per cent. Results of that order would put ACT on an unambitious prospective p/e of about 15, in line with the sector average. ACT operates in five very different areas: finance, healthcare, the public sector, corporate networks and computer support. Computer support - essentially hardware and software maintenance - is a mature business growing slowly but providing a steady revenue stream. Networking is expanding vigorously, but revenue growth is affected by the falling cost of hardware. The market for finance and healthcare packages, however, is growing rapidly, a phenomenon ACT has exploited through a series of shrewd, sometimes opportunistic acquisitions. Financial services, the company's strongest suit, generated 30 per cent of total revenues in 1991 and substantially more is expected this year. In 1991 ACT bought Kindle, Ireland's largest software house, and the City of London firm, Quotient. NMW, the stock processing company, went earlier this year to ACT for Pounds 3.8m, representing 18p a share, or 43 per cent of the price prior to the bid, a reflection both of NMW's problems and a sharp rise in the company's price as rumours of the bid spread. Quotient had a string of overseas offices, but Mr Roger Foster, ACT chairman and founder, says the Pounds 34m Kindle acquisition took the company out of its traditional role of developing departmental systems for banks and insurance companies and into the emerging financial centres of the Middle and Far East and retail banking packages. Through Quotient and Kindle, ACT took the critical step to become an international software company. Mr John Patterson, electronics industry analyst with Albert E Sharp, ACT's broker, points out that the group now has 10 developed financial software packages which could be sold in seven different countries, a matrix of 70 marketing opportunities, of which ACT is currently exploiting 28. 'There is still an enormous amount to go for,' he says. An example is the pioneering sale of ACT Citydesk market information delivery system to Kemper Securities Group in Chicago. ACT Medisys, a Pounds 13m healthcare operation, is small compared with financial services, but growing vigorously. It develops 'open software' applications which run on a wide range of hardware under the Unix operating system. It acquired Stemm Computing, which supplied patient management and administrative systems for hospital departments in 1991 and Medical Computer Services, which provides software for private sector hospitals, in 1992. The vigour of the financial and healthcare sectors is at least partially explained by the effects of recession. Both have turned increasingly to packages rather than expensive tailor-made software as the financial situation has tightened. Logsys, its public sector systems operation, is a sizeable problem for ACT. It is expected that it will have lost money in the first half of the year. The problem, according to Mr Mike Hart, group managing director, is speed of change. Logsys was a supplier of computer hardware, typically Apricot, to government departments, a low margin business and an increasingly unprofitable one as government moved to direct procurement from manufacturers. ACT's answer has been to transform Logsys into a systems integration company, a specialist in linking equipment from different vendors into sophisticated information technology systems. This has meant 18 months of pain as people and skills have had to be changed. Mr Hart says there is light at the end of the tunnel, however. The division has already secured contracts worth Pounds 4m a year in connection with Department of Social Security projects. Can ACT maintain its momentum and become as Mr Richard Holway, editor of the Holway Report and a seasoned observer of the computing services business, suggests the 'most profitable UK computing services company?' It still has some Pounds 20m cash from the Apricot disposal to spend on acquisitions and there is no sign that the present management is tiring of the struggle. Analysts believe the company is tightly managed and that Mr Foster is worth the Pounds 273,000 he was paid in 1991, putting him at the top of Holway's league table of computing services salaries. Mr Foster says he believes ACT's progress is due to strong management at head office and in the branches and a strong team aimed at mergers and acquisitions.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo sailing close to the wind / A look at the twists and turns in the Renault merger deal It took almost two tense months, but a dogged battle by Volvo to fend off what at times appeared to be an unstoppable tide of opinion against the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault finally began to pay off yesterday. The decision by two of its largest Swedish institutional shareholders to vote for the deal at a special shareholder's meeting on December 7 followed a period of non-stop behind-the-scenes lobbying. It included two long statements of further information for shareholders, intense negotiations with the French government and, finally, a trip by private jet to Paris on Wednesday for shareholder representatives to meet Renault chiefs and Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. Even after a press conference on Monday, when Volvo played its trump card of new French promises on Renault's privatisation and a virtual exemption from a subsequent state golden share, the outlook remained at best uncertain. On Wednesday, the Fifth Fund state pension fund said it would still vote against the deal. Directors of institutions continued privately to criticise the lack of detail they had been given on the valuation of the Renault and Volvo assets in the agreement. Yesterday, Svenska Dagbladet, the respected conservative daily newspaper which has been a leading critic of the merger, called again for it to be voted down. Although the prospects for Volvo now look better, the company is well aware how close to the wind it has sailed - illustrated by the eight-six split in the benchmark decision to support the deal by the board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, Volvo's biggest Swedish shareholder. Mr Per Lojdquist, the head of investor relations at Volvo, acknowledged the narrow margin of opinion. He said what was decisive was the assurances received from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on his intention to privatise Renault by the end of 1994 and the promise not to use a golden share to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent holding in the merged company. 'When we talked to the various stakeholders, privatisation and the golden share were the two dominating concerns - and we have answered them,' he said. However, even if Volvo now achieves the solid majority in favour of the merger that looked in grave jeopardy, the shareholder revolt will continue to have repercussions for the company. Privately, institutional shareholders are determined to play a less passive role than in the past, when they have traditionally stood back while Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, for 22 years the chief executive or chairman of Volvo, dominated the company, diversifying it beyond cars and trucks and ultimately building the controversial alliance with Renault. He intends to remain as non-executive chairman in the Volvo parent company from January 1, while taking on the job of chairman of the so-called supervisory board of the new Renault-Volvo. Many shareholders would like to see him hand over full control at Volvo to Mr Soren Gyll, the widely-respected chief executive. The Fourth Fund yesterday indicated that it wanted a bigger role for shareholders in nominating the Volvo board. 'I think it would be much better for Volvo if Soren Gyll took over. I don't like the idea of Gyllenhammar being chairman of both Volvo and the new company,' said one senior shareholder yesterday. Volvo officials acknowledged that the merger issue had caused much disquiet within the company, with the white collar unions and the civil engineers coming out strongly against the move under Renault's wing. 'If the shareholders vote yes, we can't just sit back. It will cause damage if we don't have the employees with us as well,' Volvo said.</p>

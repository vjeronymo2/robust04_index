The Qaidam Basin, one of the country's three major inland  basins, covering an area of about 200,000 sq km, has 33 salt  lakes in it. The salt reserves of various kinds and reserves of  minerals are estimated to have a potential value of more than  10,000 billion yuan.    With the intensified use of advanced technology for  processing and production over the past years, more than 50  processing and production enterprises, which have not long been  established there, now turn out a dozen kinds of edible salt, as  well as producing scores of quality chemical salt products.    Products of these enterprises now sell well in 23 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions across the Chinese  mainland, with the annual output value reaching 350 million yuan.    The Qaidam Basin has also been cooperating with an Israeli  company for the building of a project on a cooperative basis,  with the purpose of further tapping resources buried in salt  lakes in the basin.    The cooperative project, with an intended annual production  capacity of 800,000 tons of potash fertilizer, will raise the  present production capacity of 200,000 tons of potash  fertilizers of the entire basin to one million tons when the  project is finished in 1997, according to local officials.</p>

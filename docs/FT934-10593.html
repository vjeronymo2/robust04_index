			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz shrugs off loss LOSSES at Daimler-Benz, the German automotive, aerospace and electrical engineering group, deepened to around DM2bn (Dollars 1.18bn) in the first nine months of this year. The group, however, yesterday forecast a clear improvement in the closing quarter, and claimed the positive trend would continue into 1994. The group attributed the expected progress to the 'positive sales situation' for Mercedes-Benz cars, and the effects of this year's hefty provisions for restructuring and 44,000 job cuts. The DM2bn loss, calculated according to US accounting rules adopted for Daimler's recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange, includes a charge of DM1.5bn. The first-half deficit, on the same basis, was DM949m. Under German accounting standards, the group made a net loss of approximately DM180m in the first three quarters, after a DM168m profit at the halfway mark. Precise figures will be published on December 14, the company said. Analysts, still digesting Tuesday's hints of a dividend cut from Daimler chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, were puzzled by yesterday's figures and promises of improvement. However, most still assumed a group loss of around DM2bn for the full year. Observers said the June introduction of the C-Class Mercedes car would bolster volume sales, but that its relatively low price - unchanged from its predecessor's - would do less for profits. Overall demand in the European car market is not expected to pick up before mid-1994 at the earliest. Meanwhile, rumblings of discontent over closures and job losses continued among the group's workers. A leading employee representative said yesterday the management of the Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary had chosen a 'confrontation strategy'. He demanded the scrapping of a plan to close six factories and other sites. Mr Erwin Hilbrink, a member of the Dasa supervisory board, claimed the company had withdrawn an offer to discuss possible alternatives to the closures. Mr Reuter's veiled suggestion of a dividend reduction, apparently made to demonstrate that shareholders should share some of the sacrifices demanded of the workforce, weighed down Daimler shares yesterday. The stock shed DM9 to close at DM743.</p>

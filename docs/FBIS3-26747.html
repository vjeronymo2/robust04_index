As a major waterway in South China, Pearl River consists  mainly of four water systems: the Western River, Northern River,  Eastern River and Delta Zhuhe River with annual flowing volume  ranking second in the country, after the Chang Jiang River, the  country's longest.    The river constitutes an important hydro-power production  base in the country.    The plan is aimed at enhancing the river's anti-flood  capacity, including construction of embankments and reservoirs  to ensure the safety of major cities such as Guangzhou and  Nanning in the flood period.</p>

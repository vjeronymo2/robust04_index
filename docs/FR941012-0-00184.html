			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters discussed the status of a routing designation pending a preemption determination, with three recommending the use of an administrative stay until the determination is issued. Another recommended the interim status of a routing designation be decided by the FHWA. Two commenters recommended an administrative appeals process. The FHWA believes no changes are necessary because the procedures in 49 CFR part 397, subpart E, maintain the status of a highway routing pending a preemption determination and provide for administrative reconsideration and judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA, in considering all the comments and the current provisions in subpart E of 49 CFR part 397, determined that the proposed provisions should be incorporated into the existing procedures in subpart E rather than being included as redundant procedures unique to this final rule. Consequently, &sect;397.79 Preemption determination procedure; &sect;397.81 Waivers of preemption; &sect;397.85 Timeliness; and &sect;397.87 Judicial review of preemption or waiver of preemption decision have been removed and this final rule has been amended to refer to the applicable sections of subpart E, and subpart E is amended to refer to the provisions of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public notification procedures were discussed by twenty-nine commenters. This included seventeen members of the shipper-carrier industry, five States, three Federal agencies, two local governments, one citizens' group and one consulting firm. Thirteen commenters discussed public participation. Highway users tended to recommend more public notification through publications, such as newspapers or the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , while two government agencies recommended reducing the publication requirements because of costs. Additionally, five commenters discussed public hearing requirements and recommended providing an opportunity for a public hearing rather than requiring a public hearing. The FHWA has revised the regulation to grant States and Indian tribes discretion to hold public hearings on proposed NRHM routing designations after providing the public with notice and an opportunity to comment. The FHWA also believes publication of the notice for both the comment period and the public hearing, if one is held, to be most appropriately administered at the State and Indian tribe level, through publications, such as the official register of the State regulations, rather than through publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting of Routing Designations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ten commenters discussed the requirement for State and Indian tribes to report routing designations to the FHWA. The majority recommended the FHWA frequently publish new and existing route designations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Several also recommended that States and Indian tribes, as a prerequisite, be required to report their intention to establish a route designation to the FHWA for publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Upon further review, the FHWA determined it would be more practical and appropriate to provide some form of current information on established routing designations; consequently, the FHWA is considering alternative methods, such as establishing an electronic bulletin board, to update and provide this information to the public in a timely manner along with publishing annual lists of routing designations in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Signs, Maps and Lists of Routing Designations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ten commenters were concerned about the use and availability of road signs and maps. Highway users were generally in favor of requiring the use of road signs. They recommended that routing designations be enforceable only to the extent they are signed. Several States, notably California and Colorado, have successfully operated rather extensive and efficient routing systems through the use of lists and maps rather than signs. The requirement to sign all routing designations could also be a considerable administrative and economic burden for States which have or develop extensive routing designations. Therefore, the FHWA declines to adopt this suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

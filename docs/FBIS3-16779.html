The mayors fear that the new tariffs will endanger the  provision of food to the country's major cities. They cite  specialists who say that the decision on new rates will further  rupture traditional trade links between Russia and "near abroad"  and lead to an abrupt reduction of import food deliveries.    The three city leaders who signed the appeal believe that  the  aim pursued by the government -- to protect and support the  domestic agricultural producers -- will not be achieved. They  say that the domestic firms which supply food products to major  cities are abruptly reducing their activity and all the major  cities are already facing considerable shortages of the most  important foodstuffs.    The appeal stresses that the food market in the major cities  has dwindled dangerously, increasing the impoverishment of the  people.</p>

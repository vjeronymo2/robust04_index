			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVANGELICALS' CONFERENCE STRESSES NEW STRATEGIES  </P> <P> About 4,000 evangelical Christians opened a conference this week to forge new  strategies for spreading the faith in a rapidly changing world.  </P> <P> The goal is to preach to everyone in the world by the end of this century and  try to take advantage of political changes such as liberalization in the Soviet  Union and the growth of Christianity in developing countries.  </P> <P> Delegates to the 10-day convention, dubbed Lausanne II after a similar  gathering in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, represented 191 countries, making  it one of the largest gatherings of its kind, organizers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Opportunities Cited  </P> <P> In a keynote address, the Rev. Leighton Ford, chairman of the Lausanne  committee that is sponsoring the conference, said the evangelical movement is  facing new opportunities.  </P> <P> "Now, we wait expectantly to see what the new openness and longing for freedom  in our world -- as shown in the spirit of glasnost and the events in China --  will mean for the future of the Gospel," said Ford, a Canadian.  </P> <P> Ford said he welcomed delegates from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, East Germany, Romania, Cuba, Mozambique and other Communist countries  to the convention.  </P> <P> But another official said that the Soviet delegation had not arrived and that  the list of those who are in Manila had not been completed.  </P> <P> Ford also noted an increase in interest in evangelism among major Christian  denominations.  </P> <P> "Now, we do not hear the word moratorium, and many of these same historic  churches are rethinking the need for aggressive missionary outreach and some  have called for the '90s to be a decade of evangelism," said Ford, a  brother-in-law of the American evangelist, the Rev. Billy Graham.  </P> <P> Graham was set to speak at the Manila conference, but commitments in London  prevented him from coming, organizers said.  </P> <P> Ford said that by the year 2000, world evangelicals should be able to reach 2.5  billion people who have not heard the Gospel.  </P> <P> He also cited an increase in the number of missionaries from developing  countries and the need to face economic and social issues in spreading the  faith.  </P> <P> "(Before) our world was not quite so clearly aware of the 'troubles' in  Northern Ireland or of apartheid in South Africa, where the Gospel has been  wrapped in the sectarian robes of race and power," Ford said. "Now, we are  aware, and we stand with our brothers and sisters in those areas where they  seek to faithfully live and speak for Christ."  </P> <P> He told the delegates they must find ways to make the faith attractive to  people in widely differing parts of the world.  </P> <P> "Indians see Christ's peace in a way that Englishmen don't. Brazilians see it  in a way that Nigerians don't. Pacific Islanders see it in a way that Germans  don't," Ford said. "But as we focus in these next 10 days on Christ, we may  learn to proclaim his peace as he did."  </P> <P> Earlier, Thomas Wang, Lausanne II international director, said continued  suffering has helped in the steady growth of Christian churches in China since  the world's most populous country fell under Communist rule in 1949.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chinese Church Growth  </P> <P> "Suffering is one of the important reasons for churches to grow," said Wang, an  American. "I believe that has been the main reason for the Chinese churches to  grow from 800,000 members in 1949 to 50 million today."  </P> <P> China forced a halt to religious activity during the 1966-76 Cultural  Revolution but has since allowed churches to reopen.  </P> <P> Wang said about 300 Chinese church representatives had been expected to attend  the Manila conference, but China's crackdown on the democracy movement has made  it virtually impossible for Chinese to obtain exit visas.  </P> <P> Wang said he expected that seven Chinese church leaders who were outside China  when the crackdown began would attend.  </P></p>

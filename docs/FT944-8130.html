			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Shaky future for wage talks system: As the 1995 round starts, fewer workers are covered by it After last year's fractious wage round in Germany's trend-setting metal industry, the signs are that 1995 will be a comparatively peaceful affair. But the rhetorical blows are being exchanged with the usual gusto. The union, I G Metall, has demanded a 6 per cent pay rise following the restraint it it showed last year - accepting a 2 per cent rise which in turn led to a hefty drop in unit labour costs, thanks to big productivity increases in the economic upturn. Metal industry employers complain that the recovery still leaves German labour costs at the top of the world league. They are also making their own demands for an agreement which runs for two years and a postponement of the 35-hour week due to be introduced next October. Insiders on both sides expect a settlement around 3 per cent, a bit higher if a two-year deal is accepted. The pay negotiations usually begin in the autumn and end, sometimes acrimoniously, in the early spring. A smooth passage for the 1995 wage round does not, however, secure the long-term future of the German system of centralised pay bargaining system, as an increasing number of German companies, particularly in the east, fall outside its reach. Although the system has taken some of the credit for the country's post-war economic success it is now following a difficult path between flexibility and fragmentation. Not for nothing do union officials worry these days of a Japanese-style dual labour market developing in Germany, with a core of highly paid, secure workers covered by union agreements in big companies and a periphery of insecure, poorly paid workers in smaller companies which are not covered by agreements at all. A kind of two-tier system has long been in place. According to the IDW economic institute, average hourly pay for a blue-collar worker is about 8 per cent above the agreed minimum. But in some companies - such as Daimler-Benz - the average rate has been closer to 50 per cent above the basic. Officially, about 90 per cent of all employees in Germany are said to be covered by union-negotiated minimum rates, even though only about one third of employees are in unions. Privately, some union officials say the coverage of union agreements could now be as low as 65 or 70 per cent, with large parts of the service sector having grown up outside the system altogether. 'There are plenty of Handwerk (skilled trades) companies around here where people are getting paid about half the negotiated minimum for the metal industry,' according to one I G Metall official based near Hanover. The official said he did not wish his name to be quoted in case his comments should be interpreted as supporting employer-friendly arguments. Mr Joerg Barczynski, the I G Metall spokesman, claims that the metal industry employers exaggerate the number of companies who are not in the industry's bargaining association or are threatening to leave it. 'It is employer propaganda to frighten us into accepting whatever they offer,' he says. Mr Dieter Kirchner, head of Gesamtmetall, the metal industry employer association, disagrees. In a recent interview he warned that more and more companies were finding creative ways to avoid agreements by establishing subsidiaries outside the system. It is hard to know whom to believe. It is generally recognised that about one-third of metal industry employers are not in the association. Some are household names such as Volkswagen and Hewlett-Packard, which still recognise unions and have their own house agreements. Most are small and medium-sized companies who have never been in the association. A few well-known companies, such as Georg Fischer the engineering company in Baden-Wurttemberg, have left the metal industry association in recent years because of complaints of inflexibility over fringe benefits and working time. But a survey by the metal industry employers association in Hesse - conducted just before last year's wage round - found little evidence of companies deserting the system. Also, the greater influence of medium-sized employers in Gesamtmetall in the past two years has meant more stress on flexibility as well as strong downward pressure on some fringe benefits. An agreement - modelled on Volkswagen's - for cutting the hours and the wages of employees to avoid redundancies has been used by about 10 per cent of all companies in the past year. But if the line has been held in the west, it may be a very different story in the east. Mr Lutz Glasewald, an official of the DGB, the union umbrella body, in Cottbus, says a lot of companies are paying well under agreed rates. 'It is part of our job to sift out those who are not paying because they genuinely cannot afford to and those who are simply trying to squeeze out more profit,' he says. Mr Glasewald says most of the bigger companies in the metal industry and chemical industry associations do pay the minimum rates but more than half of the Handwerk companies, often suppliers to the bigger companies, are not in any association. This may be part of the necessary flexibility in the east, a countervailing factor to the equalisation of wages due in 1996. I G Metall has agreed a system whereby east German companies which genuinely cannot keep pace with equalisation can be given an exemption, but only if they open their books to inspection. Few like to do that, and as a result there have been only about 30 such exemptions in the past two years.</p>

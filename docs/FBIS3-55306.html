This order was issued "in line with  the 24 December 1993 letter by the Russian Federation Finance  Ministry" and in execution of the Russian Federation Government  decree on approving of the Statute on the Russian Federation  Ministry of Justice. According to this statute, the Justice  Ministry is tasked with ensuring the requisite conditions for  the functioning of general jurisdiction and military courts. As  has become known, however, this decision has come as a total  surprise for the ministry's leadership because the statute says  nothing about financing military courts.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Italian 'Mr Clean' emerges from a dirty fight: Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the new president, is the product of compromise MR Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who will be sworn in as Italy's ninth president on Thursday, has a personality and style in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Mr Francesco Cossiga. Courteous, devoutly Catholic, and formal, the new president, 73, could not be more different from the loquacious and unpredictable Mr Cossiga. Although both have come to the presidency from the ruling Christian Democrat party, Mr Scalfaro has always kept his distance from the inner cabals - unlike Mr Cossiga. Mr Cossiga rejoiced in his self-appointed populist role as 'the man with a pick-axe', chipping away at a political system in urgent need of reform. Mr Scalfaro projects the image of an impartial father figure, steering the ship of state along the path of reform with the limited powers available to the head of state. Mr Scalfaro was taken on as a 'Mr Clean'. Indeed, eyebrows have been raised by his ultra-conservatism. When chosen as speaker of the chamber of deputies after the April 5 general election, he had his office sprinkled with holy water and in the past is credited with telling a woman in a restaurant her decollete was too revealing. Perhaps not surprisingly he and Mr Cossiga can scarcely speak to each other. Mr Cossiga was deeply affronted when Mr Scalfaro became the new speaker against his express wishes - a key element in the latter's resignation on April 25, two months before his seven-year term was complete. In his brief period as speaker, Mr Scalfaro impressed with his scrupulous impartiality. When voting for the presidency began on May 13 he was considered a potential compromise candidate, but it required 16 voting sessions of the joint houses of parliament to endorse him in the final round (there were 1,010 potential voters). Although this may have seemed an unnecessarily long period to elect a new head of state when the country was without a government, the election process was treated by the parties as a dress rehearsal for the formation of the next government. Thus the first three sessions tested whether the outgoing four-party coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats could rely on their members to fall behind the leadership choice. This failed, as the Christian Democrats in particular were deeply divided. The Christian Democrats then played their main card, proposing Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the party secretary general, in the fifth and sixth vote. He mustered no more than 479 votes, short of the 508 majority, and should have won 60 votes more if all the coalition had backed him. The failure of Mr Forlani was crucial. He received insufficient support because he was too openly identified with a discredited system of Christian Democrat-controlled power, out of touch with the reforming mood of the country. The rebuff applied equally to another Christian Democrat heavyweight, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister. Unable to unite his party, Mr Forlani resigned last Friday. The Forlani resignation symbolised the impotence of the ruling coalition and allowed the search for a Christian Democrat compromise 'institutional' candidate in the form of Mr Scalfaro. Mr Scalfaro received 672 of the 1,002 votes present. This included the vote of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the radicals and the Greens, but not the republicans, who were upset that their strong front-runner, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the interim president, was passed over. This voting alliance demonstrates that the politicians have taken on board the public demand for electoral and institutional reform evident in the big general election protest vote. The politicians were also conditioned in their choice by the need to present a 'clean' candidate in the light of growing public unease over the Milan corruption scandal.</p>

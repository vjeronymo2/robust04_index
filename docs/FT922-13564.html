			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Skandia Unhappy Hafnia, the Danish insurer which tried to force its plans for a Scandinavian alliance on an unreceptive Skandia, got its come-uppance yesterday. The company's senior executives fell on their swords after disclosing huge capital losses for 1991, while shareholders found themselves with little choice but to accept a rescue takeover bid from none other than their original Swedish prey. In turning the tables, Skandia appears to have landed itself an attractive deal. The all-paper offer values Hafnia at DKr2.6bn, or a net DKr1bn if you knock off the value of Hafnia's 15 per cent Skandia stake. The Danish group's net assets, meanwhile, including the embedded value of its life fund, should work out at around DKr2bn even after last year's write-downs. In the process, Skandia has become the largest Danish insurer and has headed off the threat from its other would-be predator Uni Storebrand by persuading the Norwegian group to give up most of its 28 per cent stake. Uni's acquisition of Skandia's international reinsurance operations is very much a consolation prize. All in all, the shape of the Nordic challenge in a single European insurance market is becoming clear.</p>

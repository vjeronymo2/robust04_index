			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES LET PARENTS CALL OUT FOR CHILD-REARING TIPS  </P> <P> It used to be that moms just phoned their own mothers for sorely needed advice  on child rearing. Today, they call British child-care authority Penelope Leach.  </P> <P> Leach is one of nine child-rearing experts whose advice can be reached by  dialing (900) 246-MOMS, a recorded service offered by the National Parenting  Center.  </P> <P> "Parents today are really focused on being the best parents they can be," said  David Katzner, who recently formed the Woodland Hills-based service. "We're  sort of geared today to these one-minute bites."  </P> <P> Callers are asked to select an age group from a menu, which then cues them into  an additional menu that lists tips on such subjects as thumb sucking, book  recommendations and ear infections. Katzner, a producer for CBS news, said the  nationwide service receives several hundred calls a day.  </P> <P> Parents also may leave specific questions after a tape's conclusion, which will  be answered in writing by one of the experts at no extra charge. The cost per  call is $1.95 for the first minute and 95 cents for each additional minute.  Tape transcripts are offered through the service's monthly newsletter, which  contains additional parenting tips for an annual fee of $9.95.  </P> <P> The Parent Connection, a similar service, was begun two years ago by Jayne  Major, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy and education from UCLA.  </P> <P> "I feel that parents who are in the middle of stressful situations often need  some quick advice," said Major, who receives about 1,000 calls a month at the  number (900) 976-4MOM.  </P> <P> Callers, who are charged 90 cents per call, also may choose from a list of  advice on specific areas such as temper tantrums, how to avoid spanking, and  understanding children's thinking. A scenario is played out on the taped  message (for example, a daughter who endures a spanking because she used mom's  makeup), and advice is given on how to handle the situation in alternate ways.  </P> <P> Burbank-based L.A. Parent magazine recently started an information line, (818)  842-KIDS, which lists events geared toward parents and children. "Parents can  also leave a message if they need help in getting a referral to pediatricians  or any other concern," said Harry Jigamian, the magazine's associate producer.  "We'll call them back."  </P> <P> Too tired to tell your child a bedtime story? The solution may be to call (900)  MINI-MOM. "We have the best stories for just 80 cents a minute," announces a  recording of a child's voice. "But you need your parents' permission."  </P> <P> Deborah Stipek, professor of child development and education at UCLA, advises  parents to keep calls to a minimum.  </P> <P> "Anything that substitutes the parental role is of dubious value, to me,"  Stipek said. "A child benefits from shared, personal contact when being read  to. It's difficult to receive that from a phone earpiece."  </P></p>

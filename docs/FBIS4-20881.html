			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 17 (CTK) -- The Czech Defense  Ministry will not comment on today's press reports that  dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, which were to be used  in the production of biological weapons, are stored at several  localities in the Czech Republic, the Ministry has informed CTK.    According to the press, Czechoslovakia as a member of the  former Warsaw Pact, was charged with the development of  bacteriological weapons. They were allegedly developed at an  undeground center of the Military Research Institute near  Techonin, east Bohemia. The media claimed that the bacteria and  viruses developed in Techonin had been hidden at various  localities in the Czech Republic.    The press reports said that this not only contravened the  Czech Republic's international commitments, because the country  had signed the Geneva convention under which states undertake  not to develop, use and store without international agreement  biological weapons, but also threatened the public.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: A pawn in a European soviet Sir, With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US/UK special relationship in the political/military sphere could have led on to fame and fortune. In getting on the conveyor belt to irreversible European union in Maastricht, we have cut that link. Germany's unilateral recognition of Croatia and the virtual certainty that chancellor Kohl's clutch of European ducklings, including the ugly British, will follow, involves betrayal of the Serbian people. Worse, it is proof that John Major has reduced us to a pawn in a European soviet which will be exploited by the Germans to expand in the east, riding rough-shod over its partners' interests. We could have stated any terms we wanted. Instead we fudged and are now a third-rate power. Michael Lees, Lislee House, Courtmacsherry, Co Cork, Irish Republic</p>

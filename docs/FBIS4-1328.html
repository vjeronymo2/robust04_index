			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>   [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] released its list of  candidates yesterday, appearing to give high-profile public  figures and whites prominence on its national list but  preserving its top echelon for the regional list in  KwaZulu/Natal where it expects the strongest support.    Inkatha expects at most to win 23 percent of the votes  nationally, with its list of provincial candidates almost  equalling that of the combined regional and national component  for the national assembly. It is fielding 76 candidates to  contest the 400 seats. Most opinion polls have given Inkatha  about 13 percent of the votes nationally, although the latest  Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) report gave it only about  7 percent, which would result in the top 20 making it into  Parliament on the national list. President Mangosuthu Buthelezi  heads the national list followed by former SACP [South African  Communist Party] member Joe Matthews and hardliner Walter  Felgate.    Positions five, six and eight are held by former NP  [National  Party] members Koos van der Merwe, Jurie Mentz and Hennie  Bekker. Press officer Sue Vos will also make it into Parliament  at number seven. At number nine is information director Ziba  Jiyane with Velaphi Ndlovu at 11 and former Independent  Broadcasting Authority member Harriet Ngubane at number 12.  Chief negotiator Ben Ngubane heads a strong list of candidates  on the regional list, the safest route to election.    HSRC director Lawrie Schlemmer estimates that Inkatha could  manage 25 percent support in KwaZulu/Natal, giving about 15  candidates from that region a good chance. Among these are  Dennis Madide, Faith Gasa Forouk Cassim, Kisten Rajoo, Peter  Smith of the information department, Natal Red Cross director  Inka Mars, Ben Skosana and Philip Powell.    For its KwaZulu/Natal Provincial legislature, Inkatha has  its  chairman Frank Mdlalose as premier candidate followed by Jeffrey  Mtetwa and two royal family members Gideon and Vincent Zulu.  Also high on the list are former DP [Democratic Party] MPs Mike  Tarr and Peter Miller, with Arthur Konigkramer in ninth and Sue  Felgate at 15.    Maritzburg mayor Patrick Cornell occupies the number 20 slot  and Lindelane warlord Thomas Shabalala is at number 26.    In its second strongest region, the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], Inkatha has chosen Transvaal leader  Themba Khoza to head the list for the national assembly. He is  likely to get into Parliament. At number nine is Charles  Loliwe, who called on Inkatha members to march on the ANC  offices at Shell House recently. Inkatha's choice for PWV  premier is Musa Myeni with Hennie Bekker's wife, Gerda,  occupying fourth position before Ruth Felgate.    Mungo Soggot reports that Inkatha's 11th hour decision to  take part in the poll has triggered the frantic printing of  88-million labels. Jackstadt MD [managing director] Ken Steyn  said his company, which printed the stickers, had delivered 40  [metric] tons of label stock to printing company Self-Adhering  Products. It, in turn, had printed 22-million labels a day  since last Wednesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Popely, chairman of the Hungarian </F> People's Party, by Gabor Paizs; place and date not given: "Gyula  Popely About the Fall of the Meciar Cabinet"]    [Text] [Paizs] As chairman of the Hungarian People's  Party outside the Slovak parliament, what is your opinion about  the success of the second no-confidence motion and the fall of  the Meciar government? Can one envisage an advance of the left  wing as in Poland?    [Popely] The domestic political situation in Slovakia has  its particularity in the sense that the left essentially  advanced in the months following the 1992 elections. A slowdown  in the privatization process and, subsequently, a complete halt  to this process are clear examples of this advance. It is hard  to expect anything good or any clear development from the  current situation. In my modest view, the situation will become  even more complicated, and I do not exclude the possibility of a  new and spectacular return of the current fallen prime minister,  Meciar. And one should not forget that we are again facing  elections. The only question is when these elections will be  held. I think it would have been more fortunate if the Meciar  Cabinet had continued for a few more months because, in that  case, the entire society would have realized the true aspect of  the country- and self-damaging Meciar policy. This way,  however, Meciar has succeeded in creating a political situation  in which, by escaping from it, he can live through the events of  the coming months as a martyr.    [Paizs] A situation has emerged now that the ethnic  Hungarian political parties represent the political balance. In  your view, will the political prestige of the Hungarian parties  indeed increase in the chess game of the coming days and weeks?    [Popely] That is true: The Hungarian parties represent the  political balance today, but let me add that there is not a  single opposition political force in Slovakia today that would  be ready to regard the Hungarian parties as a serious factor. I  think it is an illusion to expect a situation in which the  Hungarians here can bring themselves into a serious political  position with the formation of a new government, not because the  Hungarians would refrain from participating but because every  opposition Slovak party would lose popularity in the eyes of the  Slovak voters if they cooperated with us.    [Paizs] Is it possible that the Hungarian parties will  obtain more than 10 percent of the votes in the next elections?    [Popely] It is possible, but I do not regard this as a  realistic figure. If the current electoral law remains in  force, one that requires a threshold of 7 percent in the case of  a coalition made up of two or three parties and a threshold of  10 percent in the case of a coalition made up of four, I think  the chances for Hungarian political subjects to enter the Slovak  parliament are endangered. Therefore, the best thing would be  for all of the Hungarian political forces to run under one name,  not in a coalition but as a single party, with the participation  of all of the Hungarian candidates, either on the list of  Coexistence or on the list of the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement. In that case, they would have to achieve only a  5-percent threshold. One should not forget that, at the  elections in June 1992, our success in reaching the 7-percent  threshold depended on only 13,000 votes.    [Paizs] What is your opinion about the spread of the left  and the relations of the Hungarian political parties with the  left? Is it possible that Peter Weiss of the Party of the  Democratic Left will also have a mandate from the Csallokoz area?    [Popely] This is quite possible, and even more than one  mandate. One should not forget that there are two Hungarian  parliamentary deputies in the Party of the Democratic Left.  This party is expected to form an alliance with the Social  Democrats and the Slovak Agricultural Party. The latter has a  lot of people in the areas inhabited by Hungarians. It is to be  feared that some of the former Hungarian members of agricultural  cooperatives will not be steadfast enough, and they might vote  for Weiss and his party under the spell of the promises of  various social reforms. They deliberately "travel" around for  Hungarian votes. It is no accident that one of the deputy  chairmen of the Party of the Democratic Left is a Hungarian  named Erzsebet Borza. This is the only Slovak party that has  its own national minority concept.</p>

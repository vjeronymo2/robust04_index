			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Building company shares fall further SHARE PRICES of hard-pressed construction and building material companies fell further yesterday as pressure mounted on the government to revive Britain's flagging housing market. Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, Britain's fourth largest building society, appealed to the government to allow mortgage tax relief on loans of up to Pounds 60,000 for the first 12 months after a house purchase. He also wants the threshold for stamp duty on house purchases raised to Pounds 60,000. He said householders were feeling less wealthy every month as house prices and consumer confidence dwindled. People were saving more and spending less, causing higher unemployment. The call for urgent action to end the recession in the housing market and pave the way for a general recovery came a day after Abbey National urged the government to offer tax relief of up to Pounds 10,000 to people selling their home at a loss. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would consider the idea but is expected to reject it. Share prices of construction companies dropped yesterday following publication of figures showing a further sharp fall in housebuilding in the three months after the election in April. The FT-Actuaries index of leading construction shares fell by 2.6 per cent to 609.68. The FT-A building materials index fell 3.2 per cent to 756.43. Housebuilders started work on 8 per cent fewer homes in the second quarter than during the previous three months, according to the Environment Department. The total number of starts of 38,900 was the lowest quarterly figure since the final three months of 1990 when the housing market was at a very low ebb. Publication of the figures came as Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, urged a three-point plan to spur recovery. He wants to boost the housing market by doubling the ceiling on mortgage interest tax relief to about Pounds 60,000, although he wants all mortgage tax relief abolished in 10 years. The bank also favours greater government spending on transport and infrastructure and is promoting the granting of accelerated tax allowances on capital investment by companies. General Accident, the insurance group, revealed that its property services division is offering insurance against falling house prices for anxious purchasers of new homes.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Yu-shan (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: "CPC </F> Guards Against Mass Disturbances"]    [Text] The CPC authorities recently took a series of tough  actions; this was closely related to the present social  situation. In addition to worsening unemployment, the inflow of  rural migrant laborers into the cities in large numbers, the  deterioration of inflation, the increasingly seriousness of  crimes, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the  problem most worrying to the CPC authorities was the appearance  of organized labor movements. There were also some indications  that some labor organizations were linked with some  intellectuals. If there is indeed an outbreak of labor unrest  with the support of some intellectuals who give advice to the  workers, that will be the most serious challenge CPC authorities  will face. In the past, the CPC mounted the political stage by  soliciting support from workers and peasants. At present, in  addition to the growing labor movements, the sentiments of the  peasantry are also unstable. Although peasant unrest has been  limited to particular areas, if trouble appears among the worker  and peasant masses and if intellectuals are also involved in the  turmoil, than the nightmare of the CPC authorities will come  true.    We may first view the living conditions of the workers. The  authorities have admitted that one-third of the state-owned  enterprises are running in the red; another one-third have  incurred invisible business losses; and only the remaining  one-third are making slight profits or making profits merely in  the accounting books. A large number of workers are in fact  living in the worst condition. In particular, some large  manufacturing and mining enterprises have no money to pay wages  to workers at all. The well-known Jixi Mining Bureau of  Heilongjiang Province could only give 40-yuan-worth of meal  coupons to 420,000 workers every month. The workers had to  bring their families to the canteens to fetch the limited food  rations, and they had no money for other consumption at all.    Another example was Lianzhao Coal Mine of Hunan Province. It  was a coal mine developed according to Mao Zedong's plan for  meeting energy needs in the south. Production was suspended  there, and 120,000 workers became jobless. Some of them took to  the streets and expressed their hope for "work, food, and money."    According to the analysis of a certain official brain trust,  four workers now have to support one jobless person (that is,  one-fifth of the working force is now laying idle). The  situation in factories and mines which are running in the red is  even more serious. In some cases, three or even two workers  have to support one jobless person. People add burdens to each  other, and there is no way to improve their livelihood.    Strong worker resentments inevitably increases  labor-management disputes. According to statistics by the  Ministry of Labor, last year the number of large-scale  labor-management disputes exceeded 12,000. In some 2,500 cases,  workers besieged plants, set fire to facilities, staged strikes,  or detained bosses or leaders. Such events directly threatened  the personal safety of party leaders in various factories and  mines. In Jixi Mining Bureau, enterprise leaders did not dare  to go to the pits for fear that they might be attacked by the  workers.    The local governments did not want to report such events to  higher authorities because assessment of their work performances  might be affected. Therefore, the national federation of trade  unions only recorded 460 strikes last year. However,  investigators sent by the central authorities found that in  Zhejiang Province alone, the number of strikes exceeded 400 last  year.    The discontent of workers was also related the corrupt and  exploitative practices of enterprise leaders and local  officials. According to some internal investigations made by the  national federation of trade unions, although many factories and  mines were running in the red, the account books still recorded  such items as "director funds" or "director-disposed funds." On  the surface, such funds were used to develop business; in fact,  the money was only used by the factory directors to develop  their personal relations with leaders of other enterprises, or  they might even line their own pockets with such money. This  aroused strong indignation among the workers.    Recently, a court in Beijing sentenced Guan Zhicheng, former  general manager of an iron and steel company in Beijing, to  death after finding him guilty of embezzlement, and the convict  was executed immediately in order to calm down the indignation  of the masses. However, because the masses found that the  authorities were evasive when handling the case, they denounced  the execution of Guan Zhicheng as being aimed at doing away with  a witness in a syndicated crime. Thus, other officials involved  in the corruption case might be at large.    As workers are facing increasing pressure in their daily  lives, their relations with enterprise leaders also become  tense. In Sichuan, leaders of state-owned factories and mines  all have pistols for self-protection. Some leaders even bring  police barons along with them. This shows that authorities were  indeed guarding against labor unrest.    The authorities did not dare to recklessly take highhanded  action against resentful workers because they knew that workers,  unlike intellectuals who may be persuaded, may react violently.  On the one hand, the authorities managed to improve the living  conditions of workers; on the other hand, an old  method--ideological education--was used. Recently, Zhu Rongji  approved the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief fund for  jobless workers who are in financial straits. However, this was  something like trying to put out a burning carload of faggots  with a cup of water, and would be of no avail. In addition, the  CPC Central Propaganda Department recently organized many  activities. It held work conferences on ideological education  for workers in Shanghai and Sichuan. The meetings were chaired  by Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Central Propaganda  Department. The authorities hoped that through such education,  the working class would serve the overall interest and support  reform. However, the ideologues also tried to consolidate their  personal position by stressing the importance of political and  ideological education. When they discussed the interests of the  workers, they particularly shifted the contradictions to the  foreign-funded enterprises and encouraged workers in the  foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions.    The workers knew that this was not exactly what they  urgently  needed. Some workers came to realize that they had to rely on  their own strength to strive for better conditions for their own  survival. Beginning 1992, some fragmented organizations appeared  among the workers. Originally, the authorities tried to include  such organizations in the national federation of trade unions.  However, they found that this was not feasible. So they made  the regulations more stringent for controlling the worker  organizations. Those which were not registered according to the  regulations were regarded as illegal underground trade unions  that would be banned.    However, underground trade unions still continued to develop  rather rapidly. Although they were rather fragmented, they  gradually spread in all parts of the country. In particular,  there are more underground trade unions in South China. The  authorities originally intended to encourage workers in the  foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions, but they  themselves are now facing the threat of underground trade unions  in the state-owned enterprises. The authorities later even  discovered that some of the underground trade unions had joined  hands with some intellectuals and were greatly shocked by this  trend.    In early 1994, the authorities found that the trend was  getting more and more unfavorable to them, and they had to check  it without delay. Material prepared by the Ministry of Public  Security showed that 10 underground trade unions had grown on a  considerable scale. They grew stronger by means of helping  workers seek a livelihood when the factories and mines failed to  guarantee it. Jobless workers were thus organized to seek  livelihoods. Such legal activities were independent of trade  unions controlled by the authorities.    Before and after 4 June last year, the authorities for the  first time discovered that intellectuals pointed out the failure  to identify themselves with workers and peasants when drawing a  lesson from the 4 June incident in 1989. This aroused the  attention of the authorities.    A more obvious example was that during the Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] in March this year,  some worker organizations even directly submitted their  organizational charters to the people's deputies. Some people's  deputies even brought such documents to Beijing in order to  spread them. This discovery further strained the nerves of the  CPC authorities.    Before the NPC session the Yuan Hongbing incident happened.  Yuan Hongbing submitted a petition letter legally to the  Complaint Office of the NPC Standing Committee, and the petition  was supported by a large number of workers and ordinary people.  After that, more than 200 people visited the Complaint Office  at the same time. The CPC authorities found that the workers  must not be allowed to join hands with intellectuals in the  labor movement. Last month, an underground trade union case  reflected the action taken by the CPC authorities against such  trend.    In the case, four of the 16 accused people are workers, two  are cadres, two are self-employed workers, three are jobless  people, and the remaining five are intellectuals, namely, Hu  Shigen, former lecturer with the Beijing Language College; Kang  Yuchun, former doctor with Beijing's Anding Hospital; Lu  Zhigang, former student at the Law Department of Beijing  University; Wang Tiancheng, former teacher in the Law Department  of Beijing University; and Wang Peizhong, former graduate  student in the Research Institute of Science and Technology for  Petroleum Prospecting and Exploitation. The authorities accused  them of organizing the "Liberal Democratic Party of China," the  "Progressive Alliance of China," and the "Preparatory Committee  for the Chinese Free Trade Unions." They drafted party  constitutions and charters, "action principles and work  methods," "interim rules for members of the Alliance," a "free  forum," and wrote such articles as "Heroic Souls of 4 June Will  Exist For Ever" and "On Free Trade Unions." They also  distributed such documents and articles in large quantities.    While the feelings of the workers were unstable, the  peasants were also quite upset. According to secret statistics  kept by the authorities, 44 local post offices and banks were  stormed and looted by peasants, because the peasants could not  withdraw money remitted to them by their relatives from the  coastal areas.    When peasants lost their temper, they did not care how  high-ranking the officials they were facing. Last December,  when Jiang Zemin visited Shaoshan, the home village of Mao  Zedong, to unveil a Mao statue, he encountered a large number of  petitioning peasants. Jiang was surrounded by the peasants for  nearly one hour. Finally, the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee  sent officials to coax the peasants to go away.    The authorities thought that if the peasants were kept from  migration, less trouble might happen. However, a research  project conducted by the CPC Central Committee's Policy Research  Office on the movement of the rural labor force between  different regions showed that peasants were moving on a large  scale, within broad areas, over a long period of time in all  parts of the country, and they were also involved in more and  more trades and industries. As long as peasants leave home,  they will immediately find that they are living at the bottom of  society, and they cannot match urban residents in any aspect.  They will even feel that they are being exploited by the urban  residents. This is root cause of the potential turmoil.    According to the findings of the research project, in the  six  provinces of Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi,  people going out to seek jobs numbered 24 million in 1993 as  compared with only 2 million in 1982. If peasants from all  parts of the country are included, the number is be much greater.    Resentment also existed among people who were neither  workers  nor peasants. Even urban residents also learned to express  their discontent by taking to the streets. There were two  petition incidents in Shanghai recently, and the municipal  government was driven to an embarrassing position. In one case,  the residents found that government land requisition was unfair,  so several  hundred people held a sit-in in front of the government  building. Shanghai television broadcast this event. The  municipal government originally hoped that the television report  might explain the situation to the residents so that the dispute  might calm down more quickly. However, the station even  broadcast footage that showed the miserable conditions of the  residents, and the petitioners won wider sympathy from other  people. In another case, a large number of Shanghai people were  taken in by unscrupulous merchants who sold counterfeit rings,  and they petitioned the authorities for seeking help.    Various signs showed that if any events occurred and  triggered off widespread popular indignation and resentment, the  authorities would not be able to bring the situation under  control any more. In order to prevent the potential crisis, the  authorities had no other option but taking preemptive highhanded  measures.</p>

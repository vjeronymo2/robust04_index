			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rates rise further THE UK money market was distinctly nervous yesterday before this weekend's batch of six opinion polls, and rates rose still further. Yesterday's poll of marginal seats in London which pointed to a hung parliament - the worst possible outcome as far as the market is concerned - did not augur well for the rest of the weekend. The retail price figures were also a disappointment to some, simply holding the previous inflation rate, rather than showing a decrease. The market continued to maintain a stance that was increasingly discounting the possibility of higher interest rates after the election. Interbank rates firmed sharply towards the close, with the key three-month rate up  1/8 at 10 15/16 -10 13/16 per cent. The six-month to one-year rates were also up  1/8 to 11 1/16 -10 15/16 , and even the one-month rate was 10 3/4 -10 5/8 , expensive for a 10 1/2 per cent base rate. The June sterling contract opened up six basis points at 89.11, but soon slid down to 88.95. The Bank of England did its best to avoid unnecessary strains on money costs by allowing the market all possible means to relieve a large shortage, forecast initially at around Pounds 1.15bn. In early operations, it purchased bills totalling Pounds 517m, made up of Pounds 11m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Pounds 2m of band 3 local authority bills at 10 3/16 per cent, and Pounds 364m band 3 and 4 bank bills at 10 3/16 and 10 5/32 per cent respectively, plus Pounds 140m for resale to the market on April 3 and 6 at 10 7/16 per cent. At midday, the forecast was revised upwards to Pounds 1.2bn, and the bank purchased a further Pounds 319m of band 1 and 3 bank bills and band 4 treasury bills. The shortage was revised down to around Pounds 1.05bn in the afternoon, with the Bank providing late assistance of Pounds 230m, to take the day's total to Pounds 1,066m. Overnight rates, however, were still relatively firm at 10 3/4 -10 1/2 per cent for much of the session, rising to 11-10 7/8 per cent in the afternoon. German call money rates firmed owing to the heavy draining of liquidity from March tax payments, but were expected to ease back on Monday. Traders quoted call money at around 9.65/70 per cent, up from 9.60 per cent on Thursday and just below the 9.75 Lombard rate.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELLULAR PHONE PIECE GAVE WRONG IMPRESSION  </P> <P> The "Cellular Blues" article in the June 10 Viewpoints contains information  that is likely to leave an erroneous impression with your readers. Here are  some facts that give a more accurate picture of the cellular industry in  general and L.A. Cellular in particular:  </P> <P> * The statement that cellular companies operate a "fixed-cost business" and do  little more than pocket their profits once a system is built is completely  untrue. When L.A. Cellular began operations in 1987, we had invested about $34  million in equipment and facilities before any income was received. Since then,  L.A. Cellular has invested an additional $120 million to improve and expand  service to its customers.  </P> <P> * While it is true that cellular demand in Los Angeles is very high, it is also  true that L.A. Cellular's investment in its system has substantially exceeded  its after-tax income. Since 1985, L.A. Cellular has had a $33-million net  negative cash return, largely due to the increasing demand for cellular  service, which requires that we continually reinvest earnings in new and more  technologically advanced equipment.  </P> <P> * Between now and 1992, L.A. Cellular is committed to spending more than $200  million toward the conversion to digital technology to ensure quality service  to our customers. For most cellular customers, the critical issues are  geographic coverage and service quality. L.A. Cellular's first priority is to  give our customers as much coverage as possible while reducing "dropped calls"  and electronic interference.  </P> <P> * It is important to note that despite the fact that we have invested millions  of dollars in new equipment and technology, inflation that has affected every  aspect of our operations and the addition of new services at no additional  charge to our customers, there have been no price increases at L.A. Cellular.  </P> <P> * An important part of the cost of cellular service is the cost of the cellular  telephone. The price of cellular equipment has dropped by more than 50% in  recent years, and prices should continue to fall as the cellular phone business  matures.  </P> <P> The recent decision by the California Public Utilities Commission loosening  restrictions on reducing cellular prices will enhance cellular carriers'  ability to respond to consumer needs and thus will benefit customers. Increased  regulation would have the opposite effect. The PUC has decided that it will not  punish companies who reinvest their profits in cellular system improvements.  This promises to bring the benefits of cellular communication to every corner  of the state, a worthy goal that all Californians should support. We do.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D. HEIL  </P> <P> The writer is president of L.A. Cellular.  </P></p>

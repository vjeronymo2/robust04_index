			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Finland to forge firmer EC ties FINLAND wants to establish EC links involving 'economic, social and security co-operation' as part of its effort to join the Community by the mid-1990s, Mr Mauno Koivisto, the country's president, said yesterday. He told the Financial Times during a visit to London that EC membership was a natural consequence of Finland's long-term policy of pursuing western integration. Finland is applying for EC membership along with most of the other members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). The president admitted that one important factor behind his country's desire to join was Finland's fear of isolation as the EC expanded: 'In people's minds, they see the danger that other Efta countries would have a greater role in European integration.' Mr Koivisto later told a lunch at the Finnish-British Trade Guild that his country wanted to advance beyond membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), the free-trade area between the EC and Efta due to come into effect at the beginning of 1993. In terms of the opening of Finland to outside competition, Mr Koivisto said that the economic implications of EEA membership were more important than those of joining the Community. The main difference was in the political sphere. 'The EEA agreement does not give us full rights to sit at the table at which decisions intimately affecting us are made. Membership would return to us a lot of the sovereignty that we shall lose as a result of the EEA agreement.' Mr Koivisto said he supported the floating of the Finnish markka in September, which led to a large effective devaluation after heavy selling pressure. Although the markka had not been overvalued, the strength of 'market forces', coupled with Finland's lack of substantial foreign exchange reserves, were the main reasons behind the decision, he said. Finland decided not to activate foreign central bank credit lines to support the markka because the fight on the currency market had already been lost, Mr Koivisto said. Finnish exporters had subsequently gained in competitiveness, and were using the devaluation as an opportunity to expand the range of goods sold abroad. Some sectors of Finnish industry were suffering from 'overheating', in spite of the general effects of recession on the economy, as a devaluation of about 20 per cent now coincided with an inflation rate of only 3 per cent, the president said.</p>

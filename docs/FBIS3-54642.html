Receiving members of the diplomatic corps, accredited to  Moldova, in Chisinau on Thursday night for a New Year he  mentioned among the country's main problems the unresolved  issues on Transdniestria and Gagauzia (southern Moldova), the  shortage of goods, growing prices, and falling population  incomes.    However, these setbacks, in his opinion, are compensated by  obvious rewards, including the passage of democratic laws, the  introduction of a national currency, and the population's  growing confidence in irreversible reforms.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder board studies call for overhaul The board of Goodman Fielder, the embattled Australian food group, is due to meet today to discuss its response to the requisitioning of an extraordinary general meeting by three big institutional shareholders and Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman. Mr Shears acquired a small interest in Goodman when he sold his Uncle Toby's group to Goodman in 1992. The unhappy investors - who include the Australian Mutual Provident, Bankers Trust and the State Authorities Superannuation Board - are seeking to overhaul the Goodman board. Their requisition notice suggested that two executive directors - Mr Barry Weir, managing director, and Mr Michael Brown, finance director - be reappointed, but that votes been taken over the removal of the remaining seven incumbents. The dissidents have put forward four potential replacement names. These include Mr Neil Lister, an executive with one of Mr Shears' companies; Mr John Keniry, a former Goodman executive; Mr Jon Petersen, formerly with Mars' Asian division; and Mr Ken Nielsen, a former chairman of Unilever Australia. Goodman Fielder was built up through a series of acquisitions during the late 1970s and 1980s under its former New Zealand-based chairman, Mr Pat Goodman. Today, it spans businesses ranging from food ingredients such as gelatine to cereal-based foods such as pasta and bread. Although a large player in some local markets - such as bakeries - it has posted poor returns recently. Net profit before abnormals was ADollars 117.2m (USDollars 86.8m) in the year to end-June 1993, on sales of almost ADollars 4bn. The previous year's figure was ADollars 108.1m. Despite speculation that Goodman could be ripe for takeover, no industry buyer has stepped forward. Earlier this year, Mr Barry Weir - who took over as managing director in December - told shareholders the group was aiming for long-term margins of between 9 and 10 per cent across all businesses.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte forges link with Ciga hotels chain FORTE, the UK hotels and restaurants group, said yesterday that it was to take over the management of Ciga, the Italian-based luxury hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan. The announcement is part of a restructuring plan of the highly-indebted Italian group organised by Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank. The deal would give Forte access to one of the world's most prestigious hotel brands, raising questions over how strongly it now needs to pursue its long-standing plan to take over the UK-based Savoy group. Under the proposed Ciga restructuring, Forte will pay Pounds 33m cash and insert some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into an Italian operating company. Forte will have a majority interest in the operating company. Ciga's bank debt will be transferred into a separate property holding company in which the operating company will have a 15 per cent stake. Ciga, which operates 35 hotels in Italy, Austria, France, Greece, the Netherlands and Spain had debts of L1,011bn (Pounds 420m) at the end of June. It recorded of losses of L110.1bn in the first half of this year, up from L58.9bn. Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte, said it was too early to say which hotels his group would place in the Ciga operating company. It is thought, however, that the group's four luxury hotels in Italy would be candidates. Mr Forte said he had approached Mediobanca last June. The group's existing activities in Italy and his family's Italian origins helped increase Forte's attractiveness to Ciga's creditors, he said. 'In some degree it's an Italian solution to the problem.' Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said that it was difficult to say what sort of return Forte could make on its investment until it had fully investigated the state of the Ciga hotels. From a marketing point of view, he described the combination of Forte and Ciga as 'potentially a dream ticket'. He added: 'Forte will be managing the biggest array of super-luxury hotels in the world.' Forte's goal of controlling the Savoy was driven by the desire for a prestigious name under which to market its own luxury hotels. Mr Slattery said that with the Ciga deal, 'for the first time, I think Forte could walk away from Savoy.' Lex, Back page</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES;  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF THE BIG TIME: LOYOLA TO PLAY IN MAUI  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount basketball hit the big time in the recent NCAA Tournament and  is starting to reap some of the benefits, as evidenced by the Lions' invitation  to a prestigious season-opening tournament next fall.  </P> <P> The Lions will play in the eight-team Chaminade Maui Classic in Hawaii. And in  a field that includes national powers Syracuse and Indiana, Loyola is being  played up as one of the marquee names.  </P> <P> "Loyola Marymount has been the Cinderella team this year, and I consider it a  feather in our cap to have such an exciting team opening their season with us,"  said Chaminade Athletic Director Mike Vasconcellos.  </P> <P> The Maui Classic, held in the Lahaina Civic Center, annually brings together a  national field for the season-opening weekend. Missouri beat Oklahoma in last  year's championship game, and eventual NCAA champ Michigan beat defending champ  Kansas the year before. This year's games will be played Nov. 23-24-25,  starting the day after Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> The field also includes Iowa State, Northeastern, host Chaminade and Loyola  conference foe Santa Clara. Arkansas-Little Rock pulled out after Coach Mike  Newell left and has been replaced by the University of Toledo.  </P> <P> A television package is being worked out, and Vasconcellos said opening  matchups should be set within a month -- with television having some input. (He  said Loyola and Santa Clara won't be put in the same bracket.) TV has found the  fast-breaking Lions to its liking the last two years, when Loyola set national  scoring records in both seasons.  </P> <P> Vasconcellos said another factor favored Loyola's selection. "We always have to  have a Catholic school in the field," he said. "Us Catholic schools have to  stick together."  </P> <P> In fact, Chaminade, a Catholic institution with an enrollment similar to  Loyola's, is planning to upgrade its program to Division I and has made  inquiries to the West Coast Conference about joining sometime in the 1990s.  </P> <P> In playing host to the tournament, Chaminade has even pulled off some major  upsets. "It's more of a spectacle than a tournament," Vasconcellos said.  "There's golf, a luau. We provide the sun, the surf, and try to sneak up on  somebody.  </P> <P> "Winning and losing is almost incidental. It's really a cultural event. The  players love it. It's a great way to start the season. It's like spring  training -- the kids are fresh; they get to interact with the other teams. When  (Coach) Rollie Massimino came out with Villanova, he set an all-time golf  record for a basketball coach. And let's face it, if you're gonna lose, you  might was well lose in Hawaii. It beats losing in North Dakota."  </P> <P> Close Shave: It's been a banner year for Loyola Marymount women's tennis. In  fact, one might say the Lions have been razor sharp.  </P> <P> For 16 years, tennis Coach Jamie Sanchez has been telling his teams that if  they could finish as high as third in the West Coast Conference, he would shave  his beard and mustache. (He doesn't worry about finishing first because  perennial winners Pepperdine and San Diego grant tennis scholarships. The other  teams in the conference don't.)  </P> <P> Well, the Lions finally placed third in the conference tournament two weeks  ago, and Sanchez began getting calls from former players and alumni. "So I went  ahead and (shaved)," Sanchez said, laughing. "Now everybody tells me I look  younger, so it might be a benefit."  </P> <P> The Lions' top gun was junior Lynn Stogner, who recently won the No. 1 singles  title in the independent division at the Ojai Tournament. She lived up to her  top seeding, winning all four matches and defeating UC San Diego's Kristine  Bahrens in the final, 6-3, 7-6. Stogner was the Lions' top player despite a  season-long wrist injury that was scheduled for surgery today.  </P> <P> Sanchez's Lions also won the doubles title at Ojai behind freshman Kim Florez  and senior Jori Stinar, giving Loyola the team title in the Intercollegiate  Independent category.  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team continues to struggle in the  California Collegiate Athletic Conference, but third baseman Fred Camarena  still has a chance to break the team batting record.  </P> <P> The Toros, 17-21-2 overall, lost to UC Riverside, 5-0, earlier this week and  take a 8-16 CCAA record into today's 3 p.m. home game against Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Camarena, however, hit in his 11th straight game against Riverside to raise his  season average to .404. With eight games to play, Camarena is hoping to become  the second Toro to hit .400, and is shooting for Ruben Jauregui's 1988 record  of .406.  </P> <P> Since dropping to his season low of .365 on April 7, the senior from Brea has  steadily raised his average to its current mark. In his 11-game streak Camarena  has hit .500 (19 for 38).  </P> <P> Stat of the Week: When the Loyola Marymount baseball team was beaten by Long  Beach State, 5-0, on Tuesday, it was the first time the Lions had been blanked  this season and the first time in 107 games. The last team to shut out the  Lions was Long Beach State in February, 1989.  </P></p>

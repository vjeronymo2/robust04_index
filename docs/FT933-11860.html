			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs to new record on economic data Wall Street US STOCK markets moved into record territory yesterday as investors opened the week with a burst of buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.96 higher at 3,567.70, its second all-time peak in the past week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.99 at 449.09 and the Nasdaq composite 4.30 at 704.54. NYSE volume came to 224m shares. Stock prices opened firmer in the wake of strong overseas equity markets and an early decline in bond yields. The overseas strength came from Europe, where the main index of German stocks rose 1.3 per cent. In the US bond market, prices advanced at the start of trading, pushing the yield below 6.7 per cent. Although bonds later fluctuated between gains and losses, equities remained higher throughout the day. Stocks were aided by some good economic news in the form of a 1.9 per cent rise in June existing home sales. By mid-morning the Dow had broken through its previous record of 3,555.40, set just last week, and was showing a 20-point gain. Prices eased back later in the morning as analysts voiced concern that the markets would struggle to hold their new record levels. In recent weeks, every time stocks have reached new highs, selling has quickly dragged prices lower, and analysts fear a similar pattern could be repeated this week. Stocks ended strongly, however, following a recovery in bond prices. Among individual stocks, second-quarter earnings reports continued to dominate. Boeing put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 5/8 in heavy trading after the aircraft manufacturer posted stronger than expected earnings of Dollars 426m. Investors shrugged off warnings from the company about its near-term business prospects. IBM initially traded lower ahead of today's expected unveiling of its second-quarter results, but ended the day up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 42 3/8 in volume of 3.9m shares. Analysts and investors continued to speculate that the troubled computer group will announce a fresh charge against earnings, further job cuts, and possibly a reduced dividend payout. Cummins Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, tumbled Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 82 1/2 on news of lower than expected second-quarter earnings. Mobil firmed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 72 3/8 after broking house Dean Witter raised its 1993 earnings estimate for the oil company following its strong second-quarter results. On the Nasdaq market, Reuters ADRs climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 65 after the UK-based financial information group announced plans to buy back up to 5.8 per cent of its shares. US Healthcare advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 52 following an improvement in second-quarter profits to 62 cents a share, up from 43 cents a year ago. Canada TORONTO ended a three-day losing streak, moving sharply higher in step with other major world markets. The TSE 300 index surged 39.3 to 3,869.5 and rises led falls by 407 to 289 after volume of 37.8m shares valued at CDollars 414.9m. The golds group jumped 4.2 per cent as the New York bullion price climbed USDollars 3.70 an ounce.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS MULLS LATE-NIGHT NEWSCAST, BUT 'IT'S NOT DEFINITE'  </P> <P> CBS News executives are weighing the possibility of introducing a new  late-night newscast, but the network has no firm plans in place.  </P> <P> CBS planned to run a late-night Persian Gulf special again Thursday night,  making it the second night in a row that the network has put the team of Lesley  Stahl and Charles Kuralt up against ABC's popular "Nightline."  </P> <P> But while executives at CBS News would like to have a regular forum to discuss  world events in depth, a special is not scheduled for tonight, and CBS  spokesman Tom Goodman said Thursday that the network will not run another  late-night special unless breaking news dictates the need for one.  </P> <P> Still, Goodman said, CBS would like to have another regular news program, and  is considering using the 11:30 time slot, among others, for such a program.  "Nightline" developed out of similar news specials on ABC more than 10 years  ago, when Ted Koppel anchored a nightly broadcast during the Iranian hostage  crisis.  </P> <P> "It's definitely not definite," Goodman said. "This is something that might  develop into something and it might not." SHARON BERNSTEIN  </P></p>

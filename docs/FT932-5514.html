			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: British Land Few investors have the power to move markets singlehandedly. Mr George Soros is one. The formation of a Pounds 500m partnership between his Quantum Fund and British Land was enough to jolt the UK property sector's stock market value into a 6 per cent increase. In terms of sentiment, it is a spectacular move - and an ingenious tool to market British Land's rights issue. Its concrete impact, though, is far from clear. Mr Soros's recent interest in gold and property may be seen as a punt on long term inflation. The more prosaic truth may simply be that both assets are cheap. The partnership aims to sink up to Pounds 1bn in UK property before the end of 1997 - more than the total net institutional investment in property last year. The risk is that its well-flagged intentions will move the market against it. Sellers will hold on for better prices. Yields on prime properties will continue to fall. British Land, which has bought Pounds 900m of properties since 1988, certainly has a good record of going against the grain. It may acquire parcels of assets or whole companies from the banks direct. Mr John Ritblat's unusual requirement to buy back at a discount shares in British Land from Quantum certainly provides an incentive to ensure the joint venture succeeds. This is not to say that the fundamentals in the property market are anything other than tough. Tenant demand will lag general economic recovery. Until employment levels pick up significantly, it is hard to see much improvement in rental values. It is an odd situation when rising share prices provide the main justification for brokers to lift their forecasts for net asset values.</p>

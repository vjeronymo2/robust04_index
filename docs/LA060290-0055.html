			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SUSPENSION OF ROBINSON IS UPHELD  </P> <P> Bobby Brown, president of the American League, upheld his three-game suspension  of Baltimore Oriole Manager Frank Robinson Friday.  </P> <P> The suspension began with Baltimore's game Friday night against the Yankees in  New York.  </P> <P> Robinson had appealed the suspension Thursday and met with Brown to discuss the  incident that occurred May 28 in Minnesota. Robinson was ejected from that game  by umpire Drew Coble and was suspended for his actions on the field and  postgame comments in which he called the umpire "a liar" and "a no-good human  being."  </P> <P> Brown suspended him the next day for "physical contact with the umpire, use of  abusive language, delay of the game and inappropriate postgame remarks to the  press." Robinson's appeal delayed the suspension.  </P></p>

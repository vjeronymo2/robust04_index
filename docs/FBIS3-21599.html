			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick Wintour in Moscow and David Fairhall: </F> "Britain and Russia Stand Down Their Missiles"]    [Text] Russia and Britain agreed yesterday to stop aiming  strategic nuclear missiles at one another's territory in a move  seen as vital to helping Boris Yeltsin's reform programme and  undermining those calling for a return to Russian expansionism.    The agreement, intended to take effect from May, was sealed  at talks in the Kremlin between Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian  president, and John Major.    Mr. Major hailed the move as a "remarkable and courageous"  step which would have been inconceivable a few years ago.    In immediate operational terms the declaration means little.  But aside from its intended impact on Russian domestic opinion  it is a powerful symbol of political change, marking the end of  the nuclear confrontation that for the past 40 years has been  used by successive British governments to justify spending  billions of pounds on maintaining first V bombers, then  submarines, on constant strategic alert.    The Russians signed a similar deal with the Americans after  President Clinton's visit to Moscow in January. British  officials said yesterday that the momentum provided by the  Anglo-Russian deal could help to curb the proliferation of  nuclear weapons.    Britain and the former Red Army have also agreed, for the  first time since the second world war, to hold joint military  exercises in Russia and Britain next year. Whether they will  include the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force has yet to be  decided, but Mr. Major told Mr. Yeltsin that he would be happy  to hold the first exercise, at battalion strength, in Britain.    "This degree of military co-operation at this particular  level is unprecedented," Mr. Major said at a glittering signing  ceremony in the Red Room at the Kremlin.    British Embassy officials said that the proposed  de-targeting  would cover both countries' entire stocks of strategic nuclear  weapons. Long range ballistic missiles are aimed at programming  their guidance computers with the geographical co-ordinates of  the target, whether an enemy missile silo, a military command  bunker or a city. However, the process probably takes only  minutes -- perhaps seconds -- and it could be reversed in an  equally short time.    Britain's present nuclear force -- soon to be replaced by  Trident -- consists of four Polaris missile submarines, one of  which is always on patrol in the Atlantic. Each submarine  carries 16 ballistic missiles, each with a range of 2,900 miles  and a multiple Chevaline warhead designed to penetrate the  former Soviet missile defences.    Chevaline replaced a simpler warhead in the 1980's. Because  the technical difficulties were underestimated, it cost far more  than forecast. But it was pushed through because of a presumed  need to meet the so-called "Moscow criterion" -- convincing the  former Soviet leaders that if they attacked Britain they would  not remain safe in their Moscow bunkers. A Polaris missile, with  its new multiple warhead, including radar decoys, would always  get through the anti-missile defences, however much they were  improved.    For some time now, threatening Moscow has ceased to be the  decisive criterion of Britain's strategic deterrent policy. The  &pound;10 billion Trident submarine programme is being justified  as  insurance against deliberately unspecified threats, and perhaps  even to deter Third World dictators who acquire nuclear weapons  in the way that Saddam Hussein nearly did.    However, with Nato officials increasingly worried that  Russia  may yet revert to an imperialist stance against neighbouring  countries, Britain hopes that the move on missiles will have  some symbolic significance within Russia.    One British official said: "It sends a powerful signal that  neither side considers the other adversaries." The British  clearly hope that it will also help to undercut popular support  for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democrat  party, whose far-right expansionist doctrine has been based on  the premise that the West is a sworn enemy of Russia.    In an attempt to head off his internal critics, Mr. Yeltsin  yesterday praised the "dynamics" of his own visit to Britain  last year and this week's return trip by Mr. Major. He said  de-targeting had been seen as "a hypothetical question for  generations, possibly even centuries ahead. But now it is  reality."    He repeatedly assured Mr. Major in their talks that he was  committed to moving ahead with the economic reform programme and  he would not be put off by opposition from his parliament.    The de-targeting follows Nato's decision in January to back  a  "partnership for peace" agreement giving the new eastern  European democracies associated Nato status.    Paradoxically, Moscow may never have been on the active  target list, because although the Polaris force could in  extremis be used independently by Britain, it has long been  assigned to Nato.    Its targets were chosen in the context of Nato's Nuclear  Operations Plan, prepared by the Supreme Allied Commander's  staff at Mons, Belgium, and as an adjunct to the U.S. Single  Integrated Operational Plan drawn up in Omaha, Nebraska.    Institutionally, removing Russia from the list does  therefore  make a considerable difference. The most fascinating question  raised by yesterday's agreement is: what other targets, if any,  will now be chosen as more appropriate? And will the computers'  previous programmes be wiped out, or merely stored?    Guardian Newspapers Limited, February 16, 1994</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 18 and 20 June  publish the results of public opinion polls conducted by various  Slovak institutions, surveying interest in participation in the  forthcoming parliamentary elections and degree of voters'  support for individual political parties and movements.    Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 18 June on page 3 carries a  200-word TA SR report entitled "Would You Participate in the  Elections If They Were To Be Held Today?" The report notes  that, in a survey conducted from 1 to 10 June 1994, the Slovak  Statistical Office asked a representative sample of 1,289 adult  citizens whether they would participate in the elections "if  they were to be held today."    According to an attached chart, in the survey, 48 percent of  respondents replied that they would "definitely participate"  (compared with 52 percent in an analogous Slovak Statistical  Office survey of May 1994), 29 percent (26 percent in May) said  that they would "probably participate," 10 percent (9) said that  they would "probably not participate," 7 percent (6) said that  they would "definitely not participate," and 6 percent (7) are  "still undecided."    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 18 June on page 2, under the  headline "How Would We Vote, Were Elections To Be Held in  June?," carries a 400-word unattributed report on the same  Slovak Statistical Office survey (1,289 respondents, data  collected from 1 to 10 June 1994). The SME report includes the  following table, which provides the results of respondents'  replies on their party preferences. In an introductory note,  SME stresses that the table includes only "the electoral  decisions of citizens who would definitely or probably  participate in the early parliamentary elections, if they were  to be held today." For the sake of comparison, the SME table  also provides the results of analogous Slovak Statistical Office  surveys conducted in April and May.

The sample consisted of 1,150  respondents. The list of parties, movements, and electoral  alliances presented to the respondents corresponded to the  present state of political parties' talks on the formation of  coalitions."

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ALLA BREVE MEDLEY: OPERA ARIAS BY VERDI, ROSSINI, DONIZETTI, BERLIOZ,  MEYERBEER; SAMUEL RAMEY, BASS; MUNICH RADIO ORCHESTRA, JACQUES DELACOTE  CONDUCTING. EMI 7 49582 2 (COMPACT DISC).  </P> <P> Ramey ventures unhackneyed repertory including the "Don Carlos" and "Vepres  siciliennes" arias in the original French, relatively unfamiliar arias from  "Robert le Diable" and "Comte Ory," and "La calunnia" in its original key. His  basso is rich and even from top to bottom. Lacking, however, is vocal  personality or musical imagination. There is little attempt at  characterization; Fiesco sounds much the same as Zaccaria. Mephisto's aria from  Berlioz' "Damnation" lacks insinuating, dark humor. The plodding accompaniments  of Delacote are no help. Walter Price  </P></p>

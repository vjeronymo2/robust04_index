			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KATHY BAKER GETS TO BE FUNNY  </P> <P> Actress Kathy Baker says critics have been using the "f" word to describe her  performance in the new movie "Edward Scissorhands," and she couldn't be  happier.  </P> <P> "That's 'f' for funny," Baker said.  </P> <P> "This is my first screen comedy. Until now there was this attitude in Hollywood  that Kathy Baker can't do comedy."  </P> <P> In "Scissorhands," Johnny Depp plays a creature built by Vincent Price who has  blades instead of fingers. Baker's predatory suburban housewife fails to seduce  him, then claims he attacked her.  </P> <P> Before "Scissorhands," moviegoers saw her in such darker films as "Jacknife"  with Robert De Niro, "Clean and Sober" with Michael Keaton and "Dad" with Ted  Danson and Jack Lemmon. The National Society of Film Critics named her best  supporting actress in 1987 for her role as a prostitute in "Street Smart."  </P> <P> She and her husband and two children have taken an apartment in Kansas City  while she makes the movie "Article 99" about a staff rebellion at a Veterans  Administration hospital.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Megawati Sukarnoputri, general chairwoman of the PDI  [Indonesian Democratic Party] DPP [Central Executive Council]  says that the 1997 election is a moment that must be seized. If  not, the PDI will have to wait another 10 to 15 years to become  great. One prerequisite for taking advantage of the moment is  maintenance of cohesiveness in the party organization.    Megawati made this statement Sunday, 27 March, when she held  a gathering for PDI members at Blitar to mark the end of the  fasting month. Present at the program were PDI DPP Chairmen  Suparlan and Mangara Siahaan, Deputy Secretary-General Dr.  Syafei Ali Gumai, Chairman of the East Java PDI DPD [Regional  Executive Council] Latief Pudjosakti, and all PDI DPC [branch  executive council] chairmen from throughout East Java.    According to Mega, the opportunity can be seized if the PDI  is unified and cohesive, and not confused and quarrelsome. "What  is the use of electing me to be general chairwoman if you are  always quarrelsome? The PDI is not going to become great if its  members and leaders are always quarreling. Is that what is to be  handed down to our younger generation?" she asked.    Mega said that in handling the emergency situation in  Surabaya, she tried not to be drawn into a confused an  quarrelsome situation. She followed the situation with patience  and firmness. "If I had not been patient and firm, I do not know  what would have become of the PDI. Therefore, your strong  support for me as general chairwoman of the PDI DPP must once  more be demonstrated by eliminating all confusion and quarreling  from the PDI organization," she asserted.    However, Mega continued, the greatness of the PDI does not  depend only on the top central leadership.</p>

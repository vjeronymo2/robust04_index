			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Le doomsday machine: John Plender says France's commitment to the franc fort policy threatens financial stability With the leaders of the main parties in the French elections uniformly committed to the same brand of hair-shirt economics, the only worthwhile political debate has been taking place in the markets. The question remains: is the franc fort policy, to which the incoming government will be as committed as the old, sustainable? It matters not only for the growing army of the unemployed in France, but for the future of Europe. The starting point of the debate is the conjunction of French short-term interest rates of about 11 per cent with inflation heading for 2 per cent or less. The French economy is thus living with real (inflation-adjusted) short-term rates of interest of nearly 9 per cent. That is only a minor irritant for many private individuals, since home loans are largely at fixed long-term rates. The banks' prime lending rates, which apply to 90 per cent of consumer borrowing, have been kept artificially low at 10 per cent to mitigate the pain for others. But for the corporate sector it is another matter. There, as a recent paper from Midland Global Markets Research points out, only 30 per cent of total debt is long term. The squeeze is most severe for small businesses, which are dependent on the banks for funds. They, too, are helped by the banks holding base rates at artificially low levels. But not enough, as Midland says, to prevent soaring bankruptcies. The real crunch, however, is in property, where the fall in the Paris market is becoming serious. The banks could probably live for some time with base rates below their marginal cost of funds, particularly where they have access to cheap retail deposits. But as Robin Monro-Davies of the rating agency IBCA argues, they cannot survive a remorseless deterioration in the quality of their assets. The scale of the problem is, so far, smaller than in Britain or the US. But for want of lower interest rates, the French are manufacturing a comparable crisis. A government committed to the European exchange rate mechanism is necessarily condemned to this seemingly perverse course of action. Instead of bolstering bank profits by reducing short rates, as the US Federal Reserve has successfully done in comparable circumstances, the authorities are maintaining an inverse yield curve - that is, keeping short rates above long rates. The result is a doomsday machine which, if allowed to continue, would eventually destroy the solvency of the banking system, wreck the public finances and impose a savage credit crunch on the economy. No one has told the Paris Bourse, which has been looking forward to bank privatisation. While the rating agencies have downgraded the debt of big French banks, share prices of Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Paribas and Suez have risen by about 20 per cent since the new year, far outperforming the market. This looks like cloud-cuckoo land. In effect, the government is betting the whole banking system on a sudden dash for Franco-German monetary union, or on the Bundesbank reducing interest rates far and fast. The promise of early monetary union, combined with an open commitment to defend a fixed parity at any cost, would help by reducing the risk premium in French interest rates - the extra return to compensate for not being in the more stable D-Mark. But will the Bundesbank be bludgeoned into accepting a deal that puts it out of business and kills the D-Mark? And will Bonn be so keen on monetary union with a new French government whose trade policy it finds repellent? If, implausibly, the answer to both questions is yes, the banking problem would be more manageable. But interest rate convergence with Frankfurt would still leave the French with real short rates of more than 6 per cent - swingeing in a recession. And the markets might anyway demand higher rates for the unified currency to compensate for the loss of exclusive German monetary management. As for the Bundesbank, further interest rate cuts are inevitable since the German economy is groggy. Yet the recently agreed solidarity pact looked a conspicuous fudge, with little attempt to prune the public sector until mid-decade. With its own survival at stake, the Bundesbank has less incentive to hurry the cuts; and in view of the continuing laxity of fiscal policy, it is hard to see its council readily conceding any level of interest rates over the next 12 months that would take France off the hook. Meantime, further French victories in yesterday's battle against inflation will simply add to the pain. This suggests that if the new French government sticks with the franc fort, and fails to win early monetary union, the sustainability of policy will remain an issue for far longer than assumed. The battle with the markets is far from over.</p>

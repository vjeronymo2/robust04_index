			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Increased home sales fail to spur prices Demand from home buyers increased last month but the rise in sales has not brought a corresponding rise in prices, a survey of more than 100 estate agents reported yesterday. The study, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says that 90 per cent of agents in England and Wales saw no increase in prices in the last three months of last year compared with the previous three months. Just under 5 per cent per cent said prices had continued to fall while a similar proportion reported increases of 2 per cent over the period. The institution says prices have remained flat in spite of an increase in house viewings and inquiries from potential purchasers. Sellers still need to set a realistic asking price to secure a sale. Confidence among potential buyers has grown as house prices have stabilised and unemployment figures have improved. The 'upbeat mood' is most marked in the south. The institution expects the improvement in sales to continue but warns that the recovery in prices will be slower. It said: 'The number of transactions will have to increase before there will be any meaningful impact on prices, which will rise only slowly throughout the year.'</p>

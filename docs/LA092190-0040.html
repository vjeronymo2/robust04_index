Paramount Pictures has moved the opening  date of the film from Nov. 21 to Christmas Day. The $50-million-plus gangster  epic, which reunites Coppola with stars Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, was shot in  Italy and New York last winter and spring and recently went back into  production for two weeks of additional shooting.

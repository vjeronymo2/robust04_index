			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Late surge in support for Tories cheers investors SHARES, government gilt-edged securities and sterling all rose sharply yesterday in London, as investors were cheered by opinion polls indicating a last-minute surge in support for the Conservative party. As voting took place in the general election, financial markets reasoned that a Tory defeat was not a foregone conclusion, in spite of the polls which have pointed either to a Labour victory or a hung parliament for most of the campaign. However, trading in most markets was thin. This was indicative of the extreme caution about efforts to predict the outcome of the election. Many investors are braced for considerable volatility when the markets reopen today. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose by 43.2 to close at 2,436.4, while gilts saw a half-point gain. On currency markets, investors bought the pound in place of the D-Mark and other units, on the basis that whichever government is elected is unlikely to opt for a sterling devaluation. The support pushed up sterling by 1 1/2 pfennigs to a London close of DM2.8575. Sterling also rose nearly 2 cents against the dollar, to Dollars 1.7665. During the campaign, markets have generally expressed negative sentiments about the possibility of a Tory defeat. However, after a 65-point fall in the FT-SE index last week, the index has recovered 54 points in the past four days. Meanwhile, sterling has climbed this week by more than 2 pfennigs, depressing expectations that a new government might be faced by a run on the pound which could force up base rates, now 10.5 per cent. Reflecting the more sanguine view in the money markets about such a possibility, the three-month interbank rate was quoted last night at about 10 3/4 per cent, down about one-eighth of a percentage point. Last week, the three-month rate, at which banks lend among themselves, had climbed to about 11 1/2 per cent, signalling that many investors thought a base-rate rise was imminent.

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Unions offer Kohl a deal on reviving east Germany GERMANY'S leading trade unions have presented the government with a list of measures to preserve and revive the east German economy, in exchange for a 'solidarity pact' to restrain their wage demands. At a private meeting on Monday, the union leaders warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he must introduce a comprehensive industrial policy to preserve key enterprises in east Germany's manufacturing base, even if they cannot be privatised. The German government must also extend its current costly labour market measures - such as job-creation schemes, and huge retraining programmes - and embark on new programmes to promote east German products in the west and in eastern Europe. They also called for concerted action from the German government, and other western industrialised states, to revive international economic activity, and for clear relaxation of monetary policy by the German Bundesbank, to stimulate economic growth and curb rising unemployment. The trade union position was spelt out at a meeting in the chancellor's office on Monday night, which involved Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG Metall, the giant engineering workers' union, Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies of the oTV public sector union, Mr Hermann Rappe of IG Chemie, the chemical workers union, and Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, chairman of the DGB union federation. News of the meeting, the first top-level talks to negotiate Mr Kohl's planned solidarity pact, leaked out yesterday, prompting bitter recriminations within the government. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who attended, accused his colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, of 'wild garrulousness', for allegedly letting out the secret. From the union side, Mr Steinkuhler refused to give away any details, but expressed disappointment that the government had failed to present any clear ideas of its own on the content of the planned pact. The union leaders are under some pressure for participating at all, with a sharp attack yesterday from Mr Detlef Hensche, leader of the hard-left union IG Medien, representing printing workers, for taking part in 'secret diplomacy.' The trade union platform goes far beyond what the German government has been ready to do so far to support lame-duck industries in the east, and would require the maintenance of at least the present massive subsidies, running at a net flow of some DM150bn (Pounds 62bn) a year from west to east. The question now is how far Mr Kohl is prepared to compromise his market-oriented approach in order to win trade union support for the solidarity pact. But the very fact that the talks have begun, and that both sides apparently agreed to keep them secret, suggests both are interested in a deal. Mr Kohl will meet Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, on Monday to discuss the state of the German economy and the basis of the planned solidarity pact. Mr Engholm can be expected to back the trade union position.</p>

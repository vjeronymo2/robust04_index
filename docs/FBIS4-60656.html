			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad  has told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are  currently working on an initiative to stop the Yemeni war. In  the meantime, sources close to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  leadership said forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  have reached the environs of the Hadhramaut Governorate, which  is adjacent to the Shabwah Governorate.    YSP sources expressed doubts that the president's forces  will  be able to continue to advance to al-Mukalla, the capital of  Hadhramaut, where 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who declared himself  president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen a few days ago, is  now present. They say these forces cannot deploy over a vast  area and maintain their cohesion at the same time.    These sources believe that the opening of the eastern front  by the forces of legitimacy in Shabwah was not meant to achieve  military as much as political and economic gains represented in  sharing the Shabwah oil revenues.    Reached by telephone in Damascus, the former Yemeni  president  told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the  well-known national figure, will propose an initiative aimed at  preserving the Yemeni unity and effecting a cease-fire.    'Ali Nasir declined to elaborate on this initiative at  present as its publication may undermine the current efforts and  contacts with the two parties to the conflict, indicating that  he himself had earlier announced his rejection of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid's secession decision. He said: We want a solution that  guarantees the Yemeni unity, spares blood, leads to a  cease-fire, and solves problems within the framework of the  state of unity. He expressed hope that the anticipated solution  may lie in an agreement by the two warring parties to  simultaneously announce the following:    1. Preserving unity and canceling the secession decision.    2. Ceasing fire immediately.    3. Lifting the siege clamped on Aden.    The former Yemeni president said this can be followed by  searching for a new formula that guarantees the existence of one  central state that is capable of survival.    Asked by AL-DUSTUR if these are the main points of the  initiative he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are proposing, he  said the initiative contains other details.    'Ali Nasir Muhammad denied a statement by 'Abd-al-Qawi  Makkawi two days ago that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim  al-Bid have agreed to meet in Paris. He said: We are still  contacting the two men in order to reach a cease-fire first. We  will arrange for a meeting between the two at a later stage.    In a related development, YSP sources expressed surprise at  the delay in Kuwaiti recognition of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen and said that Kuwait was expected to be the first state to  recognize the new state and that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh  Sabah al-Ahmad was expected to visit Aden and announce his  country's recognition from there. The sources attributed this  delay to possible strong foreign pressure by international  powers like the United States and other regional forces.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Funny money prospects intrigue Paris THE prospect of funny money extending into more European equity markets excited dealers in some bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. However, international observers noted that the thrill of it all seemed largely absent in Dublin, three days after the Irish devaluation took place. PARIS rose by 2.1 per cent on talk of a franc devaluation. In spite of deep scepticism among traders, the CAC 40 index closed 36.83 higher at 1,824.14, featuring gains in shares with large US operations or dollar earnings. Michelin moved against the trend on talk of earnings downgrades, although BNP denied that it had cut its earnings forecasts for the tyremaker. The shares fell FFr3 to FFr184.10. Among a general rise in blue chips, oils extended their gains on the strong dollar with Elf FFr14.80 higher at FFr347.80 and Total FFr5.10 better at FFr231.50. NatWest Securities observed yesterday that the market had underperformed its European counterparts, although it had posted a rise since its low last October. NatWest forecast a 15 per cent appreciation in Paris over the next twelve months. DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index fell 19.62, or 1.5 per cent to 1,324.44. FRANKFURT majored on the prospect of a restrained wage round in West Germany, the DAX index closing 18.44 higher at 1,601.53, its strongest finish since August last year. There was renewed speculation about interest rates although Mr Reinhard Fischer of Paribas Capital Markets thought that the Bundesbank would adopt 'salami tactics', with interest rate cuts coming in very thin slices this year. Turnover climbed from DM5bn to DM6.6bn, the recently resurgent Siemens by far the most active stock in DM1.34bn as it rose another DM8.30 to DM614.80. However, there was bigger share price upside in construction and retailing, regarded as recently underperforming sectors with earnings potential. Gains were led by Hochtief and Holzmann, up DM45 and DM37 to DM1,023 and DM888 respectively, and by Kaufhof, DM15 better at DM426. AMSTERDAM saw Daf marked down to FL 1.65  - 64 per cent below Monday's Fl 4.55 close  - as the shares resumed trading in the unofficial sector of the bourse. By the close, the price had picked up to Fl 1.80. Overall the bourse was mixed with the CBS Tendency index down 1.2 at 96.8. Daf's problems again depressed its creditors. ABN Amro, estimated to have lent Fl 1.25bn to the truckmaker, dipped 40 cents to Fl 51.30; ING, which has a 10.6 per cent Daf holding, shed 10 cents in early trading but picked up to end unchanged at Fl 58.40. Reports that Fokker was seeking a Fl 1bn loan from the Nationale Investeringsbank, in case Deutsche Aerospace abandons its takeover plans, left the Dutch aircraft maker Fl 3.30 lower at Fl 10.20. Nedlloyd, the transport company, fell Fl 2.50 to Fl 26.30 after rumours, denied by the company, that its banks were halting its credit lines. KLM fell Fl 1.90 amid concern over results due today. MILAN was mixed with domestic investors dominating trading. The Comit index edged 0.51 lower to 490.99. A generally bullish trend in much of the industrial sector passed Olivetti by as the share fell L64 lire to L1,899 following Tuesday's confirmation from Mr Carlo De Benedetti, its chairman, of a 1992 operating loss of L300bn-L350bn. Montedison fixed unchanged but rose to L1,220 after-hours and its parent Ferruzzi Finanziaria was L55 ahead at L1,205 on renewed speculation that it was planning to sell its Farmitalia Carlo Erba subsidiary to Kabi Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical arm of Sweden's Procordia which refused to comment. STOCKHOLM turned lower as the white goods maker, Electrolux, said that it plans to halve its 1992 dividend, leaving investors concerned that other companies could follow suit. Electrolux B shed SKr13 to SKr212 on the dividend cut and the Affarsvarlden index fell 6.0 to 902.6. Volvo B was the day's most heavily traded issue, falling SKr5 to SKr375 in turnover of SKr124m, partly on concern about possible US import tariffs on cars. Ericsson moved in the opposite direction, adding SKr2 to SKr177 as it announced a new SKr1.2bn defence contract. Procordia rose SKr3 to SKr175. ZURICH had a mixed day and the SMI index rose 1.9 to 2,120.6. SBC bearers rose SFr7 to SFr337 in response to the Tuesday's announcement that had lifted parent company net profit and planned to switch its certificates into bearer shares and to split the registered shares. MADRID rose strongly in active trade, supported by strong foreign buying. The general index closed 2.42 higher at 236.40, a new high for the year. Volume was strong, although down from Tuesday's Pta26.6bn at around Pta19bn. Telefonica was highly active as it hit an intraday record high of Pta1,360 before subsiding to Pta1,330, up Pta15. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) also attracted overseas fund managers, impressed with its fourth quarter earnings. BBV shares rose Pta100 to Pta2,860.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- February 3                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1091.97   1093.44   1093.13   1094.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1157.72   1157.93   1157.85  1 159.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00    14.00      15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1095.55   1094.58   1096.18   1097.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1160.15   1160.21   1165.09   1171.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 2     Feb 1    Jan 29    Jan 28    Jan 27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1089.43   1088.01   1079.18   1072.70   1072.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1155.59   1158.83   1148.15   1148.06   1147.75  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1097.64; 200 - 1171.25 Low/day: 100 - 1091.38 200 - 1155.94.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

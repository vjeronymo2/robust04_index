			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Igor Ivanov, deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs of the Russian Federation, by Dmitriy Osipov, RIA  NOVOSTI, special for SEGODNYA, in Damascus; date not given:  "Igor Ivanov: No Matter How Difficult the Path of Negotiations  Is, There Is No Alternative"]    [Text] After completing his visit to Syria last week,  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation  Igor Ivanov provided some details of his visit to an RIAN  correspondent before his departure for Moscow.    [Osipov] To what extent is Russia satisfied with Syria's  position in the Near East settlement?    [Ivanov] It is impossible to say that someone should be  satisfied with someone else's position on this question. After  the tragedy in Hebron, Syria, as is known, together with other  Arab countries, stopped participating in negotiations;  therefore, the main task now is to renew negotiations. Damascus  is not satisfied at present with their progress, inasmuch as it  does not see any specific results. At the same time, both Syria  and Russia agree that there is no alternative to the negotiating  process and, no matter how difficult the path may be, it is  necessary to follow it. During the meeting with President Asad  mutual interest was expressed in activating cooperation in this  direction. The Syrian president noted that the negotiating  process has a lot of enemies, and any disruption plays into  their hands. He assessed the role of Russia highly, emphasizing  that the presence of Russia is an important stabilizing element  in the Near East, an element without which it is difficult to  count on the achievement of a truly just and all-encompassing  peace.    [Osipov] The opinion exists among Syrians that the "peak" of  our mutual relations has passed into history. Some are even  saying that Russia has turned its back on Syria. Actually,  Damascus of late has repeatedly received U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and his predecessor, while the head of our MFA  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] has still not visited Syria.    [Ivanov] I would put it differently. The "peak" in the fall  of our relations has passed. I passed a message to President  Asad from President Yeltsin that speaks absolutely definitely of  our firm intention to develop full-fledged relations with Syria.  A similar statement is contained in the reply that I am taking  to Moscow. That is, there is a definite political will to take  the path of building our relations. There really was a  slump--for objective reasons associated with many factors in our  country and with the international situation; however, it is  impossible to say that someone tried to turn away from someone.  Incidentally, the Syrian president did not dramatize this  situation, and he perceived it as objective reality. He said: We  have always believed that this was a transition period, and that  the future of Russo-Syrian relations will be based on the past  many years of history and not on the current state of affairs.  As for the visit of the minister, such visits should be preceded  by specific preparations. I do not rule out the arrival of  Minister Kozyrev in Syria in the future, as well as the arrival  of high-ranking delegations along other lines. I think that we  will increase contacts in various directions.    [Osipov] Including in the sphere of military-technical  cooperation?    [Ivanov] We are ready to develop this sphere as well. A  Russian delegation was in Syria recently and prepared a draft  intergovernment agreement, which we expect will be signed and  will create the basis for cooperation. Military contacts at the  highest level are also expected.    [Osipov] Was the question of Syria's debt to Russia  broached?    [Ivanov] We inherited this serious question, and it is  necessary to resolve it. We arranged with President Asad that a  delegation of Russian experts from the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations would come to Damascus in the near future in  order, jointly with the Syrian side, to prepare such variants of  decisions that would not infringe on the interests of either  side. However, the task is not simple, and a quick resolution  should not be expected.    [Osipov] Is the Syrian side moving willingly to settle this  question?    [Ivanov] No one moves willingly to pay off debts, but I  sensed a quite constructive mood and desire to resolve this  problem--today, perhaps, this is the sole sore point that is a  definite irritant in our relations. Considering that both we and  the Syrians are interested in ridding relations of all  irritants, it can be assumed that their attitude is quite normal.</p>

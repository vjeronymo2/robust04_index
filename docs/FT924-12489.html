			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / People: Problems brewing Robin Simpson, under-secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, is to become director of the BREWERS' SOCIETY, the national trade association for the brewing and pub retailing industry. He takes over at a time when the brewing industry's relations with the government have been severely strained by the disruption caused by the enforced disposal of a third of the major brewers' pub estates. The industry is also becoming increasingly restive over the effects of the recession and the issue of EC duty harmonisation. Increased personal allowances for importing drinks into the UK, coming into effect next year, are seen as a particularly serious threat to drinks retailers in south-east England. Simpson, 52, a graduate of St Andrew's University, has been at the DTI since 1962. He was regional director in the north-east from 1986 to 1990 and is at present head of the DTI's steel, metals and minerals division. He succeeds Alan Tilbury, a former attorney-general of Botswana, who is retiring after 22 years with the society. Tilbury's appointment as director in 1990 broke the society's long tradition of filling the post from the top brass of the armed forces. ***** Robin Holland-Martin, a director of fund managers Henderson Administration Group, has joined the board of Dorling Kindersley in a non-executive capacity, in advance of the publisher's stock market listing at the end of the month. Old Etonian Holland-Martin, 53, is a former partner of Cazenove, brokers for the floatation, but says that, as he left Cazenove in 1974, there is no particular connection between his spell there and the current appointment. He has been a director of Henderson since 1983, and has also been involved with a number of venture capital companies. Currently chairman of the visiting committee for the Royal College of Art, Holland-Martin takes a particular interest in design - hence his enthusiasm for Dorling Kindersley, which specialises in highly illustrated reference books. He is the third non-executive director on the board, joining Juliet Kindersley, shareholder, and wife of chairman and chief executive Peter Kindersley; and Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer of Microsoft which, pre-floatation, holds a 26 per cent stake in the company. ***** John Lindsey, who resigned as executive director of the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) last December, has been made golf manager at St Andrews, a new post created as part of a management restructuring at St Andrews Links Trust, with effect from next January. The secretary of the Trust, Alec Beveridge, is retiring at the end of the year, and will be replaced by Nicky James as general manager and secretary. Lindsey, responsible for the golfing facilities which are next year being augmented by a fifth 18-hole course as well as new practice facilities, will report to James and usher in 'a new era in the provision of customer service' according to the Links Management committee chairman Robert Burns. Before his three years at the PGA, Lindsey, 46, had been on the promotional side of Rothmans International. After a spell in Australia, he returned to London for the group in 1984, and, working with Mark McCormack's International Management Group, helped set up the Dunhill Cup.</p>

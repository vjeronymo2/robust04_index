			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spanish Balance of Trade Improved by </F> 30 Percent in 1993"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Spanish balance of trade closed at the  end of 1993 with a deficit of 2.5 trillion pesetas, a figure  30.5 percent below the 1992 fiscal year, when a deficit of 3.5  trillion pesetas was reached, according to figures supplied by  the Ministry of the Economy and Finance yesterday.    These results are due to the "good performance by exports  and  the moderate performance by imports," which totaled 7.9 trillion  pesetas -- 20.8 percent more than in 1992 -- and which tripled  the figure recorded during the 12 months of 1992 [sentence as  published].    In 1993, imports [as published] represented a total of 10.4  trillion pesetas, a figure which represents a 2.7 percent  increase -- half that in 1992. The cover rate was 76.2 percent  during last year -- 11 percent above 1992.    According to the Economy Ministry, which described the 1993  results as "moderate, the foundations have been laid for the  recent upturn shown by most production and demand indicators to  become consolidated in 1994."    The geographical distribution of trade flows during last  year  shows a relative loss of importance by exports to the European  Union [EU], which represented 68.2 percent of the total, as  against the 71.2 percent registered during 1992. Imports from  the EU increased by 3.2 percent, as against the 2 percent  increase from other, non-Community, countries, a figure which  keeps their 61 percent share of total purchases virtually stable.    In the last month of 1993, the value of imports slightly  exceeded 1 trillion pesetas, which represented a percentage  increase of 21.1 percent with respect to the same month in 1992.  This "represents an appreciable acceleration with respect to the  rates recorded in previous months," according to the Economy  Ministry. As for exports, these reached the figure of 847  billion pesetas -- 34.2 percent more than in 1992.</p>

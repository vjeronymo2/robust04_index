The Vostokredmet industrial association, which until  recently mined and refined uranium, is situated in a suburb of  Khudzhand, an oblast center of Tajikistan. Thirty-five thousand  people, mostly Russians, who live and work at and around the  site have suddenly become unwanted by anyone, including Russia,  in a republic in the grip of a military confrontation. But the  golden minds and hands of these people have done everything to  save the enterprise. The construction of a gold refining  production line is now almost complete at the combine, which  will allow independent Tajikistan to have its gold in ingots by  the New Year holiday. Specialists at the combine designed and  built all the refining equipment themselves. [passage omitted]  [Video shows fields, machinery, lathes, panel marked "F-16  Electronic Casting Machine"]</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / MCI in Mideast telecoms deal The US telecommunications giant MCI said yesterday it had signed a contractual agreement with Patelco, a private company with the telecommunications concession for the Gaza Strip and West Bank, to provide international telephone network capacity. The MCI statement, made after a ceremony in Gaza yesterday which marked the transfer of the telecommunications network from the Israeli state-owned telecom company to Patelco, comes amid growing international controversy about the award of the contract. Mr Lawrence Kodacovi, senior vice-president of MCI, said Patelco would run and operate the telecommunications system in all Palestinian areas and MCI would provide the network capacity to link the Palestinian areas with the rest of the world. The US has formally complained to Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, about the absence of open public bidding for the telecoms contract.</p>

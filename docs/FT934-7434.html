			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ugland starts trading at 108p SHARES IN Ugland International, formerly Bristol Channel Ship Repairers, started trading yesterday at 108p. The shares were suspended in August at 8p pending the reorganisation of the company which was completed on Monday. The 80m 10p BCSR shares were consolidated into 4m ordinary shares with a nominal value of 20p and an effective worth of 160p. The company is offering a further 19.96m shares through a rights issue at 100p. The new company will have 24m shares in issue and a market capitalisation of about Pounds 26m. The rights, underwritten by Nomura International, will raise almost Pounds 19m net of expenses. Just over Pounds 16m will be used to buy Ugland Brothers, a ship management business, UB Shipping, which owns nine general cargo vessels, and a deep sea car-carrying vessel. Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman, and his family interests hold some 30 per cent of the shares and are taking up their rights in full. The board believes that the combination of the former BCSR repair operations in Swansea and the Ugland businesses will 'provide the foundations for a significant integrated international shipping group.' Joint stockbrokers to the rights issue, which closes on December 8, are Kleinwort Benson in the UK and Fondsfinans in Norway, where the company will seek a listing next month.</p>

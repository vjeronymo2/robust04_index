			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke slide continues THE SLIDE in Ladbroke shares continued as the market heeded the flow of profit downgrades begun on Friday by Smith New Court, joint broker to the leisure group. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which two weeks ago upgraded Ladbroke and last week highlighted the stock as one of its 'ten key buys' for 1993, yesterday moved the shares to its sell list. Concern focused on Ladbroke's vulnerability to increased interest charges triggered by currency fluctuations, estimated by some analysts at some Pounds 20m in the current trading year. Mr Paul Heath, leisure analyst at UBS, said: 'Having been told that pre-tax profits may be down by as much as 25 per cent, we remain very cautious about the outlook for 1993. 'He also cut his profits forecast, moving from Pounds 215m to Pounds 185m inclusive of disposals this year, and said his 1993 forecast may not be much above that figure. However, others in the market, while joining in the general downgrade, were more generous, most settling in the Pounds 195m to Pounds 210m range. The shares tumbled 11 to 169p in heavy turnover of 11m. Drug stocks down A news report that pharmaceuticals groups could lose up to Pounds 450m in UK sales as a result of planned reforms in Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was behind a fall in SmithKline Beecham. There was also some uncertainty following a meeting with analysts by Astra, Swedish rival to SmithKline. The NHS reforms, which will prompt creation of blacklists of products that will no longer be provided by the NHS on prescription, are expected to affect overseas companies selling in the UK rather than British companies. However, an instant reaction in SmithKline stock, was compounded by concern that the Astra analysts' meeting might bring good news concerning Losec, the Swedish group's anti-ulcer product. This would mean bad news for SmithKline's Tagamet as well as Glaxo's Zantac, and US investors chose to sell UK pharmaceuticals stocks. SmithKline fell sharply at the start of US trading, closing 12 off at 510p and 10 lower in the Units at 456p. Glaxo eased 2 to 810p. Owners Abroad Takeover talk returned to encircle Owners Abroad with rumours that negotiations with German group LTU were continuing. The tour operators market had been alive with such talk earlier this year after Owners shares had fallen from 108p in April to 46p in September. Then, speculation had pointed to Airtours, the rival operator, and seemed confirmed when Owners issued a statement confirming that it had received an early approach, generally thought to have been from Airtours. At its results meeting recently, Airtours had refused to comment on whether it would rekindle its interest in Owners. Meanwhile, German holiday group LTU, which bought the Thomas Cook travel chain earlier this year, has been holding informal discussions with several European tour operators. Its talks with Owners have been widely reported in the trade press. The stock exchange authorities confirmed, at the company's request, that Owners was still in a 'takeover situation'. The shares rose 5 to 83p. Airtours added 2 at 263p. There was renewed uncertainty among traders in the oil sector as the two majors, BP and Shell, stayed in positive territory, in spite of bad news from two of the top European oil and gas groups, Belgium's Petrofina and French group Total. BP closed 2 up at 224p on turnover of 6m and Shell held at 546p. Dealers said BP had been sustained by yet another bout of US buying, thought to have been triggered by last Friday's presentation by BP executives to US institutions. Lasmo remained in the firing line, sliding 5 to 140p as the market reacted to growing fears about potential sales from the Morcambe Bay gas field, the current weakness of oil prices and recent heavy selling by two of the UK's most influential fund management groups, both of which have notifiable stakes in Lasmo. Premier Consolidated, meanwhile, edged up  1/4 to 18p, with some analysts warming to the latest news from the company's drilling success off the coast of Burma. BZW, the investment bank, was thought to have been the prime mover behind a rise of 8 to 678p by Burmah Castrol. The stabilisation of the Hong Kong market prompted a partial recovery of confidence in the Far Eastern favourites. HSBC moved ahead confidently, eventually closing a net 6 better at 476p on turnover of 3.3m. Even heavier activity was noted in the Hong Kong-registered shares, which put on 3 to 466p. More than 5m of the overseas-registered shares changed hands, including a block of 4.5m shares traded for cash at 460p a share. Standard Chartered rose 7 to 535p. General Accident, regarded as the composite insurer with the largest exposure to the US, retreated 6 to 543p after sustained selling pressure in the wake of the floods and storms affecting the east coast of the US. Guardian Royal edged up 3 to 173p, shrugging aside the Standard &amp; Poor's warning on Guardian's life business rating. Willis Corroon added 7 at 185p following news of the recent US buying activity which saw Morgan Guaranty Trust acquire a further 1.5 per cent of the shares, taking the stake up to 27.19 per cent. Cable and Wireless, weakened in recent sessions by the worries surrounding Hong Kong, staged a determined rally, with small bouts of institutional buying uncovering a stock shortage. The shares closed 20 higher at 667p on low turnover of 2.4m. The week-long upsurge in Tadpole Technology shares continued at the outset, with the stock boosted to over 230p initially. However, the first serious wave of selling pressure saw the shares plummet to end another day of heavy activity a net 15 off at 179p. Several of the City's biggest institutions emerged as big buyers of the stock over the past sessions. The announcement that Fisons has agreed to sell its UK consumer health business to Roche Holding for Pounds 90m did little for the shares. The stock ended a net 2 firmer at 212p. Reuters Holdings were 31p lower at one stage because of a press article critical of Globex, Reuters' automated dealing system. The shares rallied to close 18 off at 1331p. Marketing services group WPP was steady at 43p ahead of a forecast cut and downgrade by agency broker James Capel. The house has moved the stock to a sell and reduced it 1992 forecast to Pounds 13m from Pounds 30m because of exceptional costs. Leisure conglomerate Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, rose 7 to 381p as it was announced that Prudential had been buying shares and now has a 3 per cent stake. Rumblings that independent broking house Cazenove had raised forecasts for Dorling Kindersley helped the international publishing group. The stock put on 10 to 255p. Smiths Industries moved ahead 8 to 349p, with Kleinwort Benson said to have shown a keen interest in the stock. One suggestion was that Smiths might be interested in Vicker's medical division. Vickers firmed 3 to 92p. Securities house BZW was reported to have reduced its current year profits forecast for TI Group, by Pounds 20m to Pounds 130m. The shares responded by falling 6 to 278p. A recommendation from County NatWest helped Glynwed International gain 5 to 233p. In the other industrials sector, English China Clays fell 11 to 415p in thin trading, with Smith New Court reported to have joined other brokers in downgrading current year profits estimates. Confirmation of an 11 per cent increase in the dividend to 4.9p at Tiphook, as it reported a well flagged set of interim results showing a 10.2 per cent decline in profits, cheered the market. The shares advanced 10 to 294p. Last week's stock overhang in P &amp; O and Associated British Ports appeared to have been cleared in both cases. The former added 5 at 459p in trade of 1.2m shares and the latter put on 7 to 330p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (59).

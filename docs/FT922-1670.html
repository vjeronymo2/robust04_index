			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Sales ploy to block bypass 'frivolous' A DEVICE to block construction of a road by selling small plots of land to protesters was dismissed as 'frivolous and vexatious' by the High Court yesterday. The Norfolk branch of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, had paid about Pounds 2,000 for a  3/4 -mile stretch of disused railway line lying across the proposed route of the Wymondham bypass. It then sold plots to 1,700 supporters and claimed that the Department of Transport had failed in its legal duty to notify each individual plot owner of its plan to acquire their land through compulsory purchase orders. Mr Justice McCullough ruled that the scheme was a device to frustrate the department.</p>

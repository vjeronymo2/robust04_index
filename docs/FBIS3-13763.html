			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Al Rabia [March] 19, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY -- After more than three weeks since the massacre was  committed by the Israeli terrorists at al-Hram al-Ibrahimi, the  so called Security Council adopted a vaguely worded condemnation  of the massacre without any reference to its perpetrators.  Despite the vagueness of the resolution, the USA abstained from  voting for the resolution. Moreover the American representative  declared that her government opposed any reference to the Arab  lands occupied by Israel as occupied lands including the city of  Jerusalem.    The Security Council resorted, on the behest of the USA, to  a  strange way in voting on the resolution. Accordingly, voting  was taken on each paragraph separately. The resolution did not  refer to any responsibility of the Israelis in this crime nor to  any condemnation of Israel's state terrorism.    The condemnation was worded, in each paragraph, in a manner  that did not refer directly to those responsible for the  massacre or charging anyone for this act.    JANA's editor for international affairs described what took  place in the so called Security Council as a new absurdity  showing once again that the Security Council is a lie. This  showed clearly that the Security Council is the Western  Christian countries, if not America, which dominate it and that  the alliance between Christians and Jews against Muslims lies  behind this American stance towards the massacre of al-Haram  al-Ibrahimi. It has become clear to the whole world that the  resolutions passed in the name of the Security Council  especially in relation to Arab matters are wholly  Western-American resolutions. The resolution was adopted without  any effective condemnation of Israel for terrorism for America  did not want this condemnation or sanctions imposed on Israel  whereas when it comes to issues which may serve her political  objectives, America pass, on mere suspicion, resolutions of  condemnation for terrorism imposing sanctions and embargo and  applying Chapter Seven of the U.N Charter against whomever she  wishes. This stance exposes America and deprives her even of  the fig leaf revealing her before the whole world as a terrorist  state sponsoring and supporting official terrorism and  protecting its perpetrators.    JANA's editor for international affairs concluded his  commentary by stressing that "the act of the Security Council  today shows clearly what the leader of the revolution meant in  statement immediately in the wake of the massacre of al-Haram  al-Ibrahimi when he declared `although the massacre represents  the most hideous act of terrorism ever seen in the world.' It  is clear and express act of terrorism but we challenge the West  to announce this fact and admit that the act of the Israelis is  a premeditated official terrorism. It is part of a long chain  of Israeli terrorist acts and condemn the Israelis for  terrorism."</p>

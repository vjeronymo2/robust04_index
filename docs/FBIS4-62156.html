			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vorontsov] </F>   [Text] Berlin, 12 May -- A detailed scenario for the  farewell ceremony for the Russian forces leaving Germany will be  drawn up by the end of this week and presented to President  Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl for final agreement, Pavel  Grachev, the Russian defense minister told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent. The defense minister arrived today at the  Western Group of Russian Forces, where he will spend two days  getting himself acquainted with the progress in the preparations  for the farewell ceremony, and will discuss the details of the  final stage of the event with the group's commanding officers.    Pavel Grachev pointed out that "the only right decision" was  made yesterday at the highest level concerning the farewell  ceremony for the Russian forces in Berlin, with the Russian  president and the German chancellor attending. "Now it is our  turn to get down to business" -- the Russian defense minister  said.    Pavel Grachev said that the main political outcome of  yesterday's Russian-German summit was that the leaders of two  major European countries had confirmed their striving for closer  cooperation not only in bilateral relations but also in ensuring  security throughout the continent.    Replying to a question on Russia's concept for relations  within the framework of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program,  the defense minister said that thorough preparation work is  continuing on the Russian concept. After it is agreed on by the  Russian Federation Security Council and the Russian president,  Pavel Grachev will present it to Brussels on 24 May. In  connection with this he noted that it is a question not of an  "alternative" document but only of Russia presenting its views  as a great power on its role and place in the "Partnership for  Peace" program.    The defense minister recalled that Boris Yeltsin stated in  Bonn yesterday that an agreement on this program was reached in  principle and that readiness was expressed to join the programme  after Russia's views are presented and it's role in this program  defined.</p>

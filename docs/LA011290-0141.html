			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE PANEL PRODS CITIES ON MASONRY DANGER;  </P> <P> SEISMIC SAFETY: NEWPORT BEACH, ONE OF SEVEN ORANGE COUNTY CITIES THAT HAVE  REPORTED TO THE PANEL, LEADS THE COUNTY IN UNREINFORCED BUILDINGS WITH 127.  </P> <P> More than half of the cities in the most earthquake-prone parts of California  have failed to complete the first steps toward upgrading their most dangerous  masonry buildings, a Seismic Safety Commission report released Thursday showed.  </P> <P> "Our lives are threatened by these buildings, and cities that have ignored the  law or that have adopted ineffective programs are simply letting us down,"  Commission Director L. Thomas Tobin said in a statement Thursday.  </P> <P> Tobin said only a fourth of the 366 cities and counties in the regions most  threatened by earthquakes have identified their masonry buildings and embarked  on programs to bring them up to safety standards. Another 20% claim to have no  unreinforced masonry buildings.  </P> <P> Tobin's analysis was released as the commission continued its investigation of  the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. Officials say at least 10 of the 62 deaths  during the quake are blamed on unreinforced masonry buildings, including five  people who were crushed when a wall of bricks fell onto a parking lot in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Legislature passed a law calling on cities and counties to  identify hazardous masonry buildings. They were also to adopt and begin  implementing plans for bringing those buildings up to minimum safety standards.  </P> <P> The law had a Jan. 1 deadline but included no penalties for failure to comply.  </P> <P> "We are pleased with the progress," Tobin said, "but on the other hand, we are  disappointed that over half of the cities and counties covered under the law  have yet to comply."  </P> <P> Los Angeles and several neighboring cities are in the forefront of requiring  owners to fix their unreinforced masonry buildings. But Tobin said 49  municipalities and counties have failed to so much as inform the commission  about any progress they may have made.  </P> <P> Riverside, Monterey and Imperial counties, as well as several cities in Los  Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties, are among those that have failed to  contact the commission.  </P> <P> The commission staff is not sure of the extent of the problem in the 49 cities  and counties that failed to respond. But the commission estimated that  Escondido has 24 unreinforced masonry buildings, El Monte has 25, San Clemente  35, Rialto 40 and San Gabriel 50.  </P> <P> San Clemente Councilwoman Holly Ann Veale said Thursday night that the city did  not report to the commission because it had not completed its tally of  unreinforced masonry buildings. "We do not have the same resources as do larger  cities," Veale said. "We're doing the best we can, and we hope to complete it  soon."  </P> <P> Several cities identified as among those attempting to comply with the  requirement, in fact, have a long way to go. San Francisco, for example, has  more than 2,000 unreinforced masonry buildings, more than any other city in  California.  </P> <P> Of the seven cities in Orange County that have complied with the commission's  reporting requirement, Newport Beach has the highest number with 127  unreinforced buildings. The others are Huntington Beach, 152; Brea, 27; Santa  Ana, 20; Anaheim, 16; Placentia, 16, and La Habra, 15.  </P> <P> Tobin called on the commission to back legislation that would penalize cities  that failed to bring the masonry buildings up to minimum seismic safety  standards. Such a law also would provide money for seismic upgrading.  </P> <P> In his letter, Tobin went on to advocate extending the requirement that brick  buildings be brought up to minimum standards to Central California and San  Diego -- areas thought to be less threatened by earthquakes. The commission  postponed discussion of the proposal.  </P> <P> In other testimony, University of California President David Gardner said he  opposed suggestions that warning signs be posted on campus buildings that would  be unsafe in major quakes.  </P> <P> Gardner noted that the main libraries at UCLA and UC Berkeley are thought to be  unsafe in major earthquakes, but he said warning signs "artificially deal with  the issue."  </P> <P> "What is a student to do?" Gardner asked. "They really don't have the  discretion to go in or not go in."  </P></p>

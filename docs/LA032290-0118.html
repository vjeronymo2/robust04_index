			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALPHA BETA SUES CITY OVER CARTS;  </P> <P> COURTS: GLENDALE WANTS $15 EACH FOR MORE THAN 200 STRAY CARTS, A CHARGE THE  MARKET CALLS 'EXTORTION.'  </P> <P> A local grocery store has filed a $75,000 lawsuit against the city of Glendale,  charging that an ordinance allowing the city to confiscate stray shopping carts  and charge grocers to get them back is "extortion."  </P> <P> The suit by Alpha Beta, 1122 E. Broadway, was filed last Thursday in Glendale  Superior Court. It claims that the city unlawfully seized more than 200 carts  that had been taken from the store's lots and left on public property and has  refused to return them.  </P> <P> "It's tantamount to having your car stolen, then going to the impound yard and  being told, "OK, you've got to pay a special fee to get your car back,' " said  Mark Geragos, an attorney representing Alpha Beta. "When your property is taken  away from you, you shouldn't have to pay to get it back. In any other  situation, that's called extortion. It's punishing the victim."  </P> <P> In November, 1988, the City Council, frustrated by a growing number of carts  abandoned on streets, sidewalks, parks and other public areas, passed an  ordinance authorizing the city to collect the carts and charge grocers $15 each  for their return.  </P> <P> But a year later, after more than 800 stray carts were rounded up and kept at a  public works yard, council members adopted an ordinance that exempted groceries  from the $15 per-cart charge if they agreed to install electronic cart-control  devices.  </P> <P> Several stores, including Alpha Beta, agreed to use the device, which would  automatically lock the wheels of shopping carts taken off the stores' property.  </P> <P> Vons, Lucky Stores and Ralphs then picked up, at no charge, hundreds of their  carts that had been kept at the yard, said Albert Lee, a maintenance supervisor  at the yard.  </P> <P> But the device, called Kart Kontrol, failed to work, leaving city officials  searching earlier this month for a new system.  </P> <P> Geragos said last week that Alpha Beta has considered other cart-control  systems but that they are costly to install. He said the grocery may not pursue  the lawsuit if the store's carts are returned without charge.  </P> <P> City officials have estimated the carts are worth about $100 apiece. But  Geragos said a cart costs about $400. He contended that the city damaged Alpha  Beta's carts when it stored them and should reimburse the grocery for the time  and money it has lost trying to retrieve the carts.  </P> <P> Ray Cruz, a city administrative assistant who oversees collection of the carts,  was not available for comment. But City Atty. Scott Howard said the ordinance  authorizing the collection "is lawful, appropriate and constitutional."  </P> <P> "These carts are a hazard and they're a nuisance," Howard said. "The courts  generally hold that where you have the type of business that's going to  contribute to the problem, you have an obligation to cure the problem. It's the  market's responsibility to ensure that these carts don't get scattered around  the streets."  </P></p>

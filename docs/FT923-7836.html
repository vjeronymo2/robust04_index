			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / French state insurers under fire on HIV cover MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, yesterday criticised Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled insurance group, for threatening to withdraw its cover from blood transfusion centres which have been implicated in a scandal over Aids-tainted blood supplies. On Thursday morning UAP, which is France's biggest insurer, announced it was not obliged to pay damages to people who contracted the HIV virus through transfusions from 25 regional centres where officials allegedly failed to notify UAP they were knowingly using infected blood. UAP said late on Thursday that it had reversed its decision. The French insurers' association yesterday announced that its members were extending the transfusion centres' cover until the end of the year. France's regional blood transfusion centres are being sued by people who were infected with HIV after receiving transfusions, even though the health officials involved allegedly knew the blood was infected. More than 1,200 people, mostly haemophiliacs, are known to have been infected with HIV by transfusions - 256 have died. Damages have been awarded to some HIV victims. Other cases are still pending, including the case against Dr Michel Garretta, former director of the National Blood Transfusion Centre, in which Mr Laurent Fabius, former French prime minister, now first secretary of the ruling Socialist party, gave evidence. Had UAP gone ahead with its original threat, the transfusion centres would have been forced to pay their own damages. Some centres would almost certainly have gone bankrupt. This would have caused even more embarrassment for the government, already under fire for the involvement of senior socialists such as Mr Fabius in the Garretta case. Mr Sapin yesterday condemned UAP's initial announcement saying it had been made 'without sufficient consideration'. His public comments underlined the strength of the government's feeling on the issue. It usually prefers to resolve disagreements with state companies in private.</p>

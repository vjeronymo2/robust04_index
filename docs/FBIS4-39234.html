			<p>BFN     [Text] "The goals of the Accord for Russia movement -- the  arrival to power of the opposition forces, the restoration of  the Soviet Union, and economic and social order -- are  compatible with the goals of the Agrarian Party, although our  attitude to this movement is cautious, Chairman of the Agrarian  Party Mikhail Lapshin told Interfax. He explained his position  by the fact that the agrarians favored a broader coalition of  opposition forces and by the fears lest agricultural workers  might be used by one of this movement's wings to advance their  own political interests.    The opposition forces cannot disregard the growing strength  of the agrarian movement, he continued. The time has come when  the left-wing forces must give their backing to agricultural  workers, who are ready to act resolutely in accordance with the  Constitution against the current regime, he said.    Lapshin signed the statement by the Accord for Russia  movement's leaders, but did not attend the first session of its  national council on May 28, saying that he was busy working in  the State Duma.</p>

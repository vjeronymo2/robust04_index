			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WARNER OVERCOMES CHRIS-CRAFT OBSTACLE TO MERGER WITH TIME  </P> <P> Warner Communications Inc. said today it settled a longstanding dispute with  its largest shareholder, clearing another potential obstacle to the  entertainment company's planned $18-billion merger with Time Inc.  </P> <P> The shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc., joined Time and Warner in  announcing the settlement that the companies said would permit the Time merger  with Warner to proceed "without any delay or adjustment."  </P> <P> Warner and Chris-Craft had entered an agreement in 1984 in which they acquired  stakes in each other in what was seen as a defensive maneuver by Warner to  avoid a hostile takeover.  </P> <P> But in the years since the pact was signed, relations soured between Warner and  Chris-Craft and there was some concern it could delay the proposed Warner  merger with Time.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Warner sued Chris-Craft, seeking an order that would have  compelled Chris-Craft to resolve any objections to the merger. That litigation  was resolved under today's settlement.  </P></p>

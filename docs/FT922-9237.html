			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Sweden seeks to enter EMS before joining EC MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday held out his country's firm intent of seeking association with the European Monetary System before Sweden's planned EC membership in 1995. European finance ministers are expected at the weekend to have a preliminary discussion about Sweden's wish to link the crown to Europe's exchange rate stabilisation scheme, Mr Bildt said. He was speaking after talks in London with Mr John Major, the British prime minister. These centred on Sweden's desire for speedy accession to the EC, with negotiations expected to get under way early next year.</p>

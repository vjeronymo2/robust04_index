			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Beijing news shocker: The Chinese press is undergoing radical change Madam Yang, the Beijing newspaper vendor, had no doubt what sells papers and magazines. 'News,' she declared. 'That's what sells. You've got to have hard news.' 'What I'd like to tell newspaper editors,' she added, speaking near her stand at the entrance to a Beijing subway, 'is to get more original and bizarre stories in their papers, make them more entertaining. You may frown on it, but that's what makes a paper sell.' Madam Yang could have been repeating the gospel according to Mr Rupert Murdoch, the publishing tycoon who visited Beijing recently, in his efforts to extend his empire to the Chinese mainland. But her attitude and her enterprise also reflect the enormous changes that have overtaken China's press in the past few years. Take Madam Yang herself. Her small stand, which turns a tidy profit each month, is a relatively new phenomenon. Back in the days when choice of newspapers for Beijing's residents was restricted to a few, grey Communist party-controlled propaganda sheets, such as the People's Daily, distributed mostly by subscription, there was no need for newspaper vendors. At the People's Daily itself, located in a sprawling walled compound in a Beijing suburb, mention of the fate that befell Pravda, its Soviet equivalent, brings a worried response. Pravda is barely surviving with a circulation of 500,000, down from 10m in its heyday. The Daily's circulation has also slumped, to 3m from a high of 6m in the 1970s. Mr Wu Changsheng, a senior People's Daily editor, makes no attempt to disguise his concerns. 'In the past,' he says, 'We didn't have any competition, therefore we didn't have to worry much about attracting readers. Now, our task is to make the paper more attractive and appealing without losing authority.' For much of the past four decades since the Communists came to power in 1949, numbers of newspapers had been limited. There were as few as 100 papers in the country, before liberalisation of the market in the 1980s prompted a proliferation of new titles. By the end of last year, 1,635 newspapers were being published, with combined annual sales of about 25.2bn copies. Circulation grew by about 20 per cent last year over the year before. Mr Shi Feng, an official of China's Press and Publishing Administration, which is responsible for licensing new publications, says there is enormous continuing demand for licences, both for newspapers and magazines including business publications. The surge in magazine titles has perhaps been even more notable than for newspapers. Some 6,400 magazines, the bulk of them technical, are published in China with a combined circulation of 2.3bn. Apart from the big number of periodicals coming on to the market, papers themselves are also getting bigger - from a typical four pages to as many as 12. Papers are also publishing more supplements and weekend special editions. In short, Chinese publications are becoming more commercial. Just how commercial became apparent the other day when the official Shanghai Wenhui Daily covered its entire front page with a large advertisement for air conditioners. This prompted an outcry among readers, and a worried reaction from competitors. But Wenhui business managers were unrepentant since, as they explained, the paper is now obliged to make its own way in China's market economy. China's establishment press and its problems were the subject of a somewhat plaintive article in a recent issue of Outlook, a magazine published by the official New China News Agency, whose reporters had conducted an investigation into the decline of the 'big papers'. These inquiries yielded some revealing comments, including those of an anonymous People's Daily editor who said with surprising candour: 'The news that (People's Daily) publishes is not new, which is not only insulting to the word 'news', but is also deceiving to the readers.' The magazine also related several colourful anecdotes to reinforce the point. In one, an editor of an 'establishment' paper, such as the People's Daily, returning home one night and finding on the dinner table the same old fare, asked his wife why? To which, she replied: 'I learn it from your newspaper. Don't you serve the same thing everyday.' It is the new papers and magazines which have departed from the 'standard' fare that are, not surprisingly, doing best. These publications have been building circulation rapidly by printing titillating and semi-scandalous reports on subjects ranging from the private lives of film stars and singers to fairly explicit surveys of such previously taboo issues as homosexuality. While editors are prepared to countenance fairly racy stories these days, such daring does not extend to political stories. All practise a form of self-censorship that would not be required of an editor in the west; although Chinese editors say that circumstances are becoming more liberal again after the crackdown that followed the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy activists in Beijing. 'The political atmosphere is much better now, though it's not perfect,' said Mr Li of the China Youth Daily, one of the country's 'big papers'. 'There's always room to improve. But the trend is getting better and easier.' That may be so, but the battle for real press freedom is only really just beginning, and there is no indication that the Communist party might allow real criticism of the political system and its leaders. Nevertheless, the Chinese word, toumingdu, meaning transparency in the media and in government, is heard more frequently these days; and some of the more daring publishers and editors are openly challenging the status quo. Thus, the publisher of Shanghai's Liberation Daily, probably the country's most liberal publication, recently argued strongly that all Chinese have a right to know - a fairly radical concept by local standards. 'If we really want to become an 'open China' in the eyes of the world, we must first open up the press. Journalists have the right to interview, the media has the right to report, and the public has the right to know,' he wrote. But in a country where the media has long been the exclusive preserve of the Communist party the notion of the 'right to know' smacks of a dangerous virus, and one that party officials are coming to terms with only reluctantly.</p>

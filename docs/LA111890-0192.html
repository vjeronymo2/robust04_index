			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERLINERS PROTEST MILITARY SERVICE  </P> <P> Several thousand young people demanding the abolition of military service  marched through Berlin on Saturday in a peaceful demonstration capping a week  of violent rioting in the city.  </P> <P> Hundreds of police cordoned off the route, questioning or frisking anyone  wanting to join the march.  </P> <P> The demonstrators were protesting the reintroduction of conscription in western  Berlin since German unification and the ending of the rights of the World War  II allies. City residents had been exempt from military service under an  agreement among the four major war victors -- the Soviet Union, the United  States, Britain and France.  </P> <P> Earlier last week, police fought fierce street battles with militant building  squatters in eastern Berlin and evicted them.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> NEW POLICE PISTOLS TO BE PAID FOR BY CITY  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to pay for police officers'  semiautomatic weapons.  </P> <P> The police chief authorized use of the 9-millimeter guns in October, 1989, but  officers who wanted them were required to buy them on their own.  </P> <P> Standard issue equipment has been .357 revolvers.  </P> <P> "This is something that obviously we would have liked to have done back in  October of last year, but the finances were not available then," Tustin Police  Capt. Steve Foster said.  </P> <P> The city will purchase the automatic pistols, holsters and ammunition pouches  for officers who want them and reimburse the 45 officers who have already  bought the weapons. Total cost will be between $60,000 and $65,000, Foster  said.  </P> <P> The semiautomatic weapon increases the officer's firepower, because the  individual officer armed with one would normally carry 45 rounds -- 15 in the  clip and two additional clips. The .357 pistol carries six in the cylinder and  the officer would normally carry 12 more rounds in his ammunition pouches.  </P> <P> Most other police departments in the county pay for officers' semiautomatic  weapons, which load faster and smoother than revolvers, said Tustin City  Councilman Jim Potts, a sergeant in the Irvine Police Department.  </P> <P> Potts suggested the policy after a resident wrote him a letter, contending that  making officers pay for their weapons is like hiring a secretary and making her  buy her own typewriter.  </P></p>

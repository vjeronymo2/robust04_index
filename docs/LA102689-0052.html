			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FULL HOUSE BACKFIELD PAYS OFF;  </P> <P> SERRA HIGH'S SPEEDSTERS RACK UP 40 TOUCHDOWNS IN SEVEN GAMES;  </P> <P> PREPS: COACH LEO HAND HAS ONLY ONE FAVORITE PLAY, THE PITCH. THAT'S WHERE HIS  PLAYER PITCHES THE BALL TO THE REFEREE AFTER CROSSING THE GOAL LINE.  </P> <P> When Leo Hand became head football coach at Serra High School last spring, he  explained his offensive philosophy in simple terms.  </P> <P> "I told the players I only have one favorite play in football, and that's the  pitch play," he said. "That's where the guy crosses the goal line and pitches  the ball to the referee."  </P> <P> Hand stole the line from former USC Coach John McKay, but it applies to Serra  perhaps more than it ever did to the Trojans. Through seven games this season,  the Cavaliers have crossed the goal line 40 times, an average of 5.7 touchdowns  per game.  </P> <P> Serra's speedy full-house backfield of quarterback Fred Safford, fullback  Dennis Gerard and halfbacks Lamont Daniel and Jerald Henry have done the bulk  of the scoring, accounting for 36 touchdowns -- all on the ground.  </P> <P> This is a team that likes to run. And run. And run.  </P> <P> "We'll run until someone stops the run," Safford said, matter-of-factly. "Then  we'll pass. But ain't no one stopped the run yet."  </P> <P> Serra's team statistics support Safford. The Cavaliers lead the South Bay in  rushing with 2,104 yards, an average of 301 per game, and they are last in  passing with 220 yards, an average of 31 per game. In last Friday's 52-6 win  over St. Anthony, the Cavaliers rushed for 355 yards and attempted two passes,  both incomplete.  </P> <P> So far, the lack of a passing attack hasn't hurt. Serra (7-0 overall, 2-0 in  the Camino Real League) has outscored its opponents, 276-39, and is ranked No.  2 behind Lompoc in the Southern Section Division VII poll.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers figure to add to their lopsided stats Friday night when they  visit hapless Pius X of Downey (0-7, 0-2) in a Camino Real League game.  </P> <P> All four members of Serra's full-house backfield credit team unity for their  impressive start. There is no jealousy among the stars.  </P> <P> "We decided to play as a team and not individually," Safford said. "We act as a  family. It's not just going out there and saying, 'I'm going to get mine, I  hope you get yours.' It's more of a team concept."  </P> <P> Said Gerard, who leads the team with 18 touchdowns: "I think the fact that our  line works hard, both in practice and in the games, and the defense holds the  other teams to few scores makes it easy on us."  </P> <P> The diminutive members of the backfield -- all four starters are 5-foot-9 or  shorter -- also give a great deal of credit to Hand and his 22 years of  experience.  </P> <P> Before he arrived at Serra, Hand intended to run an I formation. But once he  got to the Gardena school, he realized he had too many talented tailbacks to  limit the offense to just one starter.  </P> <P> "This is something I decided to do with these particular athletes," he said of  the full-house T offense. "We wanted to utilize as many (tailbacks) as we  possibly could. Right now, we've got three of them in there."  </P> <P> That would be Henry and Daniel, the team's halfbacks, and Safford, who is  basically a tailback playing quarterback. Together with Gerard, a powerful  runner who can bench press 325 pounds, the backfield gives opposing defenses  plenty to be concerned about.  </P> <P> "You can't focus on one guy," said Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, whose team lost  to the Cavaliers, 36-13, on Sept. 22. "You can't get caught up looking into the  backfield because they run a lot of misdirection. They can attack you at  different places with all the speed they have."  </P> <P> Hand learned the full-house T from Taft College Coach Al Baldock and used it  off-and-on during his four years as head coach at Servite High in Anaheim. He  described it as "sequence football." The formation consists of three running  backs, two wide receivers and no tight end.  </P> <P> "All the plays are tied together," Hand said. "We start with the basic play,  which is running Dennis (Gerard) off tackle. Then we draw up all the different  defenses in football. We figure out every way teams can stop it.  </P> <P> "When they do the things they need to do to stop Dennis, then they have left  themselves vulnerable in some other area. And it's my job to find that out."  </P> <P> In last week's win over St. Anthony, Serra used Gerard mostly as a decoy during  the first quarter and had success running the ball wide to Daniel and Henry.  After building a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, the Cavaliers went to Gerard  on the first play of the second quarter and the fullback busted loose for a  65-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> After just 10 offensive plays, Serra had built a 22-0 lead.  </P> <P> Gerard, a 5-9, 190-pound senior who lives in Carson, said Serra's ability to  run at will has a demoralizing effect on opponents.  </P> <P> "After a while, no one wants to tackle us head-on," he said. "They go for the  legs. Pasadena came out fired up against us. But it got to the point where we  were coming at them so hard, they didn't want to hit us any more. They would  just step to the side and make a soft tackle. Then they stopped talking."  </P> <P> Serra silenced Pasadena, 40-0, in its opener.  </P> <P> Although Hand will not release individual statistics until after the season in  order to maintain his philosophy of "team before player," the coach said Gerard  surpassed the 1,000-yard mark last week.  </P> <P> The rest of the backfield starters also have been productive.  </P> <P> Safford, a 5-6, 155-pound senior from Inglewood, has seven touchdowns. Henry  (5-8, 170), a junior from Carson whose older brother John was an All-Camino  Real League running back at Verbum Dei last year, has eight TDs. And Daniel  (5-8, 152), a senior who has run the 100 meters in 10.9 seconds, has three TDs.  </P> <P> To a man, the backs say they are on a mission to reach the Division VII  championship game. Serra's only previous appearance in a Southern Section final  was in 1980, a team the present group is frequently compared with.  </P> <P> Last year, the Cavaliers reached the second round of the playoffs after  capturing their third consecutive Camino Real League title. A win over rival  Verbum Dei on Nov. 2 will make it four in a row.  </P> <P> "We want to go out in style," Gerard said. "With rings on our fingers and  shirts and jackets."  </P> <P> If Serra keeps playing the way it has, the football team may well be the  best-dressed group on campus come December.  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Can you afford to retire? - Low interest rates have introduced a new hazard IF WORK was such a wonderful thing, someone once said, the rich would keep it to themselves. Many people are only too eager to give up their daily stint at the office. A Norwich Union survey found, for example, that two out of three workers want to retire before they are 60, writes Philip Coggan, Personal Finance Editor. Early retirement brings its financial headaches, however. Someone retiring at 55 could easily live for another 35 years  - longer than the time they had been in work. They could find that they spend more, not less, after retirement; after all, being at work stops you spending money. According to Norwich Union, four in five people expect to spend more on holidays once they retire. Three quarters expect to move to more comfortable surroundings. With a greying population, the state is not likely to be able to afford very generous retirement benefits: most people expect the government to opt for an equalised pension age of 65 for men and women. Furthermore, the number of people who work all their lives at one company, and retire on two-thirds of their final salary, is extremely limited; Laurentian Financial Group puts it at 1 per cent. In any case, final-salary schemes, where the employer bears all the risk, are gradually giving way to money-purchase schemes, where the eventual pension depends on the investment performance of the fund. In short, those who want to retire early may need to depend on their own savings efforts. But how many realise this? Laurentian found that 35 per cent of workers (including 31 per cent of those over 55) had no idea what their pension would be. Even those who have been assiduously saving over the years may have a false idea of the amount of income they can earn on their capital. Too many people have a mental '10 per cent' rule, and expect that kind of return on their money. But earning 10 per cent these days probably requires you to eat into your capital. Now that base rates have dropped, and we appear to be in an era of low growth and low inflation, 5 per cent net may be the best that savers can expect to earn without eroding their capital. In other words, for every pound of income you expect to earn from your savings in retirement, you need to have 20 in capital. To earn Pounds 10,000 a year from savings, you must build up a capital sum of Pounds 200,000. Those who have built up adequate provision through a personal pension may still find the timing of early retirement a bit of a gamble. Most of the pension fund must be used to buy an annuity, which will provide income for the rest of the individual's life. Annuity rates are set with reference to yields on long-term gilts; if you lock in while yields are low, your income suffers. And if you die one day after buying the annuity, the capital could be lost. These drawbacks have led to the concept of staggered vesting, the pensions buzzword of the moment. It allows receipt of pension benefits to be phased over several years. But staggered vesting is not a cure-all and, as Eric Short explains below, its suitability depends on circumstances.</p>

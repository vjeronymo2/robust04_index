			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / People: Wakebourne Leslie Warman, 47, a former senior executive with Lloyds Merchant Bank, has taken over as chairman of Wakebourne, the computer services and support group which has emerged from the shambles of the collapsed Maddox group. Warman, a non-executive director of John Tams and LBS Financial Software, made his name among institutional investors by standing up to Philip Green, the controversial boss of Amber Day Holdings. His resignation in June 1992, after just under a year on the board, signalled that all was not well and within a matter of months Green had been forced to quit after a collapse in Amber Day's profits. Wakebourne, which changed its name from Maddox Group, has had a controversial history under its previous chairman Hugo Biermann, a colourful South African entrepreneur. He resigned last November after the company announced massive losses and City institutions were forced to come to its rescue. Although the company has been overshadowed by unfortunate publicity, its computer services operation is well regarded and has been run by the same management team for the past 10 years.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Row over Spring Ram audit emerges THE ROW between Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, and its auditors Arthur Andersen came into the open yesterday with Andersen saying it had raised doubts about 1992 profit expectations 'at an early stage'. Spring Ram has blamed accounting rule changes - applied to its figures late in the day - for 1992 pre-tax profits falling to Pounds 26.2m, one third below the expected Pounds 39m and 28 per cent below 1991's Pounds 36.2m. The figures were reached after much haggling with Arthur Andersen. Spring Ram's share price halved last week on news of the impending disappointment. Andersen denied yesterday that it had told Spring Ram it could not support the board's pre-tax profit figure only days before results were due. It had made its reservations known early about analysts' expectations. As discussions over the 1992 figures started in November, it is understood general doubts were expressed before the end of the year. More specific points came up as the figures emerged. Main reasons for the shortfall were that Pounds 5.6m of profits were being booked early on land sales and kitchen contracts, and that the group was prevented from capitalising Pounds 4m of product development costs. The audit was conducted amid criticism of Spring Ram's aggressive accounting policies and weak financial controls. In November false accounting came to light at the Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary. In December, Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, and Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, toured City institutions reassuring them that Balterley was a 'one-off' and about the 'reality' of the group's profits. 'It has not been done by Mickey Mouse creative accounting,' said Mr Greenwood. There is strong pressure on him to go. His position and that of Arthur Andersen will be discussed by the board this week. Mr Rooney has been criticised for effectively combining the roles of chairman and chief executive. One of two non-executives the group plans to appoint may take the role of chairman. The share price closed at 75p yesterday, compared with a high last May of 181p. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KV/PL: "European Union Protest Against </F> Foreign Bank Discrimination in United States"]    [Text] Yesterday, in a joint letter addressed to the U.S.  Government and Congress, the twelve European Union (EU) member  states and the European Commission (EC) protested against a bill  proposed by Congress to levy an extra tax on foreign banks.  They express their concern over this threatened discrimination.    A November 1991 law gives the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed)  the option of auditing foreign banks and charging costs  associated with these audits on to the financial institutions in  question. U.S. banks are exempt from any charge resulting from  Fed audits.    The law is the U.S. answer to the BCCI [Bank of Credit and  Commerce International] scandal. There are an increasing number  of votes in Congress that favor the implementation of this law.  To date, the Fed has resisted pressure from Congress. A final  decision will be made in April.    But the Twelve do not want to wait for this. The charge are  additional to the costs which the banks have to pay in their  home country for prudential auditing. This extra charge also  affects only foreign banks and not U.S. banks. This is why the  EU believes it to be discriminatory. It argues that the bill is  an infringement of the principle of equal treatment and the  "national treatment" which foreign banks have enjoyed so far in  the United States.    The new initiative also goes against the principle of a  "standstill," which was agreed upon by the OECD, and is  certainly not going to help the future multilateral negotiations  on the liberalizing of financial services. No full agreement  was reached on this in the framework of the Uruguay Round. The  participating countries can still modify or withdraw their  commitments on access to their financial markets.  <H5>  French Memorandum </H5>   French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery yesterday issued a  memorandum to his colleagues on the resumption of multilateral  negotiations on the liberalization of financial services. He  asks the EC to clarify the EU position. Paris wants to know  whether the EU would more or less abandon the principle of  reciprocity in the treatment of foreign banks, while the United  States would respect it. Paris is not prepared to accept such a  one-sided situation.</p>

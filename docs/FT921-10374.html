			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / EC acts on Dutch building cartel THE European Commission has begun legal proceedings against the Dutch government, which the EC believes condoned an illegal cartel operated by the country's industry federation involving up to 7,000 builders, writes Andrew Hill from Brussels. According to the Commission, the cartel has dominated the Dutch construction industry for the last 12 years, and accounts for about 40 per cent of the sector's turnover. Brussels yesterday imposed fines of Ecu22.5m (Pounds 16.04m) on the 28 construction associations which are members of the federation, the SPO. The Commission has been investigating the cartel for more than three years. The SPO had offered to amend its methods - which involved deciding in advance the terms and candidates for contract tenders - but could not go far enough to satisfy Brussels. The Commission said it had imposed only a token fine on the SPO partly because of the federation's 'relatively co-operative attitude'. All three Baltic states will reach trade and co-operation agreements with the EC this month, as a first step to formal association with the Community. Terms will be similar to those negotiated with central European states, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Following the initialling of trade and co-operation accords with Lithuania and Latvia on February 1 and 4, the Commission said yesterday a similar arrangement would be reached with Estonia on February 24.</p>

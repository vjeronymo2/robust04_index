			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Motoring: Hatchbacks rule Britain's roads Britain's most popular type of car is a five-door hatchback - and that is official. The information comes from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which also says that Britain's total car population grew to 23,402,347 at the end of last year - a 1.7 per cent increase on 1992 - while the total number of heavy lorries fell by 1.8 per cent to 536,459. The society could have fooled me. An increase in the car population I can believe, if only because getting out of my drive and on to the main road takes longer, and is more hazardous, every year. But fewer lorries? There seem more of them around than ever. They block two of three motorway lanes as they creep slowly past each other on hills, where commonsense dictates that overtaking should be forbidden, and they make their elephantine presence felt in country lanes and local high streets where they look like goods trains that have left the rails and taken to the tarmac. The society's statistics reveal that while 31.4 per cent of Britain's cars are five-door hatchbacks, three-door models (28.4 per cent) are not far behind. Almost 60 per cent of cars now have tailgates and, if you include another 1.6m estates, it really does make the boot lid look a threatened species. Which car started the trend to tailgates? Some say it was the 1959 Austin A40, with its agreeably sharp-edged body styled by Farina of Italy. But the first ones I drove had fixed back windows; as I recall, semi-estate A40s with hinged tailgates came a year or two later. By that time, the gawky but endearing Renault 4 had appeared, with a tailgate big enough for sofas or metal milk churns - although purists might, I suppose, argue that this was more of a van with seats and windows than a hatchback. The Renault 16 - was any car ever more comfortable to ride in? - arguably started the proper hatchback line because it combined all the features you expected of a saloon with a versatility close to an estate car. Also making its bow in the early 1960s was the Simca 1100, smaller than the R16 but cast in a similar mould. Where have they all gone? The simple answer is that rust-proofing was less of a priority then than it is now. While the mechanicals remained healthy, the bodies rotted. It was not until the 1970s that the hatchback became the conventional body style for small to medium cars and a booted saloon the exception, although large-car buyers still generally opted for a boot. Saab (the first 9000s) was an exception but Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar have never made a big hatchback. The large Renault 25 and its successor, the Safrane, are hatchbacks as is the Citroen XM, although this has a cunning double back window. One goes up with the tailgate; another - easily removable when required - stays in place. Ford must have wished it had something like it when it introduced the present Granada (itself on the point of being replaced). Instead of continuing to offer four-door saloons and five-door estates, it said Granada buyers could have any kind of body they liked so long as it was a hatchback. (Old Henry Ford - 'Any colour you like so long as it is black' - would have approved.) The Granada's styling was an unhappy compromise around the rear end. More to the point, Ford lost business from fleet managers who had formerly bought Granada saloons to ferry senior people. When the chauffeur lifted the new model's tailgate to stow the luggage, the back seat passengers objected to being exposed to winter's icy blasts. In the end, Ford did what it should have done in the first place - produced a Granada saloon and, eventually, an estate car. Even the largest companies live and learn. The French may disagree, but body styling has polarised. As the society's figures reveal, cars for the masses are mainly hatchbacks. Senior people choose saloons as company cars. And for carrying capacity, there is still nothing like an estate.</p>

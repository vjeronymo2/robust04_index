			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / US baby food group agrees to Dollars 3.7bn bid from Sandoz Gerber Products, by far the biggest maker of baby food in the US, announced yesterday that it had agreed to a Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) cash bid from Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group. The price offered - equivalent to Dollars 53 per Gerber share, more than 50 per cent above the level at which the stock closed on Friday - surprised Wall Street analysts and appeared to be pitched at a level intended to ward off other bidders. It also brought excitement to the US food manufacturing sector, recently depressed over the sales outlook for higher-priced branded goods. Shares of other food companies such as Hershey Foods, CPC International and Quaker Oats rose sharply. Gerber's shares closed Dollars 15 1/2 up at Dollars 50 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Sandoz's bid comes only three weeks after its Basle-based neighbour, Roche, offered a similarly stylish Dollars 5.3bn in cash for Syntex, a US pharmaceuticals group. Both Swiss groups have strong net cash positions. Gerber's sales have been flat in recent years, reflecting a decline in US birth rates. Mr Alfred Piergallini, Gerber's chairman and chief executive, said the board had agreed to the merger because the company's best source of future sales growth lay overseas. For Gerber to exploit the international prospects alone would require heavy investment over many years, Mr Piergallini said, but joining with Sandoz would provide Gerber with ready-made distribution channels in most big international markets. Sandoz already has a large nutrition business, built around Ovaltine and Isostar drinks, various health foods and clinical nutrition products and a small baby food line. However, only 14 per cent of the nutrition division's SFr1.7bn (Pounds 801m) sales last year were in North America, whereas nearly 90 per cent of Michigan-based Gerber's Dollars 1.2bn sales were in its home continent. Mr Marc Moret, chairman of Sandoz, said Gerber's excellent image and exceptional market strength in North America 'give us a strong base in child nutrition on which we will expand internationally'. Gerber is understood to have been actively seeking a suitor for several months. Nestle, the Swiss foods group, had earlier been a strongly tipped bidder.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kinkel: Following the Recent </F> Decisions, My Position as Chairman Is Strengthened"]    [Text] Bonn, 6 May -- Following the coalition statement of  the leading bodies of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] and his  differences with North Rhine-Westphalian land chairman Juergen  Moellemann, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with  this newspaper on 6 May: "The FDP has fallen in step again."  Following the "basic decisions" made in recent weeks, his  position as chairman had strengthened, he said. This would also  manifest itself in the Federal Convention and the presidential  election in Berlin on 23 May. The FDP wanted leadership and  would get it. Kinkel called the FDP Presidium and Federal  Executive Board recommendation to the party congress, which will  be held in Rostock early in June, to continue the Bonn coalition  with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] following the Bundestag elections in October, a  "caesura." He said the North Rhine-Westphalian land party  congress in Dortmund two weeks ago had also been a decisive  event. At that congress, land chairman Moellemann was reelected  with a relatively weak result, whereas Kinkel was feted  ostentatiously.    Kinkel said he was pleased with the economic recovery and  the  change of mood resulting from it. "I am happy to see that after  a difficult starting period, things are improving for me, too; I  feel that the party accepts me."  <H5>  Support for Hamm-Bruecher </H5>   Kinkel vehemently contradicted statements that he and group  chairman Hermann Otto Solms intended to bring their influence to  bear on the FDP group in the Federal Convention to vote for  CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog on the first ballot. He called  such claims "nonsense." After each ballot of the Federal  Convention, the FDP would carefully consider the course of  events and draw its conclusions: "We will see what the  situation is in the course of the process, and have a right to  know what our partners have." Kinkel said he would hold many  preparatory talks and would then submit his proposal in Berlin.  He said the FDP supported its candidate, Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher, but he did not say whether this also held true  for the third ballot, in which a relative majority is sufficient  for the election of the federal president. Kinkel said Mrs.  Hamm-Bruecher said in the Presidium on 1 May that she would "do  what the party wants." Kinkel added that "quiet is required  now." Therefore, he rejected any speculation. In Berlin, he  would "say clearly what the direction should be -- without,  however, overrunning the FDP." As he did with his coalition  statement, he would also "make the final decision" following  exploratory talks. He said he had invited the FDP land chairmen  for 21 May. Kinkel indicated, however, that he would not leave  the decision to a meeting of the land chairmen with Moellemann.  "There is no imperative mandate, but the party leadership  accepts that -- based on the preparatory talks -- I submit my  proposal to the party group of the Federal Convention."    Kinkel said he would bring up the FDP's wish that the  protection of minorities should be anchored in the constitution  as a separate article "in coalition talks," even though the  CDU/CSU has so far rejected it. In addition, the FDP would  discuss in coalition talks the "overall context" of dual  citizenship and a law on the limitation of immigration.  However, the FDP would not bring in the Bundesrat draft, which  was rejected last week, as its own motion without the consent of  its coalition partner, as some presidium members had demanded on  2 May. "We cannot force anything." Kinkel said: "We will not  announce anything that cannot be implemented." He said the FDP  did not make the continuation of the coalition "conditional on  certain terms and does not build hurdles that may be  insurmountable." Therefore, the FDP did not insist that its  demands be accepted in the coalition prior to the Bundestag  elections. However, the FDP would point out problems in the  election campaign "whose solution the CDU/CSU has prevented."  Kinkel said the FDP would fight to resume its goals in the new  coalition: "we have the right to become a bit more critical,  without endangering the coalition." The Rostock party congress  should "not be a party congress of internal security," said  Kinkel. The FDP did not dodge the issues of internal security.  "However, I do not like it at all that the impression is being  created that crime could be combated by laws." According to  Kinkel, the Federal Government is only responsible for the  Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and border protection,  whereas the laender are responsible for combating crime.  Therefore, one should address minister-presidents like Rudolf  Scharping and Erwin Teufel and stop the "impudent hide-and-seek  game" in which the buck is passed to Bonn.  <H5>  "Decision in the End Stretch" </H5>   Kinkel said: "I am now increasingly enjoying the combination  of the offices of foreign minister and party chairman; I am  looking forward to the election campaign." He said that as a  long-distance runner, he had learned that "a race is not decided  in a curve or in the middle of the stretch, but in the end  stretch." Kinkel claimed that his "stayer qualities and his  optimism" were apparently successful.    At its closed meeting, the FDP Presidium adopted "14  arguments for a strong FDP" to give the direction for the  election campaign. The main points are the following: Austerity  and consolidation course to reduce the state quota to the level  prior to reunification by the end of this decade; privatization  and deregulation; more flexible work hours and flexibility in  connection with company pay settlements and more favorable  conditions for people setting up new medium-sized businesses.  There will be no inheritance and property tax increases, as the  SPD is planning to introduce, nor will there be higher burdens  for "higher income groups" in the form of a surcharge. The FDP  seeks to lower all income tax rates and to abolish the trade  tax. The FDP intends to counteract "slogans demanding special  surcharges for high income earners." The FDP describes itself  as the "party of the service sector, property, and technical  innovation." "We are suffocating from our social system." With  the introduction of a "citizens money system"  [Buergergeldsystem], a certain simplification is to be brought  about.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgaria to close dozens of unprofitable copper, zinc and lead mines Bulgaria is to close dozens of unprofitable copper, zinc and lead mines over the next few years, sharply reducing output of the metals, reports Reuter from Sofia. 'The zinc, lead and copper mines, or parts of them, will be closed by stages within three years,' said Mr Politimi Paunova, a senior industry ministry official. The industry ministry said that in recent years annual production of copper concentrate in Bulgaria had averaged 150,000 tonnes, lead concentrate 80,000 tonnes and zinc concentrate 70,000 tonnes. However figures were much lower last year. The closures are likely to result in output of copper falling to 50,000 tonnes a year, lead to 30,000 tonnes and zinc to 25,000 tonnes, a mining industry official said.</p>

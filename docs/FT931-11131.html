			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Ofgas to force delivery switch OFGAS, the gas industry regulator, is taking legal steps to force British Gas to transfer a Pounds 1.5bn gas supply contract to National Power's station at Little Barford, Bedfordshire, instead of the Didcot site for which it was earmarked. National Power has put plans for two 680MW stations at Didcot, Oxfordshire, on hold while uncertainty surrounds the market for gas-fired power because of the government's energy review, National Grid said yesterday. National Grid, which is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies, also said that Southern Electric had shelved plans for a 351MW power station at Fawley. National Power asked British Gas last May to transfer its 500m-therm, 15-year gas contract from Didcot to Little Barford where construction of a 680MW station began last year and which should be operational in 1995. However, since British Gas's supply contracts all specify a delivery site, the company said it would need legal advice about changing the destination of the gas. Ofgas gave the go-ahead to change the site later last year, but British Gas still demurred because of the political sensitivity surrounding gas-fired power generation. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the company was reluctant to make any changes in its gas contracts at present. 'In the middle of the debate about the future of the coal industry, any precipitate action would be tantamount to contempt of parliament,' he said. After a formal complaint from National Power in December, Ofgas has started legal proceedings against British Gas. The regulator should be in a position to serve an enforcement order on the company by March. 'We've given them every opportunity to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion but now we'll have to force them,' said Ofgas.</p>

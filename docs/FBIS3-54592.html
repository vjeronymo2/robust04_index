Chavan, has  reiterated that Rajiv Ganhi-Longowal accord [on Punjab] still  holds good and will be implemented after total peace and  normalcy returns to Punjab. Talking to newspersons after laying  the foundation stone of a building complex at Chandigarh today,  Mr. Chavan said Pakistan has launched an aggressive  disinformation campaign about the alleged human rights  violations in India. He pointed out that Pakistan itself is  responsible for creating disturbing conditions by abetting  terrorism in Punjab and some other parts of the country. Mr.  Chavan stressed the need to counter this campaign by evolving a  suitable strategy. Replying to a question about the future of  Chandigarh, the home minister said that the prime minister is  the competent authority to decide this.    Replying to a question on Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Chavan said  the government is willing to have a dialogue with the militants  there on the condition that they first give up violence. But  the talks should be within the framework of the Indian  Constitution, he added.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dutch finance group posts 10.9% rise Strong performances in banking and life insurance helped Internationale Nederlanden Group, the Dutch financial services group, to lift 1993 net profit by 10.9 per cent to Fl 2.03bn (Dollars 1.07bn). Pre-tax profits showed an even sharper rise of 18 per cent to Fl 2.82bn. But a 39 per cent increase in ING's tax bill - reflecting increased earnings in Japan and the US and the absence of the previous year's tax windfalls in Canada and Australia - accounted for the slower rate of increase in net profit. ING is to raise its dividend to Fl 3.50 from Fl 3.19 in 1992. ING also announced it was launching a Fl 1bn bond issue. Mr Aad Jacobs, chairman, said Fl 700m of the proceeds would be used to strengthen the shareholders' equity of its banking subsidiary, ING Bank, and fuel its growth. The bank has expanded rapidly in eastern Europe and Asia Pacific. The rest of the proceeds would be held in reserve. Banking results showed a strong improvement virtually across the board last year, with pre-tax profits up 27.3 per cent at Fl 1.34bn. ING cited the favourable development of interest rates and its continued successes in emerging markets.</p>

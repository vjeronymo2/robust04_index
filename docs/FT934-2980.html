			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: US-Mexican media deal falls through The proposed joint venture between Tele-Communications, the US cable operator, and Televisa, the Mexican media group, has fallen through. Under the joint venture TCI would have bought 49 per cent of Televisa's cable subsidiary, worth an estimated Dollars 200m-Dollars 400m. The two companies planned to combine to provide cable television and other services throughout Latin America. The collapse comes ahead of next week's Dollars 1bn secondary equity offering by Televisa, which will take the media group into the New York Stock Exchange. Televisa will sell 10 per cent of its equity. TCI said the joint venture needed to be re-evaluated in view of the company's proposed merger with Bell Atlantic. Bell Atlantic, which plans to buy 100 per cent of TCI, recently agreed to take a 42 per cent stake in Iusacell, Mexico's second-largest cellular phone company, for Dollars 1.04bn. One large Televisa shareholder said Bell Atlantic's stake in Iusacell complicated the transaction. Mr Emilio Azcarraga, chairman of Televisa, said: 'We concluded that it was in everyone's best interests to terminate the proposed arrangements in view of both parties' long-term objectives.' He said Televisa will continue to seek strategic alliances to expand businesses throughout the world.</p>

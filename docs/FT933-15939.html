			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Import threat to brewers CONTINUING worries over the outlook for the domestic beer market left UK brewing shares trailing yesterday, with Whitbread coming under scrutiny from one broker and a series of downgrades accompanying figures from Scottish &amp; New-castle. NatWest Securities reiterated its negative stance on the domestic brewers and its sell advice on Whitbread after warning that imported Continental beers and lagers are likely to pose an increasing threat to company profits. In particular, NatWest notes that Tesco has recently begun importing cheaper Stella Artois lager from Belgium, usurping supplies brewed under licence by Whitbread in the UK. This has added to concern that the broker has about Whitbread, which has a high rating having been earmarked in some quarters as a key recovery stock. But the broker stresses: 'The longer term effect will go far beyond premium Continental lagers and affect the whole pricing structure for lager in the off-trade. This in turn will further undermine the profitability of UK domestic brewers.' Figures from S &amp; N were duller than the market had expected, with analysts' forecasts being cut to a range of around Pounds 200m to Pounds 230m. While the lesiure division performed well enough, flat domestic brewing numbers and fairly ordinary retail figures produced slightly disappointing profits. S &amp; N fell badly but recovered to close only 2 adrift at 459p. Whitbread 'A' declined 10 to 489p on good volume of 3.7m. Bass lost 10 to 472p, Grand Metropolitan 5 to 421p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 6 to 496p.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCALED-DOWN PROJECT PROPOSED FOR AIRPORT;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: SANTA MONICA MAYOR SAYS THE CITY NEEDS THE REVENUE. HE SUGGESTS A  PLAN THAT INCLUDES LESS OFFICE SPACE AND 20 ACRES SET ASIDE FOR A PARK.  </P> <P> Having lost his fight to save a commercial office project proposed for Santa  Monica Municipal Airport, Mayor Dennis Zane is scrambling to win public support  for a smaller project, saying the city needs the revenue the project would  generate.  </P> <P> In the face of a voter initiative to overturn the project and opposition from  Los Angeles officials and residents, the City Council, at Zane's request,  rescinded its approval of the larger 822,000-square-foot development. Zane is  now proposing a 580,000-square-foot project with 20 acres set aside for a park.  </P> <P> Zane estimates that the smaller project would generate more than $200 million  over the 75-year life of the development agreement.  </P> <P> He said he would like to see his new proposal placed on the November municipal  ballot.  </P> <P> "The community interest is best served by a ballot measure," said Zane. "The  burden of compromise is to find a place where people who disagreed with me  agree with me. I am willing to set aside my initial judgment and find a common  judgment."  </P> <P> Zane said he believes that the strong opposition to the 822,000-square-foot  office project resulted in part from the council's failure to adequately  communicate the need for the revenue it would produce.  </P> <P> "I have spent eight, nine years on the council," said Zane, who was elected to  a third term in 1988. "Through that time I have been committed . . . to quality  education, a quality park system, providing an environment in which our  children can grow up healthy, and in public safety.  </P> <P> "The airport project would allow us to address some of those needs. . . . The  benefits are significantly superior to the burdens on the other side."  </P> <P> Because a referendum drive collected nearly 8,000 valid signatures, the council  was obligated to rescind its Oct. 10 approval of the project or place the  matter before the public; on Tuesday, the council rescinded its approval by a  6-1 vote. Only Councilman William Jenning voted against the repeal, saying he  believes that the matter should have been placed on the ballot. The city staff  was also directed to contact community leaders both supportive and opposed to  the project to develop a process in which a new proposal could be presented and  discussed. A recommendation is expected in 30 days.  </P> <P> Zane said placing the larger project on the ballot with so much opposition  would have been like playing a game of chicken, in which two cars race at each  other, each taking the chance that the other will move out of the way first.  </P> <P> "The appropriate thing is not to play chicken, but to find a negotiated  compromise," he said.  </P> <P> Some of Zane's council colleagues praised his decision.  </P> <P> "We need to recognize the need to have any project grow out of the will of the  people . . . and articulated by the people," said Councilman David Finkel, who  in October voted against the larger project.  </P> <P> "The lesson I hope we all learned is that the people want a say on whatever is  done with the land," said Councilman Ken Genser, another earlier opponent of  the larger project. "I don't think it was a matter that (the residents) didn't  understand (the need for revenue), it was that they didn't like what was being  proposed."  </P> <P> Councilman Herb Katz was the third councilman who voted against the project.  Council members Judy Abdo, Christine Reed and Jennings joined Zane in voting  for it.  </P> <P> Former Mayor Jim Conn, who supported the project while in office through 1988  and then formed a citizens group to support it, said he is disappointed that  Zane gave up the fight.  </P> <P> "I really regret that it has come to this," Conn said. "The proposal that we  made originally is the best thing for the future of the city. I don't think  there is any evidence that (the project) would have lost (in a referendum  election). What we have is 10% of the people who said they wanted it to go to  the ballot."  </P> <P> However, he added, "I will support whatever the council feels is appropriate.  There has to be a viable revenue flow from that property. Of course, it makes  perfect political sense to find consensus rather than go to the mat."  </P> <P> The development began as a 1.3-million-square-foot office project in 1987, when  the City Council selected Reliance Development Group to develop 37.5 acres of  unused airport land on the city's eastern border. But opposition from residents  in Santa Monica and nearby Mar Vista over potential traffic and pollution  problems persuaded city staff to recommend early last year that the project be  reduced to 1 million square feet.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission recommended that the project be further reduced to  between 600,000 and 750,000 square feet. In October, the City Council narrowly  approved the 822,000-square-foot project.  </P> <P> Within a month, a citizens committee had collected nearly 8,000 valid  signatures, and a homeowner and a pilots group had filed suit challenging the  city's authority to approve development of the public land without voter  approval.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, a Mar Vista resident filed suit challenging the project's  environmental impact report. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley supported the suit  and denounced the project as environmentally insensitive. Los Angeles City  Council members Marvin Braude and Ruth Galanter, whose districts abut Santa  Monica, had already come out against the project.  </P> <P> Although the project would be built entirely within Santa Monica, the only  access to it would be from Bundy Drive in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Los Angeles traffic engineers are currently studying the traffic impact of the  new smaller proposal.  </P> <P> Although some opponents of the rejected project have said privately that they  would support the smaller proposal because of the recreational facilities,  others are waiting to see specific plans and financial projections before  committing to it.  </P> <P> "It does not make sense to approve a project whose revenues would be used  wholly to support a new park," said Councilwoman Abdo. "If there is agreement  among the various people that results in a project that brings in enough  revenues for the city, I would be supportive."  </P> <P> Greg Thomas, the Mar Vista resident who filed suit against Santa Monica, said  he is still concerned that the project could be enlarged.  </P> <P> "I'm a doubting Thomas, so to speak, as to whether this is the project the will  eventually be presented to the people of Santa Monica," he said. "Whatever is  presented, we want to make sure that the concerns of Los Angeles are  addressed."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Henry Lambert, president of Reliance, said his company has been  unfairly caught in the middle.  </P> <P> "We were asked by the city to build a development, and we were awarded a  development of 1.3 million square feet," he said in an interview. "Then, after  spending $3 million, the process is telling us now that we will be lucky to get  600,000 square feet. Obviously that is not what we bargained for.  </P> <P> "It's an absurd process to get this far down the road and have it fall apart.  This was a well-thought-out project. Both we and the city have spent a lot of  time and money to negotiate a complicated agreement. To have a metamorphosis at  this point is absurd. In a just world, the city would be legally, or at least  morally, bound to the project."  </P> <P> But he says he will continue negotiations to build something at the site.  </P> <P> "We would like to have as large a project as possible," Lambert said. "But we  will do what we can to save the project."  </P></p>

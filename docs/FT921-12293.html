			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: An unsuitable savings vehicle foisted on public Sir, Let us not mince our words. I refer to your article, 'Tied agents 'are overselling life policies'' and leading article, 'Life policies oversold'. The big fraud (I am not mincing my words) is that they are sold at all. Endowment policies have been demonstrably the most unsuitable of all savings vehicles ever since life assurance premium relief (LAPR) was abolished in March 1984. Nevertheless the life insurance industry has continued to foist them on the public with the aid of questionable sales techniques, and by diverting an outrageously high proportion of savers' cash to its salesmens' commissions. From the early days of the Financial Services Act the life insurance lobby has fought and schemed to defend its practices, which can plainly be described as designed to 'rip off' the public. The only surprising feature about the rift that has now developed in the Unit Trust Association is that it did not happen earlier. The link that exists between the concept of savings and the concept of insuring one's life should have been severed many years ago. At long last there have been signs recently that those in high places, including Sir David Walker, the chairman of Securities and Investments Board, have come to realise this and are beginning to question the selling of such policies. Even Fimbra has begun to realise that its role in protecting the investor will be better discharged if it checks the selling of these dubious policies rather than its members' petty cash. It cannot be stressed too heavily that life insurance policies of the savings kind, such as endowments, and most of their closely related cousins such as regular premium personal pension plans, are a most unwise choice for almost anybody, not just the 30-odd per cent who find they have to cancel them within two years.

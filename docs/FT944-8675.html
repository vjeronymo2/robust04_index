			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tempers flare at Butte's AGM Tempers flared and insults were traded yesterday as shareholders sat through a prolonged annual general meeting of Butte Mining, whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits. The insults were not directed at the board, however, which is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from former managers and promoters. Shareholders' wrath was directed at the representative of a fellow investor who pressed a series of questions over the lawsuit, directors' remuneration from the litigation and Butte's accounting practices. Butte has been forced to amend its accounts by the Financial Reporting Review Panel. After more than an hour of detailed questioning, one shareholder stalked out, directing a clearly enunciated 'prat' at the persistent questioner. It became clear that most of the questions originated from shareholders being sued in the lawsuit, or from those close to defendants. They pointed out that Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, stood to gain up to Pounds 10m from the lawsuit. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said he had been awarded the litigation remuneration at a board meeting. Shareholders were welcome to examine the minutes to ensure it had been properly awarded. The chairman said the two-year-old lawsuit had taken substantial turns for the better in the past year. However, dissenting shareholders pointed out that the judge had not yet ruled on whether the case could even be heard in the US. Meanwhile, Butte's flotation is still the focus of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. All the resolutions were passed. However, one shareholder objected to granting share options to non-executive directors. Mr Lloyd-Jacob said that, given the company's inability to provide the usual incentives to directors, he did not see there was a problem with the option scheme.</p>

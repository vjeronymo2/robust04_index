			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Layla Shahid, the Palestinian </F> representative in France, by correspondent Franz-Olivier  Giesbert; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Layla Shahid, good morning.    [Shahid] Good morning.    [Giesbert] I guess you are quite thrilled this morning,  aren't you?    [Shahid] Certainly.    [Giesbert] Are you thrilled by history in the making?    [Shahid] In any case, it is a historic day. A page which is  being turned. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Do you feel like thanking Shimon Peres this  morning on Europe 1?    [Shahid] Yes, yes, yes. In any case, I would like to pay  homage to him because I believe that, of all the men who  negotiated, he is the one who had -- who has -- a vision of  Israel in time of peace, Israel after the Cold War, and I hope  that it is this particular vision that will prevail, because up  against it, there is another military vision of Israel that  still exists within the government. We shall see which one will  prevail.    [Giesbert] And what do you make of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime  minister?    [Shahid] I believe that Yitzhak Rabin was brave when he  followed Peres' plan to integrate Israel into the Middle East.    [Giesbert] He said what had to be said, didn't he?    [Shahid] Yes, he said what had to be said. I hope he will  have the courage to continue because this agreement is now faced  with the text that has to be implemented. We must not forget  that there are many difficulties remaining. There are 120,000  settlers still there, and Mr. Rabin still insists that they  should be kept in the territories even though they are risking  their own safety. I believe that there many other tests ahead  for Mr. Rabin, and I hope he will continue on the way he has  started. It is the only way for his people to survive; that is,  in peace with their neighbors.    [Giesbert] You were talking about dangers, Layla Shahid. But  who do you actually fear most? Tell us now, without any jargon.  Are you more afraid of the hysterical Israeli settlers or the  frantic fundamentalists, the religious fanatics of Hamas?    [Shahid] I am afraid of both for different reasons. I am  afraid of Palestinian fundamentalists because they support a  kind of society I do not support. However, they have everything  to gain from peace, namely normal, healthy and free life, and I  believe that they will accept the rules of the game, but I am  even more afraid of the settlers because they have everything to  lose, namely the territory where they live and their special  status, and I believe that they will use all possible means to  sabotage this peace, but, unfortunately, this is a problem and a  duty for the Israeli Government, not for ours.    [Giesbert] A Palestinian transitional government will now  manage what we call the Palestinian entity until the general  elections. How will those Palestinians chosen for the  transition be appointed? Will there be people from the Hamas  Movement, for instance?    [Shahid] They will be appointed in a balanced way between  inside and outside the occupied territories to start with.    [Giesbert] Do you mean that there will be people from the  Hamas Movement?    [Shahid] It is possible, if they agree to be responsible for  the administration of this territory, yes, why not. They  represent a political strength in Palestinian society. It would  be stupid politically to try to marginalize them. We have seen  what this led to in a country like Algeria. However, the most  important ...    [Giesbert, interrupting] But they will not work towards  peace, will they?    [Shahid] That is not obvious. I believe that, in any case,  all political forces must be given a chance in a democratic  fashion, whether they belong to the right or the left. However,  the most important thing is the way the blending between the  inside and the outside will take place. This transitional  government will probably be balanced with 50 percent PLO leaders  and 50 percent local leaders, and I believe the most important  thing is the preparation of the elections, which will take place  in the autumn since we have missed the date scheduled for July.  People will decide through their votes who they want as their  representatives. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Layla Shahid, thank you, good luck, have a nice  day.    [Shahid] Thank you.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Future of Elf chief in the balance THE FUTURE of Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, appeared in jeopardy yesterday following confirmation from official sources that the French government was considering removing him as head of the state-owned oil group. According to the source, an announcement is expected before the end of the summer and could come within weeks. Elf, France's largest industrial group, is slated for privatisation by early next year. Mr Le Floch-Prigent was appointed by the Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in 1989, and in 1981 he was an adviser to Mr Pierre Dreyfus, then industry minister in the Socialist government. He has been regarded as vulnerable since the centre-right coalition led by Mr Edouard Balladur took office in March. The government can replace the heads of state-owned companies prior to privatisation. Elf was last week named as one of four companies on the privatisation short-list, and the sale of the government's 51 per cent stake is expected by early next year. Analysts said a move to replace Mr Le Floch-Prigent would demonstrate the state's continued role in public sector companies, but would not necessarily involve a shift in strategy for Elf since senior management was firmly in place. Mr Le Floch-Prigent has been responsible for a substantial expansion and restructuring of Elf-Aquitaine. He has reduced the group's concentration on the French market and expanded its downstream activities. This was achieved through a series of acquisitions, including the UK assets of Amoco of the US in 1990, the UK assets of Occidental of the US in the following year, and the service station network of Heron of the UK. The Elf chairman has also expanded the group's pharmaceuticals and chemicals divisions. In 1991, Elf-Sanofi, which is 51 per cent owned by Elf, formed a joint venture with Sterling Drug of the US. Last year's acquisition of Yves Saint Laurent consolidated Elf-Sanofi's position as one of the world's three biggest perfume and cosmetics companies. But the group is being affected by difficult market conditions. Mr Le Floch-Prigent has warned that operating profits in the first half will be about 25 per cent less than in the first six months of 1992. Last week, he said that he did not anticipate any substantial improvement in basic chemicals and fertilisers in the second half and that the recent fall in the oil price was an added difficulty.</p>

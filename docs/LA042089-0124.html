			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Police and casino security agents were on alert because of warnings that  terrorists might be plotting a bomb attack in New Jersey's seaside gaming  resort to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya. Atlantic  City casinos said they had been taking extra precautions in light of the  warning, but casinos said they had been told by the FBI not to discuss details.  The warning involved a bomb threat against the resort's casino industry in  general, not a specific gaming house, said Gary Selesner, marketing vice  president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. "We understand that the bomb threat  ends tonight," he said late Wednesday.  </P></p>

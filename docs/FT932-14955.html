			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Referendum battle starts to hot up PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia changed gear sharply yesterday in his lackadaisical campaign to win backing for his presidency in a referendum on April 25. He told a meeting of supporters he would not obey the rules for the referendum set by his rivals in the Russian parliament, and he ordered a drastic cut in the privileges and duties of his rebellious vice president General Alexander Rutskoi. He also named Mr Oleg Lobov - a trusted associate who is close to industrial enterprise managers - as first deputy premier to oversee the economy, in a move designed to reassure the important industrial lobby. Mr Lobov outranks deputy premier Boris Fyodorov, who is in charge of economic reform. At the same time, Mr Yeltstin is working on a decree which would give massive privileges to Russia's autonomous republics in exchange for their support in the campaign. The decree would convert the Russian federation into a confederation, with each of the 21 separate republics acceding to a new union treaty in a distinctly different way. The referendum rules set by parliament lay down that any proposition needs to be approved by more than 50 per cent of the total electorate - an all but impossible margin. But Mr Yeltsin said he would issue a decree on April 20 to bring these rules into line with the referendum law, which lays down that only a majority of those voting is required. He said he had yesterday met Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, to remind him that the court was due to issue a judgment on the constitutionality of the referendum rules by April 20. Mr Zorkin, whose pronouncements have become increasingly anti-presidential, forecast on Wednesday night that Mr Yeltsin's determination to press ahead with the introduction of a new constitution would bring civil war between rightist and leftist forces. This came even though Mr Zorkin helped prepare the draft constitution Mr Yeltsin wishes to introduce. The president's move against Gen Rutskoi means the vice president's armour-plated Mercedes has been replaced with a Volga, the middle managers' workhorse; his bodyguards have been cut to two; and he is relieved of responsibility for agricultural reforms - an area where, like so many of his predecessors, he made little mark. Gen Rutskoi, whose support was crucial to Mr Yeltsin on his accession to power two years ago and who was chosen because of his military (air force) background and influence among reformist communists, is now close to being Mr Yeltsin's main contender for the presidency. He is a powerful and emotional speaker, has a record of physical courage in action and is the head of a relatively large party, the Free Russia party - part of the Civic Union bloc. Mr Yeltsin, still supported by the dwindling number of radical democrats in the political class, appears to have plumped for the heads of republics within Russia as the biggest source of his support. They have called on voters to turn out on April 25 - though they refused to explicitly endorse Mr Yeltsin - and they have agreed the referendum may go ahead in all of their territories.</p>

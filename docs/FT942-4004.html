			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A gory tale retold - A look at a new version of 'Thyestes' Attack me with whips and snakes. The zodiac's falling. My hair's standing on end with horror. The stars have all run away. No, these melodramatic flights come not from some Elizabethan, Jacobean or Romantic melodrama, but from the Roman playwright Seneca. And they come from him by way of, of all people, Caryl Churchill, whose translation of his Thyestes has just arrived at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs after its debut last week in Manchester. Seneca's plays are an odd mix: overblown rhetoric, lurid descriptions of gore, and - so surprising - some remarkably acute psychological strokes. The average Senecan speech builds one massive blockbuster effect on another, piling Pelion on Ossa, and so it is astonishing when one character suddenly says 'I know not what, but it is something'. Yes, it sounds like Lear. And the gore recalls Titus Andronicus. To Seneca, however, it probably closer to home - he had lived through the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. Thyestes re-tells the most appalling crime in all Greek mythology. Atreus (papa to Agamemnon) kills the children of his brother Thyestes and, in a banquet, has him (unwitting) feed on their flesh and drink their blood. The killing and eating occur offstage, the blood-drinking onstage. Why has Churchill turned to this gruesome tale? Partly, I guess, because it continues the macabre studies she entered in Lives of the Great Poisoners. Partly because Seneca had such an influence on English drama. And partly because Seneca probably did not write for the stage and because (again, I'm guessing) Churchill is interested in subjects that elude conventional drama. It would help, mind you, if she did more in the play's early stages to show who is who. Which brother are we hearing talking about the other brother? It takes too long to discover. But Churchill's translation skilfully points up all the play's influence on Elizabethan drama, while investing it with some welcome modernity of utterance. Listening to her text has its rewards for the student of Seneca, of Churchill, and Eng. lit. Most of it, however, is dull for the theatregoer. It might be more gripping if James Macdonald had directed the play with more variety of inflection. The style of acting is low-key. The intention may be to put a layer of ice over the fire in these people's guts, but the effect is mere tepidity. Accents come from all over the British Isles. (Thyestes and Atreus - Ewan Stewart and Kevin McMonagle  - both sound Glaswegian.) Videos show images of events offstage; we don't see Thyestes scoffing his kids but we do see him in post-prandial plenitude. The tone is flat, avoiding suspense. The result only underlines how poor Seneca was at sustaining psychological or dramatic interest on a moment-by-moment basis. It is amazing how he kept all the feeblest features of Greek drama while ditching or muddling all the best. Worst, I think, are the numerous crummy fortune-cookie utterances. 'No luck lasts. Pain and delight take it in turns.' And - my nomination for naffest sentiment - 'You'd have to be really greedy for life if you didn't want to die when the whole world's dying with you.' Which may be true to think, but, in mid-drama, is mighty silly to say. Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs</p>

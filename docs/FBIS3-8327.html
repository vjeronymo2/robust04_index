			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F> Young Democrats, by Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "We  Are Facing the Citizens With A Good Conscience"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Orban] I am convinced that  only a calm force that acts rationally and is capable of  cooperating with the two other political camps, a political  force really standing at the center of the political arena, can  face the current tasks. In the difficult years to come, only  such a force will be able to guarantee a compromise between the  various interests and, subsequently, social peace. Unless a  liberal center government leads the country after 1994, I really  fear that neither of the forces at the right or at the left of  the political arena will recoil from making use of all the  available means to topple the other's government. And this will  hurt the entire country.    I find it particularly dangerous that, in the case of such a  political polarization, the basis of the bourgeois center could  also slowly disintegrate, because a bourgeois middle class needs  peace. If this center force disappears and if everyone has to  belong to some camp in order to assert his interests, then we  can give up our hopes of a bourgeois Hungary.    [Pinter] In your opinion, does the concept of bourgeois  center originate from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]  exclusively?    [Orban] The process that led to the signing of an agreement  between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  and later between the other two liberal parties started at our  pressure. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Do you exclude the existence of liberal political  parties that want to cooperation between liberals and leftists  in principle?    [Orban] Of course, there are leftist liberal forces, and no  one should be ashamed of this, because the social-liberal trend  is present in many areas in the world. However, for such a  policy in Hungary today, we lack one of the the major  conditions, namely a genuine and strong social democratic party  with which the liberals could easily agree. As for us, in our  policy, we would like to assert the idea that the liberal  thought always failed on two issues that are still timely today;  one of them is the national issue, to which the liberals have  failed to give an efficient answer since the beginning of this  century and have left this issue to the right-wing and often  extremist forces. We know well what tragedies came in the wake  of all this. Certain circles of the current government  coalition followed this tradition when they called us a force  "insensitive to vital national questions" and tried to make  people believe that liberalism was an article of mass  consumption brought from abroad. The Fidesz has faced this  challenge in the past three years. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Could the elections in Hungary lead to results in  the wake of which you revised your position about the  undesirable aspect of a social liberal coalition? Gabor Fodor  left the Fidesz and, as "second" on the national list of the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], he said that a government  coalition based on the liberal force and the center would be the  most balanced one, and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and  a conservative party, perhaps the Christian Democratic People's  Party might also have a place in such a coalition. Is it  possible to form a real political agreement?    [Orban] I consider Gabor Fodor to be a full SZDSZ  politician. Our personal relations cannot affect the cooperation  between liberals. However, with a more clever policy, we could  have postponed this issue until after the elections. This  change of parties will hurt the SZDSZ, at least to the same  extent it hurt the Fidesz. I fear that there will be no winner  in this competition, and all of us will only lose. The  "Fodor-affair" can always be heated up and used to question the  cooperation between liberal parties; those who aim at this will  do this. As for a social liberal coalition, I do not think that  a situation could emerge in the wake of which I would change my  opinion. I cannot know in advance whether a situation might  emerge in which Hungary's interests require a cooperation  between liberals and the socialists. In any case, I would be  very glad if Hungary did not get into such a situation. My goal  is to see Hungary led by a strong liberal center after May 1994.  However, elections could lead to special situations. The  Fidesz represents a principled position and, in a given case,  surmounting party policy considerations, we could negotiate with  every democratic party on cooperation. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Can you see the possibilities of cooperation with  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] more clearly now that it  again has a chairman?    [Orban] No. But I can generally see much more clearly now  compared to the time before [former Prime Minister] Jozsef  Antall separated the radical right wing from his party. I find  the prime minister's statement reassuring when he says that the  chances of cooperation between the MDF and the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party are the same as that between the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] and the MSZP. I trust that the  consolidation of the conservative forces will continue and this  has to manifest itself, among other things, precisely in  consistent distancing from the radical forces. This is desirable  for all civic middle classes that are interested in politics.  [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Do you feel that you have prepared to comply with  all aspects of the responsibility of governing?    [Orban] The level of preparations can always be improved a  little. However, it is a fact that, since 1992, large  committees have been working on making the Fidesz suitable for  government work. With this in mind, we expanded the Fidesz's  expert basis, we formed our relations with other parties,  employers, and -- with less success -- employee organizations in  accordance with this, and we worked in foreign politics in the  interest of this.    We are ready, taking the possibilities into consideration,  to  prepare Hungary for an earliest possible European Union and NATO  membership. In spite of the economic policy failures, the  country is enjoying some kind of stability; we are ready to  preserve this, to launch an economic program that favors  enterprises and establishes the conditions for growth, and to  implement a grand educational reform. We have prepared as far  as our abilities allow us and we will face the electors with a  clear conscience: Here we are, the choice is yours. [passage  omitted]</p>

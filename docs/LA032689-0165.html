			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> WILANDER UPSET BY ARGENTINA'S MANCINI IN FOUR SETS  </P> <P> Mats Wilander, the world's No. 2-ranked player who has started slowly this  year, was upset Saturday by Argentina's Alberto Mancini in the third round of  the International Players Championships.  </P> <P> Mancini, seeded 31st in the two-week tournament, defeated the defending  champion, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Mancini's strong cross-court backhand is among  the best he has seen, Wilander said.  </P> <P> "I knew he was really good, but I didn't think he could keep it up for that  long," said Wilander, who won three Grand Slam events in 1988 but is off to a  3-3 start this year.  </P> <P> "I thought he played really well. It seemed he was doing all the right things."  </P> <P> Wilander lost his No. 1 ranking to Ivan Lendl after being beaten by Ramesh  Krishnan of India in the second round of the Australian Open. He entered the  International Players Championships with a 1-2 record after countryman Mikael  Pernfors defeated him in a first-round match of the WCT Championships at  Dallas.  </P> <P> Wilander said his biggest problem has been a lack of playing time in  tournaments but he was encouraged after beating David Pate and Scott Warner  last week in the tournament.  </P> <P> But when Mancini, 19, broke him for a 2-1 lead in the third set, Wilander began  to sense the match slipping away.  </P> <P> Mancini, ranked 41st, said: "I felt stronger and felt like if I could win the  second set, he would have a hard time beating me.  </P> <P> Yannick Noah, seeded 12th, avoided an upset by overcoming a two-set deficit to  defeat Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union, 5-7, 6-7, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.  </P> <P> In another five-setter, Carl Uwe-Steeb outlasted Jim Courier, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5,  4-6, 6-4. Steeb defeated third-seeded Andre Agassi in the first round.  </P> <P> Earlier, Gabriela Sabatini won her third consecutive match in straight sets,  dominating Belinda Cordwell of New Zealand, 6-2, 6-1, to reach the fourth round  of the women's draw of the $2.1-million event.  </P> <P> The top-seeded Sabatini, 18, has bounced back from a third-round loss in the  Virginia Slims of Florida tournament with impressive victories over Elly  Hakami, Catherine Suire and Cordwell.  </P> <P> She hasn't lost a game in three of the six sets and defeated Cordwell in 70  minutes to set up a fourth-round match against Anne Grossman.  </P> <P> Helena Sukova and Lori McNeil, seeded third and 10th, also advanced during the  day session at the International Tennis Center. Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Manuela  Maleeva of Bulgaria and No. 12 Arantxa Sanchez of Spain lost in straight sets.  </P> <P> In men's play, fifth-seeded Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland beat Mark Kratzmann of  Australia, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4; No. 14 Mikael Pernfors defeated Mexico's Leonardo  Lavalle 1-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-4, and Jim Grabb upset 16th-seeded Darren Cahill of  Australia, 6-4, 0-6, 7-6, 6-1.  </P> <P> Sukova, of Czechoslovakia, defeated Barbara Paulus of Austria, 6-1, 6-2, and  McNeil downed Tine Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.  </P> <P> Maleeva was hampered by two sore ankles and lost to Isabelle Demongeot of  France, 6-3, 6-2. She hurt her left ankle in a tournament at Indian Wells three  weeks ago and injured her right ankle here in a second-round victory over Gigi  Fernandez.  </P> <P> Gretchen Magers upset Sanchez, 7-5, 6-3, and Grossman advanced to her match  against Sabatini with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Halle Cioffi.  </P></p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Speculation ignored IN SPITE of recent speculation in several national newspapers about the possibility of further base rate cuts, the sterling money markets continue to take the view that another cut is unlikely to be engineered by the Bank of England before the summer is over. It was not just that rates in nearly all markets were unchanged yesterday. A far more striking indication of the market's negative mood was that trading for the September sterling contract was much more active than the one for June. Dealers say this indicates a particularly downbeat view on rate cuts: there are still six weeks to go before the June contract expires, and the fact that futures traders are now focusing on September suggests that they expect little change in rates for a while. Analysts say the market's view on the prospects for base rate movements has been mostly accurate in the last 18 months. The money markets have accurately predicted six out of the eight cuts that have been engineered by the Bank of England in that time. Only in two cases have they guessed wrong: when they scotched all thought of a half-point cut last September and when they thought that there would be a cut before the April general election. So those who are confident about a rate cut should take note that rates in the interbank market changed little yesterday. Three-month money, a key indicator of future rate movements, was unchanged at 10 1/8 per cent. No less important was the fact that the yield curve was flat at 10 1/8 from one week right out to five months. Only after six months does the cost of money ease by  1/16 of a percentage point. Futures trading in sterling was slow, with the June and September contracts moving in narrow ranges. September sterling ended at 90.30, suggesting that base rates in five months' time will be at 9.70 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the morning of Pounds 1.05bn. The Bank bought Pounds 303m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 400m for resale to the market on June 1 at 9 15/16 per cent. After the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.1bn, the Bank purchased Pounds 30m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.2bn. After providing late assistance, the Bank's total help for the day was Pounds 923m.</p>

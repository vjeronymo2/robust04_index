			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Visa cuts fraud losses by 24% Visa, the international card payments system, said yesterday that fraudulent payments had fallen by 24 per cent in the first quarter of this year, reflecting greatly improved detection procedures. The fall occurred in Visa's Europe, Middle East and Africa division where sales volume for the first quarter of this year was Dollars 44.6bn, (Pounds 28.2bn) an increase of 11.7 per cent from the first quarter of last year. Visa defines fraud as the use of lost and stolen cards or cards not received by the owner, fraudulent applications, counterfeit cards and fraudulent use of account numbers. It said that, while the number of attempts to acquire merchandise fraudulently through the use of its cards had not declined, its use of technology and 'human intervention programmes' had greatly improved detection. Among these is a risk-identification service which identifies suspect merchants and informs member banks for subsequent action. A code has been embedded in each card's magnetic strip, which is checked when it is passed through a point-of-sale terminal. This has helped reduce counterfeiting or alteration of the magnetic strip and helped reduce losses through counterfeiting to Dollars 17.5m. Visa has improved its database so that high-risk areas can be identified and fraud detection resources allocated to them.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Afghan mujahideen agree to form ruling council A BREAKTHROUGH in United Nations-brokered talks among Afghan mujahideen leaders came last night with an agreement in Pakistan to form a 50-member council which would go to Kabul in the next few days to take power. The council will rule for two months before turning over power to a supreme council. This body would prepare a further council of tribal leaders to choose a transitional government to lead up to elections a year later. The premiership is being held for Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islami party. Mr Hekmatyar has offered only conditional support for the agreement, demanding that the 50-member council stage be eliminated. He is still in Afghanistan and has not ratified the plan. Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, commander of the moderate, northern-based Jamiat-e-Islami (Party of Islam), is to be defence minister. The 50-member council will be led by Mr Sibghatullah Mojadidi, a former professor, who leads the small, moderate Afghan National Liberation Front. It is to be made up of 30 field commanders, 10 Islamic clerics and 10 members selected by the political parties. The supreme council is to be headed by Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, Jamiat-e-Islami leader. It remained unclear in Kabul whether the accord would end the 13-year-old civil war. Although Najibullah is no longer president, rivalry between mujahideen groups has threatened a continuation of the conflict. Three Afghan generals pledged that the armed forces would support a government to be formed by the guerrillas. The deal came shortly after the arrival in Pakistan of Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, who said the UN would seek peace in Afghanistan. 'I will consult leaders of this country (Pakistan) and ask their assistance, so that we will be able to continue our role of conciliation among the different groups in Afghanistan.' Several thousand guerrillas from rival mujahideen groups slipped into Kabul yesterday in what seemed to be a move towards taking control of the city. The government has said it is prepared to hand power to a united mujahideen government. Mr Raz Mohammad Pakteen, interior minister, confirmed in an interview that 2,000-3,000 armed mujahideen had entered Kabul. Other reports suggested the figure could be as high as 20,000. Most are from groups who support Mr Masood. The eastern city of Jalalabad - the last outside the capital to remain in government control - yesterday fell to a coalition of guerrilla groups.

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: Another price cut at M &amp; S - The Bottom Line Knocking 12 1/2 p off Marks and Spencer's share price on the day it announced a 16 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 851m, extending its lead as the UK's most profitable retailer, must rank as one of the stock market's more churlish reactions. Sir Richard Greenbury, Marks' pugnacious chairman, found it difficult to conceal his irritation - perhaps understandably. By any standards, the company's performance in the year to March was impressive. Group turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.54bn, with operating profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 873.4m. In the UK, sales grew 9.5 per cent to Pounds 5.48bn, and operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds 810m. Leaving aside the perennial trouble spot of Canada, the overseas businesses all increased sales and profits, except continental Europe where profits fell slightly. In the UK, M &amp; S has achieved such results by offering outstanding value for money. Cost savings through improvements in efficiency and information technology were passed on to customers in lower prices, but without damaging the operating margin - which at 14 per cent is a figure other clothing and food retailers only dream about. The increased volumes that resulted meant Marks and Spencer could put more business through its suppliers' factories, and so get even better deals out of them. Sir Richard says M &amp; S has also improved the 'desirability and fashionability' of its products - something attested to in recent features in the fashion and national press. There is, moreover, ample scope for growth. M &amp; S announced on Tuesday it would spend Pounds 1bn on expansion over three years. While it is already represented in most UK locations where it wants to be, M &amp; S says many existing town-centre stores are too small to carry the full range, and it will extend them where possible. In financial services, where profits rose 40 per cent, M &amp; S has announced a move into the pensions market. Even more exciting in the long-term are opportunities overseas. In continental Europe, where turnover reached Pounds 243m last year, the focus will be France and Spain. The recession there has not helped the bottom line, but makes it a good time to be investing in property. Sir Richard says he expected developing the continental European business to be his main task as chairman. But the outstanding success of Marks' ventures in east Asia, especially Hong Kong, has forced him to take a closer interest in that region. The company is being wooed by the Chinese government and by Japanese manufacturers. Both offer huge possibilities: China a market of 1bn people; Japan a clothing market four times the value of the UK's. The Japanese, says Sir Richard, are quality-conscious but are looking for retailers who can supply at a lower price than the designer labels that dominate the market. The company's experience in the US and Canada shows that not everything it touches turns to gold, at least not immediately. Brooks Bros in the US is improving, but still makes a smaller return on sales than the rest of the group. But there is a feeling among retail analysts that when it goes into China and Japan, M &amp; S will get it right. So why did the shares fall? One reason is that profits were slightly smaller than forecast, due to an unexpected Pounds 16m increase in pension costs. Another is a warning that cost inflation could re-emerge this year, although the company said, perhaps justifiably, that it was better placed to absorb this than its competitors. An underlying reason for the fall was investors switching from M &amp; S into Burton, which they believe offers bigger short-term growth opportunities if its recovery programme starts to bear fruit. That, however, is a big if. M &amp; S, on the other hand, has lifted earnings per share 62 per cent and dividends 64 per cent in five years. For a more exciting, and possibly bumpy, ride, jump into Burton, or even Storehouse. For a more sedate, but perhaps ultimately more rewarding, journey, stay aboard Marks and Spencer.</p>

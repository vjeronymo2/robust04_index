			<p>BFN     [Text] For the third successive day, servicemen of the  Defense Ministry of Tajikistan and representatives of the  Russian Army in Tajikistan and of the Internal Affairs Ministry  are manning checkpoints in Dushanbe. Their joint action stems  from the fact that in recent days the sociopolitical situation  in Dushanbe has deteriorated slightly. Several military  servicemen have fallen victim to bullets fired by criminal  elements. This is why joint security groups are observing the  sociopolitical situation in the city at the orders of the  republican leadership and also observing the agreement of the  military leaders of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan.    According to the press office of the Internal Affairs  Ministry, criminal incidents have decreased compared to several  days ago as a result of joint efforts by the joint security  bodies.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Hawthorne 2, Beverly Hills 1 -- The Cougars, winless in their first eight Bay  League outings, completed a two-game sweep of first-place Beverly Hills with a  victory at Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Tarrick Brock's bases-loaded single with no outs in the seventh inning drove in  Moises Barba with the winning run. Hawthorne, which beat Beverly Hills, 5-4, on  Tuesday, improved to 10-14 overall and 2-8 in league play.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills (15-4, 7-3) had tied the score with one out in the top the  seventh. Third baseman Barba fielded a grounder but threw the ball into right  field, allowing Bryan Urda to score from first.  </P> <P> The batter reached third, but was stranded after right-hander Angel Fierro got  two straight ground-ball outs. Fierro, who gave up five hits, pitched the  second consecutive complete game for Hawthorne. Ted Golden threw a two-hitter  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills right-hander D.J. Sutton had held Hawthorne to one run going into  the seventh, but was pulled after hitting Barba with a pitch and walking Robert  Lujan to open the inning.  </P> <P> Dennis Stone followed with a bunt that reliever Steve Belkin fielded and threw  wide to third, pulling the third baseman off the bag and allowing Barba to  slide in safely. Brock then hit his game-winner into right field.  </P> <P> Hawthorne opened a 1-0 lead in the second on a sacrifice fly by Lujan.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes 8, Inglewood 6 -- Jason Goldberg went three for three and drove in  four runs to help the Sea Kings end a three-game losing streak with a Bay  League victory at Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> "We had to win sometime," said Coach Gil Eberhard, whose team improved to 12-9  overall and 6-4 in league play. "The law of probability catches up with you."  </P> <P> Goldberg's two-run single in the third inning broke a 5-5 tie. Palos Verdes  opened a 5-0 lead in the second, but Inglewood came back with five runs in the  third with the help of two Sea King errors.  </P> <P> Junior left-hander Pat O'Hara weathered the bad inning, going the distance to  even his league record at 1-1.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes scored five runs in the second on three extra-base hits. Chris  Heyn had a two-run triple, Goldberg a two-run double and Blake Anderson an RBI  double.  </P> <P> Torrance 4, Leuzinger 1 -- Mike Kendall, who suffered his first loss Tuesday in  relief, came back to pitch a five-hitter with nine strikeouts to help the host  Tartars pull into a first-place tie in the Bay League.  </P> <P> Kendall (8-1), a senior right-hander, gave up no earned runs.  </P> <P> Eric Gonzales went two for two with two RBIs, and Anton Williamson and Kris  Radcliffe each doubled and scored a run, as Torrance improved to 16-5 overall  and pulled into a three-way tie with Beverly Hills and Rolling Hills in the  league at 7-3.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills 8, Santa Monica 3 -- Steve Archibald's two-run double capped a  four-run fifth inning and put the Titans ahead to stay, 5-3, in a Bay League  game at Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Right-hander Kirt Kishita (5-1 in league play) went six innings, giving up six  hits. Rolling Hills is 10-9 overall and 7-3 in league, good for a share of  first place. ROB FERNAS  </P></p>

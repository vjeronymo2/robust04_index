This was the first time in three years the heavy industrial  sector had exceeded its plan five per cent in its total turnover  and seven per cent in its output value. The 1993 output value  was 23 per cent higher than in 1992.    Worthy of note was the production of 1,300 machine tools, up  by 52,6 per cent in comparison with 1992 241,000 tonnes of  rolled steel, up by 23 per cent 21,700 electric motors, up by 57  per cent nearly 700,000 tonnes of fertilizers, up by 32 per cent  360,000 tonnes of apatite ore, up by 24 per cent, and 2,800  electric transformers, up by 114 per cent. These products sold  well in domestic markets.    According to economists, heavy industrial establishments  have  been able to survive while the country was switching to a market  oriented economy because they knew how to combine the  manufacture of their special products with consumer goods such  as electric fans, detergents, paint, household electric cables,  bicycle parts, batteries, and so on.    In some major mechanical engineering plants, their  specialized products accounted for one-third of their output  value, whereas consumer goods made up the remainder.    In addition, the industrial products met the requirement of  buyers in the sectors of agricultural production, and food, farm  product and sea product processing.    The heavy industry sector expects a growth rate for 1994 of  10 per cent compared with 1993.    The ministry of heavy industry has outlined a programme to  combine the development of heavy industry with agriculture to  turn out products suitable to the country's climate, conditions  and farming techniques.    To implement this programme, by the end 1993, the heavy  industry sector put the Lao Cai Apatite Sorting Plant, with a  designed capacity of 760,000 tonnes per year, on its first test  run, and more investment in improving and expanding several  establishments for rolled steel production.</p>

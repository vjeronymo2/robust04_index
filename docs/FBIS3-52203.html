But other analysts, who look deeper into issues, believe  that  despite such an agreement still no clear outlook can be seen in  the U.S.-North Korean relations and no end can be seen to the  crisis in the Korean peninsula. Those analysts believe that the  strain in ties between America and North Korea does not end with  the issues of the inspection of the North Korean nuclear  installations and ending of the U.S.-South Korean military  maneuvers. The problem is that America, within the framework of  the theory of the new world order, does not want any country but  those which support U.S. interests to have access to nuclear  arms. At the same time, North Korea believes that this American  strategy is against its security and national interests.    A more worrying point is that there are still a number of  the  so-called minor differences that could expand into bigger  differences in the two countries' relations at any moment.    Pyongyang is concerned that after the inspection of the  North  Korean nuclear installations, Washington will continue its  hostile policies to bring North Korea in line with U.S.  policies, as it has done in the case of many other countries.  For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency has  repeatedly inspected Iranian nuclear installations and has  assessed its inspections as positive and believes that Iran is  using nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. Yet at the  same time, America has repeatedly accused Iran of using it for  military purposes.    Pessimism over the agreements reached between Washington and  Pyongyang became more evident when North Korean President Kim  Il-sung yesterday announced that even though such agreements can  solve the existing differences on North Korean nuclear plans to  a certain extent, any kind of pressure or intimidation by  America can end in disaster. Such a warning is a reply to  developments that may take place during the agreement or  afterward. This comes at a time when Sam Nunn, the chairman of  the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, announced during a  recent television interview that if North Korea insists on  keeping its nuclear weapons America will put North Korea in such  political and military isolation that after a time all its  economy and regime will collapse. Such an announcement, even as  a mere threat, shows how the existence of a socialist country  with an anti-American nature cannot be easily tolerated by  Washington.    In any case, the insistence of the two sides on keeping  their  positions has so far prevented the achievement of a final  solution to the existing differences, and as long as America  does not respond positively to requests made by North Korea, it  seems unlikely that an agreement can be easily reached,  particularly as during the nine months of crisis in the  relations between America and North Korea relations, Pyongyang  has shown the necessary flexibility.</p>

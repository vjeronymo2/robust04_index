			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (2): A changing economic base - Manufacturing employment is concentrated in a small number of large companies SAFEWAY has a new supermarket on one of the western approaches to Coventry city centre. Nearby, a bridge with the name Alvis painted on it, spans the road. It is a natural historic juxtaposition, symbolic of changes in the city's economy, writes Paul Cheeseright. Alvis, the fighting vehicle manufacturer, owned the land where Safeway now operates, but it has slimmed down and moved out of the city centre: where once there was industry, there are services, a switch which is the single most important characteristic of the Coventry economy since the recession of the early 1980s. Retrospectively, it is clear that manufacturing peaked in 1966, but the critical years were between 1974 and 1982. 'During that period, Coventry lost 46 per cent of its manufacturing jobs - 53,000. A major shift took place in the local economy,' says Mr Michael Healey, principal lecturer in geography at Coventry Polytechnic and the author of numerous studies on Coventry's economic development. His research showed that nearly two thirds of the manufacturing job losses were caused by recession and changes in the industrial structure  - 'Coventry suffered from the weakness of the national economy,' Mr Healey noted. Yet, despite the relative decline of manufacturing, the economic significance of industry remains huge, and the 1990s recession may also lead to permanent losses of capacity. Indeed, there are local fears - and Coventry is not unique in this respect - that the scale of the cutbacks, the reduced level of training, and financial difficulties in coping with any expansion in demand will mean that companies may not be able to respond quickly to an upturn in orders. Certainly skill shortages are expected to recur. This may be unduly pessimistic if only because the manufacturing base is held together now, as it was 20 years ago, by a relatively small number of companies. The 100 largest employers account for around 60 per cent of total employment in the city and within that 100, the top 15 account for around 45 per cent. These are not the sort of companies that necessarily have trouble with the bank manager. The three largest private sector employers are Jaguar, GPT and Peugeot Talbot, but the largest employer of all is Coventry City Council. Employment is highly concentrated, and in manufacturing is spread over a narrow range of sectors, primarily metal goods and engineering, with a particular emphasis on vehicle manufacture: the historic industrial base remains intact. WITH more than half of its jobs in manufacturing now in the control of companies headquartered outside the region, and frequently abroad, the Coventry economy has, however, been prey to global economic movement. There has not until recently been the leavening and diversity provided by local small companies. Nor indeed has there been the stability which comes from such diversity. But the shockwaves of the 1980s recession, the easy credit of the mid-1980s and a changing appreciation insouth-east England of Coventry's role in the national economy has set off change. Reli ance on a small range of manufacturers and a narrow range of products is diminishing. On the basis of information gleaned from VAT registrations, Coventry had, during the 1980s, an exceptionally high rate of business formation. There was a growth rate of 41 per cent. This was not only the highest of any district in the West Midlands but 12 percentage points greater than the national average. Surveys suggest both that the vast majority of the new businesses have been of local origin and in the services sector. The services sector has been expanded by inward investment. At a time when the south-east England economy was growing quickly, Coventry was seen as close enough to be convenient, and cheap enough to be attractive. Indeed, reports Mr Harvey Williams, regional spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, current office rents in and around Coventry for new or recently refurbished property are between Pounds 12 and Pounds 14 a square foot, compared with Pounds 17-18 in Birmingham and Pounds 40 in the south-east. Yet, Coventry's significance as an office centre should not be overstated - 'a large proportion of service functions have been back-office functions. 'I don't think we would see ourselves as in the position of Birmingham, saying we want to be some kind of financial services centre,' says Mr Trevor Cornfoot, the City Council's head of economic development. Coventry is instead becoming an office dormitory of the south-east. Many of the new jobs have gone to business parks on the periphery of the city, leaving the city council anxious to secure other forms of development in the centre, through, for example, the expansion of hotel, leisure and retail facilities. Yet, come what may, Coventry's future, like that of the West Midlands as a whole, is indissolubly linked to that of the engineering industry. The problem has been to secure the growth of companies which will at once diminish economic dependence on the traditional employers, widen the industrial base and provide the development opportunities for the technology of the next generation. The city council calculates that there are now 300 companies in Coventry engaged in high technology activities. One stimulus has been the University of Warwick Science Park, a centre of research and development for 54 companies of diverse origin - 'the science park has made a difference to the quality of companies entering the city,' notes Mr Cornfoot. In spite of all these changes, Coventry has not managed to compensate, at least in employment terms, for the de-industrialisation which took place during the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Although greater diversity carries the promise of greater stability, it is not clear, especially after taking into account the effects of the current recession, that the local economy has reached the stage where a new generation of growth is assured.</p>

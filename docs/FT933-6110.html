			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / IoD wants scope of labour law extended THE BANNING of all public-sector strikes that breach procedure agreements and the introduction of legally binding, compulsory arbitration for Britain's essential services are being demanded by the Institute of Directors. With the implementation yesterday of many of the provisions in the new Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, the IoD will use a meeting with ministers this week to step up its campaign for further changes in employment laws. Its demands are: The removal of all remaining legal immunities from liability in tort enjoyed by trade unions. This would deprive unions of protection from civil actions and resulting financial damages for involvement in industrial disputes. The abolition of the current licensing system for employment agencies which is seen as an unnecessary burden on business which inhibits the use of contract labour. The removal of the legal monopoly enjoyed by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service's conciliation activities in disputes brought to it by industrial tribunals. The IoD also wants to see whether Acas services could be market tested or made subject to competition by private-sector providers. In addition, it favours changes to employment protection law to enable further deregulation. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has so far shown no sign that he is ready to introduce further legislation in the labour market. But yesterday he did not rule out legislation when he spoke of 'the government's continuing commitment to legislate so as to create and maintain a fair balance between protecting the rights of employees, while avoiding excessive costs and administrative burdens on business'. The institute is to press the government on its attitude to the European Community's social action programme. It wants to know how ministers intend to protect British business interests if an EC draft directive on the introduction of European works councils for companies that operate across the Continent is considered under the social chapter protocol of the Maastricht treaty. The institute is concerned that British multinationals will be affected proportionately more by the directive than companies based in other member states.</p>

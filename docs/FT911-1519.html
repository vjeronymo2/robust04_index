			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stock Exchange enters TV drama THE STOCK Exchange is formally committed to wider share ownership but on occasions its actions seem to contradict its rhetoric. For example, last month it became embroiled in a row with Ceefax and Oracle, the two providers of television teletext services. More than 8m TV sets in the UK are geared to receive BBC's Ceefax and and ITV's Oracle service, both of which are free, and a considerable number are watched by small investors interested in the stock market. Hence there was widespread disappointment at the beginning of April when the quality of share price information on the two services deteriorated sharply. With no warning to the viewers who follow share price changes on Ceefax and Oracle, the frequency of price updates was cut. For some months, prices had been updated every half an hour, but suddenly they were back to being changed every hour and a half. The ideal form of share-price data reflects the ebb and flow of the market, allowing investors to make buy and sell decisions on the finest terms. A system whereby prices change every half hour falls short of this 'real-time' ideal, but at least comes close. By contrast, the investor who only sees prices at 9am, 10.30am and at midday misses out on much of the morning's market action. The two services received a flood of complaints after the change, which they passed to the Stock Exchange, together with complaints of their own. Ceefax and Oracle said that the Exchange was acting against the principle of wider share ownership. The Stock Exchange's response was that the move to half-hourly updates in January had been a temporary response to the Gulf War, during which markets were expected to be more volatile than usual. As a special concession to the millions of teletext users, the Exchange had decided to speed up the flow of information. Now that the war had ended, the Exchange had decided to revert to its old practice of updating prices every 90 minutes, it said. This argument did not carry much weight with the investors who had become used to the improved service. The Stock Exchange then put its foot in deeper when an incorrectly briefed press officer said that real-time information could be bought for just Pounds 65 a year. The officer omitted the fact that it costs Pounds 25,000 a year to obtain the flow of real-time data from the Exchange. The Pounds 65 is extra - it is the charge on each computer terminal by which the information is distributed. Screen-based real-time share information is available, but at considerably more than Pounds 65 a year. The Stock Exchange's own Market Eye service requires an up-front investment of between Pounds 870 and Pounds 1,680 for hardware, plus an annual subscription charge of Pounds 1,016. (Tel: 071-410-6888 for further details.) Pont Data charges between Pounds 200 a month for real-time information (less for a restricted service) (Tel: 071-256-6234), while BT Citiservice charges a subscription of Pounds 42 per quarter, plus a charge of 45p per minute (Tel: 0442 237000). In both cases, the investor would have to pay extra for the computer hardware, although a TV set can be updated for about Pounds 150. There are also at least four telephone-based services, which offer share price and other financial information. These are: British Telecom's Citycall (0898 121220); Financial Times's Cityline (0836 4300 01); TIC's Sharecall (0898 345 345); and Telephone Information Services' Teleshare (0898 500 500). Oracle and Ceefax's argument is that they are doing the Exchange a favour by disseminating share price information to small investors. Given the Exchange's commitment to wider share ownership, why did it downgrade the teletext service? A problem is that Oracle makes money out of its share price service by charging companies to have their prices quoted and selling advertising space while the BBC is forbidden from making money out of the service. The Exchange is perhaps frustrated that it cannot share the revenues generated by Oracle and it cannot cut a separate deal with Oracle as it is contractually bound to treat both teletext providers equally. The Exchange says that it has an obligation to those who pay for the privilege of dis-tributing real-time information. Ceefax and Oracle do pay the Exchange, but not as much as the Pont Data and Citiservice. The Exchange appears to be putting its own short-term commercial interests ahead of the principle of wider share ownership.</p>

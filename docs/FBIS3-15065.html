			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article: "Why the Hysteria in Washington?"] </F>   [Text] A certain marshal of France would say to his batman  in the morning from time to time: "Fetch my old kepi, I intend  to stamp on it today in a fit of anger." That is what comes to  mind when you look at the official hysteria that has unfolded in  the United States over the arrest of the Ames couple, who have  been charged with spying for Russia. They have been under  surveillance for over 10 months. The President was informed of  all the suspicions, which did not stop him visiting Moscow and  agreeing on a "mature partnership" with Russia. And now  suddenly the Ameses have been dragged into broad daylight, like  the old marshal's kepi, so that Washington has something to  stamp on in anger.    One can hardly say seriously that this entire tale of  espionage, which has caused a major cold spell in relations  between Moscow and Washington, was the reason for this cooling.  In actual fact, people in the U.S. capital are bound to realize  that Russia, even if the charges against the Ameses do accord  with reality, did not go beyond what is permissible. After all,  as far as one can judge from articles in the press, Ames  informed the Russian special services about U.S. agents  operating in Russia. To be honest, Russia's desire to find out  which of its citizens is working for a foreign state is quite  justified.    But what is the real reason then for the demarches, in which  all the administration's top leaders have been involved? To  tell the truth I do not think that people who link what is  happening with the ratification of this year's U.S. intelligence  budget are right. After all, the prestige of the CIA has not so  much been strengthened as weakened. And, what is more, given  the really serious uncertainty in the world it is hardly  necessary to use scandalous arrests of foreign agents to  persuade congressmen of the need to allocate money for the  special services' activity.    Those who link the hysteria in Washington with Russia's  unexpected and extremely successful Bosnian settlement  initiative are closer to the truth. The initiative as such is  not the issue, however. Since, if we are talking about the crux  of the matter, Moscow's initiative has indeed eased the  implementation of the Western approach to the settlement. It  has enabled the Serbs to "keep face" and NATO members to avoid  an utterly unprecedented operation that would be the prologue to  a long and bloody conflict. Russia has found a solution  acceptable to everyone. Moreover it risked its soldiers' lives  in doing so.    So what has driven Washington berserk? In my view, Moscow's  successful initiative in the Balkans confirmed once and for all  the fundamental changes in Russian foreign policy. Changes for  which U.S. strategic planning made no provision at all. After  all, over the last few years Washington has already gotten  accustomed to feeling that it is the only world leader, the only  superpower. This power could dare to ignore world public opinion  when missile and bombing raids were inflicted on Iraq. It can  even put up with the obvious fiasco of Somalia. And its world  lead does not seem to have been disputed at all. At least no  alternatives were given.    But this time the United States found itself on the  sidelines  of the settlement process owing to the actions taken by Russia,  which it had long since struck off the list of main participants  in international politics. But no, in everyone's eyes Russia  remained an important, perhaps the most important factor in  world politics. A passive inward-looking factor, so to speak.  Russia was primarily of interest to the rest of the world  because of the dangers that will arise if disturbances or civil  war break out in a country that not only has nuclear but also  other destructive potential. And so, in order not to "cause  trouble," the West, primarily the United States, was willing to  provide some financial and economic aid for Russian reforms and  mostly talk endlessly about the terms of this support. With the  same end in view -- in order not to elicit a pathological  reaction from the Russian public -- our country continued to be  ritually called a great power and invited to take part in  resolving various global problems, without being thought capable  of really accomplishing anything.    People say that fashion reflects people's ideas. Thus,  "Russian refugee" style is gaining a foothold in the world:  shapeless pants, a vest, and a shawl worn on top of a sweater  with the ends tied at the back. Like it or not, that is how we  are seen. Yet suddenly it emerges that Russia, which had  already been written off, is beginning not only to announce but  also to implement an active foreign policy course. It is not  enough that it is resolutely promoting reintegration within the  CIS and trying to carry out peacekeeping functions in nearby  foreign countries. The West could have somehow put up with that.  But a country in crisis is being successful in an area where  Western states have been impotently marking time for two years  now. It emerges that, despite its own crisis and the  occasionally obvious inconsistency in its policy, Russia still  has considerable prestige, and quite possibly not just in the  Balkans....    The question now is, as France's LE FIGARO wrote, how far  the  United States is prepared to agree to the expansion of Russian  influence. At the moment Washington is displaying its  irritation.    Someone has been very skillful and timely in bringing up the  Ameses. After all, the incident is extremely useful for those  circles that have no interest in a real partnership between the  West and Russia. And these circles exist in virtually all  countries. MAINICHI SHIMBUN has just reported that  U.S.-Japanese staff exercises are still being conducted, based  on the possibility of a Russian attack on Hokkaido. Now, when  the sides are reassessing their own role and the role of  partner, those people who feel uncomfortable in the present  situation may quite easily see their chance. They could quite  easily try to use the cold spell to once again dig up the "enemy  image" that we are long since sick of.    Yet one cannot say that their plans are totally groundless.  The train of events shows that the switch to new relations with  the West has by no means become irreversible. The old fears and  old ways rear their heads again at the slightest complication.  And menacing speeches can already be heard in the U.S.  Congress. A Russian diplomat has already been expelled like  during those memorable times. And this at a time when the U.S.  President has over the last few days clearly been backpedaling,  reluctant to jeopardize the whole set of Russian-U.S. relations.  However the conflict seems to have the potential to escalate on  its own.    A great deal now depends on Russia. It must retain calm  dignity. One can hardly talk seriously about its meeting the  absolutely unacceptable demand for the unilateral cessation of  intelligence activity in the United States. But it is also  important not to succumb to provocation today. We are by and  large being incited to make brusque statements. Firmness is  what is needed here. It is necessary to show the United States  and other Western states from the example of recent crises that  a partnership with Russia is indeed a vital necessity for  everyone. And that the rules of conduct within this partnership  are the same for everyone. That there are not junior partners  who must know their place and not interfere in the adults'  conversations and actions. Nor are there any older partners who  have the right to put children in their place or even just vent  their spleen on them.</p>

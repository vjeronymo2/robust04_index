			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: British mission heads for India A specially chartered Concorde will leave the UK for India on Sunday carrying Mr Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister, and 85 top industrialists, small businessmen and bankers on the UK's biggest ever trade mission. The week-long tour of Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay and Madras is the most ambitious step yet by the Department of Trade and Industry to boost British trade with India, which last year was worth more than Pounds 1bn in each direction. Mr Needham, who is leading the mission, said in London yesterday that opportunities for UK companies in India were unrivalled by any other market in the world: along with China, India is one of the world's two fastest growing developing economies. The mission marks a further British attempt to build on historic links and benefit from India's economic liberalisation programme. 'India is opening up to investment, joint ventures and increasingly to overseas trade,' Mr Needham said. Last year, bilateral trade was marginally positive in Britain's favour, but this year UK exports have been rising at a slower rate than its imports from India, suggesting there will be a small deficit for the year as a whole. Mr Needham said the UK was already playing a big role in India, but he hoped the mission would lead to more deals, especially in infrastructure projects such as telecommunications and power. The presence of bankers and insurance executives on the trip reflected the importance for India of private-sector 'build-own-operate' and 'build-operate-transfer' infrastructure projects, whose financing arrangements are normally complex. Mr Needham is particularly keen to encourage partnerships between UK and Indian companies, such as a 50:50 joint venture announced yesterday by Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, and RPG Enterprises, India's fourth largest business group. The two companies have formed RPG-RR Power Engineering to modernise and refurbish India's older power plants. The signing ceremony will be in Calcutta on Monday. Mr Sanjiv Goenka, vice chairman of RPG Enterprises, said that 'the power shortage in India can be mitigated to some extent by improving the operational efficiency of the old power plants. The majority of power plants here are more than 12 years old and many of them need to be renovated.'</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Moody's knock Lonrho Shares in Lonrho, the controversial international conglomerate, plunged below the 100p mark for the first time since late 1985, eventually closing a net 19 down at 95p, as the market took fright at the downgrade of its credit rating by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. The retreat by the share price took place during exceptionally heavy trading in which more than 23m shares changed hands. Tuesday sees the electoral reform referendum in South Africa and the market only now seems to have woken up to the fact that Lonrho derives in excess of 30 per cent of its profits from the republic. The stock was additionally unsettled by what was seen as a slightly lower than expected price Lonrho is expected tp receive for Scottish &amp; Universal Holdings which owns a number of weekly newspapers in Scotland. Moody's downgraded its rating for around Dollars 360m-worth of Lonrho's Eurobonds to below investment grade. Lonrho shares attracted heavy activity earlier this year. In January they plummeted from over 170p to 107p after a steep fall in profits and a cut in the dividend, only to recover to 130p by the end of last month when US investment funds FMR and Fidelity International revealed they had built a joint holding of 4 per cent in Lonrho. By last week their joint holding had been increased to 6.27 per cent or 41.2m shares. Lex struggles Lower profits and the loss of its exclusive importer agreement for Volvo Cars knocked 28 off Lex Service shares to 204p. The market was particularly concerned at the ending of the Volvo contract on March 30, despite compensation of around Pounds 100m. Volvo was a major source of income for Lex, even though profits last year fell to Pounds 500,000 from Pounds 9.1m as a result of the slump in UK car sales. The final dividend was 6p, compared with 9.4p, making a total of 10p against 15.3p. Analysts said attempts to diversify into other businesses have had mixed success, but Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman of Lex said the 'actions we have taken to reduce costs are already showing through in a significant improvement in profit compared with 1991.' RTZ rises A rethink by the market about RTZ's preliminary figures, announced on Thursday, and a growing recognition of the group's massive overseas earnings and assets, prompted another flurry of strong buying for the shares. They closed 16 higher at 571p, having touched 585p earlier in the session with turnover expanding rapidly to 5.5m. MTM falls further The gloom surrrounding MTM deepened as the shares took another dive, although they managed to recover some ground by the close. Stock exchange officials are said to have been interviewing MTM executives, past and present, in recent days, focusing on the collapse in the speciality chemicals group share price, and the seemingly contradictory statements included in the board's two recent profit warnings. An official inquiry is said to be imminent. Turnover was another busy 1.5m, the shares, down at around 50p at one stage, rallied to close a net 18 down at 70p. Specialist engineering cocnern TI Group bucked the downward trend in the market, rising 7 to 621p following Thursday's announcement that 1991 profits fell only 18 per cent to Pounds 105.2m in difficult trading conditions. With an unsettled domestic outlook, ICI and BOC Group - two companies with strong international bias - attracted investors' attention. ICI gained 7 to 1,255p. while BOC closed ahead 10 at 657p in good volume of 2.4m. Oil shares put on a relatively sound performance, but slipped away towards the close. There were a number of panicky enquiries to marketmakers in mid-morning when news wires flashed up the story of a suspension in Amsterdam - subsequently quickly rescinded by the Dutch authorities - of Royal Dutch shares. Shell Transport settled 4 firmer at 446p on keen turnover of 5m with specialists noting a further flurry of switching out of Royal Dutch and into Shell. There were also suggestions of sizeable switching by UK institutions out of BP and into British Gas after the latter's agreement with Ofgas to end its monopoly of the industrial and commercial gas supply market, and to run its gas pipeline division as a separate entity. Nevertheless, the big US funds continued to support BP shares, which closed a net 2 higher at 263p on heavy turnover of 13m. British Gas slipped a penny at 249p with turnover approaching 5m. Enterprise and Lasmo lost further ground, with Lasmoslipping 2 1/2 to 184p after determined selling from some of the leading UK brokerage houses. Enterprise, where Thursday's preliminary results confounded some of the direst stories about the dividend, fell 5 to 362p. The profits downgrade carried out in midweek by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's telecoms analyst, Adam Quinton, continued to depress BT shares; the 'old' dropped 9 1/2 to 318p and the partly-paid stock 8 to 105p. A strong early showing on Wall Street helped Glaxo Holdings, although later weakness in New York and London took off the initial shine. Volume was busy at 2.5m, the shares closing 2 up at 786p. Sentiment was also helped by news from Canada that Biochem Pharma, which has development and marketing agreements with Glaxo, had held successful pre-clinical trials for its 3TC anti-Aids drug on the Hepatitis B virus. Drinks groups suffered from nervousness about the political situation, while international spirits companies were also hard hit. Guinness lost 8 to 567p, as profit-taking continued to erode recent gains, and Grand Metropolitan slipped 12 to 893p. A publicity stunt was how British Airways described Virgin Atlantic's decision to institute formal proceedings in the US aimed at stopping what it alleges is a dirty tricks campaign. BA's shares fell 4 to 249p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew turned positive on the hotel and catering sector, in particular moving from a hold to a buy on Forte. The hotel group was also basking in the success of its warrants excercise, the shares rising 5 to 229p in good volume of 3.9m. Analyst Mr Paul Heath said: 'We think the hotel cycle has hit the bottom and is now due for a bounce. With Forte's figures out next month, we are also expecting a good dividend.' A buy recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite failed to prevent Kwik Save falling 10 to 553p, while J. Sainsbury gave up 9 to 380p and Tesco 9 to 243p following recent sell notes from brokers. Kingfisher lost another 5 to 484p and WH Smith 'A' 5 to 456p as fears continued that a price war in the do-it-yourself sector will damage group profits. Leading property shares held ground against the trend as buyers began to look at the sector after its recent poor run. Sentiment was helped by a buy note from Smith New Court on MEPC, the shares rising 3 to 330p. Great Portland gained from a big line of stock, up 4 at 151p, Land Securities added 4 to 419p.

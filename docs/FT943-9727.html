			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / US-N Korean nuclear talks make progress Talks between North Korea and the US on Pyongyang's nuclear programme appeared to move forward yesterday when Pyongyang said it was willing to transform its nuclear power industry, Reuter reports from Geneva. Mr Kang Sok-chu, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, said Pyongyang had offered to switch from its plutonium-producing graphite reactors to safer light-water reactors. was But North Korea was only willing to make the switch if it received 'proper and appropriate compensation', suggesting there would be a high price for ending the stand-off caused by North Korea's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities. Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state and chief American delegate at the talks, said North Korea's offers had come in response to US proposals considered by Pyongyang over the weekend. The suggestions were 'certainly worthy of study and consideration' before tomorrow's meeting. Resumption of the Geneva talks follows the death four weeks ago of Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader. The new session has been seen in the west as an important pointer to the stance taken by his son and successor, Mr Kim Jong-il. Mr Kang also said North Korea had proposed ways to tackle the problem of 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods removed from a reactor in May which would 'certainly ease the concerns of the international community'. The US and South Korea have expressed fears the North could reprocess the fuel rods and gain a potential supply of plutonium for making nuclear weapons. The US has been trying to persuade Pyongyang to open its nuclear power programme to full international inspection, accusing it of having diverted plutonium for nuclear weapons manufacture. Under a plan thought to be favoured by the US, any light-water reactors given to North Korea would probably be Russian, since the North Koreans already know Russian technology.</p>

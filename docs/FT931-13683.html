			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: The Hypochondriac - Theatre Few great artists have relied so much upon formula as Moliere. True, when he made a play like The Misanthrope, he created a protagonist and a dilemma that are still startling. But in many other plays he gave us age-old plots that circle around such archetypes as the miserly old pantaloon, the two young lovers whose love is thwarted by the older generation, the quack doctor, and so on. We seem to have known these characters all our lives, and yet Moliere's impishness is such that we hang both on the suspense of the old plot and on the fun of the detail that makes it new. Cambridge Theatre Company's new production of The Hypochondriac has Gerard Murphy both as translator and playing the title role. Here he is, self-mollycoddled in shawls and kerchiefs, savouring his doctors' bills (for 'a full, penetrative, colonic irrigation . . . a cathartic douche, to dispel Sir's wind'); I laugh all the more to recall that this time last year I was watching him as Oedipus, heroic, noble and shattered. As Argan, he looks like a fretful old pug. Occasionally he applies too much virtuosity of breathcontrol and vocal colour, but his nervous force is the production's lynchpin. His translation catches the lively banter of Moliere's prose. A pity that he translates 'bagatelles' as 'bullshit.' 'Foul' language blunts the fun of Argan's fascination with his own bowels. ('Have I excreted much bile?' he asks tenderly.) Murphy's version also, audaciously, includes the play's musical prologue, interludes and finale, and brings them off, if not with musical finesse, at least with comic panache Although the director, Nick Philippou, had to leave the production in the last week of rehearsals 'for personal reasons,' the company gives him full credit. As it stands, this Hypochondriac has plenty of energy, and its audience is kept laughing aloud from first to last. Some problems arise in having seven actors play all the roles in a play that already has characters appearing in disguise; and when Damon Shaw (a tall man) appears as Argan's little daughter Louison things tip over briefly into the wrong kind of buffoonery. As the maid Toinette, Kathy Burke is not your traditional pert chit, but a loud, broad Eastender with vowels that could bat for England. She never steps out of character, and she becomes the production's second cornerstone. Debra Gillett and James Dreyfus, as Argan's daughter Angelique and her lover Cleante, steer a suave path between sincere ardour and mischievous exaggeration. The way that he, when pretending to be her singing-master, hurls veiled hints of his vexation at her family comes close to Fawlty Towers extremism, but is irresistibly funny. Moggie Douglas's designs combine economy, stylishness and satire. On tour until March 6</p>

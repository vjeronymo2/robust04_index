			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The muted reaction of Eurotunnel's share price to this week's news that a full shuttle service for drivers and cars will be phased in from November is understandable. The tunnel has been dogged by colossal risks ever since the project was conceived. Now the worry is focused on the risk that the project will not be able to generate the returns necessary to cover its operating costs and to service a funding requirement calculated to be Pounds 10.1bn at its peak. As the maximum commitment Eurotunnel has teased out of its bankers is Pounds 10.5bn, there is only limited room for manoeuvre. On the basis of assumptions made in April, when the project was rescued with a rights issue, Eurotunnel hopes to make a small pre-tax profit in 2002 and a declare a dividend for the following year. But some of the assumptions on revenues and interest rates made then already look questionable. For example the delay in opening the shuttle service has meant that Eurotunnel missed the peak summer season; details of the resulting shortfall will be disclosed at the interim stage next month. Eurotunnel may soon breach its banking covenants, possibly requiring shareholders to stump up fresh equity for the fourth time since the project was launched. Completion of the tunnel is undoubtedly a historic achievement which may one day prove lucrative to its owners. But the debt burden is so great that this generation of shareholders is unlikely to enjoy a bonanza.</p>

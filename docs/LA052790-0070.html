			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE PREVAILS  </P> <P> Jack Adler's May 13 Consumer Report about refunds on unused portions of advance  payments for travel expenses was interesting but left for the last sentence  probably the most effective way of recovering one's funds.  </P> <P> My wife and I were on the third day of a prepaid vacation to Hawaii when I took  a bad fall in Hana and suffered a bad break of my left foot.  </P> <P> After examining the X-ray, the doctor at the Maui hospital recommended that I  return to the mainland for surgery. My wife canceled the rest of the prepaid  hotel accommodations and returned the prepaid rental car and we returned to  California for the treatment for my foot.  </P> <P> The travel company, through which our local agency had arranged our vacation,  refused to consider either a refund or to issue undated vouchers for the unused  part of our trip, although I addressed the president of the company by letter  directly. Feeling that I was not being treated fairly, I sued in small-claims  court and collected my requested refund plus court costs.  </P> <P> ROLAND A. BECK  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam and Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has agreed to temporarily  relax credit to bail out state enterprises and solve the problem  of "triangular debts".    Sources close to the State Council said the decision was  partly motivated by the political consideration of maintaining  social stability and preventing unemployment. They said Mr Zhu  was also anxious to improve his image with state entrepreneurs  and regional cadres, two power blocs that would have a say in  the post-Deng Xiaoping succession struggle.    The sources quoted the vice premier as indicating that  credit  policy for the "circulation funds" of industrial enterprises  could be relaxed in spite of the ongoing fight against  inflation. Mr Zhu said even enterprises losing money should be  extended credit "if the funds are being used for the production  of goods that can be sold" and if the firms can guarantee loan  repayment. "Banks should dispense loans to help maintain the  basic living expenses of employees in money-losing enterprises,"  Mr Zhu said.    However, he called upon local governments to cover some of  the expenses for paying the under-employed, saying the centre  and localities "must join hands in maintaining social stability".    Mr Zhu was adamant that funds would not be given to  enterprises that had no hope of being turned around and that  such units should be declared bankrupt. But he said bankruptcy  should only be tried on an experimental basis to avoid social  disruption.    He has also given instructions that credit be provided for  solving the problem of "triangular debts" or money enterprises  owe each other.    XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) reported last night  various ministries and banks would join hands to clear up debts  in sectors including coal, metallurgy, electricity,  petrochemicals, and lumber. Funds would also be made available  for the two hardest hit provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning.    Economic analysts said the relaxation of credit could fuel  inflation, which the semi-official China News Service described  as "still high." The agency said fixed assets investment by  state firms in April was 44.2 percent over the same month last  year, which was eight percent more than the comparable figure  for the first three months of the year.    Moreover, from January to April, losses incurred by  state-owned enterprises increased by 62.6 per cent over the same  period in 1993. The analysts said while pumping money into such  enterprises could solve the temporary problem of decreasing  unemployment, the measure might exacerbate the budget deficit  and fuel inflation without achieving the long-term goal of  improving efficiency.    Chinese sources said various local governments had resisted  Beijing's call that they dig into local budgets to relieve the  plight of the unemployed.</p>

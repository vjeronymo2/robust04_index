			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Mining Woes -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 June  in  a page-16 editorial notes South Africa's "need to wean itself  away from its mining roots," since old mines "cannot survive  soaring cost pressures without a gold price that is galloping  ever upward." The "unfortunate consequence" is that many jobs  are being lost, but now is the time to make the adjustment while  there are "(hopefully) improved job opportunities flowing from  embryonic economic revival and heightened expenditure on social  infrastructure."    MPs Privilege List -- A second editorial on the same page  states that "it is entirely right" to cut free flights for  former parliamentarians. "The big problem is the  parliamentarians of the present, whose privilege list grows  longer by the day and whose own free flight schedule has just  been magnified. They should rediscover that their role is as  public servants, not public parasites."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Mine Closures -- The impending closure of the Durban  Roodepoort Deep gold mine "will have devastating economic and  social effects" on those who are dependent on the remittances of  migrant workers employed at the mine, says a page-10 editorial  in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 June. "None of  this, though, would justify a permanent and probably growing  subsidy to a mine which has done what all mines eventually do --  reach the end of their natural lives. A subsidy would set a  precedent for state assistance to numerous other lossmaking,  marginal enterprises, outside the mining industry too."  However, there should be "routine but comprehensive contingency  planning to mitigate the effects of decline and closure in the  industry." This should be the responsibility of "mine  managements and other stakeholders -- including employees and  adjacent local authorities -- at enterprises which are still  going concerns to begin this work now."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Kasrils Appointment a Mistake -- "Up to now President Nelson  Mandela has treated appointments in and around the cabinet with  great sensitivity," notes a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg  BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 June. However, "with the appointment  of Mr. Ronnie Kasrils as deputy minister of defense, Mr. Mandela  has made his first significant mistake." The integration of the  South African National Defense Force is a "difficult process"  which has to be handled "with great caution" since there are  already danger signals in this regard. "If the individuals and  component parts of the new defense force do not have confidence  in the leadership and the process, the defensive shield could  become a threat" since the political heads of this integration  are both two former top figures of Spear of the Nation, the ANC  military wing, with little known about their underground  activities, even though an investigation "has pointed a finger  at Mr. Modise." Mr. Kasrils's role in the Bisho massacre is  "too well known, but further we don't know for which murder and  maiming he has been responsible." "The appointment of a  hardened communist in a key portfolio such as defense will shock  many. One wonders what the international world will think while  South Africa is urgently seeking investments." "We do not  believe that Mr. Kasrils's appointment will promote  reconciliation and national unity."    Confusion Over Amnesty Law -- A second editorial on the same  page says "last week the Ministry of Justice announced that 63  prisoners were released. Among them were four very  controversial former policemen who were released on the basis of  the Law on Further Amnesty, despite having been found guilty of  murder. It would appear as though the amnesty order in question  had already been signed by former President F.W. de Klerk even  before the election, after which it was discussed with the new  minister of justice and the new cabinet." Meanwhile, the new  justice minister and Mr. Mandela are distancing themselves from  this decision. "Such a situation is untenable" because if each  amnesty case -- intended to bring about reconciliation -- has to  be "accompanied by such controversy and discord" then it would  be "better to suspend the whole process."</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Float values Court Cavendish at Pounds 51m COURT Cavendish, the nursing home company, has priced its new issue at 225p a share, valuing the group at Pounds 51m. It plans to use the money raised to repay Pounds 24.6m debt and to finance expansion. Currently the fifth largest nursing home operator in the UK, Court Cavendish aims to grow at 500 beds a year for the next three to five years, spending between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m a year. The company has a new secured bank facility to borrow Pounds 20m. UBS is placing 20.2m shares, 90 per cent of the total, 7.1m of which are subject to clawback. Existing shareholders are selling 2.56m shares, with 17.7m new shares being issued. The company's estimate of pro forma pre-tax profits for the year to end April of Pounds 2.26m and earnings per share of 14.8p put the shares are on an historic p/e of 15.2 at the issue price. A notional net dividend of 3.6p for 1992-93 gives a yield of 2 per cent at the offer price. COMMENT Court Cavendish aims to differentiate itself in this competitive market. Private and part-private clients fill 60 per cent of beds - more than competitors - and a mix of residential with traditional nursing homes gives it flexibility. The company's strategy of buying filled homes rather than building new ones makes sense in today's property market. But it could mean less efficient homes with higher costs. The immediate problem is uncertainty created by recent changes to government funding rules. These should favour corporate investors in the end, while social and political trends make nursing homes a growth sector. The company says it has the finance for its goal of 3,000 beds within about three years. It hopes that by 1996 there will be a US-style lease-back market in nursing home assets to pay for further growth. On forecast profits of Pounds 4.2m for the current year the prospective p/e of 14 at the issue price looks cheap. Given the sector is on 15.5 and Westminster Health Care, a larger and recently floated competitor, is on 16, the issue should go well.</p>

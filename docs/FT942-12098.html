			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Delay in expansion of the EU could create crisis of confidence A delay in expanding the European Union to 16 members would hurt European business and could create another crisis of confidence in the EU, the industry group Unice warned yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. Referring to today's vote in the European parliament, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe said the EU would benefit economically by admitting Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 'A successful conclusion to enlargement will boost confidence in the European Union and strengthen the policies to achieve renewed competitiveness, sustained growth and increased job generation,' it said in a statement. The parliament's assent is necessary for the four countries to join the EU as planned on January 1. Officials have predicted a 'yes' vote, but many MPs have been irked by an arrangement on voting procedures for a bigger Union - made to win over Britain to the expansion plans - which they say would undermine the powers of the parliament, the EU's only directly elected body. Unice said it shared the parliament's wish for efficient, transparent and democratic institutions. 'But the applicant states, with their strong traditions of openness and democracy, will only add strength, not weakness, to the pursuit of such reform,' it said.</p>

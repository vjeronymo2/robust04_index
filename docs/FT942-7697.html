			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shinawatra posts sharp rise at Bt712m Shinawatra Computer and Communications, the parent company of the Thai communications and broadcasting group controlled by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, yesterday reported sharply higher net profits for the first quarter of the current year, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. Unconsolidated net profits were Bt712.6m (Dollars 28.29m) in the three months to end-March, compared with Bt276.4m a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to Bt7.29 from Bt3.94. Consolidated profits for the quarter were Bt722m; no comparable figure was provided for last year. The sale of a 17.5 per cent stake in International Engineering to its communications rival UCOM produced profits of Bt290m. Shinawatra's profits were also lifted by a successful promotional campaign by its 60 per cent-owned subsidiary, Advanced Info Services, which already accounts for half the country's lucrative portable telephone and pager market. Advanced's consolidated quarterly profits climbed 150 per cent to Bt383.72m from Bt153m a year ago . Investment analysts generally think that Mr Thaksin's decision to step back from operational control of his businesses recently to enter politics has had little effect on the direction of the ambitious group because 'he's essentially still in charge'. Brokers generally reckon that the Shinawatra parent company will report profits of around Bt1.8bn this year.</p>

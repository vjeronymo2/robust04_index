			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sevastopol -- The Black Sea Fleet Press Center  reports that over 20 combat ships of the Black Sea Fleet put out  to sea on 26 January in accordance with the plan for 1994 to  practice combat training tasks. One of the aims of the Black  Sea Fleet sailors' training exercise is to provide instruction  for their young reinforcements, with 4,500 conscripts from  Ukraine among them.    The command of the Black Sea Fleet, in the words of Mykola  Savchenko, Ukrainian Navy Press Center head, did not coordinate  its actions with respect to this training exercise, either with  the Navy commander or the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, which  contravenes the accord between the Russian and Ukrainian  presidents of 17 June 1993. In particular, it contravenes  Article 6, in accordance with which the fleet command was to  have notified not only the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the  president of Ukraine in advance, but also the leadership of  Sevastopol and the Crimea.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / All because the lady loves: A tale of power, passion and chocolate 'Vorsprungli durch Heirat (a little progress through marriage).' There is nothing peculiarly Swiss about this situation - it is human,' said a well-informed Zurich businessman yesterday. He was referring to the strange case of Mr Rudulph Sprungli, the autocratic chairman of the Swiss confectionery group, Lindt &amp; Sprungli, whose marriage last week to a woman 28 years his junior provoked a slump in the group's shares and the resignation of its respected chief executive. It is a tale that combines those eternal and ever-troublesome themes - love, greed, ageing, power, religion and chocolate. Not surprisingly, it has enthralled Swiss society in the middle of an otherwise soporific summer. It all started last spring when the 72-year-old Mr Sprungli divorced his wife of 45 years and announced his engagement to a 44-year-old sometime adherent of a US-based theosophical sect called 'I AM'. Within days, it was reported that his betrothed, Ms Alexandra Gantenbein, had been advising him privately on top management appointments, with the implication that the company was being infiltrated by 'I AM' adherents. Mr Sprungli promptly called off the engagement and called in a firm of accountants, KPMG Fides, to investigate. All went quiet until 10 days ago when Lindt &amp; Sprungli issued a statement saying that KPMG had concluded that decisions on executive appointments were made by authorised directors. But it added a quotation from the KPMG report to the effect that 'Mrs A Gantenbein, occasional member of the 'I AM' movement, gained some importance and influence in decisions over top manager positions'. Then, late on Monday afternoon Lindt &amp; Sprungli announced that the couple had been secretly married the previous Friday. Within 24 hours, the group's shares had lost nearly a tenth of their value and the chief executive had resigned. Although the couple, the company and the resigning chief executive have not been willing to shed any light on these events, the Swiss media have proceeded to speculate with a confidence that comes of living in a fairly tight-knit community. As to Mr Sprungli himself, it is a matter of record that some 12 years ago, at 61, he stood down as group chief executive, saying that one of the 10 deadly sins in a family company was to leave unsettled the question of a successor. He stayed on as chairman. In an interview last April he admitted that the succession was still undecided and he was remaining active. Indeed, his continued interventions in day-to-day management have led to a high level of turnover of senior executives. Mr Ulrich Geissmann, who left the company yesterday, had been chief executive for little over a year. In the previous six years, there had been four chief executives and a frequent rotation of other top employees, with departures said to stem from 'differences of opinion' or some similar phrase. In the spring of 1991, the chairman's eldest son and heir apparent, Rudolf K Sprungli, then marketing director, left the company to become managing director of another food group. 'We have grown a bit apart,' Mr Sprungli, pere, admitted in April. As for Ms Gantenbein and 'I AM', various reports have emerged in the press, of which the most tantalising is that she had married a Swiss businessman in 1986 when he was 77. He died 16 months later, leaving her some SFr4.5m (Pounds 1.7m). The sect to which she belongs was founded in Chicago in the 1930s and its followers believe that people carry within themselves the divine spirit. Its Zurich reading room, in a non-descript office building in a seedy part of town, has been tightly shut this week. As amusing as the story is, it has serious aspects. Lindt &amp; Sprungli sales last year reached just under SFr1bn; it employs more than 4,000 people and has factories in Germany, France and the US as well as in Switzerland. A trade union representative said there was a growing feeling of unease among employees. At the moment, the group is in remarkably good health. Profits were up 20 per cent last year to SFr23.5m and the dividend was raised for the seventh year in a row. But all is obviously not well. 'It is a familiar situation,' a Zurich businessman said yesterday. 'The chairman has passed his prime, but the board is too weak to do anything about it.' Problems of succession in family companies are not uncommon in Swiss business. A long-running struggle at Movenpick, the restaurants and hotels group, was finally resolved last December when the family sold its stake to a German businessman. The five-strong Sprungli family controls almost 50 per cent of the company's voting shares and has a pact to vote together. Until now, the family has let Mr Sprungli have his way, but the ex-Mrs Sprungli, who is thought to be the biggest single shareholder, may be losing her patience, company observers believe. She was unhappy about her son's ejection last year, they say. Among those embarrassed by the affair is Credit Suisse, the group's bank. Mr Kurt Widmer, a Credit Suisse director, sits on the Lindt &amp; Sprungli board. Observers say the bank has been an effective supporter of the Lindt shares this week. By yesterday's close, the bearer shares, having been as low as SFr10,900 on Wednesday, had recovered to SFr13,000, SFr800 higher than at the end of last week. Credit Suisse also has close relations with Nestle, the Swiss food and confectionery group, leading to press speculation of a possible Nestle takeover. Nestle has refused to comment, but such an outcome seems unlikely on competition policy grounds. Thus, it could take some time for this steamy tale of power, passion and sugar to cool down. One Zurich newspaper predicted yesterday that the new Mrs Sprungli would be in the chief executive's chair at Lindt by next month. 'Absurd,' said the company in one of its rare comments these days.</p>

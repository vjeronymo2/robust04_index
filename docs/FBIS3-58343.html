			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "sm": "Early Decision"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 10 Jan -- In the future a general decision  about the exports by international armament syndicates with  German participation is to be made before the cooperation  project is initiated. This has been suggested by FRG Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party [FDP].    The goal is to ensure "minimum orders" for German armament  companies. A final political decision has not yet made on his  ideas, Rexrodt admitted.    An amendment to the Military Materiel Control Law and a  change in the Federal Government's political principles for the  export of military weapons and other armament goods from 1982 to  loosen the export policy is not planned, however, the FDP  politician stressed. The Economics Minister stressed that he  thinks a common European arms export policy is urgently  necessary. However, he admitted that the views of the 12 EU  member states on a unified policy in this field are still far  apart.    The establishment of unified European rules for the export  of  so- called dual-use goods, which can be used for military and  civilian purposes, is of particular importance, Rexrodt said.  According to the current state of negotiations, agreement  concerning this issue can be achieved in the Union only below  the standard of the regulations that are valid in Germany now.  Nevertheless, Rexrodt assessed the emerging compromise as  progress, not least regarding the desire for equal  competitiveness of Germany's export business.</p>

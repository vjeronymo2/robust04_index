			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GPG halts Power offer Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, is not proceeding with its Dollars 17.32m (Pounds 7.3m) offer for Power Brewing Company of Australia. It had intended to make an offer at 44 cents a share for 50 per cent of each member's fully paid ordinary PBC shares. However, GPG decided against it since PBC has proposed to adopt initiatives suggested by GPG to end PBC's joint venture with Queensland Breweries and the return of resulting cash to PBC shareholders.</p>

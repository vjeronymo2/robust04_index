			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BM nets Dollars 22m from US sale BM Group, the loss-making engineering company, yesterday announced the latest in a series of disposals with the sale of a US construction and mining equipment distributor to Marubeni of Japan for a net consideration of Dollars 22.2m (Pounds 14.5m). The sale of Mitchell Distributing, which had been expected before the June 30 year-end, will bring current debt down by Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 52m. Debt has been reduced substantially from the Pounds 98m reported at the interim stage by previous disposals. Because of the slight delay in completing the sale agreement, however, the group will show borrowings of Pounds 65m when it reports annual figures in October. BM said the disposal programme, agreed with bankers, was on track. The group plans to get rid of businesses in Canada - for which it took a Pounds 6m charge at the interim stage - and operations in Belgium and South Africa. BM will now have to focus on renegotiating banking facilities to replace the short-term support which expires in December.</p>

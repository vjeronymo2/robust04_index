			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREETERS ENDORSE PLAN TO LET BANKS SELL SECURITIES  </P> <P> Wall Street leaders declared an end on Friday to their lengthy battle to keep  banks out of the stocks and bonds business, proposing to junk the law that has  governed the nation's basic banking structure since the Depression.  </P> <P> Directors of the Securities Industry Assn., at the trade group's annual  convention here, endorsed a proposal for new legislation to let subsidiaries of  banks "engage in a broad range of securities and securities-related  activities."  </P> <P> At the same time, the SIA said its plan would let brokers engage in consumer  banking businesses and join banks in having access to the Federal Reserve's  banking system, including the right to borrow from the Fed in emergencies.  </P> <P> The move appears to herald one of the biggest breaks yet in the gradually  crumbling wall separating banking and brokerage activities, erected by the  Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 amid the financial crisis that followed the stock  market crash four years earlier.  </P> <P> The barrier has been weakened chink by chink in recent years, with the move  toward financial deregulation.  </P></p>

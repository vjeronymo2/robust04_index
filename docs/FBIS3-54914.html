It lifts all  restrictions on the issuance of a general civil foreign travel  passport. In order to obtain it, one will not have to produce  private or service invitations at local visa and registration  departments. A written application will be sufficient, and a  passport will be issued in due course. Moreover, there will be  no need in the new year for a separate permission entry [in the  passport] stating the country and the time limits for going  there. The new passport will be valid to go to any country in  the world a number of times. This was the topic of a news  conference held in Minsk with the participation of  representatives of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Consular  Directorate, the Internal Affairs Ministry Passport and Visa  Service, and the republic's Border Troops Chief Directorate.</p>

Lewis] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- The National Party [NP]  has condemned the carnage and mayhem in central Johannesburg on  Monday, saying such chaos made an all-inclusive political  solution less attainable.    "We deplore the fact that a whole city could be held hostage  by political organisations who cannot solve their disputes  peacefully and responsibly," said NP director of information Mr  Marthinus van Schalkwyk. He added, however, there were too many  differing viewpoints to form a definite picture of who started  the carnage.</p>

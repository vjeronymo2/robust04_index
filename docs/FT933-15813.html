			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Ashworth's research centres and academic chairs will help LSE Sir, The news of John Ashworth's setbacks (Observer, 'Under review', June 25) needs to be put in perspective. While he may have lost County Hall and his plan for top-up fees, he has already chalked up a number of successes. One of these is the Centre for the Study of Global Governance, which is funded by the World Humanity Action Trust. As its director, I can vouch for the fact that it was John Ashworth's network as a natural scientist which secured us the money. The same is true of the Principe d'Asturias chair in Spanish Studies established with a donation of Pounds 500,000. The Observer item appeared in the middle of a three-day conference on Evolution and the Human Sciences. Not only had John Ashworth, as a microbiologist, been instrumental in setting up this dialogue between natural scientists, social scientists and philosophers, but he helped its host, the London School of Economics philosophy department, secure from an anonymous donor a 25-year, rent-free lease on a building in the vicinity of the LSE. This will house the proposed All London Centre for the History and Philosophy of Science. Eventually research centres and academic chairs will help the LSE, whatever happens to County Hall. Meghnad Desai, Centre for the Study of Global Governance, Houghton Street, London WC2</p>

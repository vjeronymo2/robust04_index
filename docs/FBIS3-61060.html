			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Petr Altunin under </F> the rubric "Continuing the Subject": "In the Empty Tank,  Billions... But Only A Real Manager Can Extract It From There"]    [Text] It is an indisputable fact, as they say, that the  fuel service base in the army and navy has come to a halt in its  development. Most of it was built more than 30 years ago, during  the missile-fuel boom, when the fuel service provided full  support for the launching of missiles into space, the emergence  of the navy onto the world ocean and increased motorization of  the army. The base has recently become fairly obsolete, however,  and since the collapse of the Union it has found itself in an  altogether critical state.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA raised the need to renew this very important  material base at the beginning of last year. The report was  titled "Where Are We to Get Two and a Half Billion?" Today, in  view of the fact that we have not managed to solve the problem  and that prices have spiraled to hundreds of times what they  were, a trillion would not be enough. Just what can be done?    Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention. The  solution was made easier by the fact that the interests of the  fuel service coincided with the nation's economic interests.  More precisely, those of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, which  has recently begun experiencing a shortage of containers and  pumping equipment, and simply of space. In the armed forces, on  the contrary, due to a shortage of fuel and lubricants (caused  by inadequate financing), fuel bases and depots are idle, and  everything is being off-loaded directly into the military units  and onto the ships. Incidentally, empty containers corrode more  rapidly.... So why not help the Ministry of Fuel and Energy with  the transfer, storage and distribution of petroleum products,  and thereby earn some money for improving and renovating the  materials and equipment base?    The Central Missile Fuel Directorate came out with an  initiative to this effect. And it was supported by the Rear  Services of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense, and  then by higher authorities. Decree No. 219, "On the Construction  of and the Renovation of Operating Petroleum Transshipment  Facilities," issued by the government on 14 March 1993,  specifically authorized the Fuel Service of the Armed Forces to  take part in this undertaking. In other words, the military  bases and depots were given the opportunity to provide services  for outside, civilian organizations for a charge and without  detriment to the combat training.    In accordance with this decree, the Minister of Defense of  the Russian Federation issued Order No. 355 on 15 July of last  year, with an appendix listing the bases and depots authorized  to provide services, and also containing complete regulations on  their activities.    What do these documents say? I took this question to  Major-General P. Gorupay, chief of the Central Missile Fuel  Directorate of the Ministry of Defense.    "These documents are extremely important to us," Pavel  Ivanovich said. "They are based on an agreement between the base  and an outside organization. They include a list of services,  diverse services: The transfer of liquid petroleum products from  reinforced concrete tanks to the reservoirs of bases and depots,  the unloading of apportioned fuel into storage facilities and at  open sites, the chemical analysis of oil, technical assistance  with the accounting, the allocation of vehicles for hauling the  fuel, the provision of depot sites and containers for storing  various materials, and so forth. The charges for the services  are open but no lower than the current market prices in the  given area. Rigid monitoring is specified to prevent possible  violations."    I was told at the Central Directorate that there is rapid  development of the fuel service for the Moscow, Volga and  Leningrad districts, the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The  military fuel base located at Murmansk, for example, concluded a  one-year agreement with the Murmansk Maritime Shipping Line on  the transferring of petroleum products. Payments under the  agreement should amount to more than one million dollars.    For six months now a Baltic Fleet fuel base has been  transferring fuel belonging to a large joint enterprise--under  an agreement permitting this, of course--with visible results. A  major overhaul of the railroad platform and the pipeline have  been carried out with the several million dollars earned,  several pumping units have been installed with the assistance of  the Swedes, and the installation of standing tanks is underway.    Even a service on a lesser scale is profitable. The central  base located at Naro-Fominsk has concluded an agreement with one  of the enterprises whereby incoming motor transport equipment is  off-loaded and stored on the latter's tracks. The amount  involved is 600,000 rubles per day. The base at which A. Kustov  is chief does not have much space, but it is within the Moscow  city limits. He said that an agreement has been reached on the  storage of expensive assemblies and devices, for which the  charge is considerably greater....    In short, the minister's order has opened up extensive  possibilities. Some people have taken it the wrong way, however.  Some of them are in no rush to execute it. There is plenty of  time, they say, and have not taken the initiative to look for  customers. There have also been overly clever "executives."  Colonel V. Basalayev, chief of a fuel dump, conducted operations  involving petroleum products for a joint-stock company not at  the market price, as should have been the case, but at a  preferential price. There would have to be some abuses, of  course. This incident was rapidly halted, and all of the fuel  services were apprised of it.    Additional problems arose for the fuel service. Additional  personnel are needed for organizing the services and for strict,  universal monitoring: Financial experts, economists, legal  experts and others. This was taken into account in the order  issued by the Minister of Defense. A group consisting of three  officers and two civilian employees is being added to the T/O of  the Central Directorate, to be maintained out of income from the  services provided. The group exists only on paper for now, to be  sure. It has been impossible thus far to arrange all of the  necessary formalities.</p>

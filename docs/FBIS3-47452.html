			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 11 January, a senior official at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] referred to a plan to  increase to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994 the amount of U.S.  auto parts procured by Japanese automakers and said, "It would  be difficult to carry out the plan." In bilateral framework  trade talks on autos and auto parts, Washington has called on  Tokyo to ask Japanese automakers to formulate programs for  imports of U.S. auto parts beyond fiscal year 1995 so they that  these can be used as "objective criteria" to gauge the openness  of the Japanese market. Thus, the negative view expressed by the  MITI official might affect the unofficial vice-ministerial-level  talks on autos and the auto parts trade that are to start on 12  January.    In January 1992, when former U.S. President George Bush  visited Tokyo, Japanese automakers drew up programs for their  procurement of U.S. auto parts under MITI's guidance. They  imported or procured locally U.S.-made parts worth $7.24 billion  in the first half of fiscal year 1993 (April-September 1993), a  21.1-percent increase from the previous year. Despite this  large increase, the senior MITI official thinks that "their  procurement will decrease from now on," noting that the  emergence of new models developed by the U.S. Big Three is  casting a shadow over the sales of Japanese cars in the U.S.  market, and that the ratio of parts procured locally by Japanese  factories in the United States has already been very high, thus  making it difficult for them to purchase more.    He believes that expanding the import of U.S.-made parts  "will be more difficult than increasing local procurement"  because car sales remain sluggish at home and Japanese  automakers can no longer afford to buy expensive U.S. parts.    MITI has concluded that it is highly unlikely that the  amount  of U.S. parts procured by Japanese automakers, which is expected  to reach about $15 billion altogether in fiscal year 1993, will  increase appreciably in fiscal year 1994.    The Japanese Government is avoiding getting involved in the  U.S.-made parts procurement plans, claiming: "What is  demonstrated in the procurement programs are voluntary goals set  by Japanese automakers on the condition that their production in  the United States should increase by 50 percent." However, the  U.S. Government views the procurement programs as Japan's  "commitments" and considers them a good example of numerical  targets. It is possible that MITI's negative view on the  expansion of U.S.-made parts procurement will cause Washington's  attitude to toughen in the auto and auto parts trade talks.</p>

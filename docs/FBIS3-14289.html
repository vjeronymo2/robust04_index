Prior to the resumption of the negotiations a short while  ago, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th said  agreement has been reached on the deployment of joint  Palestinian-Israeli police patrols in the Hebron area. He said  agreement has also been reached on the weapons that will be  carried by the international observer force. These weapons, he  noted, will be individual weapons to be used for only  self-defense.    As we have said, the negotiations have been resumed. This is  the only new development I know of. We will announce any  further developments once they occur.</p>

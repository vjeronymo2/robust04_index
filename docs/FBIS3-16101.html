The two  countries agreed to team up and work together on the problem of  nuclear non-proliferation.    The announcement was made at a news conference after the  talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Vladivostok on Monday.    "We are partners and will continue to work in this  direction," Kozyrev said. Christopher said that despite the age  difference he and Kozyrev are doing one work.    Speaking about Bosnia, both diplomats expressed satisfaction  with the achieved results, including the compromise between the  warring factions.    Also discussed was the possibility of transforming G-7 into  G-8.    Kozyrev and Christopher said that relations between the two  countries have passed the test of strength lately. They did not  discuss the spy scandal involving a high-ranking CIA official,  James Aldrich.    Concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic  states, Kozyrev said Russia stands for their soonest possible  pullout and has nothing to do with the attempts of the Baltic  republics to deport the Russian troops. He said Russia will  take part in COCOM.    Asked about the situation in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Russian  foreign minister said that Russia calls for the preservation of  fish resources in the sea. There has been understanding on the  part of the United States. In the future both countries plan to  discuss this issue, he said.    After the talks, Christopher left for the U.S. Kozyrev flew  to Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, to attend a meeting of  the foreign ministers of Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan, and representatives of Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan.    The participants are expected to be received by Tajik  President Emomali Rakhmanov. During the visit to Tajikistan,  Kozyrev will take a trip to the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

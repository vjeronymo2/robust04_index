			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Job cuts and Dollars 150m charge at Arco The shrinking of the US oil and gas industry continued apace yesterday as Atlantic Richfield announced a further Dollars 150m after-tax charge and a plan to cut its workforce by 2,000 more people by the end of next year. Late last year, Arco took a Dollars 450m charge and announced 1,500 job cuts as part of a reorganisation of its US oil and gas business outside Alaska, the location of its biggest US production activities. Taken together, these moves will leave the company with annual costs which are Dollars 400m lower by 1996, Mike Bowlin, Arco's president and chief executive, said yesterday. Like others, Los Angeles-based Arco is attempting to channel a greater share of its capital spending into international ventures, which hold out the prospect of bigger discoveries and higher profits margins. Two weeks ago, Texaco announced it was cutting 2,500 workers and selling half of its US oil-producing properties, while Chevron last week said it had found a buyer for its San Francisco headquarters building, though the name and likely sale price were not disclosed. Among the latest round of job cuts at Arco, the company said it would reduce its workforce in Alaska by 750. At the end of 1993, the company employed 25,000 people, 20,000 of them in the US. The latest charge, to be taken in second-quarter figures due shortly, results from improvements in the retirement and benefits package for former workers. Much of the earlier, Dollars 450m charge reflected write-downs in US assets.</p>

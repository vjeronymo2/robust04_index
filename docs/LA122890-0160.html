			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 ESCAPED SOUTH KOREAN PRISONERS KILL THEMSELVES DURING STANDOFF  </P> <P> Two escaped South Korean prisoners killed themselves with a revolver today  rather than surrender to police approaching their lakeside hide-out in  helicopters and rubber boats.  </P> <P> The shootings ended a 36-hour chase for three convicted murderers who broke out  of their jail early Thursday by sawing through bars in their cell, police said.  </P> <P> Hundreds of police were mobilized for the manhunt.  </P> <P> One escapee was caught near the rural lake outside the provincial city of  Taejon. When police found him, he surrendered peacefully and asked for food,  police said.  </P> <P> The other two -- Park Bong Sun, 30, and Shin Kwang Jae, 21 -- crossed the lake  aboard a stolen boat but were trapped by a dozen sharpshooters on the shore.  Civilians, including news photographers, witnessed the dramatic lakeside  standoff.  </P> <P> The two rejected repeated calls to surrender, with Park holding the revolver to  his head and threatening to shoot himself. As police approached in helicopters  and rubber boats, Park fired a bullet into his head.  </P> <P> Shin then took the gun and fired a bullet into his chest. He died on the way to  a hospital.  </P> <P> The revolver had been stolen from a police officer earlier today, when the  escapees, armed with a knife, had been stopped for questioning at a bus  terminal in Taejon, 100 miles south of Seoul.  </P> <P> A police officer was stabbed in the neck and seriously wounded during that  confrontation.  </P></p>

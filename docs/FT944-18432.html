			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Row over minimum wage defused A row over Labour's commitment to a national minimum wage was defused yesterday when it was agreed that the party's Economic Commission, chaired by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, would draw up details of the policy. Tension between the unions and the party leadership on employment law was set aside with the adoption of motions calling for increased rights at work, while a radical motion calling for the repeal of all Conservative union legislation seems likely to be rejected on a card vote. On the minimum wage, the conference backed a motion calling for a target for the low-paid based on half median male earnings. But officials said the commission would prepare proposals on the commitment to be approved at a future conference. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union and a member of the Economic Commission, accused the media of 'mischief-making nonsense' in suggesting there were differences of view between the unions and the leadership over the minimum wage. He said: 'We seem to be picking over each word. In the end it is a matter of trust.' Mr Tony Blair insisted the minimum wage must be introduced 'flexibly and sensibly' and not 'foolishly'. Interviewed last night on the BBC's Panorama programme, Mr Blair said: 'If we do it foolishly, and some countries have done it foolishly, then it could have an adverse impact. So we will do it sensibly.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Labour would have to consider ways of phasing in the minimum wage 'step by step'. Mr Brown denied the party was split over the minimum wage but refused to accept that Labour should commit itself for the time being to a precise figure. However Mr Garfield Davies, general secretary of the Usdaw shopworkers' union, stressed that a clear formula and a clear figure would have to be agreed well before the next election. 'We must have a clear figure so the millions of low-paid workers will be able to see how their wages will be improved,' he said. Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, received loud applause from a minority of delegates when he called for the repeal of all Conservative legislation and attacked Mr Blair for his 'lukewarm' support for the rail signallers' strike. The main motion on rights at work called for the right to individual and collective representation by unions and a legal right to strike. However Mr Peter Mandelson, a leading party moderniser close to Mr Blair, said at a fringe meeting that legislation alone will not help unions. He said: 'They have got to modernise themselves and make themselves more attractive to potential members. That is the only way they can improve their standing.' He also said that last year's one-member, one-vote reform was only the first step. He added that the important next step was to increase individual membership among union members.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Household rubbish recycling 'limited' RECYCLING HOUSEHOLD refuse is considered important by most people, according to a survey on recycling published yesterday. But 64 per cent of those questioned said they put all their rubbish into the dustbin rather than arrange for any of it to be recycled. Compilers of the survey, published by Mintel, the research group, questioned 1,000 adults throughout the UK in May and August last year. They find that 94 per cent of respondents considered recycling important for the environment. Household waste forms just 21m tonnes, or 3 per cent, of the UK's annual 700m tonnes of rubbish. The typical household disposes of some 650kg of glass, paper, ferrous metal and waste food each year. The government has fixed a target for councils of recycling 25 per cent of all household waste by the year 2000. However, according to Mintel, few councils have yet completed their waste recycling plans, which must be presented to the Department of the Environment by August. Between 3 per cent of 5 per cent of all waste comes from households, and Mintel believes that at least 42 per cent of the household share could be recycled. As available landfill space runs out, pressure will build for legislation to compel more recycling, the survey says. Mintel estimates after questioning councils that the capacity of existing landfill sites will be exhausted within about 11 years. Britain rates low on a Europe-wide recycling league table, according to Mr John Cunningham, Mintel's chief executive. Only 19 per cent of Britain's household glass is recycled, placing the UK 11th out of 13 European countries surveyed. Mintel said yesterday that the report had been printed on recycled paper. But as that cost 50 per cent more than virgin paper the exercise might not be repeated. Mr Tony Baldry, junior environment minister, yesterday announced final details of a scheme in which local authorities will make payments to recycling groups and companies based on the amount they collect for recycling. The new scheme of payments, known as recycling credits, will start on April 1. Recycling: Public Attitudes and Market Reality 1992. Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE. Pounds 895.</p>

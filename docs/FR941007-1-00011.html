For example, if the price of a marginal kilowatt were to exceed its marginal cost by an amount equal to the value of the marginal externality damage, the pricing distortion in utility markets and the externality would together create a situation where utility-customer decision-making would satisfy the marginal conditions for social optimality without any further adjustments. An additional externality adder in this situation would move away from the alignment of the private and social decision-making problems that motivates concern with externalities in the first place. Based on this reasoning, DOE believes that application of an additional externality adder in any situation where the price of a marginal kilowatt exceeds marginal cost by more than the value of the marginal externality damage would be inconsistent with the objective of maximizing net national benefits. In fact, for this latter case, one can envision arguments in favor of applying ``subtractors'' to utility rates used in a calculation of net national benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that real-world utility pricing systems are quite complex. Many systems employ a fixed connection or service charge, together with prices to meet incremental demand that may vary with the class of service, time of day, or level of demand within a billing period. The analysis that supports the appliance standards rulemakings does not reflect this complexity. Rather, a national average is used to represent current and forecasted consumer prices. Based on its present information, the Department believes that the difference between this ``analysis price'' and marginal cost, rather than the difference between some true marginal price and marginal cost, is relevant to establishing the gap between price and cost that bears on the incorporation of incremental externality values in the Department's analysis. The Department seeks comment on alternatives to national averages that would better reflect local and regional differences in consumer prices, as well as the other sources of price variation mentioned above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in some circumstances, the price facing end-users may be less than marginal cost. The same principles would apply. Even ignoring externalities, prices below marginal cost encourage demand whose value to users is less than the cost of production to meet it. To correct this situation and at the same time reflect externalities that may also be present, it would be necessary to apply adders larger than the marginal damage from emissions associated with increased energy demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the above, the relationship between price and marginal cost is clearly central to the determination of externality values for use in setting appliance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue 8: Evidence bearing on the relationship between the end-user price of energy and marginal cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

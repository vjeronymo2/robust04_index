			<p>BFN     [Text] In spite of what the skeptics said, Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev has nevertheless succeeded in  creating his own armed forces. This was clearly shown by the  latest military parade in Groznyy, where military units were  presented with banners and demonstrated their own uniforms. Two  years ago when the rebellious general announced universal  mobilization, many people, including people in Chechnya itself,  viewed it as a children's game, forgetting that the Chechen  president had excellent military training. Today Dudayev, apart  from his National Guard, has several regiments, including an air  squadron.    Chechen cadre officers who have returned to the republic  after being demobilized from Russian and CIS Armed Forces are  being utilized in the Army. Despite the critical lack of cash  in Chechnya and the lack of its' own currency, Dudayev  nevertheless does not begrudge money for the Army or its  weaponry. As the president himself said at a recent news  conference, the world is too cruel and recognizes only strength.  To all appearances he shares the dream of creating a strong  Chechen state with its' own army. In one way or another the  existence of the Chechen Armed Forces is already a fact. This  fact will almost certainly be used by Dudayev at the possible  coming talks with Russia. [video shows military parade in  progress]</p>

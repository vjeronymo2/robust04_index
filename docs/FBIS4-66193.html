			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Dalin (1728 1129 2651): "Economic </F> Regionalism, Protectionism Drive Japan's Move Back to Asia"]    [Text] Japan has begun implementing its strategy of  "dissociating itself from America and returning to Asia" even as  it continues to insist it is a "member of the Western camp." Its  central purpose is to become a political power. With the Asian  economy growing by leaps and bounds, Japan must return to Asia  if it is to secure its place in the world, jockeying for a  favorable spot as it wages economic war with the United States  and Europe.    In pursuit of its back-to-Asia strategy, Japan follows these  policies: Cooperate as well as compete with the United States;  resolve the issues inherited from history; use economic and  technological means to achieve leadership in Asia; and make use  of international organizations and international conferences.    Japan's "detaching itself from America to return to Asia"  strategy has caught the attention of nations around the world,  particularly its neighbors in Asia.    Both inside Japan and overseas, some of the hottest topics  in  political, economic, and academic circles as well as the media  these days are the notion of Japan "detaching itself from the  United States to return to Asia," the idea that "Japanese  diplomacy is redoubling its attention to Asia," and the sense  that Japan is "shifting its development strategy back to Asia."  These issues are being explored from a variety of perspectives,  political, economic, diplomatic, and security.    This article examines the current status, background, and  future trends of Japan's back-to-Asia strategy, its principal  point of departure being Japan's foreign economic strategy.    1. Japan On the Way Back To Asia    After World War II, it was Japan's strategy to dissociate  itself from Asia and link up with the United States, toeing  Washington's line diplomatically and relying on it economically.  Since the mid-1980's, as its economic prowess grew rapidly,  Japan is no longer content to remain America's junior partner  and has been trying to achieve political parity with the latter,  drawing support from Asia. Thus it began its strategy of  "detaching itself from the United States and returning to Asia"  even as it insisted on remaining a member of the Western  alliance. Adopting a three-in-one approach combining trade and  investment with economic aid, with direct investment playing the  dominant role, Japan has vigorously pursued the "wild goose"  model, building a solid foundation in the making the itself the  leader of the regional economy of East Asia.    A. Japan-Asian Trade Increasing Every Year    On the exports front, Japan's exports to Asia rose 14  percent  between 1991 and 1992, while exports to America increased just 7  percent. In 1992, Japan's exports to Asia accounted for 38.8  percent of the nation's total exports, while exports to the  United States made up only 28.8 percent. On the imports side,  Japan's imports from Asia rose 6 percent, while those from the  United States slipped 3 percent. In 1992, Japan's imports from  Asia accounted for 45 percent of Japan's total imports, while  imports from the United States amounted to just 22.4 percent.  (HUSHENG MONTHLY, July 1991; GUOSHI TUHUI, 1993 edition) Asia  has become Japan's largest trading partner, overtaking the  United States.    The above data aside, the following points need to be made  about the increasing Japan-Asia trade: 1) Japan has resumed its  trade ties with Asia. Before the war (1934-1936), Japan mainly  looked to Asia as the source of raw materials it imported and  the destination of the manufactured goods it exported. At its  peak, Japan-Asian trade accounted for 60 percent of Japan's  total trade. After the war, Japan-United States trade blossomed  while Japan-Asian trade dropped below 30 percent in the late  1970's. In recent years, however, Japan-Asian trade has  gradually rebounded to almost 40 percent, exceeding the size of  Japan-United States trade. (HUSHENG MONTHLY, July 1993) 2) The  pattern of commodity exchange has shifted from vertical to  horizontal, however. In the pre-war years, Japan's imports from  Asia consisted of raw materials, grain, and assorted mineral  products, agricultural products, and handcrafted articles. To  date, most imports from Asia's four "mini-dragons" are  manufactured goods, with machinery and electronic parts and  components accounting for one-quarter. More machinery is  imported from member nations of ASEAN than raw materials. 3)  Asia has become an increasingly important export market for  Japanese goods. Ten years ago, only Taiwan barely made it onto  the list of Japan's top-ten export market by placing tenth. To  date, seven Asian nations and regions, namely mainland China,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and  Malaysia have earned themselves a spot on the top-ten list.    B. Direct Japanese Investment in Asia Rising Without  Interruption    In the early 1980's, direct Japanese investment in Asia was  more or less on a par with American investment in Asia. In 1992  Japanese investment in Asia totalled $60 billion, up from $19.5  billion in 1985. During the same period, direct American  investment in Asia rose just 22 percent. In the 5 years between  1987 and 1990, direct Japanese investment in the four  "mini-dragons" and ASEAN amounted to $26.8 billion, 360 percent  more than American investment, catapulting Japan into the top  investor spot ahead of other economic powers. (ZHUJUN MONTHLY,  February 1992) Japanese investment in Asia has been an economic  boon to Japan. According to statistics from the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Asian subsidiaries  of Japanese corporations earned 487 billion Japanese yen in  profits in the fiscal year between April 1991 and March 1992. In  contrast, their counterparts in Europe only earned Y6.6 billion  in profits and those in North America suffered losses totalling  Y208 billion. (THE ECONOMIST 24 April 1993)    C. Government Development Aid Focusing On Asia    Government development aid is an essential component of  Japan's foreign policy as well as a major tool of its foreign  strategy. The "Outline of Government Development Aid," adopted  by the Japanese cabinet on 30 June 1992, states explicitly, "The  Asian region has intimate historical, geographical, political,  and economic ties with Japan... Japan should continue to make  Asia the focus of its assistance program." (WAIJIAO YUEKAN  MONTHLY, March 1993) In 1991 the Japanese government dispensed  $11 billion in development aid, which placed it ahead of the  United States ($9.4 billion) as the world's top aid giver. Over  60 percent of Japan's development aid goes to Asia, with the  five nations of Indonesia, China, Thailand, the Philippines, and  Bangladesh alone accounting for almost half of all Japanese aid.  ("Economic Cooperation: Current Status and Problems," 1992  edition)    In addition, Japan is also playing an increasingly prominent  role in debt payments, trade settlement, and foreign exchange  reserves in Asia.    4) Creating "East Asia Economic Sphere"    In the late 1980's, Japan's economic position in Asia  consolidated, the cabinet introduced the idea of an "East Asian  economic sphere" to include 10 nations and regions, namely the  four "mini-dragons," ASEAN, and Japan itself. For starters,  Japan began shifting those of its industries that had become  uncompetitive to the four "mini-dragons" in a big way. Later  Japan and the four "mini-dragons" started exporting capital to  ASEAN, setting in motion a chain-like adjustment of the region's  industrial structure. The upshot is an international division of  labor in which Japan specializes in the production of high-tech  products; the four "mini-dragons," conventional technical goods  and durable consumer goods; and ASEAN, labor-intensive products.  In the process, both the four "mini-dragons" and ASEAN have  become more dependent on Japan.    Building on its success with the "East Asian economic  sphere," Japan pushed hard for and devoted itself to putting  together a "Sea of Japan economic sphere." What the "Sea of  Japan economic sphere" mainly entails is Japan-led economic  cooperation, with Russia contributing resources, Japan and South  Korea contributing funds and technology, and China and North  Korea contributing manpower. Japan envisions the "Sea of Japan  economic sphere" as a bridge linking Northeast Asia with  Southeast Asia, thus steering the entire East Asia into its  development orbit.    5) Conducting a Vigorous Asian Diplomacy    As it became a stronger and stronger economic power in Asia,  Japan applied itself to achieving a political standing  commensurate with its economic might. Its Asian foreign policy,  hitherto dominated by economic diplomacy, now became  increasingly "politicized." Japan has taken a string of major  steps in the political, military, and diplomatic arenas in Asia  in recent years. Among them are these three: 1) Participated  actively in resolving the Cambodian issue. No sooner did the  Japanese Diet pass the "UN Peacekeeping Activities and  Cooperation Law" in April 1992 than Japan sent self-defense  troops to take part in the UN peacekeeping effort in Cambodia.  Moreover, Japan hosted two conferences aimed at solving the  Cambodian issue. Japan's enthusiasm on behalf on the Cambodian  problem was driven by its desire to gain a louder voice in Asian  affairs. 2) The Japanese emperor visited China. Emperor Akihito  and Empress Michiko visited China between 23 and 28 October  1992, becoming the first Japanese monarch ever to visit China in  the ancient history of Chinese-Japanese relations. That the  Japanese emperor put off visiting the United States and instead  made China the destination of his first trip overseas after  ascending the throne was much discussed in the international  media. A "Shishi She" commentary noted, "The basic government  position is that a stable Sino-Japanese relationship is the  cornerstone of stability in the Pacific.... That consideration  underpins Japan's active Asian diplomacy, using Sino-Japanese  relations as its axis." (29 October 1992) 3) Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa visited ASEAN. In January 1993 Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa visited Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and  Brunei, all ASEAN members. While in Bangkok, he delivered a  speech entitled "The New Asian Pacific Era and Cooperation  between Japan and ASEAN" enunciating what has been delivered the  "Miyazawa Doctrine." In his speech he laid down Japan's four  basic policies in Asia: First, actively participate in the  creation of a "security dialogue mechanism" in the Asian Pacific  area; second, help open up the Asian Pacific area economically;  third, exert itself on behalf of democracy, human rights, and  environmentalism; and fourth, engage in cooperation with the  three nations in Indochina. His speech painted in broad strokes  the basic features of Japanese policy in Asia.    2. The Focuses of Japan's Return to Asia    Japan's strategic decision to return to Asia was prompted by  more than considerations that have to do with geography,  history, and its relations with the various Asian nations. There  are other major concerns:    1) Achieving its goal of becoming a political power.    In a speech in his native Qunma Prefecture in July 1982,  Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki said, "Japan must seek a louder  voice in world politics, raising its stature not only as an  economic power but also as a political power." ("Diplomacy Green  Paper," 1983 edition) That was the first time a Japanese prime  minister unequivocally articulated the goal of making Japan a  "political power." Successive administrations led by the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] after Suzuki adopted this slogan as an  official policy. More recently, Xiaoze Yilang [1420 3419 0001  6745], an official of the New Life Party, put forward a  "conventional nation" theory in his book A Plan for  Transforming Japan While he did not use terms like  "political power," he came up with a number of new suggestions  such as amending the constitution, changing the nature and  strategy of the self-defense forces, participating in UN  peace-keeping activities, pushing for a permanent seat on the  Security Council, and building a new world order side by side  with the United States and Europe. Xiaoze Yilang's "conventional  nation" theory, it may be said, goes one step beyond the  "political power" theory advanced by the LDP. We can thus see  that no matter which party or faction is in power, Japan will  not deviate from its strategic objective of achieving the status  of "political power." They all seek to make Japan part of a  tri-polar world, exercising world leadership along with the  United States and Europe.    To achieve the above strategic objectives, Japan attaches  the  utmost importance to finding its own base and establishing its  own economic sphere. Where, then, is Japan's base? What about  its economic sphere? These questions were answered by Gangqi  Jiuyan [1481 1505 0036 1750], a former Japanese ambassador to  Thailand, who said Japan must return to Asia and create a "super  Asian sphere." In his 1992 article entitled "The New Strategy of  Striving to Create a Super Sphere in Asia," he wrote that "it is  in Asia that Japan will find its diplomatic future, a stage  where it can maneuver.... In any case, except for Asia, one  cannot find another arena at the moment which offers a bright  future for Japanese diplomacy; there is no other oasis."  ("Dumai" monthly, August 1992) Gangqi Jiuyan's words provide a  graphic explanation of the motives behind Japan's return to Asia  and the actions it has taken toward that purpose.    2) Explosive Economic Growth in Asia    According to World Bank reports, East Asian economies grew  8.5 percent in the 1980's, up from 6.6 percent in the 1970's.  Since 1990, amid the backdrop of global recession, Asia  continued to lead the world in economic growth. The  International Monetary Fund estimates that economic growth in  the ten major Asian nations and regions other than Japan may  have reached 8.75 percent in 1993 and will average 7.1 percent  in 1994, far higher than the growth rate of the Western  economies. Even more spectacular is the expansion of the Chinese  economy in recent years, growing 7 percent in 1991, 12.8 percent  in 1992, and 14 percent in the first half of 1993. One United  States magazine has calculated that the Asian economy now  accounts for 25 percent of the global economy, up from 4 percent  30 years ago, and may well make up one-third by the year 2000.  (FORTUNE MAGAZINE, November 1993)    All eyes are on the booming Asian economy. To some developed  nations, Asia is the most dynamic, most promising place in the  world. Both the United States and Germany are scrambling to  shift their attention to Asia, pinning their hopes for ending  the economic recession at home on the Asian market. As for  Japan, a resource-poor nation with a small domestic market which  is mired in a deep recession, Asia resembles a huge magnet. It  is thought that only by returning to Asia and relying on Asia  can it secure a firm foothold in the world.    3) Disintegration of the Soviet Union; Escalating  Japan-United States Conflicts    During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union  were allies which fought Japan side by side. Later, during the  Cold War, the United States allied itself with Japan against the  Soviet Union. With the end of the Cold War, the relations among  these three countries are still evolving, but already ther are  signs pointing to new changes. On a political level, the United  States and Russia, former adversaries, have now become partners.  In 1992, President Bush of the United States and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin signed the "Camp David Declaration" and  "Washington Charter," proclaiming a friendly partnership between  the two nations. After taking office, President Clinton has been  even more energetic in improving diplomatic relations with  Russia, supporting the Yeltsin regime politically and offering  Russia economic aid. Due to the improvement in United  States-Russian relations, the practical function of the United  States-Japanese alliance has diminished significantly.    Economically speaking, the United States and Japan,  erstwhile  allies, have now become rivals. After he took office, Clinton  has shifted priority from the military to the economy, making  economic strength the key to national security. Revitalizing the  U.S. economy and eliminating the huge deficit in its trade with  Japan have become urgent and major issues in United  States-Japanese relations. Not only does Clinton relentlessly  push for a more expansive yen, but he has also demanded that  Japan open up its market, even specifying the market share that  U.S. goods should have in Japan as a means of trimming Japan's  trade surplus. As United States and Russia nudge closer to each  other and Japan-United States trade friction escalates, Japan  has no choice but to return to Asia to find its destiny there.    4) Regionalization and Rise of Economic Blocs    The trends in the world economy today are regionalization  and  the formation of economic blocs. The EC unified its market on 1  January 1993. A number of countries in north Europe are lobbying  hard to join the EC. In late 1992, the three countries in North  America--the United States, Canada, and Mexico--signed the North  American Free Trade Act [NAFTA] and the United States has also  talked about extending the free trade zone in North America to  Latin America. Although both EC and NAFTA have publicly declared  they would comply with the principle of free trade and keep  their markets open, the fact of the matter is that they have  acted in a way that is clearly discriminatory and exclusionary.    Moved by protectionism and regionalism, Japan increased its  investment in and stepped up trade with countries in North  America and West Europe, intensifying its penetration of those  markets. On the other hand, it has been hard at work trying to  consolidate its political and economic position in Asia. Japan  considers East Asia its "courtyard" in the same way that the  United States views Latin America as its "backyard." Japan works  assiduously to bring about its East Asian economic sphere in  order to position itself favorably in its economic war with the  United States and Europe.    3. Japan's Return to Asia: Future Prospects    Japan is set on returning to Asia, but not too rapidly. The  road back to Asia is fraught with many an obstacle, both  domestic and international, and Japan must overcome them by  moving cautiously and diplomatically. Reviewing the words and  deeds of both the Japanese Government and people in private  life, we see that these are the major strategies Japan pursues  to engineer its return to Asia:    1) Cooperate and Compete With the United States    In devising its Asian policy, the United States goes tit for  tat with Japan, not ceding any ground at all. During the Bush  Administration, Secretary of State Baker countered Japan's "wild  goose" model, a strategy aimed at dominating the Asian economy,  with his "fan-shaped" model. Under the latter model, Asia was  perceived as an open fan; America would be the axis and the  United States-Japan alliance would be the backbone, supplemented  by America's alliances with South Korea, Australia, and ASEAN  and embracing the entire Asian Pacific region. The purpose was  to ensure America's economic interests and dominance in the  region. After he assumed office, Clinton has shifted the U.S.  strategic focus from the Atlantic to the Pacific as a means of  revitalizing the U.S. economy. Assistant Secretary of State  Winston Lord has said, "No other region is more important to the  United States to date than East Asia and the Pacific region."  (United States Information Agency, 9 June 1993) In July 1993,  Clinton called for a "new Pacific community" during his visit to  Japan and South Korea and proposed upgrading the Asian Pacific  Economic Cooperation [APEC] ministerial conference scheduled to  be held in Seattle under the auspices of the United States to an  informal conference attended by heads of government. It was the  goal of the United States to link APEC with NAFTA, thus  preserving and expanding America's political and economic  interests in the Asian Pacific region.    There are three schools of thought in Japan's academic  circles regarding how best to counter U.S. Asian strategy. One  group advocates globalism. It would like Japan to continue to  uphold the postwar multilateral free and equal trade system, do  its best to bring the Uruguay round of talks under GATT to  fruition, and eschew exclusivity in Asian Pacific economic  cooperation. The second school of thought prefers a  confrontational approach: build up an independent free trade  zone in Asia (or just East Asia) as a counterweight to EC and  NAFTA. Most people want to make some sort of a compromise  between these two positions. They believe that while the  conflicts between Japan and the United States in Asia have  intensified, Japan cannot afford direct confrontation with the  latter because it still cannot do without it. Economically, the  United States is indispensable, absorbing one-third of Japan's  exports. Militarily, Japan still depends on America's security  shield. Politically, Japan needs backing from the United States  if it is to become a political power. Therefore they advocate a  middle course: cooperate as well as compete with Washington.  Specifically, the so-called "middle course" means maintaining  the free trade system, adhering to GATT, making concessions to  regionalism to some extent, expanding its economic muscle in  Asia, and holding fast to its alliance with the United States.  For Japan, this amounts to tightrope diplomacy, which no doubt  is most challenging. In the absence of any better course,  however, Japan has no choice but to go ahead with this balancing  act gingerly.    2) Resolve Problems Inherited From History    It has been 48 years since the end of World War II. However,  the war's instigator, Japan, has not been forgiven by the people  of the various Asian nations. To remove the mistrust of its  neighbors in Asia and create an image of peace and friendship,  Japan's new prime minister, Morihito Hosokawa, broke with the  ambiguous attitude of his predecessors and forthrightly admitted  as soon as he took office that the "previous war was a war of  aggression. We believe the war was a mistake." (Japan GONGTONG  SHE 10 August 1993) "We again express our profound  self-reflection and apologies for the intolerable suffering and  pain our past aggression and colonial rule had caused many  people." He also declared, "We should take our proper role as a  member of the Asian Pacific community seriously and do our best  to contribute to the peace and prosperity of this region."  (SHISHI SHE 23 August 1993)    The constructive attitude of the new administration toward  solving the problems left over from history no doubt was meant  to set the stage for Japan's return to Asia. While Hosokawa's  remarks and apologies were widely welcome by Japan's neighbors,  the response was cautious. In his government report on 23  August, Hosokawa retreated from the term "war of aggression"  uttered days earlier during his press conference, now  downgrading it to "aggressive conduct." In addition, members of  his coalition government worshipped at the Yasukuni shrine. All  this made many Asian nations skeptical whether Japan can really  face up to the historical problems honestly.    3) Use Economics and Technology To Dominate Asia    History may be a barrier on Japan's road back to Asia, but  economics and technology give Japan an overwhelming edge. Japan  can participate in and dominate the Asian economy through trade,  direct investment, development aid, technology transfer,  personnel exchange, and other economic and technological  activities. Professor Rujianglung of Meiji University in Japan  sums up this approach as "winning without victory." In other  words, the leadership in the Asian Pacific area that Japan is  pursuing is a kind of imperceptible victory. He also refers to  it as "different hegemony," a new-concept hegemony distinct from  conventional hegemony which is backed by economic,  technological, and financial forces. (WENYI ChUNQIU MONTHLY July  1990) The "winning without victory" approach, which can achieve  goals that military power failed to achieve in the past, no  doubt will serve Japan well as it seeks to return to Asia,  However, if Japan relies solely on its technical and economic  superiority and fails to handle its relations with the various  Asian nations correctly and truly bring about joint development  on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, this superiority  will not last long.    4) Rely on International Organizations and International  Conferences    First and foremost, Japan looks to the United Nations. Right  now Japan is working hard to gain a permanent seat on the  Security Council, a crucial step on Japan's road toward becoming  a political power. Japan has put forward a series of proposals  about reforming the United Nations to its General Assembly  during the current session and has repeatedly indicated its  readiness to participate in UN peace-keeping efforts. All these  moves are intended to prepare public opinion for Japan's return  to Asia.    Next, Japan relies on the G-7 summit, the meeting of the  heads of government of seven Western powers, of which Japan is  the only Asian member. At the G-7 meeting in Tokyo in 1993,  Japan served as Asia's spokesman. When President Suharto of  Indonesia visited Japan, the host nation agreed to forward his  opinions to the G-7 meeting.    Then there is the APEC ministerial conference. To prepare  for  the informal meeting of APEC leaders in Seattle, Japan held  consultations with South Korea and ASEAN to coordinate their  views. It was also slated to present the report "Ideas for  Economic Cooperation in the Asian Pacific Region for The Year  2000" at the conference. Among the ten topics covered by the  report were the promotion of trade and investment within the  region, the strengthening of its industrial base, and  environmental issues. The thrust of the report was the  furthering of liberalization in regional trade and investment.  Clearly, Japan's goal is to use APEC to counter the  protectionism of NAFTA and consolidate Japan's economic position  in Asia.    Furthermore, Japan has gained a stronger voice at the annual  enlarged meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers.    We should note that most of the international organizations  mentioned above operate under American leadership and Japan's  influence is limited. Whether or not Japan will achieve all its  objectives depends on how things turn out.    A historical issue that has confronted Japan ever since  Meiji  Modernization is this: Should Japan exist as part of Asia or  part of the United States and Europe? Or should it compromise  between the two? If we look back at over a century of diplomatic  history, we see that by and large Japan has allied itself with  Europe and the Western camp. In 1885, Fuze Yuji, a bourgeois  thinker, put forward his "out of Asia" theory in SHISHI XINBAO.  By that he meant Japan should join the camp of the European  powers and the United States and invade Asia (primarily China).  The Japanese Government embraced his theory and launched one war  of aggression after another, culminating in the country's utter  defeat and surrender in the Pacific War. After the war, Japan  allied itself with America and toed the Washington line in  opposition to China. Only after Nixon visited China in 1972 did  Japan normalize diplomatic relations with China.    After a century, Japan's foreign strategy finally shifted  from "leaving Asia to join Europe" to "detaching itself from the  United States to rejoin Asia." This is the third time Japan  changed national direction after the Meiji Restoration and its  defeat in the war. This strategic shift naturally has attracted  profound concern in nations around the world, particularly its  neighbors in Asia. These nations hope that Japan will learn a  lesson from history and totally put aside its contempt for Asia.  They hope that Japan will not become a military power or  intervene in the domestic affairs of another country and that it  will use its formidable economic power and advanced science and  technology to cooperate with the nations of Asia on an equal  basis, building a prosperous Asia together. Will Japan, on its  way back to Asia, do what other Asian nations hope that it will  do? That remains to be seen.</p>

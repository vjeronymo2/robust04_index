			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Drop in negative equity reported THE NUMBER of homeowners whose property is worth less than their mortgage loan fell a further 5 per cent in the third quarter of the year to 1.36m, the Woolwich Building Society said yesterday. The number of mortgage holders with 'negative equity' as a result of property price falls since 1990 is now 24 per cent down on the start of the year. Some 68,000 families were released from negative equity in the third quarter. The fall in negative equity, as a result of a 0.5 per cent rise in house prices, was smaller than in the second quarter, when a 3.2 per cent price rise reduced the number of negative equity households by 350,000 from its 1.8m peak. The largest fall in the third quarter was in the south-east, where the number of households with negative equity dropped by 5.2 per cent from 404,000 to 383,000. However, the number of households with negative equity rose in the West Midlands, the north of England and Wales. There was a 24 per cent rise in the north, with 21,000 households affected compared with 17,000 in the second quarter. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, called on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to alter mortgage interest tax relief in the Budget next month because the recovery in the housing market was as yet 'far too fragile'.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BET BET's management claims to have nursed the company back to corporate health, but it is a shadow of its former self. Since 1990 shareholders' funds have halved to Pounds 260m despite a Pounds 200m rescue rights issue, the dividend has fallen by 75 per cent and turnover has fallen by a quarter. Profits have more than halved, notwithstanding last year's recovery. Admittedly the group has net cash on its balance sheet and the focus has sharpened to four basic business areas. But Mr John Clark, the chief executive who masterminded the surgery, must now put some flesh back on the bones. It will be a daunting task. Though BET has managed 14.7 per cent margins in its textile cleaning services, margins on other activities such as contract cleaning and security personnel services are slow to recover. Plant hire, which consumes more than its fair share of capital, looks a particular drag. Nor does the newly sanitised balance sheet offer much scope for funding acquisitions with cash, especially since capital spending is at last being permitted to increase. Given the problems it faced at the outset, the management may be forgiven for some sense of satisfaction. Yet its optimism must be tempered by the board's decision to defer increasing a dividend which is more than twice covered.</p>

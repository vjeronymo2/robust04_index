			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 48 COMPLETES FIRST COURSE;  </P> <P> COLLEGE ATHLETICS: GRADUATION NEARS FOR FIRST CLASS OF BASKETBALL PLAYERS  IMPACTED BY THE NCAA'S ACADEMIC STATUTE FOR FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY.  </P> <P> It has become as much a part of the vernacular of college basketball as  3-pointer, small forward and "call a t.o., baby."  </P> <P> The only problem is Prop 48 has become a negative description of a high school  athlete who has failed to meet the academic minimums for immediate collegiate  eligibility.  </P> <P> The current senior class is the first to have entered college with Prop 48 in  effect.  </P> <P> Three of its most prominent members -- Michigan's Rumeal Robinson and Terry  Mills and St. John's Jayson Williams -- were among the first to be declared  ineligible because of it.  </P> <P> It has changed their lives forever and to listen the them, it has changed them  for the better.  </P> <P> "Every student is different as every person is different," Robinson said before  a recent practice. "Certain student-athletes can't adjust to playing big-time  sports at a big-time college. Certain players can adjust. I can only speak for  myself. I like what I did that freshman year although I didn't like what  initially happened to me. I liked that I didn't play and that I got a chance to  socialize with the students.  </P> <P> "It is kind of a shame that players often don't get a chance to do that because  what is college except a place to come and meet different people and those  people that you meet might be your friends or the people you socialize with the  rest of your life."  </P> <P> Robinson has come as far as you can from the situation which faced him as an  incoming freshman. Forget the national championship he won with two free throws  in overtime. Robinson has overcome a learning disability to graduate on time  with a grade point index right at the 'B' level.  </P> <P> Still, his name is usually preceded by Prop 48, even though it no longer  applies.  </P> <P> "I didn't let it bother me but it did become a label," Robinson said. "When you  sat down and watched TV, the announcer said 'Prop 48 student' or whatever. You  should identify a student-athlete by what he's doing now not what he's done in  the past. It's kind of sad it does happen but it does and you just have to move  on."  </P> <P> All three will move on to the NBA next season having played just three years of  college basketball having been penalized a year of competition by Prop 48.  </P> <P> "They should look at the rule a little more," said Mills, who will leave  Michigan with a championship ring and a degree with a few more credits this  summer. "I feel we should be allowed to practice. That wouldn't take away from  what they're trying to accomplish. It gives you more motivation when you sit  out; 'Hey, I'm going to get my degree."'  </P> <P> Mills wants others to know how hard that year away from the basketball court  will be.  </P> <P> "I try to talk to high school players and tell them to be prepared either way  it goes," he said. "Mainly, I focus on that if you don't make it, don't give  up. That's something I didn't do. I know I'm capable of doing whatever I put my  mind to. I tell them 'Just work harder in school so you don't have to sit out  but if you do be prepared for it."  </P> <P> Williams was crushed when he found out there wouldn't be any basketball for him  as a freshman.  </P> <P> "You never think it's going to happen to you and when it does and you're just  17, you're immature about it," Williams said before a recent game. "I thought  they put the rule in just for me, just to keep me out. Right now, I think it  was for the best because it showed St. John's or any other school could have  and will carry on without Jayson Williams. It helped me put things in  perspective for school."  </P> <P> Williams, who said he will graduate on time, was limited to 14 games this  season by injury. He broke his right foot in preseason practice and refractured  it against Georgetown.  </P> <P> Like Robinson and Mills, he is in favor of keeping academic minimums but with  some changes.  </P> <P> "I don't think they should count so much on one test," Williams said referring  to the mandatory 700 score on the SAT or 15 on the ACT. "I think you should be  judged more on your school grades as well. Some people are bad test takers just  like some people are bad foul shooters. It's not that you're dumb."  </P> <P> Robinson and Mills had each other in the year they sat out.  </P> <P> "There were times I really needed Rumeal," Mills said. "If I acted like it was  all too much, he would get on me and ask if I wanted people to always think I  was a loser. I don't want to think of that year without him."  </P> <P> Williams was by himself but was still near his family in New York.  </P> <P> "I didn't even want to go to the games," he said. "It's like no one even knows  who you are. I didn't feel like a part of the program. But Mark Jackson and  (assistant) Ron Rutledge stuck with me."  </P> <P> Williams in turn became the big brother to Billy Singleton and Chuck Sproling  who followed him in at St. John's in the same academic predicament.  </P> <P> "I told them the most important thing is don't get down and don't worry about  your physical condition," he said. "I told them to keep up their spirit. It's  lonely. We took them out after games and made them a part of our family as they  did with me."  </P> <P> Robinson, Mills and Williams, all of whom have been listed as possible NBA  lottery picks, said they were against making all freshman ineligible.  </P> <P> "It depends on what their priorities are," Robinson said. "If they have tunnel  vision for the NBA only let them play. If they don't, though, give them a  chance to get used to college. Basketball is now a year-long thing and it's  hard to get the credits in to stay eligible and there's a lot of pressure on  you when you're not eligible.  </P> <P> "You have a tendency to rush things and you never play your best when you're  rushing. Me, I didn't have to rush; I enjoyed it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DOVE' AND PEACOCKS RULS TV'S ROOST;  </P> <P> MCANALLY, MATLIN AND 'RAISIN' AT TOP OF THE EMMY OMISSIONS  </P> <P> Debating the prime-time Emmy nominations is half the fun of hearing about them.  Maybe all the fun.  </P> <P> So here is wisdom from the mount.  </P> <P> It's encouraging to see so many TV achievements -- from ABC's landmark "War and  Remembrance" to Robert Duvall's aging cowboy in the blockbuster CBS miniseries  "Lonesome Dove" to the writing of ABC's "The Wonder Years" -- get the  recognition they deserve.  </P> <P> And it's interesting to contemplate the meaning of other inclusions: Do  information-series nominations for the syndicated "A Current Affair" and the  newly racy "Entertainment Tonight" confer legitimization on tabloid TV?  </P> <P> Yet stunning omissions abound, beginning with the exclusion of Ray McAnally  from the category honoring lead actors in a miniseries or special.  </P> <P> If either Duvall or John Gielgud ("War and Remembrance") aren't victorious  here, it will be the biggest upset since David and Goliath. Each was  outstanding.  </P> <P> However, McAnally, who died recently, arguably gave the season's best single  performance as the charming, manipulative rogue of a father in the PBS  novelization of John Le Carre's "A Perfect Spy."  </P> <P> Nominees James Woods (ABC's "Bill W."), Ben Kingsley (HBO's "Murderers Among  Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story") and Duvall's "Lonesome Dove" co-star Tommy Lee  Jones also were very good, but not in a class with McAnally. An Emmy nomination  would have been a nice way to celebrate him posthumously.  </P> <P> Moreover, a case could also be made in this category for Danny Glover, who got  a supporting actor nomination for his routine work in "Lonesome Dove," but  nothing for his overpowering performance in the "American Playhouse" production  of "Raisin in the Sun" on PBS.  </P> <P> Other notable omissions:  </P> <P>  -- Marlee Matlin as the troubled young mother of "A Bridge to Silence" on CBS;  Esther Rolle, so memorable as the mother in "A Raisin in the Sun," and Oprah  Winfrey, whose excellent work as a suffering matriarch was easily the best part  of ABC's largely undistinguished "The Women of Brewster Place." The show got  nominated; Winfrey didn't.  </P> <P> Jane Seymour ("War and Remembrance") is the class of this category for lead  actresses in a miniseries or special. But a strong case could be made for  Matlin, Rolle and Winfrey over of NBC's "Roe vs. Wade" nominees Amy Madigan and  Holly Hunter and "Lonesome Dove" nominees Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston (who  had a supporting, not a lead, role).  </P> <P>  -- "A Raisin in the Sun," scintillating by any criteria, except those used by  the Emmy nominators, whose choices for best drama or comedy special include the  infinitely less deserving, but better publicized "My Name Is Bill W." and "Roe  vs. Wade."  </P> <P>  -- HBO's satirical "Tanner '88," which fittingly earned a director's  nomination for Robert Altman, but was slighted in the dramatic series category  despite providing TV's most biting and incisive political commentary of the  presidential campaign. Brilliantly written by "Doonesbury" creator Garry  Trudeau (who was also ignored in the nominations), it was bold and exiting TV.  </P> <P> HBO's other fine entry in this category, "Vietnam War Story," also went  unnominated, as did two of its highly worthy entries in the miniseries  category: "A Dangerous Life" was an utterly captivating account of the the  Marcoses' fall from power in the Philippines, and "Glory, Glory" was a musical  satire of dishonest TV evangelists that was appealingly outrageous -- perhaps  too outrageous for the Emmy crowd.  </P> <P>  -- "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," as charmingly enigmatic on cable's  Lifetime network as it was on NBC, and "It's Garry Shandling's Show," the  Showtime comedy (with repeats on Fox) that remains as daring and funny as  anything on TV. Yes, no comedy deserves an Emmy over last year's winner from  ABC, the wondrous "Wonder Years," which is also nominated this year. But none  of the other nominees -- "Cheers" and "The Golden Girls" from NBC and  "Designing Women" and newcomer "Murphy Brown" from CBS -- is as consistently  funny and full of creative jolts as the Shandling show.  </P> <P>  -- Ken Olin and Mel Harris of ABC's "thirtysomething," overlooked in the  category citing drama series leads. They're the very heart of this special  show.  </P></p>

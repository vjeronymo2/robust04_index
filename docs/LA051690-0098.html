			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DIE HARD 2': BITING THE BULLET OVER BUDGET;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE DELAYED OPENING OF BRUCE WILLIS' ACTION-THRILLER ADDS FUEL TO TALK  OF A $20-MILLION COST OVERRUN.  </P> <P> Twentieth Century Fox appears to have further underscored Hollywood talk that  "Die Hard 2" may be as much as $20 million over its $40 million production  budget. Fox officials vehemently deny huge overruns, but this week they delayed  release of the Bruce Willis thriller from June to July.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Fox said the producers of "Die Hard 2" would deliver the final  version of the film June 17, making the advertised opening of June 22 nearly  impossible to meet. As a result, the movie will have a July 2 premiere in Los  Angeles, followed by a national release on the July 4th weekend.  </P> <P> Saying "We're saving the best for last" and "We're waiting for a whole weekend  of Friday nights," Fox officials attempted to put the best face on the delay.  They have pointed out that June is already loaded with a potential blockbuster  movie a week.  </P> <P> For weeks, the sequel to the 1988 box-office hit, set in a snowed-in,  terrorist-overrun Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, has been  the subject of speculation about runaway production costs. The original "Die  Hard," set in a Los Angeles high rise, cost $28 million to make and turned into  an $80 million hit.  </P> <P> But at a lavish 35th birthday bowling party for Willis, rumors of a  studio-ordered audit to see how producer Joel Silver handled production funds  and other stories have clouded the prospects for this summer's sequel.  </P> <P> The huge cost overrun stories are all bunk, according to Fox production  president Roger Birnbaum. He declined to say how much "Die Hard 2" might have  gone over its reported $40 million budget, but he dismissed reports that the  cost of the film may have soared past the $60 million mark.  </P> <P> "The only thing I will tell you is that (the movie) went five days over  budget," Birnbaum told The Times. "That was due to unfortunate circumstances.  Quite honestly, I don't know where all these rumors emanate from."  </P> <P> Birnbaum pointed to similar over-budget rumors surrounding Carolco's "Total  Recall" and two Paramount films, "Days of Thunder" and "Godfather III," adding,  "I wouldn't be surprised if rival companies put these stories out to take the  heat off themselves."  </P> <P> The "unfortunate circumstances" that put "Die Hard 2" over budget was the  weather, not Willis' birthday party or Silver's alleged profligacy, according  to a Fox spokeswoman. "Our problems were either finding actual snow or a  temperature in which we could make snow," she said. "We needed a blanket as far  as the eye could see for the exterior of the airport."  </P> <P> Pre-production, special effects and initial sound-stage filming began last  December in Los Angeles, but then the Larry &amp; Charles Gordon/Joel Silver  production hit the road. First stop in January was normally snowed-in Stapleton  International Airport in Denver, where Deputy Director of Aviation Richard  Boulware said the cast and crew spent an estimated $50,000 a day for three and  a half weeks, just on per-diem expenses such as hotels, car rentals and food.  </P> <P> "We loved having them here," said Boulware.  </P> <P> But the snow melted early and the "Die Hard 2" odyssey moved farther north to  Moses Lake, Wash. By March, the snow melted again and the crew packed up and  headed to Alpena, Mich. Spring caught up with them there as well and they had  to go even farther north to Kincheloe Air Force Base near Kinross, Mich., in  April.  </P> <P> Willis's salary is a factor in the higher cost of producing "Die Hard 2," but  not a significant one. He is earning $7.5 million for reprising his role as a  police officer who single-handedly devastates terrorists -- $2.5 million more  than he got the original.  </P> <P> "Die Hard" also transformed Willis from a TV-comedy star into a full-fledged  action-thriller movie star, rivaling Sylvester Stallone and Arnold  Schwarzenegger at the box office. The original shooting budget climbed  proportionately, from $28 million for "Die Hard" to a reported $40 million for  "Die Hard 2."  </P> <P> When he turned 35 on March 19, Willis was feted with a Los Angeles bash that  had a bowling alley theme. In homage to the actor's blue collar New Jersey  persona, "Bruno," bowling shirts for each guest were flown to New York,  personalized with their names at a company that specializes in embroidering  bowling shirts, and messengered back to each guest who had to wear them to the  door as their invitation, according to sources.  </P> <P> Eddie Murphy, who came to the party in street clothes, supposedly had one of  his gofers carry his shirt to the door on a hanger in order to get inside.  </P> <P> But the cost of the party did not come out of "Die Hard 2" production funds,  according to the Fox spokeswoman.  </P> <P> And Silver, who has a longstanding reputation as a free-spending producer, did  not permanently alienate Fox executives by going over budget, according to  Birnbaum. He has just completed two other movies for Fox -- "The Adventures of  Ford Fairlane" and "Predator II" -- and is under contract to produce two more.  </P> <P> "Let me clarify all of this very, very simply: at the premiere of 'Die Hard 2,'  you will see Joel Silver sitting next to me," said Birnbaum. "We audit every  single movie that we make during and in post-production. That's what we're  doing with 'Die Hard 2,' just like every other movie. There's no special movie  audit going on."  </P> <P> Fox's current strategy calls for a "Die Hard 2"opening on 2,000 screens.  Several exhibitors are expected to use more expensive, but higher quality 70  millimeter prints to maximize the impact of the opening.  </P> <P> But postponing a promised blockbuster can have disastrous results, as the  studio learned last summer when it repeatedly put off release of "The Abyss"  until August, after the momentum from such early summer entries as Warner's  "Batman" and Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" had already eaten up the  lion's share of America's summer movie dollars.  </P></p>

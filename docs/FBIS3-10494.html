			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "The United States </F> Sidesteps GATT"]    [Text] We believed that the approval of the Uruguay Round  of the GATT meant the threat of a international trade war, like  the one of the 1930's which internationalized the recession, had  been averted. Suddenly, however, by what may be deducted from  the attitude of -- paradoxically -- the country that most  struggled for the approval of the Uruguay Round -- that is, the  United States -- we can see that the danger has not been  averted. The Democrat U.S. Government, under the pretext of  liquidating protectionist practices of other countries, refuses  to solve its conflicts within the World Trade Organization  [Organizacao Mundial de Comercio -- OMC] which in April will  replace the GATT by will of its members who want to upgrade the  authority of this international organization.    We knew that a Democrat administration would strengthen U.S.  protectionism. Lacking the force of Reagan, President Bush  could not withstand the Democrats in Congress and ended by  imposing trade retaliations on countries like Japan, India, and  Brazil. Until now the so-called Super 301 has never been used,  but Washington will now apply it against Japan, which refuses to  remove some of its subtle barriers against the entrance of  foreign products.    The U.S. reaction follows President Clinton's decision not  to  open further to international trade, especially in the field of  services. The determining factor, however, was the publication  of trade statistics by regions in 1993. In 1993 the United  States, whose exports increased 3.7 percent and whose imports  increased 8.9 percent, registered a trade balance deficit of  $115.777 billion -- some 37 percent up on the previous year. It  must be pointed out that this was not the biggest negative trade  balance ever registered in the United States -- it reached $152  billion in 1987, a year when Washington needed support from its  allies against the USSR and when it was attempting to avoid a  trade war that could weaken the unity of the anti-Communist  bloc. The most serious issue is that with $59.3182 billion,  Japan was responsible in 1993 for 51.2 percent of the total  international trade deficit of the United States. It is  interesting to point out that after Japan comes the People's  Republic of China, the future "big" trader of Asia, with whom  the U.S. has a trade deficit of $22.7677 billion.    Washington wants the government in Tokyo to give up a type  of  protectionism that goes against international law. We recently  observed an example of Japanese behavior when the Japanese  Government opened the borders to foreign rice. No one in the  country bought the imported rice even though it was cheaper,  thus demonstrating the Japanese people's great solidarity with  its farmers. This does not mean, however, that arguments about  what can be considered abuses (which certainly exist) within  Japanese protectionism, should be avoided at the OMC. By  attempting to assume a bilateral trade policy, the United States  is -- without recognizing that an international organization and  not its president should decide if a trade partner is violating  the GATT norms or its spirit -- encouraging a conflict. This  kind of isolation on Washington's behalf is a kind of  imperialism which may not be very well received by other  countries. It must also be pointed out that the United States  has been arrogant toward Japan, which is experiencing a  difficult moment both in the economic and political field. The  best results cannot be attained through bilateral negotiations  based on power positions, especially regarding Japan which is  now becoming aware of its political force...    We must add that not all U.S. citizens support the  application of sanctions against Japan which, after Canada, is  the second biggest client of the United States -- buying from it  $47 billion worth of goods and which is also its second supplier  -- by which it has been of service to the United Sates by  forcing it to increase productivity. It must be pointed out  that the sanctions announced will not produce an immediate  effect: The first list of products that will be object of  sanctions will be published by the end of September. Only then  will the Tokyo government react by imposing restrictions on U.S.  products -- probably agricultural products, which will harm the  U.S. primary production sector, which has great political  influence. The issue is that taking into consideration the  sanctions that will be effective as of October, the White House  decision causes an immediate effect: It has brought down the  prices of some agricultural products, among them soybean. It is  possible that in the long term Brazil may gain from a trade war  between these two large world powers, but we will be affected by  the drop in some prices. We will then be able to see that only  an international trade peace will be good for everyone in the  long run.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 May -- If Russia makes its proposals  about an international conference on security and the  nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula more concrete, North  Korea is ready to study them and reply in concrete terms, Son  Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Moscow, told journalists today.    He said: "The attractive side of the Russian initiative is  the desire to resolve the nuclear issue in the region through  talks, without the use of force and threats, based on the  principle of equal rights." According to the ambassador, only  methods based on the use of force and pressure have been applied  to his country so far. The United States, the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and certain states have frequently  used such methods. Son Song-pil said: Regrettably, Russia has  also been unable to refrain from using them, and for a while it  toed the line of the U.S. Administration with respect to the  issue of nuclear safety on the Korean peninsula. This has  caused relations between North Korea and the Russian Federation  to cool in the past few years. Now some aspects of their  bilateral relations have started to inspire hope, and the  present Russian initiative reflects this hope.    Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the  obstacles preventing the nuclear problem from being solved  immediately, Son Song-pil spoke primarily about the IAEA's  so-called "double standards" when estimating the level of  nuclear activity of different states. He said conclusive proof  of this is the 70 kg of plutonium that is unaccounted in  Tokaymura, Japan, and only recently made public. Given the  well-developed and efficient system of monitoring the security  of nuclear installations by this international organization,  this incident can only signify that the IAEA is "far from being  impartial." The North Korean ambassador does not rule out that  the plutonium found in Japan is "merely the tip of the iceberg"  and that thorough and unbiased inspection could lead to the  discovery of other serious Japanese violations of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

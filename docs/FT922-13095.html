			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Russian cabinet resignation unsettles bourses NEWS that the Russian government had offered its resignation to President Boris Yeltsin unsettled bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT began the session quietly, unperturbed by the overnight fall in Tokyo. The only element to excite dealers in early trading was press speculation that Daimler-Benz planned to increase its 1991 dividend. The group declined to comment, saying that a decision would be made later this month. The DAX index closed down 8.33 at 1,727.74 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 0.16 to 706.83. Turnover fell to DM4.8bn from DM6.2bn. Analysts said that Daimler was likely to increase its dividend, in the region of DM1 to DM13, but that this would be coupled with a rights issue. Daimler climbed to an intraday high of DM785.50 before the news from Russia sent the market broadly lower. Its shares closed just DM1.20 higher at DM779.20. Other leading stocks affected by the Russian developments included Deutsche Bank which has one of the biggest exposures to debt from the former Soviet Union. It closed down DM6.50 at DM709. Siemens was DM4.2 lower at DM679.60, Schering declined DM8.20 to DM800 and Volkswagen was off DM5.3 at DM369. PARIS fell back, the CAC-40 index losing 10.79 to 1,963.27 in light turnover of FFr1.62bn. Euro Disney fell FFr1 to FFr139.90 in active trading of 775,550 shares after the opening of the theme park was hindered by a rail strike. A block of 100,000 shares was put through the market but the identity of the parties involved was hidden by a recent change in the trading system. Alcatel was also active, falling FFr6 to FFr619 on profit-taking after last week's gains. There were concerns that Alcatel's earnings would not grow as strongly in 1992 compared with 1991. After the close, Alcatel said it planned to sell 2m existing shares via American Depositary Shares in the US. LVMH dropped FFr116 to FFr4,373 on reports that the company had confirmed in a letter to shareholders that sales of its luxury items in Japan were slowing down. STOCKHOLM closed lower in thin trading. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 5.2 to 970.4 as turnover declined to SKr339m from SKr568m. Shares in Gota soared after its majority owner Trygg-Hansa unveiled a full bid for the banking group through a share swap. Gota A jumped SKr6 to SKr23 but Trygg-Hansa B free fell SKr11 to SKr79 as investors worried about the financial implications of Trygg-Hansa's involvement in Gota. The construction and real estate index jumped 3.3 per cent on the weekend news that the government plans to scrap a tax on commercial real estate. MILAN closed little changed in dull trading. The Comit index eased 0.37 to 500.79 in turnover estimated at less than Friday's L89bn. Most monthly call options, which expired yesterday, were not taken up. Smaller stocks were active. Gemina, whose RCS Editore publishing unit reported a lower-than-expected L50bn in 1991 net profit, lost L10 to L1,165 while the engineering group Focchi rose L30 to L12,920 on news of a 50 per cent rise in net profit to L21.1bn. ZURICH fell in late trading. The SMI index closed down 7.4 at 1,840.6. The chemical sector was active: Roche certificates declined SFr30 to SFr3,110, while Ciba-Geigy, which reported a 17 per cent increase in first quarter group sales, saw its bearers lose SFr30 to SFr3,430 and certificates fall SFr10 to SFr3,450. Banks were generally stronger: CS Holding bearers gained SFr45 to SFr1,990 and Union Bank added SFr100 to SFr3,890. AMSTERDAM was barely changed in the absence of corporate news. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.2 at 124.9 in turnover of Fl 426.6m. An earthquake yesterday, which caused some devastation in northern Europe, had its epicentre near DSM's main chemical plant. However, the group reported that there was no damage to the facility and the shares rose 10 cents to Fl 107.60. VNU, which said sales in 1992 so far showed little improvement from the previous year, slipped 80 cents to Fl 81.10. After the market closed it said that it was planning an expansion programme. Other publishers were strong: Elsevier gained 70 cents to Fl 114.20 and Wolters Kluwer was up 80 cents at Fl 71.70. Unilever was active with analysts noting a switch out of its UK shares into the Dutch paper. It closed Fl 2 ahead at Fl 184.20. MADRID fell back after its strong performance last Friday. The general index fell 2.17 to 247.67 in low turnover of some Pta7bn. March inflation figures, in line with expectations, had little effect on sentiment. Union Fenosa was actively traded, falling Pta11 to Pta557, after a negative analysts meeting last week. BRUSSELS closed flat in quiet trading. The Bel-20 index closed up 0.14 to 1,178.91 in low turnover of BFr550m. ISTANBUL rose on selective buying. The index rose 41.86 to 4,027.64.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1156.64  1157.00  1156.33  1153.19  1153.13  1152.12  1152.81  1153.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1157.99    Day's Low  1151.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Apr 10     Apr 9     Apr 8     Apr 7     Apr 6 1155.74   1140.98   1143.45   1156.82   1155.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs. -- British Trade Minister  Richard Needham has clarified that his statement that pressure  would grow on his government to retaliate if Malaysia continued  with its policy of not awarding new government contracts to  British firms, had been taken out of context.    Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Dr. Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan  said today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] received a  letter from Needham last week.    Dr. Abdullah said the letter was discussed at yesterday's  cabinet meeting and Needham's reasons were noted.    "It was decided that no further action is necessary on the  matter as the reasons given were deemed sufficient," he added.    Dr. Abdullah said Needham had made it clear that his  statement to REUTER News Agency was not meant as a threat to  Malaysia.    Asked if Needham had explained in what context he gave the  statement, Abdullah said he did not elaborate this in his letter.    "The reasons given are sufficient... there is no possibility  of retaliation (by Britain) and we will accept that (the  reasons)," he told reporters after receiving a RM [Malaysian  ringgit] 10,000 cheque for the Barisan Bertindak Bosnia [Bosnian  Action Front] Fund from Rotary Club District 330 at his ministry.    Asked if Wisma Putra had sought the clarification from  Needham, Dr. Abdullah said no. He said Needham sent the letter  on his own accord after reading in the newspapers about  Malaysia's dissatisfaction over his statement. [passage omitted]</p>

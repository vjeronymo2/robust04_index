			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Portugal's Marconi up 11% after six months COMPANHIA Portuguesa Radio Marconi, the Portuguese government-controlled telecoms group, yesterday reported net profits for the first half of 1993 of Esc2bn (Dollars 12.2m), an 11 per cent increase compared with the same period last year. Operating profits grew by 14 per cent to Esc3.7bn and cash flow increased by 12 per cent to Esc4.5bn. Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, Marconi's president, said the results showed a strengthening in the company's financial structure in terms of solidity, autonomy and solvency. He also reported a significant reduction in indebtedness and an important increase in capital to Esc43bn, compared with Esc37bn the previous year. Portugal's telecoms sector is undergoing an important restructuring, with two wholly state-owned companies and Marconi, which is 49 per cent privately-owned, being brought together under a single government-controlled holding company, Comunicacoes Nacionais. Marconi has a licence to operate intercontinental calls to and from Portugal, but is also bidding for a concession to operate inter-European services. The company forecasts that net profits will exceed Esc4bn for all of 1993, an increase of 15 per cent on 1992.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (2): Local networks grow in number - Powerful PCs have enabled the shift of networking away from the mainframe THE NUMBER of UK organisations with at least one local area network of personal computers has almost doubled in the past three years. At the same time the use of these networks has started to become more sophisticated, with systems normally run on a central mainframe computer being moved out to the users in their own departments. But this growth in numbers and use is creating technical and human problems which threaten the full exploitation of networked PCs at the very time when advances in technology are opening new potential for users. More than 85 per cent of organisations of all sizes in the UK now have at least one local area network, according to market research specialist Romtec. The average network has 46 computers connected, although 57 per cent have fewer than 20. This does not mean, however, that most of PCs are networked: in 85 per cent of organisations, only 55 per cent of computers are connected. The users expect this to increase to 65 per cent by the end of 1993, representing a growth rate of 18 per cent. This growth has been led by users rather than computing people and has taken off with the emergence of increasingly powerful PCs, according to Mr Graeme Allan, technical marketing manager at network market leader Novell. 'In the early days, users who had discovered PCs hit on the idea of networking for greater efficiency,' Mr Allan says. 'People were wandering around with a floppy disc looking for a spare printer or a piece of applications software: networking enabled them to share printers and files. 'Since then network technology has become more mature and PCs have become more powerful with the move to the Intel 386 processor and now 486, so people have started looking beyond office automation applications to business-critical systems. 'Meanwhile the computing department has recognised the growth of local networks and has got involved in this movement, under pressure from the users, and is even giving it some encouragement now.' This last point is supported by the Romtec survey, which shows that in 80 per cent of organisations, local area networks are now specified centrally. Romtec manager Mr Jon Whiteley says this reflects the fact that organisations now see that network growth has corporate implications. However, the more advanced users are now at a crossroads. The original network applications software such as electronic mail packages are well established and are evolving into so-called groupware products which help people work together on documents or spreadsheets. But moving traditional critical business systems from the central mainframe to a PC network 'seems like a colossal leap in the dark', as Novell's Mr Allan puts it. These systems have generally been developed by an organisation's computing department or are based on mainframe software packages. 'The idea of downsizing from the mainframe is still mostly just talk,' Mr Allan says. 'The reality is that there is still a huge vested interest in the traditional approach among IT departments, big computer manufacturers and major consultancies. In addition there is a shortage of expertise to carry it out.' The skills shortage has been highlighted by several recent studies as one of the biggest obstacles to the full exploitation of networked computers. A survey by Andersen Consulting on the related issue of client-server systems, in which applications are split across networks, concludes that 'the skills shortage is the key issue'. This was mentioned by over 90 per cent of organisations planning to move in this direction. A study by the West London Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) reveals an urgent need to retrain traditional computing people to fill the skills gaps in the fields of networking, user support and the Unix operating system. Unix runs on computers of all sizes and is thus seen as having an important role in the move from mainframes to PC networks. 'The definitions of analysts, programmers, operators and users are becoming less clear cut,' says Mr Phil Blackburn, chief executive of the West London TEC. 'Traditional IT staff are being made redundant, yet companies seeking the new skills are already having recruitment problems. 'We have the classic scenario for another round of IT skills shortages once the recession lifts.' The fact that network growth has been led by users rather than computing departments has created the related problem of network management. The lack of central control was highlighted in a UK survey last year by network specialist 3Com and Benchmark Research. It showed that 82 per cent of companies used three or more data communication protocols, 59 per cent used two or more types of wiring and 31 per cent used two or more network designs. A complementary study by The Networking Centre suggested that users were being especially affected by breakdowns in devices for connecting networks together. 'Recessionary pressures and skills shortages are restricting the levels of support staff and as a result local area network managers are fire-fighting problems every day,' says Mr Stuart Morrice, managing director of Peapod Distribution, which recently launched a network management system. Mr Morrice adds: 'The growth of local area networks is more limited by the availability of staff to support them than by the suppliers' ability to deliver the products.' The staffing issue will be met by training or poaching, as every computing specialist shortage has been dealt with in the past. Meanwhile products will become more reliable. Already PC manufacturers are building network facilities into their products, while the companies which supply them with microprocessors are putting network links in at chip level. As the problems are resolved, the future looks bright for organisations which move business systems out to local networks. Royal International, part of Royal Insurance, switched its accounting and electronic mail from a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer to a PC network. It moved from an accounting package costing Pounds 120,000 a year to one bought for around Pounds 5,000 and from an electronic mail package costing Pounds 200,000 to a Pounds 2,000 package bought off the shelf. EBC Amro Asset Management has saved over Pounds 250,000 a year by moving from DEC Vax minicomputers to a company-wide PC network which now runs all its systems. 'With networked PCs, the hardware is cheaper, the software is cheaper, the maintenance is cheaper and as a result the financial risk is less,' says Mr Allan at Novell. 'In addition, systems can go live more quickly, which can mean extra benefits for the business.'</p>

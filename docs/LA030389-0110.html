			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PARTY CHIEF, 2 MINE OFFICIALS ARRESTED IN YUGOSLAV ETHNIC UNREST  </P> <P> Police Thursday began arresting organizers of ethnic Albanian unrest in  Yugoslavia's turbulent Kosovo Province, and the official news agency Tanjug  said that former Kosovo party chief Azem Vlasi was among those held.  </P> <P> The arrests followed widespread protests against planned constitutional changes  that ethnic Albanians fear will limit their autonomy in the southern province,  bordering Albania.  </P> <P> Tanjug said that Vlasi, one of the most popular Communist Party leaders among  ethnic Albanians in the province, was arrested along with two directors of a  mine whose workers' strike helped set off the wave of protests.  </P> <P> The eight-day strike led the Yugoslav State Presidency to clamp a partial state  of emergency on the province. Troops and tanks were deployed in Kosovo for the  first time since ethnic Albanian riots in 1981.  </P></p>

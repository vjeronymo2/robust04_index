			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: ANI makes ADollars 191m bid for tube maker Australian National Industries, the Sydney-based engineering company which owns the Aurora group in the UK, yesterday announced a ADollars 191m (USDollars 140.4m) bid for Palmer Tube Mills, another quoted Australian company which manufactures steel tube and pipe sections. ANI is offering either all-paper terms, or a mixture of shares and cash. Shareholders can choose 72 ANI shares for every 100 Palmer shares held, or 64 ANI shares and ADollars 13 cash for every 100 shares. In order to meet the potential cash element of the bid, ANI is to place 32m new shares at ADollars 1.80 each, raising ADollars 57m. Explaining the reasons for the bid, ANI said that the two companies had 'compatible' interests in the steel production area, and that ANI's resources and technical know-how could enhance Palmer's performance. However, Palmer responded coolly, saying that ANI had raised the bid possibility in recent discussions between the two companies. 'Now that the offer has been made, the board will give consideration to it,' the company said. Palmer's operations are split between Australia and the US, and it employs 250 and 290 people in the two countries respectively. Its sales in the nine months to the end of March were ADollars 235.7m, compared with ANI's ADollars 1.1bn for the same period. Palmer's main plants are in Brisbane, Melbourne and Chicago.</p>

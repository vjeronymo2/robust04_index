			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Shakin' off those Wall Street Blues: Philip Coggan on the prospects in the world's main equity markets in 1995 Asked to assess the outlook for the world's equity markets in 1995, fund managers quickly resort to football-speak. 'It will be a year of two halves' is the common refrain. In the first six months, many expect worries about rising interest rates to keep equity markets depressed. But in the second half of the year, they believe the prospects of a US economic slowdown will allow interest rates to start falling again, and share prices to rally. Like defeated footballers, many fund managers and traders will be feeling sick as parrots after 1994. Whereas in 1993 it was almost ludicrously easy to make money, this year it has been simple to lose it. In most countries, it would have been better for investors to leave their money in the bank and take the year off. Of the 24 main markets, only eight have seen their stock market indices rise, in local currency terms, since the start of 1994. The most substantial, Japan, is a market to which many fund managers have been underexposed. In bonds, the story has been worse. Of 21 leading government bond markets, only Austria produced a positive total return in local currency terms in 1994, according to Kemper Investment Management. The event that set the tone for the year was the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates in February. While the US bond market had already been weakening in the face of the accelerating pace of US economic growth, the initial rise in rates was a watershed. It signalled the end of a period when it had been possible to 'play the curve' - borrow at a low short-term rate and invest in long-term bonds, for a higher income and the chance of capital growth. Those who had speculated on such gains lost heavily this year, with forced sales of bonds exacerbating the price falls. Equities were particularly vulnerable to a decline in bonds, since a fall in bond prices results in a rise in bond yields. With the return on cash deposits also rising, the attractions of highly-priced equities dwindled. In the US, while the narrow Dow Jones Industrial Average has held up reasonably well, the Russell 2000 index of smaller capitalisation stocks fell 4.5 per cent over the year. The rest of the world's financial markets found it impossible to escape the backwash of US interest rate changes. In part, this was because US investors had been significant buyers of other countries' equities and bonds in 1993 and moved money back home as US interest rates rose this year. But in Europe, market weakness also reflected a fundamental change in the outlook for economic growth. At the start of the year, most investors expected European interest rates to continue to fall as governments attempted to stimulate their economies. By the end of the first quarter, however, it was clear that European economies were recovering faster than expected and accordingly, the prospect of interest rate cuts was diluted. Throw in the fear of renewed inflation, aided and abetted by a surge in commodity prices, and the result was a bad year for bonds and shares. When looking at the prospects for 1995, the most important issue for investors remains the outlook for the US economy and interest rates. According to Mr Maxwell Ward, the manager of Scottish Mortgage, an international investment trust, 'the key factor is how much further US monetary tightening has to run'. He expects the Fed funds rate, currently 5.5 per cent, to reach 7 per cent. The difficult trick that the equity markets hope the Fed will pull off is to increase interest rates sufficiently to head off inflationary pressures without pushing the US economy into recession. The difficulty of pulling this off means that investors may start the year in cautious mood. 'Uncertainty about how much the Fed will raise rates means that it will be appropriate to have plenty of cash,' says Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of equity strategy at Goldman Sachs in London. 'If the US economy does start to slow down in the second and third quarters of 1995, and bonds started to rally, then I would want to buy equities,' says Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court. 'But I want to see the economy slow down first.' This could be bad news for a recent enthusiasm of international investors - the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Higher interest rates and slower economic growth in the US would hit the exports of both areas, and their growth prospects. More important in the short term, it might cause an outflow of US mutual funds from the both regions, particularly after Mexico's recent troubles highlighted the risks of emerging markets. Since most emerging markets are small and illiquid, a sudden rush of sellers could lead to a sharp fall in share prices. Asian markets have already shown signs of suffering at the end of 1994. Emerging markets enthusiasts, however, are still confident about the long-term prospects. 'Developing countries will grow at 5-6 per cent this year, twice the rate of the major economies,' says Mr Peter Scott, chief executive of emerging markets specialist Beta Funds. 'While 1995 may see an initial period of continued weakness, there is a secular trend among institutions to increase the proportion of their portfolios in emerging markets. A lot of investors are still very light in the area.' For the UK and Europe, the early part of the year may simply be a struggle to escape from the shadow of the US. 'The UK market looks pretty good value but can't shake off the Wall Street blues,' says Mr Christopher Tracey, a pensions fund investment director at Robert Fleming. But Mr Tracey thinks that European corporate earnings will be growing faster than in any big market except Japan by the end of 1995. That should support share prices even though interest rates are at, or close to, their bottom in Europe. Japan remains an enigma for many western investors. In terms of price-earnings ratios, Japanese shares look horrendously expensive by outside standards, but foreign investors have been more enthusiastic about the market this year than Japanese institutions. Economic recovery in 1995 should boost corporate earnings but investors remain cautious, rather than bullish. The most important role that Tokyo might play in 1995 would be if Japanese investors resumed the substantial purchases of overseas securities that so boosted international markets in the 1980s. With all the world's big economies recovering, the fundamental issue for investors is whether the economic recovery will lead to an inflationary bust later in the 1990s, or whether there is the chance of a sustained period of non-inflationary growth. For much of this year, equity markets have been buffeted by the twin forces of rising interest rates and higher corporate earnings. The former have been dominant in 1994, perhaps because investors could not see where the peak of the interest rate cycle would occur. But the bulls hope that by the end of 1995, the picture will be clearer. 'My view is that people will take on board that this is a long, strong economic upswing in which the peak is several years away, rather than being visible at the end of 1995,' says Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at broker James Capel. In the meantime, investors could face a bumpy ride.</p>

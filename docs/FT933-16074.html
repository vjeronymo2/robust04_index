			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Technology: Lure of the city lights - Smith &amp; Nephew defied convention by relocating R&amp;D from country home to science park THE conventional wisdom 30 years ago was that researchers worked best in peaceful isolation. Many UK companies tried to give them peace and quiet by converting country houses in idyllic landscapes into laboratories. In the 1990s, however, isolation is out and interaction is in. According to today's ideas, the perfect setting for a corporate laboratory is a university science park, where researchers can collaborate easily with fellow scientists. Most companies stay put in their existing country house laboratories, however, imagining that a move would be prohibitively expensive and disruptive. The exception is Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group, which has just transferred its research centre from Gilston Park, an early Victorian mansion in rural Essex, to a new building on York Science Park. S&amp;N did, of course, incur substantial direct costs - at least Pounds 2.5m for moving all its staff and equipment to York plus Pounds 5.5m for fitting out the research centre. (The 83,000 sq ft building was put up by York Science Park, a joint venture between the university and P&amp;O Developments, and rented as a shell to S&amp;N) The indirect costs of disrupted projects and distracted staff are not known. 'We have different views on how much dislocation there has been but I would say it amounted to six months of research on average,' says Alan Suggett, R&amp;D director. 'We took some of our best scientists to be (relocation) project co-ordinators - which they did very well - but we underestimated the amount of time involved. If we did it again, I would probably have used more external consultants, so as to preserve our research programme.' The total costs of the move, then, can be put at a minimum of Pounds 10m, or twice the annual budget of the group research centre. (S&amp;N spent a total of Pounds 25m on R&amp;D last year - Pounds 5m centrally and the remainder by its operating businesses.) But John Robinson, chief executive, says the benefits far outweigh the costs. 'This was not just about moving to a building designed for the next century rather than the last. It is about creating a new research culture.' The reasons for leaving Gilston Park included: poor communications; out-of-date facilities that could not be improved easily because of planning constraints; security problems on the country house estate; and, above all, the difficulty of recruiting and retaining good staff. The attractions of York are: the university's highly rated research, which is not exploited by other science-based companies; the city's excellent international image; and proximity to S&amp;N's main UK manufacturing base in Hull. At the same time, S&amp;N took advantage of the move both to refocus research more closely on its fast-growing core businesses and to introduce a new management structure. The refocusing involves running down research in consumer products (such as the well-known Elastoplast brand in the UK) and in pharmaceuticals - an activity in which S&amp;N cannot hope to compete with the large drug companies. The funds are being redirected to five strategic growth areas: orthopaedic implants; wound management products (such as hospital dressings and gels); minimally invasive surgery; casting and bandaging; and surgeons' gloves. In place of the previous management hierarchy, the new research centre has a flat 'matrix' structure. Line managers are responsible for departments such as chemical and biological sciences, while programme managers handle specific projects like wound management research. 'We've also introduced a 'scientific ladder' which enables senior scientists to have equal status to managers, in terms of benefits and so on,' says Gareth Lloyd-Jones, research director. Strategic control of R&amp;D rests with a Research Steering Group chaired by the chief executive, which meets twice a year. Its members include Suggett, Lloyd-Jones and the heads of the operating businesses. Outside input comes from a Scientific Advisory Panel of five university researchers chaired by Nancy Lane, a Cambridge University biologist who is a non-executive director of S&amp;N. It also meets twice a year, to provide an independent review of the corporate research programme. 'We act as an auditing body, giving the company feedback on the areas where it is weak and on the strengths that it can build on,' she says. One scientist familiar with S&amp;N research says: 'They have some catching up to do; they're still a bit sleepy Essex villagey.' But Lane thinks that comment is unfair: 'The work is good now and will become excellent in the new laboratory.' The building in York was designed to be as flexible as possible, in contrast to Gilston Park. 'We decided to make the labs interchangeable, so that we could change the research programme overnight if we had to,' says Suggett. The main laboratories are arranged on two floors, on both sides of a wide central aisle - the 'write-up area' where the scientists have their desks and can sit with colleagues to gossip or discuss work. There is a separate product development lab where engineers build pilot manufacturing lines. S&amp;N employed 220 people at Gilston Park and has 180 working at York; the job cuts were among support services such as maintenance, security and cleaning. About 90 people made the move from Essex last autumn - only 18 months after the relocation was announced - 'and fortunately these included almost all of our key professional staff,' Suggett says. That left another 90 to be recruited locally, mainly technicians and secretarial staff. 'What we were asking people to do was, in effect, to make a personal commitment to Smith &amp; Nephew for the next few years,' he adds. Although family commitments prevented some people moving, others took the opportunity to leave S&amp;N because they had been uncertain about their long-term future with the company. Jack Fennimore, the S&amp;N chief technologist who managed the relocation project, says external advisers had predicted that only 50 to 60 would agree to move. Robinson had said he would be happy if 80 moved. Lane, who also chairs the UK government committee on women in science, was particularly pleased that S&amp;N lost very few of its female researchers. Several of them persuaded their partners to move with them to York. Interaction between S&amp;N and the university - a prime reason for the company's move - is already getting under way, says Tony Robards, professor of applied biology. Informal early exchanges between the academic and corporate labs are leading to more formal arrangements, such as sharing of expensive equipment and placements of S&amp;N staff to train with academic specialists. Joint research projects under the government's Link and Teaching Company schemes are also in prospect. Will other companies follow S&amp;N's example? One candidate might be Johnson Matthey, the UK metals group, which has a similar-sized research centre based at Blount's Court, a country house in rural Oxfordshire. 'We have talked about moving many times; the subject comes up every two years or so but we just don't think it's worth the cost and effort,' says George McGuire, Johnson Matthey research director. 'We like it here.' But Robinson is convinced that for S&amp;N the move was worth the effort. 'It has given a new excitement about R&amp;D to the whole group worldwide.'</p>

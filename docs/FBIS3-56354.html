That position was  stated at a news conference on Friday by the heads of the  delegations, Algis Gricius, the Lithuanian parliamentary foreign  affairs committee's deputy chairman, and Tunne Kelam, deputy  chairman of the Estonian state assembly.    The stand on the issue was coordinated in Vilnius at a  meeting of the Baltic delegations to the Council of Europe. The  Lithuanian and Estonian position was supported by Latvia, which  so far has guest status at the Council of Europe.    The Baltic states' key argument against Russia's admission  to  the Council of Europe is the presence of its troops on Latvian  and Estonian territories. Besides, the heads of the Lithuanian  and Estonian delegations said Russia must first solve its own  problems and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other  states. We are waiting for Russia, as the successor to the  rights of the Soviet Union, to make an official statement on the  1940 occupation of the Baltic states, Algis Gricius said.    The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe is due  to  open in Strasbourg on 24 January.</p>

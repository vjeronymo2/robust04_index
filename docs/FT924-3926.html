			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Intel wins microchip dispute with AMD SHARES in Intel surged yesterday, while Advanced Micro Devices declined sharply, following a court ruling denying AMD the right to use Intel microprocessor software after a long-running copyright dispute between the two US chipmakers. The ruling protects Intel's exclusive rights to the microcode for its microprocessors, which are widely used in personal computers. Microcode is the internal software that controls the functions of a microprocessor chip. AMD had claimed rights to use Intel's microcode under the terms of a 1976 licensing agreement between the two companies. A federal judge ruled late on Wednesday, however, that the prior agreement did not give AMD the right to distribute products containing Intel microcode. 'We are very pleased with the decision,' said Mr F. Thomas Dunlap, Intel vice-president and general counsel. AMD had been expected to launch, within the next few weeks, its own version of Intel's 486 microprocessor, one of Intel's most lucrative products, a chip used in the latest generation of personal computers. However, AMD said it was well advanced with development of its own 486 microcode. 'As a prudent company, we had a contingency plan,' said Mr W. J. Sanders, AMD chairman and chief executive. AMD plans to launch its 486 chip in about six months. But the company said it was planning an immediate appeal of the ruling and might also seek a new trial in the microcode copyright dispute. 'No verdict and no ruling can change the underlying truth. In 1976 I negotiated in good faith and AMD paid a substantial sum for the rights that AMD is now being denied. There is no acceptable alternative for us other than to continue to fight for justice,' Mr Sanders said. AMD's appeals cannot, however, make up for lost time in the fast-paced microprocessor market. The court ruling has cost it an opportunity to compete with Intel when sales of 486 microprocessors are peaking. Personal computer manufacturers are already developing products based upon Intel's next generation microprocessor, called Pentium, which follows the 486. Although Intel dominates the market for PC microprocessors, AMD has made big inroads over the past year. AMD stressed the latest ruling would have no effect on its shipments of 386 chips. Last year an arbitrator awarded AMD a 'permanent, royalty-free non-exclusive, non-transferable worldwide right' to Intel's 386 technology as a remedy for Intel's breach of a technology exchange agreement between the two companies. Intel is appealing the arbitrator's decision. Intel was up Dollars 2 at Dollars 75 1/4 at mid-day yesterday, while AMD's stock was trading at Dollars 15 3/4 , down from a Wednesday close of Dollars 17 7/8 .</p>

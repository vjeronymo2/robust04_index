			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Japan loosens up on sale of third world loans - How Tokyo's banks are under pressure to lift their capital ratios Banks in Europe and the US have been selling third world loan assets for years, while Japanese banks have held tight. Now with their capital ratios under pressure from the Basle international guidelines and with a discreet nod from the Ministry of Finance, the portfolios are loosening. Japanese banks are now important sellers of third world loans. Japanese bankers play down the scale of their selling so far, saying there is no uniform strategy, but admit that they are likely to step it up. Mr Ryuichi Kato, chairman of the Nagoya-based Tokai Bank, said: 'In the future, Japanese banks will have to think about the possible selling of their credits like the European and American banks have done.' One motivation, he said, would be to keep up capital ratios in the face of the international bank capital guidelines. Significant disposals of assets by Japanese banks emerged towards the close of the last financial year, which ended March 31. Selling assets for cash is one way to improve capital ratios. In addition, selling the bonds created by Mexico's restructuring deal with banks last March enabled them to emerge with a profit, because the bonds have risen sharply from the depressed price at which they were first booked last year. Officials from the Ministry of Finance say they do not mind Japanese banks selling. There is one proviso, they say: that it doesn't produce a disorderly market or damage the financial standing of the country concerned. This appears to confirm Japanese bankers' assessments that the scale of selling will be modest. Japanese banks are the second-largest national group of bank creditors to the less-developed countries (LDCs), after the US banks. For much of the 1980s, Japanese banks were new lenders in most of Latin America's debt restructurings, while other banks - the so-called 'free-riders' - stayed out. Their share of the outstanding debt also grew as other banks reduced their portfolios, while the Japanese banks stood fast. More recently though, the importance of the LDC debt issue to the banks has begun to decline. The decline of the dollar against the yen has meant that in yen terms, the absolute size of the dollar-denominated third world loan portfolios has declined. Third world loans now make up only 1 per cent of the loans of Japanese city, trust and long-term credit banks. At the end of last September, the face value of third world loans held by these banks amounted to Y3,528.4bn - nearly Dollars 26bn at current exchange rates - of which the city banks accounted for the largest share: Y2,508bn. This compares with the estimated Dollars 60bn held by US banks and to the estimated stock of bank debt of roughly Dollars 400bn. But not all the fall is due to yen appreciation. Since 1987 Japanese banks have transferred assets to a Cayman Island shell company, called the Japanese Bankers' Association. For example, some bonds Venezuelan debt restructurings were transferred into the company, in which Japanese banks own preferred shares based on the proportion of the assets that they transfer into it. However, Japanese bankers are uncomfortable about disclosing how much they have transferred into the JBA, which they say does not itself sell assets into the secondary market. The reason for their discomfort is that it smacks of special tax concessions available to banks and not to other types of companies. The debt has also been reduced by the so-called 'Brady' restructurings in which concessional bonds were exchanged for loans. All Japanese bank lenders to Mexico and Venezuela swapped their old loans for concessional bonds. The reason that the Japanese banks have been slower than most in selling their loans, apart from their MoF-encouraged innate conservatism, was the low level of reserves they had built up. Building a cushion against loan losses is expensive for Japanese banks. To do it they must sell assets from their hidden reserves - usually shares held in Japanese companies. In doing so, they must pay tax on their gains at one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. (For most restructuring countries, only 1 per cent is transferable into reserves tax free. For a minority, such as Nicaragua or Peru, which have not made any payments to banks for three years or more, a 50 per cent tax free reserve is allowed - in effect a write-off.) This means the banks have to sell shares worth more than double the reserve they establish. However, there is a tax break when a write-off is taken - so the banks' reserves effectively cover more than double the actual reserve level. The Ministry of Finance for the first time this year has allowed banks to set the reserve level they wish against their third world loans, lifting a ceiling of 25 per cent that was previously in place. Most banks have moved reserves to the 30 per cent level - an effective ratio of 70 per cent because of the tax rules. Tokai Bank's Mr Kato points out that the banks have asked the government to allow tax-free reserving for all restructuring countries. The problem for banks, according to other senior Japanese bankers, is that while, under current tax rules, the banks are satisfactorily reserved against loss of capital, they are not reserved against the build up of interest arrears. 'So we have to suffer for the portion of interest that is not paid,' said one. Sales of assets and the prospect for more are important enough for a dozen or so of the largest secondary market dealers in LDC assets to have set up some kind of operation in Tokyo. So far, only one Japanese bank has established its own debt trading group: the Bank of Tokyo, whose operation is based in New York. Other Japanese banks are said to have considered similar moves but have not yet taken the plunge. Debt traders in Tokyo say they do not envisage Tokyo developing soon into the two-way market now evident in London and New York. When Japanese banks are in the market, they are sellers - although strong competition among traders in Tokyo is such that the prices they obtain are generally keen. There is an irony in the emergence of Japanese bank selling of LDC assets. The banks are ridding themselves of their Latin American assets just as investment institutions worldwide - and even the cautious Japanese - are beginning to develop a selective interest in the region, at least in those parts of it now enjoying economic success, such as Chile and Mexico.  -------------------------------------------------------- Developing Country Debt Exposure (September 1990)  --------------------------------------------------------                           Debt    % of                           Ybn    loans  -------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Tokyo             502.2  3.94 Hokkaido Takushoku         75.9  1.12 Saitama                    74.7  0.84 Fuji                      247    0.83 Tokai                     209.8  1.08 Dai-Ichi Kangyo           247.4  0.75 Mitsubishi                224.8  0.76 Sumitomo                  299.4  0.99 Sanwa                     237.9  0.79 Mitsui Taiyo Kobe         263.9  0.71 Kyowa                      61.8  0.61 Daiwa                      61.2  0.65 Total                   2,506    0.97  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

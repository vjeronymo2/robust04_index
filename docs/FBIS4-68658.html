Kirpichnikov: "Russian Community in </F> Azerbaijan Backs Geydar Aliyev and Sergey Baburin"]    [Text]  <H5>  Russian All-People's Union holds press conference </H5>   A press conference was held by deputies, members of the  unregistered group "Russian Way", who visited Azerbaijan at the  invitation of the Russian community (ROA) [Russian Community of  Azerbaijan]. As a result a cooperation agreement was signed  yesterday in the presence of the journalists between the ROA and  Sergey Baburin's Russian All-People's Union.    Then the organizers spoke about their visit. They were  received by Geydar Aliyev and other ROA leaders at the cultural  center of the Slavs of Azerbaijan and visited camps for refugees  liberated from Armenians, as well as settlements, and villages  populated by ethnic Russians. According to the deputies the  Russian community supports the policy of Mr. Aliyev and shares  the burden of war around Nagornyy Karabakh, surprised at the  indifference of the Russian side. The deputies condemned action  taken by Armenia in seizing foreign lands, the non-fulfillment  of UN resolutions, and the pro-Armenian SMI [mass media], they  were also shocked by the state of the refugees and the inaction  of Russia and underscored the loss of trust in it by Azerbajanis  and local Russians. Mention was also made of recruiting points  for mercenaries on Russian soil and of the fact that peace  proposals of the Russian Federation with regard to the  withdrawal of the warring sides from the line of contact are  unacceptable to Azerbaijan. The only area in which the positions  of Geydar Aliyev, the Russian All-People's Union, and the  Russian community of Azerbaijan diverged pertained to the  question of the revival of USSR: in calling for closer  unification with Russia Mr. Aliyev stands for independence and  the CIS; Mr. Baburin hints that first there is the CIS, and then  it is not too far to something like the Soviet Union; the ROA  chief, Mr. Zabelin, without being specific, speaks of unity.    That divergence leads to certain banalities. The problem of  ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan, naturally, exists. Also a no less  natural fact is that they support the leadership of the warring  country in everything: this is not the Baltic region for  you--expression of discontent may cost you some blood. And the  desire to receive cultural support, and whenever possible  materials support, from the historical homeland is totally  understandable. The viewpoint of the Azerbaijan leadership with  regard to its own actions and the Russian community, in  connection with these actions, is equally predictable. Finally,  the Russian Federation leadership must unconditionally support  Russian communities on both sides of the front, both  politically, socially and culturally. It must also take into  account the attitude of the leadership of the warring sides  toward the given communities, without even mentioning the  historical, "geopolitical," simple political, and simple ethnic  evaluations of what is taking place.    It is simpler for the Russian All-People's Union and it may  allow itself to grumble publicly without being particularly  concerned with objectivity. Let us say, a comparison of the  situation in Nagornyy Karabakh and in Bosnia is completely  proper: in both places it is terrible, in both places Christians  are persecuting Muslims, and states not recognized by anyone  were proclaimed on officially foreign land. Mr. Baburin,  however, who visited both regions, in one case supports "the  victim," and in the other "the aggressor." In order to preserve  some semblance of logic he promulgates the version of a world  conspiracy whose goal is to throw firewood on the fire of  conflicts from any side just so that it would burn hotter--a  world conspiracy understandably supported by world forces of  Evil. With that thesis Baburin places himself not only in the  position of a person with whom it is improper to argue, but,  taking into account the literary legacy of Zhirinovskiy, in a  position that is already occupied by a more astute predecessor.    Unfortunately, international "Baburinism" is peculiar to  many  leading and rank-and-file deputies of the State Duma who have  visited one of the warring sides in some conflict, and it is  completely normal if the deputation from the lower chamber  dispatched to the Balkans will return with a similar world  outlook. Even that, however, is not the entire problem. The  reliance of truly suffering Russian-speaking, Serbian-speaking  people, and others on political fringes or warring dilettantes  leads not only to exaggerated self-appraisal and inadequate  acts, but also, inevitably, to a cautious attitude by persons  conducting real Russian policy.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading GROWING nervousness over the prospects for the London equity market was underscored yesterday by an unusually large and exceptionally bearish deal in traded options, writes Peter John. Marketmakers said Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, had bought 8,000 FT-SE puts - options to sell the market at a fixed time and price - expiring in February at 2,800. Morgan Stanley was unavailable for comment but traders were surprised at the size of the deal, which boosted turnover in FT-SE 100 options to 27,700 and overall options turnover to 51,800. The trade was seen as insurance against the underlying market falling below the expiry price, and thus represented a view that the FT-SE 100 could slide 300 points over the next three months. A further indicator of unease came from the level of implied volatility, the measure of uncertainty within the market, which rose by two percentage points to 17 per cent. Among stock options, Hanson was the most active performer as one house rolled forward exposure from November series to the February's. The Footsie futures contract for December opened weak but traded up to 3,121 before falling in the afternoon to close at 3,106. At that level it was some 8 points above the cash market and above it's estimated fair value premium of around 5 points. Turnover topped 12,000 lots.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Mortification of a mighty Miti mandarin Japan's coalition government won a showdown against the powerful bureaucracy yesterday, when a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry resigned after prematurely promoting a colleague to enhance his curriculum vitae. The defeat of the mighty Miti echoed around the streets of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo's bureaucratic district, where officials of other ministries saw the government's action as an encroachment on their traditional territory and an attack on their reputation. Mr Masahisa Naito, director-general of Miti's industrial policy bureau, admitted that he had erred by promoting his colleague, who became an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Democratic party, but thought that the offence did not warrant his resignation. He was urged by other bureaucrats to hold out against the resignation demand by Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the Miti minister, but Mr Naito apparently sensed that public opinion was running against the bureaucrats and their political partisanship. 'I wouldn't say that Mr Naito broke the law, but if you were asked whether his behaviour was appropriate or inappropriate, then you couldn't say it was appropriate,' Mr Kumagai said. The outcome was also a victory for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the powerbroker who pulled together the coalition and who is close to Mr Kumagai. In recent weeks, Mr Ozawa has complained about the lingering influence of the LDP, now in opposition for the first time in four decades, at Miti and other ministries. However, it is unclear whether the attacks on the bureaucracy's power will continue or whether the government will just target officials with close LDP ties, which, in the past, were important for the ministries. Japan's bureaucrats believe that they have run the country since the end of the war, as the LDP routinely changed ministers every year, meaning that few had the time to master their ministries and left most of the important decisions to senior officials. Miti officials complained yesterday that the campaign against Mr Naito came as the coalition government is increasingly fragile and another election is imminent. The Naito case, they say, has undermined the stability of the bureaucracy without ensuring longer-term changes in the relationship between politician and ministry.</p>

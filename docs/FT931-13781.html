			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Worries over Solidarity Pact THE DOLLAR remained under pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling to DM1.60 in European trading, as the markets ruled out any chance of a policy easing by the Bundesbank today, writes James Blitz. Speculation of a cut in official German rates at today's council meeting was all but killed after the Bundesbank conducted a neutral weekly intervention in the German money market. The Bundesbank imperceptibly eased the lowest accepted tender for 14-day funds to 8.59 per cent, and drained liquidity from the market. Prospects for a narrowing of the differential between short-term German and US rates were further dampened as German trade unions criticised the Bonn government's 'federal consolidation programme' launched yesterday. The plan is one of the most ambitious attempts to rein back social spending and industrial subsidies in Germany since the war. But the German Trade Union, DGB, said yesterday that it would not support a solidarity pact which contained the government's proposals. Agreement on the pact is seen as a crucial precursor to aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank. A sign of the dollar's weakness was that it closed down nearly  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark in London, at DM1.6065, despite the German currency's weakness against the Japanese yen in Asian trading the night before. The yen closed at Y77.8 against the D-Mark from a previous close of Y77.96. In European exchange rate mechanism trading, the German currency continued to weaken against the French franc, which closed at FFr3.3800 to the D-Mark, some 5 pfennigs above its ERM floor. If any source of uncertainty over the French currency remains, it is the high level of money market rates, with three month money rising yesterday to 11 15/16 per cent. However, Mr Michael Gallagher, Director of Economic Research at IDEA, the business information group, said that the Bank of France was deliberately keeping money market rates high as it sells French francs in an attempt to build up foreign currency reserves. A similar operation is thought to have been conducted for 3 weeks after the September French franc crisis. Attempts by European central banks to replenish their reserves with D-Marks may even keep the German currency underpinned against the dollar for some time yet. According to Mr Gallagher, the Bundesbank's monthly report suggested that Frankfurt is still owed some DM60bn by European central banks in return for its interventions during the currency crisis. Sterling lost exactly 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4750, after the December retail sales figures in the UK dropped 0.7 per cent on the month, a figure that was far worse than expected.</p>

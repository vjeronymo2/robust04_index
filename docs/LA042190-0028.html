			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE DISCOVERS B-2 BOMBER CRACKS  </P> <P> The Air Force said Friday it has discovered "hairline cracking" in a rear  section of the B-2 Stealth bomber that may be caused by exposure to high  temperatures.  </P> <P> The exact reason for the cracking, found during a routine inspection of the  radar-evading aircraft on March 30, is still under study, said Air Force  spokesman Maj. Dick Cole.  </P> <P> The cracking is located in the aft deck of the plane behind its engine exhaust  outlets. The problem was first reported in the magazine Aviation Week &amp;  Space Technology.  </P> <P> Cole said that the sections with the cracking will be removed and replaced with  new titanium patches.  </P> <P> Titanium, which is highly heat resistant and is very strong, also was used in  the now-retired reconnaisance aircraft SR-71. However, there are shortages of  the material plaguing the aerospace industry.  </P> <P> Cole said it wasn't clear whether the problem would delay the plane's testing  process.  </P></p>

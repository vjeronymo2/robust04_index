			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Bundesbank policy wins OECD support GERMANY'S hardline interest rate policy has won unconditional backing from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Bundesbank should keep rates high for as long as necessary to bring inflation down to the target range of 2 per cent or less, the Paris-based institution says in its latest economic survey. Meanwhile, it adds, there is no need for action to counter recent rapid expansion of German money supply. The report, released conveniently to feature in the media one day before the independent central bank's council is due to review its monetary targets, will further demoralise European Community members lobbying for German interest rate cuts to help them out of recession. It could also undermine the position of bank council members such as Mr Lothar Muller, president of the Bavarian state bank, who are lobbying hard for tighter monetary controls. The Bundesbank itself sent out further signals yesterday that it will not be hustled by complaining European Monetary System (EMS) partners into relaxing its interest rates stance. It was understandable that others might want lower interest rates, the bank said in its latest monthly report, but it did not follow that the use of 'suitable counter-measures' should be hindered in countries facing 'intolerable' price inflation. The bank was maintaining its position in the interests of Europe, the report claimed. The D-Mark was the anchor of the EMS and any weakening of its stability standards would make the conditions for economic and monetary union more difficult to achieve in several countries. Money supply figures for May, confirmed without comment yesterday in the Bundesbank report, show the broad M3 measure growing at 9 per cent year-on-year, compared with the target range of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent. 'A temporary above-target monetary expansion would not seem to call for further tightening of monetary conditions, but there should be no let-up in the pursuit of lower inflation, even if this means high interest rates for a prolonged period,' the OECD survey says. To paraphrase the report's delicate language, it says that, since reconstruction of the wrecked eastern economy has increased calls on every conceivable west German resource, it is hardly surprising that money is in demand. There is also evidence of D-Mark hoarding and demand from neighbouring Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where the hardest currency in Europe is widely preferred to the softer local alternatives. Meanwhile, it adds, the interest rates screw must be held down until inflation rates respond. Inflation in western Germany will fall from 4.3 per cent now to between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent in the second half of this year, it adds. A scheduled one point increase in value added tax to 15 per cent next January is expected to push the rate up another 0.5 per cent. There is also a risk that instead of absorbing cost pressures, companies will pass them on through price rises, further fuelling upward movement. 'In such a scenario, the scope for reduction of interest rates would be more limited and the upturn of economic activity weaker than in the present projection,' the report says. However, if more high wage deals and the temptation to pass on cost rises are avoided, inflation could be down to around 2.75 per cent by the end of next year. Making no mention of the impact of the maintenance of existing high rates on Germany's partners in the European Monetary System - Bundesbank policy has been under persistent fire as the main dampening influence on attempts to break out of recession - the report focuses solely on domestic challenges. The OECD expects western gross national product (GNP) to grow 1.3 per cent this year - compared with most expect-ations of around 1 per cent  - and 2.3 per cent in 1993. In the east, GNP should rise 7.5 per cent in 1992 and 9 per cent next year. It notes that government and Bundesbank policies seem set to support a more sustainable growth rate than in the post-unification boom. Most expansion will come from increased exports. Internal demand will be dampened by the impending VAT increase. High interest rates, lower company profits and sub-potential growth will reduce investment in the west. These factors, coupled with low growth in import prices, will also help cut inflation.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                GERMAN ECONOMY: OECD PROJECTIONS TO 1993                   AT CONSTANT 1991 PRICES (DMbn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                           VOLUME CHANGES PER CENT                            Germany     West       East       Germany                              Total   Germany     Germany      Total                              1991   1992  1993  1992  1993  1992  1993  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Private consumption       1,575.4    1.2   2.4   5.0   3.0   1.6   2.5 Public consumption          559.5    1.5   1.2  -4.0   2.0   0.6   1.3 Total investment            653.6    1.6   2.8  27.5  13.7   4.5   4.3 Machinery, equipment        642.1    0.1   3.4  35.0  18.0   4.2   5.6 Construction                299.7    3.0   2.2  20.0   9.0   4.8   3.0 Change in stocks             11.5    0.0   0.0  -1.0   2.3  -0.1   0.1 Total domestic demand     2,788.5    1.3   2.2   6.7   6.6   2.0   2.8 Foreign balance              19.8    0.2   0.4  -5.0  -3.3  -0.2   0.0 Exports                     824.0    3.7   5.1  20.0  15.0   3.5   5.6 Imports                     804.1    4.1   5.2   9.5   7.0   4.3   5.4 GNP                       2,808.3    1.3   2.3   7.5   9.0   1.8   2.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

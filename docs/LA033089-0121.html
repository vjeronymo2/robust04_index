			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> MALL RENEWAL PLAN OKD  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency gave preliminary approval Monday to a $57.3-million  revitalization plan for the Fashion Plaza mall, instructing its staff to  negotiate a development agreement with the mall owner, Sylvan Shulman Co., and  May Centers Inc.  </P> <P> The plan calls for adding a 140,000- square-foot May Co. store, 100,000 square  feet of new mall area and 82,000 square feet of peripheral commercial  development. In approving it, the city rejected competing proposals from owners  of two small mall properties for more limited rehabilitation.  </P> <P> The May Co. will move from the Eastland Shopping Center, the city's other mall,  which is owned by May Centers and is the focus of a separate revitalization  proposal. May Centers is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based May Department Stores  Inc.  </P> <P> Negotiations over how much money the Redevelopment Agency will contribute are  under way. The final contribution will probably involve a future sales tax or  tax increment paid to the developers. Redevelopment officials said the city  will provide no money up front for the project.  </P> <P> The revitalization is intended to transform the 14-year-old center into a  "super regional mall" competing with the Puente Hills Mall, Santa Anita Fashion  Park and the Montclair Plaza. According to city studies, the Fashion Plaza has  had a 7% decline in sales and a 19% decrease in customer traffic from last  year.  </P> <P> May Centers officials said the company has a $17.5-million budget for the  project.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY FINALLY REPLACES CANCELED BILL  </P> <P> More than 2 months after it canceled a performance of Verdi's Requiem, and just  1 week before show time, the Pacific Symphony has announced a replacement  program in which soprano Aprile Millo will sing Verdi arias and the orchestra  will offer Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony.  </P> <P> For the April 26-27 concerts, outgoing music director Keith Clark will lead  Millo and the orchestra in such Verdi excerpts as the Overture to "Luisa  Miller"; "Tacea la notte placida" from "Il Trovatore"; Ballabile, the Willow  Song and "Ave Maria" from "Otello," Prelude to Act III of "La Traviata"; and  "Pace, pace, mio dio!" from "La Forza del Destino."  </P> <P> The Bruckner symphony will provide the second half of the program.  </P> <P> The Verdi Requiem, which would have enlisted soloists Millo and Dolora Zajick,  plus the Pacific Chorale, was cut in February as a budget-balancing move that  saved about $75,000, according to the orchestra's executive direcor, Louis G.  Spisto.  </P> <P> Officials said the Requiem will be rescheduled for the 1990-91 season. There is  no confirmed date for an alternate appearance by mezzo-soprano Zajick, although  officials have said that she will return during the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> Orchestra leaders said the long delay in settling on the substitute program  stemmed from difficulties in coordinating repertory between soloist and  orchestra.

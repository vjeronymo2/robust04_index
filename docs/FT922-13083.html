			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Earthquake shuts German nuclear plant A REACTOR block in the Biblis nuclear power station in the state of Hesse was closed 'as a security precaution' yesterday after an earthquake before dawn shook a huge area around the Dutch-German border, writes Christopher Parkes. Widespread damage and panic was reported after the 15-second shock. Unusually powerful for western Europe, it measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. Although the Biblis reactor was believed not to be severely damaged, many houses in the area around the epicentre, Roermond in The Netherlands, were expected to be declared unsafe and demolished. Reports of injuries, mainly caused by falling masonry and roof tiles to people running out into the streets, suggested around 50 people had been hurt. One elderly woman in Bonn was reported to have died of a heart attack.</p>

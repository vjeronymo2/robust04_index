			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: </F> "Russia Is Predestined To Be a Great Power"]    [Text] There is only one way to achieve an open, stable,  and democratic Russia: Close cooperation between Russia and the  United States. But then both parties must be prepared to  compromise.    Unfortunately, I must say that in these confusing times we  cannot count on much understanding and support from our friends  and allies in the West.    Even at this critical moment, now that the democrats need  full support, we are hearing Western threats that economic  cooperation with Russia will be limited.    Some comments show an almost manic desire for a world with  just one great power: the United States. This is not very  realistic. The United States cannot deal with all the world's  problems on its own; if it were to try, it would just weaken  itself.    Moreover, even in this difficult transitional period, Russia  remains a superpower. Not just because of its arsenal of  nuclear weapons and missiles, but also because of its natural  resources, technological skills, and strategic location.    There are reactionary forces in both the United States and  Russia, the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes that  are afraid of losing influence, that are striving for an end to  the present cooperation. They are spreading myths: "Since  Russia is simply condemned to eternal totalitarian governments,  always in confrontation with the outside world, it can never,  from a historical point of view, travel the same path as the  West."    It appears that some Western politicians, in Washington and  elsewhere, see Russia as a younger rather than an equal partner.  In this view of things a "good Russian" is always a follower  and never a leader.    Right from the start, politicians in both Russia and the  West  who thought pragmatically based their policy on two assumptions.  First, Russia is predestined to be a great power, not a  second-rank power. Under a communist or nationalist regime it is  aggressive and a threat, while under a democratic government it  would be peaceful and prosperous.    Second, cooperative links, like those between the United  States and Russia, do not prevent forceful and even aggressive  policies to defend self-interests.    This can sometimes lead to disagreement. That is not  serious, as long as the situation remains one of compromise  rather than confrontation. It is naive to expect that great  powers like Russia and the United States must and can always  live together in harmony.    A particularly promising example of cooperation was the U.S.  readiness to involve Russian experts in determining the  principles for the export of militarily useful technology from  the West to the former Communist countries and countries which  are accused of supporting terrorism.    How should the Russian democrats answer the new chauvinistic  wind blowing in Washington? Russia cannot agree to playing a  subordinate role in the world. That would be unjust and  politically dangerous. Extreme nationalists and other  reactionaries would quickly reap a profit.    While the idea that the Americans are in charge of the world  is dangerous, there remains an urgent need for U.S. leadership  because of the special position of the United States in the G-7  and NATO.    NATO was set up to resist communism and defend the Western  democracies from the threat emanating from it. But nowadays  NATO is no longer sufficient for two reasons: It no longer has  communism as its greatest enemy and Russia is not a member.    What role could NATO play in solving the big international  conflicts? The organizational problems could be solved in part  by the Partnership for Peace proposed by the United States,  which various countries in Eastern and Central Europe have in  the meantime joined and which is also acceptable to Russia.    But even this should not be seen as true cooperation, as has  been painfully demonstrated in the Bosnian crisis. The NATO  ultimatum on Sarajevo was made while Russia was not involved in  any way. It is unacceptable to exclude Russia from attempts to  solve the situation in Bosnia, where Russia has present and  future interests.    We must urgently make a start on a strategy for achieving a  mature and realistic relationship -- dare we call it realpolitik?</p>

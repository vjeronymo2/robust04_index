			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Voice recognition gets into gear A PROFESSOR at the University of Ohio is using voice recognition technology to cut production times for small- and medium-sized manufacturers, writes Larry Donovan. To make a mechanical gear, for example, the software developed by Dinesh Dhamija is loaded on to the computer and a user vocabulary is built up. Then the gear is sketched on a screen by voice commands. The monologue is straightforward. 'I want a gear which works on a reduction ration 2 as to 1 and to transmit 150 horsepower.' After prompting questions about size, stress factors and materials, the computer analyses the request and comes back with some options. The model that is chosen is then open for further modifications. When the sketch is done, the data is sent to a computer numerical control unit to make the part on site. Alternatively the data can be sent almost across a data network to a plant nearly anywhere in the world. The system costs between Dollars 30,000-Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 17,000-Pounds 22,000).

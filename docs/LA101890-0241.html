			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: GROUP SEEKS TO COMBAT GAY SUICIDE  </P> <P> Blaming ultraconservatives for fostering an anti-gay climate that can  contribute to suicide, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays recently  started a national education program to combat a newly acknowledged crisis of  gay and lesbian youth suicide.  </P> <P> Some studies estimate that gay youngsters are three times as likely as non-gays  to attempt suicide and that they account for about 30% of the 5,000 youth  suicides each year, according to Paulette Goodman, president of the  Washington-based group, which held its annual convention last week at the Hyatt  Regency Alicante in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> "People who express themselves like (anti-gay minister) Lou Sheldon don't  appreciate that children are killing themselves day after day," she said.  </P> <P> Both Sheldon, president of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, and  Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) prevailed upon Louis W. Sullivan,  secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repudiate a  January, 1990, government report that contained the gay suicide statistics.  </P> <P> Goodman estimated that one family in four is touched by homosexuality. But  often, she said, parents learn of their child's homosexual orientation only  after a suicide attempt. Others may never reveal their sexual preferences out  of shame and fear.  </P> <P> The three-phase national project "Respect All Youth" will develop informational  materials designed to:  </P> <P> * Increase awareness of issues that may lead young people to suicide.  </P> <P> * Provide a systematic outreach to leaders of national youth organizations,  including Boy and Girl Scouts and the 4-H, as well as religious groups and  other professionals.  </P> <P> * Provide training for the 200 chapters of PFLAG to help them reach youth and  teachers in the local community.  </P> <P> "Silence is argument carried on by other means." -- Ernesto (Che) Guevara  (1928-67)  </P></p>

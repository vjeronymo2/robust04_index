			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Most of the General State Budget is to be  allocated to the defense sector this year. Reacting to a recent  statement by General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National  Resistance, Renamo, that he was not keen to lead hungry,  shoeless, and wageless men, Deputy Planning Minister Tomas  Salomao said at a news conference yesterday that our country's  military expenses could this year take up 45 percent of the  General State Budget. He added that each soldier of the future  of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, has been allocated  a daily sum of 7,200 meticals for his meals.    Deputy Planning Minister Tomas Salomo neither confirmed nor  denied Gen. Ngonhamo's disclosure that two commanders, two  instructors, and [words indistinct] functionaries had been  turned out of a hotel in Beira because they had not paid their  bills. Minister Salomao simply said that there had been no  reason for that to happen because funds will always be made  available to cover such expenses. [passage omitted]</p>

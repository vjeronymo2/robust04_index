That is why it agrees to the time for withdrawal fixed  by the Russian side (before August 31st, 1994: Interfax note),  and does not insist on an earlier date, Estonia's Ambassador to  Russia, Yuriy Kahn, told a news conference given on Thursday  after the latest round of bilateral talks.    The Estonian side, he said, has only one wish: that Russia  step up the withdrawal of units stationed in the center of  Tallinn which are in direct proximity to the building of  Estonia's parliament.    The diplomat expressed surprise at the Russian delegation's  refusal to present a schedule for troops withdrawal on the  grounds that the problem of Russian military retirees in Estonia  remains unresolved. According to him, earlier the two sides  agreed "to resort to no linkages, and discuss every issue  separately."    "This road leads to a deadlock. Linkages can only turn the  negotiating process into bargaining," he said.    According to the ambassador, those in the Russian military  who retired after the time when Estonia gained its independence  (August 20th, 1991: Interfax's note) must leave Estonia  together with the withdrawing troops.    "It's odd that Russia has not granted these people any legal  or social guarantees. It seems to have decided to leave them in  Estonia's care. These people fought for Russia, and such an  attitude to them on the part of Moscow is inadmissible," he said.    With reference to the package of "border issues" Kahn noted  that Russia "seems to have begun to understand that the  administrative line fixed by Stalin cannot serve as a state  border between the two countries."    "When determining our border we continue to be guided by the  peace treaty signed with Russia in Tartu (in 1920: Interfax  note), and we believe that Moscow has territorial claims to us,  not vice versa," Kahn said.    According to the ambassador, a meeting should be organized  between the Russian and Estonian presidents "so as to reach  serious solutions."    "Unfortunately, Russia's Foreign Ministry believes that all  issues should be tentatively coordinated between lower-level  officials, after which the presidents will only sign the  documents already drafted. We do not share this approach," the  diplomat said.</p>

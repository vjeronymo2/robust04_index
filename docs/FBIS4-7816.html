			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ratko Peter: "Belief in God and Peasant Discord"] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Party Splits </H5>   What is happening on the Croatian political scene? Have the  convulsions and tensions in political parties even reached the  Croatian Peasant Party [HSS], the party that was the most  pleasant surprise in the last zupanija elections, just a little  more than a year ago? Was it precisely then, as some say, that  the peasant cart began to go downhill, has peasant concord  become more and more peasant discord, and has belief in God  remained the only unquestioned maxim of the party? Is the  history of the Croatian Peasant Party actually the paradigm of  historical Croatian discord, which so many times has taken  bloody tributes from us, of which we are perhaps witnesses even  today?    Yet another intraparty conflict or showdown is taking place  in the (overcrowded) Croatian political space, this time between  the top members of the Peasant Party. Although the party has  been saying (in writing and verbally) that it is a question of  party squabbles and differing views, there are quite a few  people who say that this is a naked struggle for power and even  a split in the party. Following the sharp division in the  incumbent party, where thanks to Tudjman's strong position and  intervention they managed to find a "middle" line as a  compromise of the division into "right" and "left," following  the open conflicts in the strongest opposition party, when  Budisa nevertheless "survived" in the position of the party's  top man, and after the fierce conflicts in the strongest  regional party, which, it seems, was also the most radical in  settling "its affairs," it is now the turn of the "Croatian  peasants" who, judging by all appearances, have applied the  "Istrian models" in solving their problems. In short, Dr. Josip  Stojanovic, chairman of the Executive Committee, and Mirko  Mador, member of the party's presidium and a deputy in the House  of Representatives of the Croatian parliament, have been  suspended.  <H5>  The Kasina Meeting </H5>   Although both Josip Stojanovic and Mirko Mador say that  there  is no split in the party and that they do not want to bring down  Stipac (although Stipac brought them down, at least for the  present), one gets the impression that the "peasants" have  nevertheless been playing games and looking for justice. In the  village Kasina (not far from Zagreb), there was a meeting of the  party's Initiative Committee in order to offer, it was stated,  support to the Executive Committee in its effort to achieve the  most successful activity and organization of the party,  especially of its central headquarters. The "Kasina group" of  some 100 HSS members (some say even less, although that is no  longer the point) met in the afternoon hours of Saturday, 26  February, the same day when the party's presidium held a meeting  in the morning at which the decision was made to "dispatch"  Mador and Stojanovic, although the "Kasina meeting" still had  not begun. What is more, according to Mador, that decision was  made even a day earlier, on Friday. In its meeting, the party's  presidium adopted a unanimous decision to suspend the two  members on grounds that "contrary to the provisions of the  bylaws and without knowledge of the presidium, they organized  and held a party meeting that same day in Kasina." Mador, on the  other hand, says that from the legal standpoint it is completely  legal to hold such a meeting ("After looking at the party  bylaws, I saw that I was not violating any party regulation by  holding a party meeting"), and it is also indicative that the  party's presidium should judge a priori something which actually  had not even begun. It is obvious that party confrontations had  been prepared in advance in the apparently tranquil Peasant  Party.    "Since back in February we have been issuing warnings about  the party's problems, especially the ineffectiveness of its  central headquarters," says one of the "expellees," Dr. Josip  Stojanovic. "That meeting in Kasina should have been closed to  the public, at least until all the materials were turned over to  Drago Stipac, the party's president, but that did not occur  because Stipac did what he did. All the criteria and keys to  election in the party are in the hands of the presidium, and  those people render judgment, which is evident once again in  this case."  <H5>  Gunfire From Wooden Rifles </H5>   It is quite obvious that in spite of the desire to have it  all take place "out of the public eye," the party's dirty linen  has nevertheless come out in public, and the first step was  actually taken by Mador in his open letter to Drago Stipac.  "Yes, I wrote that letter during the meeting in Kasina, because  we already knew about the suspension decision of the party  presidium. That is in fact why I wrote very emotionally."    Still, there is much that is unclear and foggy in the entire  story. For example, why did Stipac expel only Stojanovic and  Mador, although the Kasina meeting was attended by some 100  people, what are really the reasons of the conflict, did it all  come down to personal animosities, to a naked party struggle for  power, has the party at this point been equal to the new  political realities and the increasing number of its members  (according to certain indications, the HSS is the country's  second largest party in terms of membership), is this a case of  unclear ideological definition and unrecognizability, can it all  be blamed on the "notorious moles" who obviously have not  bypassed even the 90-year-old Peasant Party? "I still stand by  what I wrote in the open letter," says Mirko Mador, "and that is  that the HSS must be a general Croatian party, a party of the  center, social and democratic. It must be a modern party, the  wooden guns and hoes with which Macek created the Croatian  banovina will no longer do, the Croatian peasant must be a  policymaker, not the object of policy. The main trouble in the  party is its ideological unrecognizability, in that the problem  of Bosnia and Herzegovina was put ahead of Croatia in general,  and it is also the party organization itself, its general  ineffectiveness, especially that of the central headquarters.  The party's growth trend, which has been marked, is not in line  with the work of the central headquarters, and there are many  things that are unclear concerning personnel and finances. The  main party problem nevertheless came from outside, with the help  of certain people within the HSS, and it is thanks to those  people that the party was some kind of political appendage or  hanger-on. Within our party, there were and are special-interest  groups of the incumbent party and the strongest opposition  party, various emissaries make their rounds, and the party has  become a highly eligible maiden. All of that is politically  unclear and morally disgusting. That is why I made my deputy's  seat available, because my main interest is for the party to get  on its own right road. So, along with the special-interest  groups from outside, the main problems of the party are  contained in the very conception of the party's organization and  in its ideological unrecognizability."  <H5>  Suspend Me as Well </H5>   The conclusion is drawn from all we have said that strange  things have been happening for a long time now within the HSS,  something that was mainly unknown to the public before Mador's  letter, although the question might be put why Mador has hung  out the party's dirty laundry at this particular point, is this  nevertheless a struggle for power and the kind of lobbying in  advance of certain important party meetings (perhaps even a  party convention?), is Mador actually an HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Union] mole (that has also been said), or is it after  all a struggle for some different HSS, as Mador says, "more  acceptable from the generational standpoint, younger,  better-trained, and more professional"? It nevertheless remains  unclear why in his recent press conference Mador did not want to  expose the alleged HDZ and Liberal "mole" even when the  journalists insisted several times.    Nevertheless, one learns behind the scenes that the names of  Josko Kovac and Tihomil Radja are being spoken of as the men  from the incumbent party and Budisa's party, respectively. Kovac  himself says that in Dalmatia and Split the HSS is supporting  President Stipac, and that the voices of the two men expelled  and the group around them are a minority compared to the 40,000  members of the HSS who stand behind Stipac, and that "Stipac is  too democratic, because if he were not, Mador and Stojanovic  would already have been not suspended, but read out of the  party." Radja, on the other hand, says that all of this is yet  another attempt of the incumbent party to undermine the work of  the HSS by provoking a conflict within it, indeed even with the  help of a high government official ("let him recognize  himself"). According to Radja, it is a question of HDZ "special  operatives," i.e., of "members of the HDZ youth groups," while  Mador's blow was "below the belt." "I openly support Stipac, who  still has never made a single political gaffe, although that  does not mean that some of his actions should not be criticized."    The split in the party is obvious, there is evidence of that  in the open letter of Josip Fajdic, the man who chaired the  meeting in Kasina. According to Fajdic, the party central  headquarters is itself the bone of contention, it is a question  of "fossilized structures" which fall utterly short of the  current political situation and general situation, as well as  the needs of the party for more up-to-date political activity.  So, in spite of the party's ideological unrecognizability ("let  us move on, Mr. President, from Busovaca"), Fajdic concludes his  letter with the request "that you suspend me along with the rest  from the party, because I truly belong to that part of the HSS."  <H5>  An Impermissible Gaffe </H5>   Is the HSS really facing perhaps its crucial and fateful  moments, is Josko Kovac really right when he says that it is a  question of "marginalized structures," or have Mador and  Stojanovic only started an avalanche of malcontents who, as we  see, have now been joined by Fajdic, but also by Nikica  Novakovic, the first president of the revived HSS, also  "dissatisfied with the way the party has been led by Drago  Stipac, and with methods that have nothing in common with the  doctrine of the Radic brothers"? We should also mention that the  Medjimurje chapter of the party also favors reorganization of  the HSS. On the other hand, however, Drago Stipac does not want  to debate through the media the "accidental fellow travelers" in  the party, he obviously wants to work this out behind the doors  of the party, although the door is already cracked open. The man  who is said to lead the party in an authoritarian way, who is  said to be too old to lead the party, and who is said to be  responsible for the party's ideological wandering, in which the  valley of the Lasva has frequently been more essential than  crucial problems in Croatia, and who is said to have committed  certain impermissible political gaffes (in SRPSKI GLASNIK,  Stipac talks about a federal Croatia and about the Serbs as a  constituent nationality), will nevertheless have to respond very  quickly to the charges which are becoming more and more frequent.    Is the party too much submerged in populist and folklore  rhetoric, has it become a kind of "peasant trade union," are its  president and the seven vice presidents really "used up," people  whose traditional HSS values simply have no place in a time that  is half a century after Macek and the Radic brothers. There are  many questions, but one thing is still quite certain: The party  split in the HSS is obvious, the divisions run deeper than it  seems at first, the only question is how, whether through a  party convention, with full-scale preparations, or on the other  hand "behind the scenes," the HSS will get its new victorious  image.</p>

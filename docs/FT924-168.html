			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Planning for higher education Sir, The timely article by Andrew Adonis ('Competing answers to university challenge', December 21) raises the question of how future governments will pay for higher education. One possible solution is to force students to pay part of their fees according to some means tested formula. Whatever the merits of this, it is fatally flawed when it comes to higher education courses linked to training for posts in the public sector, in particular in nursing and education. The greater proportion of funding now available to institutions through fee income rather than by grants to institutions has encouraged universities and colleges to expand rapidly. In September, recruitment to courses for those training as primary school teachers was some 50 per cent over target at 18,000. Many of those starting out to train as teachers will have little realistic hope of securing a job as a teacher. Asking them to pay part of their fees would only saddle them with a bigger debt on top of their existing loans. Unless sensible planning is introduced quickly the pool of unemployed teachers will rise dramatically over the next few years. The announcement that bursaries for teachers in the former shortage subjects will be reduced from next September is a start if it helps to reduce demand for courses but it will have no effect unless institutions try to match recruitment more closely to demand for teachers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Filipe Mabutana] </F>   [Text] Under the chairmanship of President Joaquim Alberto  Chissano, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Central  Committee has been holding its fourth ordinary session at the  Frelimo School in Matola since this morning. A total of 144  party members are attending the session, which should perhaps be  called Frelimo's triumphal meeting. According to Frelimo  Chairman Joaquim Chissano, only Frelimo knows how to implement  democracy in this country. In practice, democracy will perish  and be a tuneless song in the throats of dictators or disguised  puppets. [sentence as heard]    In his speech to the fourth Frelimo Central Committee  session, the Mozambican president gave special attention to the  Mozambican peace process in general, and in particular the troop  confinement and demobilization processes, as well as the  formation of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM. He  also noted the need for Frelimo militants to mobilize the  electorate and to gather new members for the party. In fact,  Frelimo is very happy about its membership.    In his speech a few minutes ago, Frelimo Chairman Chissano  said his party had already been able to get 359,719 new members  in the 21-month period between March 1992 and December of last  year. According to him, these figures reflect his party's  growing credibility among the Mozambican people. Joaquim  Chissano noted that such findings by Frelimo may serve as a  catalyst to increase its belief that it can win the upcoming  first multiparty elections in the country.    [Begin Chissano recording] Our party has enjoyed the  people's  respect for many years. These perceptions arise from the  people's knowledge about the aims that have always guided  Frelimo and the successes we have scored even when we were going  through rather difficult times. [Words indistinct] the  difficulties we have faced. This should not wipe away our  history or the foundations we have established and on which (?we  hope to build) a happy Mozambique. We must have the courage and  firmness to face up to the challenges posed by this process. We  want to win the elections in a climate of reconciliation and  tolerance. This does not mean, though, that we have to keep  quiet about all direct and indirect aggression we have been  dealt. [end recording]</p>

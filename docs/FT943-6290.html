			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola, Nestle remodel link-up Coca-Cola and Nestle are streamlining their global co-operation in the ready-to-drink tea and coffee sector. The two groups will dissolve a joint venture created in 1991 to make and sell the products throughout the world. Instead, the two will work together to accelerate their product drive in more countries. Ready-to-drink teas and coffees, distributed hot and cold in vending machines, have long been popular in Japan, the only country where Nestle and Coca-Cola compete with each other in these products. The two groups have decided to combine their strengths - Nestle's coffee and tea brands and Coke's distribution and vending machines - to introduce the range to other markets. Nestle said yesterday the joint venture had so far introduced ready-to-drink teas and coffees to 25 countries on four continents. Neither company has revealed sales figures, but it is believed the venture has annual revenues of about Dollars 250m. Under the new arrangement, Coke will concentrate on developing the market for ready-to-drink teas, and will take out a 100-year licence from Nestle to use the Nestea trademark throughout the world, except in Japan. Nestle will concentrate on developing Nescafe brand ready-to-drink coffees. Wherever possible, the products would be distributed through Coca-Cola bottlers. Nestle said the arrangement would accelerate decision-making by eliminating an entire level of management.</p>

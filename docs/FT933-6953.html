			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Zhu heeds foreign advice to slow China's growth MR ZHU RONGJI, China's vice premier in charge of the economy, acted to slow the rapid growth of the economy after receiving recommendations from international advisers whom he called the 'foreign monks'. The team's involvement in the formulation of economic measures reveals a remarkable degree of openness to external advice on the part of Mr Zhu. Mr Zhu's term for the foreigners, according to a participant in meetings held in China in June, was 'his way of saying that outsiders sometimes have greater wisdom because they can look at things from the outside'. The team, mainly from the World Bank but including several other foreign economists, recommended a package of measures to cool the over-heating economy at the end of a three-day meeting with Chinese officials at Dalian, on China's north-eastern coast, from June 10 to 12. Among their suggestions were increases in interest rates, much tighter control of the financial system, and curbs on capital spending by local governments. Mr Zhu's response was swift. On July 2 he took over as governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. On July 5 he stated that China 'must rectify financial order and strengthen financial discipline'. On July 11 he raised interest rates. The World Bank team first met Mr Zhu in Beijing. He asked them whether they believed that the economy was over-heating. When they answered that they were convinced that it was, he asked them what actions they would advise. The team then went to Dalian for an annual session with ministers and top officials of the ministry of finance, the People's Bank and the System Reform Commission, the agency which is overseeing the re-structuring of the economy. The team's advice was given at the close of the Dalian conference. The recommendations, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, said evidence of overheating was provided by rising inflation and a widening gap between the official exchange rate and the rate in the 'swap centres' in which foreign currencies are mainly traded. 'It is clear that the main source of the overheating is excessive fixed investment growth, facilitated by an accommodating monetary policy,' the report said. China's economy grew 13 per cent in 1992 and the annual rate of growth rose to 14 per cent in the first half of 1993. As the economists and officials met, inflation was edging over 20 per cent in big cities and the yuan, China's currency, was weakening as low Chinese interest rates made it attractive to hold foreign currencies. Much of the investment in fixed assets - which was rising at a 70 per cent annual rate in the first half of 1993 - was by local governments which rushed, with the help of ill-advised lending, to establish property and industrial schemes. Mr Zhu has cracked down both on the lending and on local authorities, closing down 1,000 locally-declared 'development zones' - though economists say the total number of zones is much larger than this. The World Bank already had a close relationship with China. Reforms since 1979 have earned high praise from the bank and exhortations to press ahead. Reuter adds: The US plans to impose sanctions against China as early as this week for allegedly exporting sensitive missile technology - the M-11, capable to delivering a 500kg warhead up to 300km - to Pakistan in breach of its pledges, a US official said in Washington yesterday.

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUSTICES REJECT COUNTY'S PRISON LAND CHALLENGE  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal by Los Angeles  County challenging a lower court ruling that allowed land acquisition for a  planned Lancaster prison while legal challenges against the prison were  pending.  </P> <P> In an order issued Thursday, the court also lifted a stay it imposed on the  state last month to prevent the acquisition of the 252-acre site while the  justices decided whether to hear the appeal.  </P> <P> The lower court ruling in July had forced state officials to cancel a call for  bids on a contract to grade the site.  </P> <P> Deputy County Counsel Jonathan Crane said the impact of the ruling is lessened  by the fact that on Monday a Superior Court judge will hear arguments on  environmental lawsuits filed by the county and city of Lancaster against the  prison. That hearing could result in a judge's order permitting construction to  continue, or in a temporary or permanent prohibition against further  construction work, according to lawyers on both sides.  </P></p>

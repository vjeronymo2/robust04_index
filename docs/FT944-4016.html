			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Thai coalition near collapse as party quits Thailand's coalition government was near collapse yesterday after a split over local administration prompted the abrupt departure of its second largest member, the New Aspiration party led by the interior minister. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, who now controls only 141 of the 360 seats in the lower house of parliament, must persuade one of the right-wing opposition parties to join the government or call a general election. There are fears the break-up of what is probably Thailand's least corrupt elected government in recent history could dilute the vital but unspectacular efforts to revamp the country's mediocre education system and boost the incomes of the rural poor, which have been the hallmarks of its two years in office. Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the interior minister and former army chief, pulled his party's 51 MPs out of the coalition after helping to defeat a government move to have village headmen elected. He sought to find favour with powerful bureaucrats who can deliver many rural votes at the next election. Mr Chuan said his Democrat party, the largest single grouping in the coalition, would lead a minority administration during talks to form a new government, partly to ensure parliament passed proposed constitutional reforms, such as lowering the voting age to 18. This leaves him vulnerable to a no-confidence vote, which could occur during an emergency session even though parliament goes into recess for four months on December 21. If the government is unable to accommodate the demands of the two big opposition parties, parliament will probably be dissolved early in the new year, dashing hopes that Mr Chuan's coalition could be the first to survive a full four-year term. General elections would be held in April or May. The opposition had no hesitation in helping to humiliate the government, even though they originally proposed the election of local government officials. 'I think Chuan has the fight of his political life now,' said Mr Amnuay Wirawan, who recently stepped down as a deputy prime minister to form a new party. This is an awkward time for the Democrat party to fight an election as it has seen its relatively clean image tainted by scandal. The party's deputy agriculture minister, Mr Suthep Thaugsuban, resigned his cabinet post on Tuesday following allegations that he helped transfer land to rich friends on the holiday island of Phuket. However, few people expect to see the military step into the political arena after its chastening experience in 1992, when Mr Chuan's coalition swept into power on a wave of opposition to the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the hideous massacre, the official  Palestinian spokesman made the following statement:    The forces of the Israeli occupation have yesterday  committed  a new massacre against the children of our people in the  occupied Gaza Strip when the Israeli Army fired at some  Palestinian young activists while they were distributing  political leaflets in Jabalyah to the masses of our people on  the political developments that are currently under way.    When those youths stopped near a gas station, the army  patrols and Arabic-speaking elements of the Israeli intelligence  immediately opened fire on them, killing the six youths, as well  as a woman and a man while passing by the place.    This new massacre -- which is being added to the series of  the massacres committed by the Israeli Army and the armed  settlers against the children of our people since the terrible  massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, and before that since their  occupation of our land and their attacks on our sanctities,  freedom, and dignity and on our right in a dignified, free and  independent life -- all these reveal the depth of the  premeditated conspiracy in which some Israeli Army units and the  armed settlers are implicated against our masses, our sanctities  and land, which, in their totality, constitute hideous crimes  and vile conspiracies against humanity, against our people and  against the whole of the peace process.    This massacre will only increase our people's determination  and adherence to obtain their legitimate rights. It is  regrettable that all these crimes and violations are taking  place at the same time when false crocodile tears are being shed  over lost opportunities for a solution, and evasive talk is  being heard on good intentions and on a desire for peace.    Genuine peace comes about by protecting the Palestinian  people, their sanctities, lives and properties in accordance  with international legitimacy, the last of which was declared in  UN Security Council Resolution 904. This resolution calls for  ensuring international protection for our people by providing an  international presence in the Palestinian territories, disarming  settlers, and evacuating the settlements which lie in the heart  of our towns and amidst our people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister </F> Peres by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen, following the  meeting of Labor's Central Committee on 19 June; place not given  -- recorded]    [Text] The crisis in the ruling party is worsening. Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today found it difficult to have his say  at the meeting of Labor's Central Committee due to catcalls  directed against him by Labor members. At the same time, our  correspondent has learned that on 21 June, Shim'on Peres will  convene about 40 of his main supporters for a meeting the kind  of which has not taken place in Labor for a long time.  Relations between Rabin and Peres may be growing tense again,  so let us hear their reactions.    [Begin recording] [Rosen, addressing Peres] Knesset members  [MK's] say there is no master in Labor today.    [Peres] I am not an commentator on MK's.    [Rosen] Has the prime minister lost control over Labor?    [Peres] I am a cabinet member. I do not intend to criticize  the prime minister.    [Rosen] If you were Labor's chairman, what would you have  done to rehabilitate the party?    [Peres] When I was Labor chairman I did what I needed to do.  Take a look at what I did.    [Rosen] You know that it is said now that the Peres camp is  revived.    [Peres] Look, I am not prepared to deal with rumors. Let  people speak.    [Rosen] Is there no truth to this?    [Peres] To the best of my knowledge, there are no camps in  the party today, nor is it necessary to revive them.    [Rosen] Do you intend to take part in the negotiations over  the Histadrut coalition so as to help finalize matters?    [Peres] If I am requested to do so, I will. I will not  initiate this however.    [Rosen, addressing Rabin] The Central Committee was not so  sympathetic to you, if I am not mistaken.    [Rabin] I have already said on several occasions, in better  times too, that if I were up for election in this committee I  would not have been elected. I was elected through primaries.    [Rosen] Do you believe this committee will be replaced in  the next elections?    [Rabin] I assume that before the next elections we will have  a party convention and institutions will be elected there. I  hope these elections will be democratic.    [Rosen] How does one emerge from the muddle in Labor?    [Rabin] I am not worried. My problem is to emerge from the  Histadrut muddle.    [Rosen] Do you feel there is some problem or tension between  you and the foreign minister?    [Rabin] I think we have a correct work relationship. There  is unpleasant past experience, but we are also united about the  future.    [Rosen] What is the situation today then?    [Rabin] The situation is alright.    [Rosen] Do you think your attitude toward the ministers is  usually correct?    [Rabin] I hope so.    [Rosen] Do you not hear complaints from them sometimes?    [Rabin] Look, I am a prime minister. I have supreme  responsibility. When the right wing demonstrates against  something, they demonstrate against me, not the ministers.  Responsibility also means authority. [end recording]</p>

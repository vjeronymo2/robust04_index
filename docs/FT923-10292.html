			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Novo calls for Pounds 9m as profits jump NOVO GROUP yesterday announced a sharp rise in profits, an Pounds 8.8m rights issue to help fund a Pounds 3.3m acquisition, and a capital reorganisation. For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose to Pounds 1.08m helped by the acquisition in April 1991 of Novo Communications for Dollars 14m. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m. The figures compared with Pounds 158,000 and Pounds 9.45m for the preceding 18 months. Earnings were 10.1p (1.44p). The group, formerly EMC, is a provider of inventory management, storage and distribution services to the film and television industries. The underwritten rights issue is of 29.38m new ordinary shares on a 16-for-3 basis at 30p per share. Some Pounds 3.3m of the Pounds 8.8m will be used to acquire Walport International together with the 50 per cent of Walport Telmar Scandinavia not already held by Walport International. Walport is the world's largest supplier of rented visual entertainment to the commercial shipping industry. The capital restructure involves the conversion of the 1m 6 per cent convertible preference shares into 3.33m new ordinaries; the conversion of the 2.14m 10 per cent cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares into 7.12m new ordinaries; the redemption of the 2.14m 10 per cent cumulative redeemable preference shares at par; and repayment of the outstanding loan notes, which were used in respect of the acquisition of Dataguard, for Dollars 4.25m (Pounds 2.2m). The directors said the 'geographical mix of the group's earnings and its unwieldy loan structure' had combined to prevent it paying its preference dividends. The ordinary payment is therefore omitted - a 1.6p total was paid for 1991.</p>

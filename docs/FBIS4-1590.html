			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security  Council issued a presidential statement today, calling on the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to cooperate in the  international inspection of its nuclear sites.    The council urged DPRK to allow IAEA (the International  Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors to complete the inspection  activities agreed by the two sides last month.    IAEA reported to the council earlier this month that because  of DPRK's objection, it was unable to draw conclusions as to  whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material or  reprocessing or other operations.    But DPRK argued that the inspections required by IAEA were  beyond the line agreed upon by the two sides last month.    The council also appealed to those member states engaged in  dialogue with DPRK to continue their dialogue in accordance with  the agreement.    The United States, Britain and France at first insisted on  using warning languages in either a resolution or a statement  but met strong opposition from China, which said that anything  done by the council should be mild and constructive and that any  pressure against DPRK would be counterproductive.    China's position got support from the 10 non-permanent  member  countries, which argued that since China was a next-door  neighbor of DPRK, its observations should be respected.    After several days of heated debate, the council at last  reached consensus on the statement which contained most of  China's suggestions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified  individuals tonight detonated two bombs in different places in  Guatemala City, according to the volunteer fire department.    The fire department chief, Emilio Najera, told NOTIMEX that  one of the bombs exploded in front of the home of the brother of  Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, bishop of Zacapa and the  former mediator in negotiations between the government and the  guerrillas. The second bomb went off at Climat, a store located  in the exclusive Zone 9 of this capital.    Firemen did not specify the type of explosives used in the  attacks, both of which caused considerable damage but no  casualties. The attacks were carried out on the Day of  Constitutionality, just 24 hours before the peace talks between  the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  (URNG) are due to resume in Mexico.</p>

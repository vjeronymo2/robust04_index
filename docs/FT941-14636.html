			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcan blames world glut for Dollars 36m loss Alcan Aluminium, one of the world's biggest producers, blamed the world aluminium glut for a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 36m, or 17 cents a share, including a rationalisation charge of Dollars 25m. This compares with a loss of Dollars 56m, or 29 cents ,in the 1992 quarter, including Dollars 49m of special charges. Revenues in the latest quarter were down slightly at Dollars 1.8bn. Alcan's loss for the full year was Dollars 104m, or 54 cents, against a loss of Dollars 112m, or 60 cents. Special charges were Dollars 37m, compared with Dollars 58m. Revenues were again down slightly, at Dollars 7.23bn. Mr Jacques Bougie, president, blamed exports from the former Soviet Union for the overcapacity crisis. LME spot ingot prices touched a new low (after inflation) of 46 US cents a pound last month. The price has since risen - it stood at 54.5 cents earlier this week - on hopes of an international deal on production cuts. Alcan last week decided to close temporarily another 156,000 tonnes of ingot capacity in north America, Brazil and the UK. Fabricated product volumes reached new highs in the fourth quarter and 1993, but prices fell. Ingot shipments were lower in the fourth quarter but higher for the year. Prices, however, weakened. Operating results benefited from cost reductions and lower interest expenses. The year-on-year losses were reduced in Canada, Latin America and the Pacific area, but were higher in the US, Europe and elsewhere.</p>

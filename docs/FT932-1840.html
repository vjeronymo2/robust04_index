			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: Quality as key to survival of Europe's car industry Sir, Heaven help the European car industry if Carole Tongue (Letter, June 15) holds any sway within it. Has she not understood that the renaissance of the British motor industry owes everything to the infusion it has received of Japanese methods and working practices and nothing to do with the relatively low wages and long working hours in Britain? Is the European parliament unaware that the survival of the motor industry is precariously dependent upon arbitrary quotas being agreed with the Japanese to keep their imports within reasonable bounds? Long working hours have nothing to do with efficiency and competitiveness in a world market. It is the quality of work which counts and it is in this respect that Europeans, especially the British, have still to improve. A number of high labour content industries in Italy continue to move their plants to the Ukraine, to Tunisia and even to Albania in order to escape the consequences of unrealistically high social contributions which Italian politicians espouse and Italian manufacturers are having increasing difficulty in living with. Is it possible that the European parliament has not heard that BMW has been driven to open a plant in the US?

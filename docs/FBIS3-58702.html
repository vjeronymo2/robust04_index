			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Ghost at NATO's Feast"] </F>   [Text] "What really matters is Bosnia," said a senior  Clinton administration official quoted in the FINANCIAL TIMES  last September, discussing prospects for the NATO summit which  opens in Brussels today. If by January 10 NATO was "there, and  doing something," the summit would be a success. But if  Sarajevo had "gone down the tubes" it would be a failure.    January 10 is here, and NATO is not "there." At least, it is  no more there than it was in September. The headquarters unit  provided by NATO for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) is still  there, but the force is no more able than it was four months ago  to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo and other towns  from Serb shelling, which continued cynically through the  Christmas "truce," if anything at greater intensity than before.  In August NATO threatened air strikes if the "strangulation" of  Sarajevo continued. It persists but there have been no air  strikes.    The UN commander in Bosnia, General Francis Briquemont -- a  representative of NATO's host nation -- has just resigned,  "exhausted" after six months in the job and publicly deploring  the "fantastic gap" between UN Security Council resolutions,  "the will to execute those resolutions and the means available  to commanders in the field." The resolutions in question  authorise the use of "all necessary means" to ensure that relief  supplies reach their destination. Yet tanks intended for the  protection of UN troops trying to reopen the airport at Tuzla,  so that relief supplies can be flown in, are stranded at a base  in Serbia because Bosnian Serb leaders (against whose forces the  protection is required) are allowed to block their passage; and  the Serbian government extracts payment from the UN for allowing  supplies through, to offset the effect of sanctions which the UN  has itself imposed.  <H5>  Peace Agreement </H5>   When the U.S. official spoke in September of NATO being  "there, and doing something," she alluded to the plan for a NATO  force including 25,000 U.S. troops, to supervise the  implementation of a peace agreement between the three Bosnian  parties. Today not only does a peace agreement seem further off  than ever, but no one any longer believes, after the retreat  from Somalia and Haiti, that U.S. troops would be sent to Bosnia  even if a peace agreement were reached.    In short, while Sarajevo may not quite yet have disappeared  "down the tubes," in other respects conditions in Bosnia are  precisely those required for the NATO summit to be a failure.  Nor can NATO get away with blaming the UN for this state of  affairs. The same governments call the tune in both  organisations.  <H5>  Military Muscle </H5>   Only NATO could provide the political and military muscle  for  the UN to enforce its resolutions in Bosnia, and it has  conspicuously failed to do so. No wonder, then, that Central  European governments lack confidence in it. No wonder they  interpret the proposed Partnerships for Peace, not as a bold  strategy for gradually expanding NATO's zone of peace but as a  fudge, designed to avoid any risk of confrontation between NATO  and Russia.    Indeed who can expect that NATO would stand up to Russia if  it lacks the courage to stand up to Serbia and Croatia? Who can  be surprised, when Serbia is allowed to get away with ignoring  frontiers and forcibly moving populations in the name of ethnic  solidarity, that Russian leaders from Boris Yeltsin downwards  increasingly invoke the same principle in dealing with other ex-  Soviet republics, and seem increasingly disposed to defend the  involvement of Russian military units in conflicts beyond  Russian borders as a contribution to "stability" or even  "peacekeeping?"    Of course, Russia is not Serbia and Yeltsin is not  Milosevic.  There is still a chance that Russia under Mr Yeltsin's  leadership will remain democratic and friendly to the West.  NATO leaders do not want to jeopardise that chance, and  recognise that any Russian regime will be concerned with the  stability of Russia's neighbours, particularly those with large  ethnic Russian populations. But that does not mean they should  encourage anyone in Russia to think that such interests can be  asserted legitimately or with impunity by military force.  Further passivity in Bosnia is all too liable to have that  effect.</p>

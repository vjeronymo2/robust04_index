"Primarily it is necessary to make sure that the information  is correct and that it reflects the position of the Kazakh  Government and President Nursultan Nazarbayev," the minister's  first deputy (who accompanies Russian Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin during his official visit to Italy) emphasized.    "We have the kind of relations with Kazakhstan which allows  us to resolve our issues without mediation of ambassadors to  other states," Adamishin pointed out.    The premier's press secretary Anatoliy Sergeyev also  confirmed that the Russian premier currently in Rome had  received no official information on the Kazakh ambassador's  statement.</p>

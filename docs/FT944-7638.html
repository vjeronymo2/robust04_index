			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Nato action will prolong bloodshed, says Russia The second Nato air strike in Bosnia 'can lead to nothing but prolonged bloodshed,' the Russian foreign ministry warned yesterday in an apparent attempt to distance itself from the more aggressive policy recently adopted by the international community in the former Yugoslavia. 'We are seriously worried about the alarming new information from Bosnia,' Mr Grigory Karasin, the foreign ministry spokesman, told Itar-Tass newsagency. ' On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin had expressed cautious approval of the first air strike against an airbase which had been used by rebel Serbs to bombard the besieged town of Bihac. But in subsequent comments, Russian representatives qualified their support with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warning that further air strikes might prompt Russia to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from Bosnia. The Russian government is under increasing domestic pressure to act to limit foreign military intervention in the former Yugoslavia. The lower house of parliament yesterday passed a resolution urging Mr Yeltsin to use all possible means - including the exercise of Russia's veto in the UN security council - to halt military action in the Balkans. The resolution said although parliament recognised that the military action was within UN mandate it did not believe the air strikes were 'essential or appropriate'. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader of the Liberal Democratic party of Russia, has been trying to whip up opposition to the Russian government's support for UN policy saying it is unacceptable to use force to settle a political dispute. 'The conflict cannot be resolved by military means,' he said. Mr Kozyrev will tomorrow meet Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, in Bonn to express Russia's disquiet at the latest events in Bosnia and 'synchronise watches' for the foreign ministers' meeting on the former Yugoslavia.</p>

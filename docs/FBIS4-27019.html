			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 28 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton today became the first U.S. chief executive in American  history to set up a personal legal defense fund and ask  Americans to offer contributions to it, the White House  announced here today.    The fund limits contributions to 1,000 dollars per person  and  bars donations from corporations, unions and political action  committees, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told the  White House news briefing this afternoon.    "The President will be faced with potentially large legal  bills and it's in the best interest of the country for the  President to have those bills paid," Myers said.    Clinton's legal bills may top two million U.S. dollars a  year  to deal with mounting legal problems including a sexual  harassment suit and a federal investigation of the failed  Whitewater Development Corporation in the late 1980s, which the  Clintons half owned.    At a news briefing at the Washington office of the Sullivan  and Cromwell law firm, which will handle Clinton's legal defense  fund, the trustees said creating the fund was essential because  the legal bills facing the Clintons could be "enormous."    Estimates put the costs of legal bills at one million to two  million U.S. dollars a year or more.    However, the Clintons' 1993 income was just about 293,000  U.S. dollars. The couple's net worth is estimated at no more  than 1.6 million U.S. dollars, according to financial disclosure  forms.    The trustees who will organize the fund-raising effort  include Republicans as well as Democrats and they will be headed  by the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus of a  university, and Nicholas Katzenbach, a former U.S. attorney  general.    No previous U.S. president has had to face the enormous  personal legal expenses confronting President Clinton because of  current legal proceedings based on events that allegedly  occurred well before he took office, Hesburgh and Katzenbach  said in a joint statement.    "We believe it is in the public interest to assist the  President in meeting a financial burden that could otherwise  distract him from performing his public responsibilities," they  said in the statement.    The trust was established with a 2,000-dollar contribution  by  the Clintons. All donations will be considered gifts, not  income, and the Clintons will incur no tax obligation because of  them. The contributions are not deductible for income tax  purposes.    When all legal issues have been concluded and the trust is  terminated, any unused money will be paid to the Clintons, who  have agreed to donate it to charity or turn it over to the  federal government, according to the lawyers and trustees who  briefed reporters.    The organizers of the fund said the names and addresses of  the donors and amounts donated will be made public every six  months.</p>

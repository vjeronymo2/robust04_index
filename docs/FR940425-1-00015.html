Normal maintenance procedures call for operators periodically to check the RAT functionally by using airplane hydraulic pressure, pumped through the RAT, to spin the turbine. In the recently reported incidents, the turbine blade separations occurred from 1.5 to 2 minutes into the functional test. Investigation into the cause of the failures revealed that inadequately lubricated turbine bearings on the RAT's led to the separation of the turbine blade assembly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, there have been no mandatory replacement or refurbishment times for the RAT's installed on Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes. Under normal maintenance procedures, the RAT's are functionally tested, on the an average, every 48 months or 4,000 flights (at a ``D'' check). The RAT is replaced, refurbished, or repaired ``on condition'' only; that is, only if the RAT fails the functional test. In the reported incidents, the RAT's had not been serviced, nor had functional testing indicated that they needed servicing, since new. It is likely that RAT's have been on many other affected airplanes since delivery, with no servicing that would ensure adequate lubrication of the turbine bearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although all of the incidents of failure occurred while the airplane was on the ground undergoing routine functional testing of the RAT, the likelihood exists for these failures also to occur during flight, if the RAT were deployed during an emergency. The RAT is used during flight only in the event of failure of hydraulic power in all four hydraulic systems of the airplane; this would most likely occur in an ``all engines out'' situation. Separation of the turbine blade assembly on the RAT could result in damage to the RAT, the airplane structure, or systems, and could damage property or injure persons on the ground. Failure of the RAT during an ``all engines out'' emergency situation could result in complete loss of hydraulic power on the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Lockheed TriStar L&hyph;1011 Service Bulletin 093&hyph;29&hyph;098, dated December 6, 1993, that describes procedures for removing, disassembling, inspecting, testing, and servicing of the RAT. This service bulletin references Dowty Aerospace Hydraulics_Cheltenham Service Bulletin RAT16C10&hyph;29&hyph;168, dated December 1, 1993, as an additional source of service information for inspecting, testing, and servicing the RAT's. (Dowty is the manufacturer of the subject RAT's.) It also references Dowty Aerospace Hydraulics_Cheltenham Service Bulletin RAT16C10&hyph;29&hyph;154, Revision 1, dated September 15, 1993, which recommends overhauling the RAT every 8 years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require that operators initially either service the RAT (which entails removal, disassembly, inspection, and testing) in accordance with the Lockheed service bulletin described previously; or completely overhaul the RAT in accordance with the RAT Overhaul Manual. This proposal would also require revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to incorporate procedures to overhaul the RAT at 8-year intervals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 236 Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 117 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For operators electing initially to service the RAT, it would take approximately 48 work hours per airplane to accomplish those actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed servicing actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,640 per RAT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For operators electing initially to overhaul the RAT, it would take approximately 170 work hours per RAT to accomplish those actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed overhaul actions on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,350 per RAT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of work hours that would be required to perform either the servicing or overhaul of the RAT, as indicated above, is presented as if those actions were to be accomplished as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of any necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Incorporation of the proposed requirements of this AD into the FAA-approved maintenance program would require approximately 40 work hours per operator to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of incorporation of the proposed maintenance program change on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200 per operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

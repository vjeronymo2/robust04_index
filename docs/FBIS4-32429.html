			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on  22 June on pages 1 and 2 carries a 900-word interview with  Jaroslav Svechota, former deputy minister of interior, by Julius  Gembicky entitled "Jaroslav Svechota: I Do Not Own a Firm That  Would Shadow Politicians for Vladimir Meciar." In the  interview, which was held in a Bratislava cafe on 21 June,  Svechota responds to an interview given by Ludovit Cernak,  deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic  and chairman of the National Democratic Party, to the 17 June  issue of the East Slovak regional daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD,  claiming that a private firm run by Svechota was acting as an  "information and intelligence agency" for former Prime Minister  Meciar.    In the interview, Svechota asserts that he does not know  anything about the existence of such a firm. He tells the  interviewer that he is a partner in only two private firms, one  "dealing with agricultural production on restituted land in the  Dunajska Streda district" and the other a building firm, which,  however, "does not engage in any activity and does not have even  one koruna of turnover or profit." Asked how the suspicion of  his involvement in such a firm could arise, Svechota says: "It  may have its origin in Czech dailies, where a report appeared  that I was behind Vladimir Meciar's intelligence service. It is  a fabrication. I am engaged in neither intelligence nor  shadowing people." Svechota also denies that he has engaged in  any such activity at any time since leaving the Ministry of  Interior.    Asked about Cernak's possible motives for his assertions in  the SLOVENSKY VYCHOD interview, Svechota says: "We could find a  reply to this if we analyzed Mr. Cernak's contacts and  ascertained from where he might have such findings. But I  really do not know what his motives are." Pressed by the  interviewer to say what he means by Cernak's "contacts,"  Svechota then says: "I would not want to go into detail."    In conclusion, Svechota announces that he is going to sue  both the publisher of SLOVENSKY VYCHOD and Cernak.</p>

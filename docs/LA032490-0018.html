			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV'S 'FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS': IS IT DISGUISED CHILD ABUSE?  </P> <P> My, but isn't Mr. Rosenberg righteously upset over children being "injured" on  "Funniest Home Videos."  </P> <P> Never mind that there are thousands of incidents of murder and other violent  crimes, child abuse and abandonment, portrayed on television each year.  </P> <P> Now along comes genuine slices of life in "Funniest Videos," and Rosenberg  rises up to censure it on humanitarian grounds.  </P> <P> "Normal" TV and movies are far more destructive in their indoctrination than a  few home videos.  </P> <P> DANIEL A.

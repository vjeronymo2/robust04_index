			<p>BFN     [Text] The federal Government has reacted to a statement  credited to the Cameroonian foreign minister, Mr. Ferdinand  Oyono. Mr. Oyono is quoted to have said that his country is  prepared to go to war over the Bakassi Peninsula, a piece of  Nigerian territory which has been the subject of dispute. Mr.  Oyono is also quoted as having said that there could be an  outbreak of war anytime now.    In reacting to the Cameroonian minister's utterance, the  minister of state for foreign affairs, Chief Anthony Ani, said  the Nigerian Government considers the statement unnecessarily  belligerent and unfortunate, especially in the face of ongoing  efforts to resolve the matter amicably. Chief Ani also said it  is instructive that Mr. Oyono's threat was issued in Addis  Ababa, where a committee of OAU had risen from deliberations in  the finding of a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Chief Ani  has however warned that Nigeria's capability to protect its  territory and citizens should not be underestimated.</p>

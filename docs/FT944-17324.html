			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Lloyd's - who wins what? / Ralph Atkins analyses this week's High Court 'victory' for Names The anger of hard-hit Lloyd's Names was vented a little this week. The High Court's ruling that Gooda Walker Names - among the worst-affected members of the London insurance market - had been victims of negligent underwriting during the late 1980s reinforced many Names' arguments that some professionals who handed their money were incompetent and culpable. Beyond the sense of vindication, however, the benefits that aggrieved Names can reap following Tuesday's ruling are not clear. Although Mr Justice Phillips, the judge, was colourful in criticising the Gooda Walker underwriters, other cases in the legislative pipeline may not prove as strong. Phillips described the insurance 'spiral' in the Gooda Walker case, by which the underwriters agreed to cover others against excessive losses from catastrophes, as 'like a multiple game of pass the parcel'. His criticisms may encourage other 'spiral' cases, particularly Names on the Feltrim syndicates whose case begins later this month. But they do not set a precedent. The next batch of cases, for instance, concern a different set of losses - those arising from so-called long-tail liabilities: claims related to US asbestosis and pollution awards in the United States. These affect policies underwritten by syndicates as far back as the 1940s. Moreover, when Lloyd's last year appraised the strength of 31 legal cases pending in its attempts to forge a settlement between all sides embroiled in legal challenges, Sir Michael Kerr, a former High Court judge, found some were 'weak' or even 'hopeless'. Even when Names have a strong case, the justice system is unable to offer quick recompense. Gooda Walker is a good illustration: although the action group was quick to organise and had a relatively swift passage through court, it will still be months before the level of compensation is agreed. An appeal could delay any deal until next summer. By then, legal action would have taken more than two years to reach a conclusion. Other action groups do not even have a date for their cases to begin; many may have to wait until the end of the century. Another reason for caution in interpreting the Gooda Walker verdict is that damages awarded may fall well short of losses incurred by Names. Phillips said damages for the Gooda Walker Names should be based on losses sustained by the negligent conduct, rather than total losses. The action group estimates that will be worth Pounds 504m (compared with its claim of Pounds 629m), but lawyers for the defence describe that as speculative. One little-noticed feature of the Gooda Walker case, however, was the High Court's ruling that the Names involved should have some protection against losses resulting from catastrophes but which have not yet been reported. Yet, even if the Names win legal backing for compensation, they may not get their money back. This is because the Lloyd's agencies they are suing may not have sufficient 'errors and omissions' cover from which claims for negligence are paid. The best estimates in the Gooda Walker case suggest about Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m might be available - much of it underwritten by other Lloyd's Names. In total, E&amp;O cover for agencies being sued probably totals about Pounds 1bn - compared with total claims of about Pounds 3bn. In practice, that could mean some groups of Names receiving little more than they would have under Lloyd's Pounds 900m settlement offer which was rejected earlier this year. Josceline Grove, secretary of the Secretan Names Association - which is claiming Pounds 60m on behalf of 962 individuals in a case still some way down the legal queue - admits 'it is a race into court and the first groups could scoop the pool, leaving nothing for the rest'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by SELSKAYA ZHIZN scientific observer Leonid </F> Kruglov: "Departed From Life; Alarming Ecological Situation in  Russia Demands Urgent Action"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] National environmental  reports only became public here at the end of the eighties.  They contain specific information on the current state of our  environment. They cite data on the amount of harmful substances  discharged into the atmosphere, the pollution of soil and  drinking water sources, and the radiation situation. The  compilation of these reports is painstaking work performed every  year by environmental experts and specialists.    The Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and  Natural Resources recently published the latest State Report for  1992. In the preface to it, Minister V.I. Danilov-Danilyan  acknowledges that the state of the environment in Russia as a  whole is unsatisfactory: The atmosphere, water, and soil are  still being heavily polluted with gaseous, liquid, and solid  waste from industry and consumers alike. Moreover, as one  should expect, the general slump in output has not led to a  similar reduction in pollution, as enterprises in crisis have  begun to cut environmental protection costs. Thus the economic  situation in the country is aggravating the environmental  situation.    The facts cited in this document are not for those of a  nervous disposition. The volume of polluting substances  discharged into the atmosphere from stationary sources in Russia  alone amounts to 28.2 million tonnes. Highly toxic cyanides,  arsenic, fluorides, and heavy metal oxides are spewed from these  "volcanoes." Their emissions exceed the maximum permissible  concentration in the air basin of 171 cities. In Chita,  Taganrog, Lipetsk, Bratsk, and Ulyanovsk -- in fact, a total of  44 industrial centers in Russia -- the atmospheric pollution  index has reached a level dangerous to the health of millions of  people.    With one-quarter of the world's fresh water resources  concentrated in Lake Baykal, we are contriving to pollute these  crystal-clear waters with toxins from outmoded pulp and paper  combines. The fabled lake's own mechanism of biological  self-purification is on the brink of collapse. What then can  one say about ordinary reservoirs? In 1992, 39 percent of all  untreated sewage flowing into Russia's rivers was discharged  into the Volga basin alone.    Due to economic difficulties, the use of pesticides in  agriculture fell from 150,000 tonnes in the eighties to 100,000  tonnes in 1992. But supporters of the green movement have no  cause to celebrate. Russia uses tens, if not hundreds of  different types of toxic chemicals banned in the countries where  they are produced, but with a market here because of their low  price. They are extremely toxic. Moreover, these toxins have  the ability to accumulate in the soil for long periods of time.  Analysis shows that soil in Moscow Oblast and Irkutsk Oblast  still contains DDT, banned many years ago.    We will not try to explain what all these "curies" and other  units for measuring radiation levels mean. For the majority of  people, these scientific terms mean nothing, but their lives are  no easier for all that. As of January 1993, the territory  polluted with radioactive nuclides from Chernobyl -- cesium-137  averaging one to five "curies" per square kilometer -- includes  16 oblasts and Mordovia. A total of 21,861,000 people currently  live there, mainly villagers. By law, they are all due state  benefits and compensation. But who will guarantee that even  these few "curies" will not affect the health of future  generations? Once again, it seems, we are going to rely on the  Russian "maybe." Wait and see. But will we live to see?    Analysis of the information in the State Report allows us to  draw the uncomfortable conclusion that all these negative  ecological factors put together have led to a serious  deterioration in the environment in the main regions where tens  of millions of Russians live. Living there is dangerous, and  turning a blind eye is criminal.    No assurances and entreaties that everything will be better  in the future arouse enthusiasm in anyone anymore. We need a  long-term, single-minded program of action. From this point of  view, we would like to assess the constructiveness of the  Russian Presidential Edict "On the State Strategy of the Russian  Federation To Protect the Environment and Ensure Steady  Development," published in February this year. Is there, for  example, any real foundation to the government directive to  approve within two months a plan of action to protect the  environment in 1994-95?    The basic principles of the strategy, in the drafting of  which the Russian Federation Ministry of the Environment and  Natural Resources and the Russian Federation Security Council  Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety took part,  provide for the environmentally sound location and development  of industrial and agricultural enterprises; sustainable and  rational use of natural resources; protection of the environment  in areas of human habitation; the restoration of shattered  ecosystems; the utilization of waste; and other urgent measures  conducive to improvement of the environment in Russia.    The time given to implement the edict is extremely short.  There is much to do. Sources of pollution in environmental  "hotspots" -- areas where it is simply dangerous to live --  should be eliminated first and foremost. The state must make  all the necessary budgetary allocations. There is no  alternative when the nation's health is at stake.    It is up to the state to call those directly responsible for  environmental damage strictly to account. Anyone who breaks the  Russian Law on Protection of the Environment must be made to  pay. With the transition to market relations, sources of  investment in national environmental safety are broadening  considerably. The taxpayer is not obliged to pay for someone  else's economic mistakes. This also applies to the  agro-industrial complex.    Any producer -- however vital his product may be -- must be  placed in the situation where, because of the risk of being  ruined, it is to his disadvantage to engage in economic  operations which pollute rivers, soil, or atmosphere.    If the environment suffers, do not expect any return. This  principle must become mandatory for all. Sometimes, however,  this return is within arm's reach. Let us take a specific  example. Any poultry plant, apart from anything else, is a  major "supplier" of extremely valuable organic fertilizer. With  mineral fertilizers expensive and in short supply, it is  perfectly realistic to develop the technology of biothermal  processing of the droppings, thereby setting up production of  poudrette, fertility grains. Progressive private farms are  already successfully selling the surplus of this valuable  product to farms and kitchen gardens both here and abroad at a  considerable profit. At present, however, toxic waste from big  state poultry plants continues to pollute underground springs  and rivers, for which fines are paid amidst cries of being on  the brink of closure because of the high price of mixed feed.    The economic principle must form the basis of the mechanism  for the use of natural resources in our country. It is naive to  assume that the Ministry of the Environment and Natural  Resources is solely responsible for instilling order in this  respect. It certainly is not a departmental matter: It is a  matter of state.    The time for debates and discussions on the methods and  approaches to deciding upon a strategy of national environmental  salvation is long gone. It is time to act!    There is a scientific term: Survival. It concerns all  living beings, man included. People, like any other creature on  this planet, need clean air, unpolluted water, and good soil --  a source of food. Russia's citizens have a constitutional right  to a decent environment. This must not be forgotten in the face  of future generations.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Observer: Rights time Has anyone else noticed a point that the stock market appears to have overlooked in its generally enthusiastic response to George Wimpey's first ever rights issue? Sir John Quinton had been chairman of Barclays Bank for only nine months when he stunned the market by launching a Pounds 920m rights issue in early 1988, and we all know what happened after that. Now, six months after Quinton took the chair at Wimpey, it is asking its shareholders for money. No doubt it is all for a jolly good cause. But when it comes to losing other people's money and replenishing it with rights issues, Britain's bankers are in a class of their own.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US poses new Gatt quandary - Washington and environmentalists have objected to proposals for a new trade organisation A TIDY-MINDED after-thought to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks has become yet another obstacle to completion of the stuttering six-year-old negotiations. US objections to proposals for a powerful new trade institution to implement the Round's results are set against the backdrop of an aggressive campaign against the provisionally named Multilateral Trade Organisation by environmental groups, especially in the US where a final Uruguay Round package, due next February, faces a rough ride through Congress. US officials last week infuriated trading partners in Geneva by suggesting that the MTO could be ditched, leaving the present General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to administer the 28 or so Uruguay Round accords spanning virtually all world trade in goods, services and ideas (intellectual property such as patents, copyrights and trademarks). After 45 years Gatt is still only a provisional contractual arrangement, after refusal by the US Congress in 1948 to ratify the International Trade Organisation, its legal parent. The MTO, first mooted by Canada and the European Community in 1990, would give the agreements the status of international law and concrete form to the idea of the Round as a 'single undertaking' - to which all 108 participants must subscribe in its entirety. It would subsume Gatt itself, proposed sister bodies on services and intellectual property, and the now voluntary Gatt codes on anti-dumping, technical barriers to trade and so on. It would operate a common dispute settlement mechanism with the possibility of 'cross-retaliation' between sectors. US officials deny they are deliberately throwing a spanner in the works and say trading partners were alerted months ago that Washington had problems with the MTO draft text. 'We're not closing the door on an MTO,' says a senior official. 'But we have to negotiate changes.' Washington's main worries relate not to the MTO's status as an international treaty, as some have suggested, but to draft rules that override existing Gatt obligations or alter deals negotiated in the Round. These concern voting procedures on amendments to international trade rules - which, unlike existing Gatt rules, would oblige dissenting countries to accept changes approved by a two-thirds majority - and the rights of countries to waive agreed rules or withhold their benefits from trading partners ('non-application'). Thus the draft agreement on intellectual property does not permit countries to opt out of its provisions. The draft MTO text does. US officials say if other countries are unwilling to renegotiate the MTO rules it would still be possible to implement the Uruguay Round as a 'single undertaking', including an integrated dispute settlement mechanism, by means of a ministerial declaration and accompanying protocol. Environmentalists, for their part, argue that a powerful MTO, its policies formulated by trade bureaucrats behind closed doors, will trample on government efforts to protect the environment and promote sustainable development, by giving priority to unconstrained free trade. They fear, among other things, that it will force a 'levelling down' of environmental, consumer and safety standards by making it easier to challenge high standards as barriers to trade. US negotiators say they are seeking 'clarifications' to draft rules on food safety regulations and technical standards that would endorse the right of governments to set standards above international norms. Some European governments support this. However, this alone is unlikely to placate the environment lobby which wants a wholesale 'greening' of the MTO text including a commitment to sustainable development. Another MTO problem concerns membership. Nearly 40 small developing countries which have not taken a full part in the Geneva negotiations could find themselves excluded because they have not made offers to liberalise trade in goods and services. Worse, Brussels is pondering whether the EC rather than member states should become a member of the MTO. At present, it speaks in Gatt on behalf of members, which are individual contracting parties. However, the EC does not run a common regime on trade in services as it does for goods - so it is open to dispute whether it can speak on behalf of member states in services.</p>

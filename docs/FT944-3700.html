			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Personal View: Airports owner bad for its customers BAA, the privatised company that owns London's three airports, has been a profitable investment for its shareholders. Its share price has risen fourfold since BAA was privatised in 1987. What makes it especially attractive is the virtually guaranteed return on capital allowed to the company by its regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority. But while BAA's shareholders have done well, the same cannot be said for its customers. Airport charges and rents are generally higher in the UK than in the US. All airport revenue ultimately comes from airline customers, whether passengers or cargo, in higher air fares. High charges also hit airline profitability, which is often lower than that of the airports they use. Last year, for example, Heathrow airport's return on capital was 26 per cent higher than that of British Airways. This is despite heavy revaluations of BAA's assets such as runways and terminal buildings that have much longer operational lives than aircraft. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission was dissatisfied with the effectiveness of regulation when it last reviewed BAA in 1991. The commission concluded that it would be useful to reconsider whether 'to substitute a degree of competition for the present system of regulation'. One commission member, Mr Graham Mather, went further, arguing that BAA should be forced to divest one of the London airports 'sooner rather than later'. But it is doubtful whether simply breaking up BAA in this way would be the answer, since it is hard to introduce competition in the airport market. Different airports are not comparable products: demand for extra capacity at Heathrow cannot be satisfied by offering lowercharges at Gatwick or Stansted. Furthermore, the planning system limits the extent to which capacity can be increased to satisfy demand. Whoever owns Heathrow, can effectively act as a monopolist. International conventions such as the Bermuda 2 agreement between the US and the UK specify that airport charges should not be set by supply and demand. The fundamental principle of the 1985 Airports White Paper was that 'airports are not an end in themselves: they exist to support air services'. Airport charges should therefore be cost-related and allow for only 'reasonable' profits. Deciding what is a reasonable level for profits depends on the cost of capital that BAA is allowed to assume in setting charges. BAA told the MMC in 1991 that it was a high-risk business, an argument the MMC appeared to accept in allowing a generous price cap for airport charges between 1992 and 1997. In assessing reasonable profits, the MMC looked to the dividend yield on BAA's shares. But this is like looking into a mirror; investors value highly the regulator's implied guaranteed rate of return and push up the share price. To the regulator, the high share price implies that investors require higher profits. A false market is thus created. The MMC sets the maximum charges for the London airports on the assumption that BAA needed a return on the current cost of its capital of 8 per cent. This is the same as nationalised industries, where the Treasury uses demanding current cost targets that force them to finance investment from user charges as far as possible. But this is not appropriate for a private company which can finance investment from borrowing. Unusually for such a company, BAA has been able to finance its airport investment programme from cashflow. Since 1991, BAA's capital expenditure has totalled more than Pounds 1bn, equivalent to operating cash flow after net interest payments, all of which comes from the airlines and their customers. There has been an increase in external financing - mainly borrowings. But this is much the same as the amount paid by BAA to its shareholders. The regulator should review BAA's position as a monopoly supplier of capital to its London airports. One answer is market-testing to find out whether other companies would be prepared to accept a lower return on capital than BAA to finance airport improvements. This could be done using techniques being developed for the government's private finance initiative, by inviting bids for new projects from outside investors and banks. If this led to lower costs of capital, it would put downward pressure on airport charges and help improve airline profitability. If BAA were to be privatised today, it would be in a very different form. Simply putting BAA in the private sector with a quasi-guaranteed return on an ever-expanding asset based is not a long-term answer.

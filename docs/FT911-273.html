			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Sunday trading appeal to Law Lords today THE LONG legal battle over Sunday trading in England and Wales will enter its final stage today when the Law Lords begin hearing an appeal by B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself chain, which will determine whether the Sunday trading laws are incompatible with European law. B&amp;Q is appealing against a ruling by Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High Court last July that the 1950 Shops Act, which governs Sunday trading, does not contravene the free-trade principles of European Community law. The case concerns High Court injunctions granted to two councils banning B&amp;Q from opening its stores at Norwich and Stoke on Trent on Sundays. The Shops Act makes local authorities the prosecuting bodies for breaches of the law. As a result enforcement is patchy across the country. Some councils pursue any breach of the law while others turn a blind eye. The maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine for any one store on any one Sunday. Local authorities can also seek High Court injunctions to prevent breaches of the Shops Act. Because some stores can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year from opening on Sundays, the Pounds 1,000 penalty has not proved an effective deterrent. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions as the best way of banning Sunday trading over the past two years. Two weeks ago, however, the effectiveness of these injunctions was thrown into doubt by a High Court ruling that they should not be granted to local authorities unless they were prepared to give cross-undertakings to the court that if they eventually lost their case they would compensate the stores for any financial losses resulting from enforced Sunday closure. Council lawyers say because of the potential financial risks involved in giving cross-undertakings this decision makes the Sunday trading laws virtually unenforceable. Last week, for example, Texas Homecare, the DIY chain run by the Ladbroke Group, raised the pressure on six local authorities by stating that they could face a potential claim for damages in excess of Pounds 150,000 per year for each store where Texas had given cross-undertakings not to trade. The DIY chain asked the authorities to confirm that such an amount had been reserved in their budgets. B&amp;Q will argue before the Law Lords that the Shops Act is incompatible with Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which prevents quantitative restrictions on imports between member states of the EC. Retailers claim that the Sunday trading ban reduces their turnover and results in fewer orders for goods from suppliers in other member states, thereby indirectly restricting the level of imports into the UK from those states. The issue has already been referred once to the European Court. In November 1989 the Court ruled the Shops Act would not be compatible with Article 30 unless the Sunday trading ban had an objective regarded as justified in EC law and the effect on trade caused by the measure did not exceed that necessary to obtain that objective. This left the UK courts with considerable discretion which has only succeeded in increasing the confusion surrounding the Sunday trading laws. Both the Home Office and the British Retailers' Association (BRA) have launched separate initiatives to try to establish common ground between the two sides.</p>

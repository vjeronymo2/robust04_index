			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Patents Law"] </F>   [Text] The Uruguay Round of GATT talks agreement signed by  111 nations, including Argentina, will make it easier to modify  our country's patents law, an issue confronting strong interests  and on which there are notorious international pressures.    It is now certain that pharmaceutical patents, which  currently are not recognized in our legislation, will be  regulated by law in the future. What is being discussed at this  time is the extent of adaptation periods and the way to exploit  patents.    The long-lasting argument on the issue has acquired  international importance in the past few years. The boom in  science and technology, the huge amounts used in research and  invention -- particularly in developed nations, and the size of  the pharmaceutical market have brought the issue to the fore on  nations' negotiating agenda.    One after another, all developed nations have recognized  this  right and joined other nations in their demand for recognition  from developing nations, which, in general, have tried to  maintain permissive policies allowing local companies -- even  though this is not the purpose -- to go without paying  intellectual rights on inventions and, more generically,  everything included under the definition of intellectual  property rights.    In our country, the central issue is medicinal patents on  formulas and fabrication procedures, which often are used  without paying royalties. Sometimes the violation involves local  production, other times it derives from the importation of  medicines from nations that do not recognize those rights, even  though this market has become narrower and narrower because of  the increasing number of countries that recognize patents rights  in their legislation.    The Uruguay Round of GATT talks not only commits all parties  to recognize patents rights, but also establishes a 20-year  period for exploitation starting from the date the application  is presented. The study of the case, however, can last several  years. The agreement also defines the general basis for  exploitation in case the owner does not do it on his own. Among  other things it establishes that developing nations will have 10  years to fully adapt and comply.    The GATT agreement must be ratified by the legislatures of  at  least 33 nations before it becomes effective, including the U.S.  and Argentine Congresses. It is reasonable, however, to take  GATT dispositions as the future international rule.    What we are discussing today then is not the legitimacy of  patents but the terms for recognition, which constitutes  important progress. The draft bill the executive branch sent to  Congress three years ago recognizes patents in accordance with  the GATT agreement, although proposing firmer terms for  negotiating between parties and adaptation periods that are  closer to U.S. Government goals.    In Washington, meanwhile, the period for conclusion of an  administrative investigation that could derive from the  application of compensatory rights on Argentine exports for  damage against U.S. patent owners, which could be for some $110  million annually, is running out.    The problem now is limited to negotiations between the  Argentine and U.S. Governments and between the national  executive and legislative branches. The most convenient and  reasonable thing, considering the ironing out of difficulties  carried out by GATT, is to try approving an agreement on pending  issues quickly.    Formally, Argentina does not have any reason to approve  legislation going beyond what has been agreed on at GATT. But  there is a reality that must be recognized: the need to insert  the country into the world community. Here the recognition of  intellectual property rights is a rule of good partnership. The  United States, in turn, should take into account that the  implementation of commercial sanctions cannot exceed what is  established by GATT, and the new World Trade Organization has  the authority to mediate between conflicting parties.</p>

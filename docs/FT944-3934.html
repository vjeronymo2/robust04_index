			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lucas raises Pounds 56m for US purchase Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components group, yesterday raised Pounds 56m through the placing with institutions of 29m new shares at 193p. The placing followed the completion in the US of its acquisition for Dollars 87m (Pounds 53m) of Lake Center Industries from Guy F Atkinson. The company brings with it Dollars 13m of debt and its consolidation by Lucas will involve the write-off of Dollars 51m of goodwill. The shares closed down by 7p at 195p. The decision to finance the purchase of LCI by a share issue reflects Lucas's concern not to extend its gearing, which during its last financial year fell to 39 per cent from 46 per cent. The group is engaged in strengthening core businesses and selling peripheral interests. LCI, with control panels among its products, fits into Lucas Body Systems. Lucas also said that it expects by the end of this month to have settled the criminal aspects of its dispute over contract compliance with the US government. It made provision of Pounds 87.6m, which it insists is adequate, to cover the costs of both restructuring and the litigation. Overall, Lucas has started its current year in encouraging fashion with first quarter sales showing a 12 per cent improvement on the comparable period.</p>

Anhui has employed more than 420 foreign experts whose  assistance has generated 120 million yuan in extra economic  returns over the past eight years.    The grain-basket province has also imported advanced  cultivation technology, quality breeding stocks and other  applied farming technologies to promote high-yielding  agriculture with quality produce.    Last year Anhui spread the use of a rice cultivation and  growing technique from Japan to one third of the province,  achieving a ten percent output increase per mu (one mu is 0.1647  ha [hectare]).    The Fuyang region benefited from the skills of a Japanese  expert in growing apples. More than 700 kg of apples are now  harvested per mu, a one-third increase. The region has devoted  40,000 mu to growing the fruit.    Emphasis has meanwhile been placed on updating and retooling  major state-owned enterprises.    A leather factory in Anqing employed 15 foreign experts to  improve its technology and management skills, enabling its  products to enter the world market and increase its annual  output value by one million yuan.    "The key to success is using the talents of foreign experts  to develop the local economy," said Zhang Mingxiang, deputy  director of the province's Foreign Experts Office.    To date, Anhui has fostered close co-operative ties with  countries like Japan, Germany, France, the United States and  Canada.    Zhang said his office is planning to recruit more experts,  including overseas Chinese, from more countries and regions to  help modernize Anhui's major enterprises and agriculture.</p>

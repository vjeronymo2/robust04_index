			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: ABB wins Indian locomotive deal ABB Transportation Systems, part of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has won a deal worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133.3m) to transfer mainline electric locomotive technology to Indian Railways, Andrew Baxter writes from London. The deal, signed with India's Ministry of Railways, will be largely financed by the Asian Development Bank and covers technology transfer and delivery of 30 locomotives. The 10-year agreement means India will become the first Asian country to have three-phase drive locomotive technology, incorporating sophisticated electronics and microprocessor control. It is the first time that ABB has granted a licence outside the company for the three-phase drive techn-ology. A three-phase motor does not need a commutator, is lighter than conventional electric motors and more economical.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Gardening: Close encounters with top-class growers CONTEMPLATING the features of my colleague, Robin Lane Fox, swollen with rage after his rail journey, I was glad of my decision to parachute into Hampton Court Flower Show. Europe's largest flower show is a daunting prospect, even if it is laid out much more spaciously than Chelsea. The non-gardener might conceivably have a better time at Chelsea's eclectic rival. There is a vast craft village populated with people selling such mysterious items as Sugan kitchen chairs made to an ancient Celtic design, and Karom boards. Husband and wife teams sell personalised copies of their novels and pressed steel sculptures of 'mystic warriors'. If, however, it is plants and nurserymen you want to see, there are eight floral marquees crammed with vendors, eager to sell - and talk. Maybe the exhibitors in May were just too hot this year to relish a grilling, but this year, for once, I left Chelsea feeling rather starved of the kind of close contact with top-class growers which makes the show more than just a spectacle. Under Royal Horticultural Society rules, Chelsea exhibitors must wear jackets and ties. At Hampton Court, anything goes. As the well-dressed David Pickard, of Meadowcroft Fuschias in Cambridgeshire said: 'Chelsea is the gentleman's event.' I celebrated the freedom to buy on-the-spot with two of Pickard's ivy-leaved geraniums, the variegated-leaf L'Elegant and Barbe-Bleu, a fabulous dark cherry-red which should be more widely-grown (ring 0487-823333) . In the marquee given over to the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, I had my first deep discussion at the Norfolk Lavender stand (0485-70384). Munstead and Hidcote are the lavenders everyone knows, and every one sells. But are they really the right foil for old roses, or is the purple just too eye-catching? Now I think I have the answer in Sawyers, new last year when it was introduced by Norfolk Lavender. The flowers are spear-shaped and a paler shade of blue, without being dull. Sawyers grows to 27in, has a long flowering season and it is as hardy as any lavender can be. Its leaf is a good grey and bare-rooted stock costs Pounds 2.20. Anyone who has wasted money on foxtail lilies, eremurus, will appreciate my envy at Rupert Bowlby's prize-winning stand (0737-642221). How is one to achieve, year after year, those gorgeous June-flowering spikes in shades of yellow, orange, and apricot? Best to play safe, was the advice, and look not at the hybrids but at the earlier flowering E. himalaicus, which is white, and robustus, pink and flowering in June. Apparently, they are one of the lesser-known delights of travelling from Samarkand to the Himalayas and as that would imply, they are happy to be baked in summer and frozen all winter. They even relish heavy clay. With a large budget, one might be tempted by Bowlby's new introduction, Allium 'Beau Regarde'. It is probably a cross between christophii and giganteum, and it looks almost alarming hefty, with heads a full 6in across. The price is equally hefty, Pounds 18 a bulb. Wait a few years, and this bloated onion should eventually be ours for just a few pounds. Still thinking about expensive but troublesome bulbs, I had bearded two helpful Dutchmen from the combined Warmenhoven and de Groot stand (20, Purbrock Avenue, Watford, WD2 6AD). Amaryllis (hippeastrums, properly) and crown imperials are not foolproof, but they are exquisite, especially the former which are appearing in ever more delicious shades. With hippeastrums, the answer is to choose a pot size only 20 per cent larger than the bulb, and to plant them half under the soil, immediately they arrive in September or October - no later. Then give them a frequent meal of Phostrogen and expect, in almost every case, two stems with six flowers. Could I economise and hope to enjoy the same display another year? Possibly, is the answer, but only at the price of remembering to feed weekly for seven months. Life is perhaps too short. As for that other show-stopper, Crown Imperial, their short lives are nine times out of ten, due to the ravages of slugs. Rats, they always say, are put off by the foxy smell but slugs like nothing better. My helpful Dutchman told me that the answer was plenty of sand around the bulb to deter the beasts, although the soil must be good and rich. So does Hampton Court or any flower show justify its entry fee? Ask shrewdly, and, in my opinion, it should.</p>

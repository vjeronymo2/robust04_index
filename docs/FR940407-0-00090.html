			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. General Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Detailed vs. General Guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters felt that the EIP proposal was overly specific and limited flexibility. These commenters contended that it would be difficult for EPA guidance to anticipate and identify all of the specific elements of proposed programs that might be approvable until actual programs are developed and adopted. They felt that the final EIP rules should be limited to a detailed policy statement and discussion of principles and criteria to which EIP's must adhere rather than specific guidance on how EIP programs should be designed and administered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters, including a State and an environmental group, felt that the final rules should include more detailed guidance. One such commenter felt that without more detailed guidance, technical questions such as how to calculate emissions reductions or to establish baselines might be so daunting as to discourage attempts to develop EIP's. This commenter felt that the need for such guidance is particularly great for EIP's relying on area and mobile source emissions reductions. Another such commenter felt that without more detailed guidance spelling out appropriate design criteria and policy and legal limitations, States will succumb to pressures to develop EIP's that do not effectively implement the requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters on both sides of this issue recommended that the EPA provide examples of successful, appropriate EIP's. Such commenters recommended that such information be provided through supplemental documentation or through an EPA-established EIP information clearinghouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just as an individual State EIP rule should balance flexibility with specificity, the EPA's final EIP rules should do the same. Thus, the final rules retain the balance between general statements of principles and criteria and specific detailed guidance on technical requirements that was reflected in the proposal. The final rules provide sufficient detail to allow States to design and implement EIP's that will effectively implement the requirements of the Act without defeating the purpose of capturing the benefits of market-based regulatory approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the final rules do not include specific examples of EIP's that have been successfully implemented, the EPA agrees that such information is a useful and important aspect of encouraging the development of such programs. For the last 3 years, the EPA has funded grants to support market-based initiatives by State, regional and local agencies. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All such initiatives have included strong involvement from the State, affected local interests, and the relevant EPA Regional Office(s). Final reports from these projects are available from the States to further the EPA's goal of disseminating information about the design and implementation of EIP's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The docket contains summaries of such programs and contacts for information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beyond this grant program, the EPA is committed to working with individual States as they develop EIP's. In addition to the program survey documents which have been placed in the docket, the EPA is developing plans for future outreach activities to make information about successful EIP initiatives as broadly available as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Administrative Simplicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters agreed that administrative complexity can be one of the greatest impediments to a regulation and urged the EPA to simplify the terms and processes of these rules. Such commenters felt that undue administrative complexity would stifle the development of EIP's and provide a significant disincentive for participation in trading programs. These commenters generally felt that the EIP rules should minimize regulatory barriers because they interfere with the functioning of desirable market mechanisms which are necessary for the success of the EIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One type of complexity cited by two State commenters related to excessive government process, and the associated lack of timeliness, in the review of individual emissions trades. These commenters recommended that individual emissions trading transactions not be required to be submitted to the EPA for review once a State's generic trading rule has been approved by the EPA. Further, one such commenter recommended more focus on the audit and evaluation of an EIP program, rather than on administrative burdens upfront in implementing emissions trades. This commenter felt that the EPA should have the authority to conduct periodic audits of emissions trading transactions approved by the States to assure the integrity of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

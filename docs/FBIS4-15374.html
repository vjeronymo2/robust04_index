			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Leonid Kravchuk from </F> the Market Reforms Press Center in Kiev by Volodymyr Kuzmenko;  date not given -- all of Kravchuk's comments are recorded]    [Text] [Kuzmenko] So, one of the first questions to the  president was this: After December 1991, the society of Ukraine  has suffered many delusions. In connection with this, which one  of them has proved to be the most harmful? This is how Leonid  Kravchuk answered:    [Kravchuk] Our greatest delusion was the euphoria of a quick  resolution of any problems posed by life. It seems to me that  euphoria is a product of little or insufficient knowledge of the  situation: The less one knows about this or that subject --  this, incidentally, is a philosophical interpretation --the  simpler and (?very much clearer) everything seems to one. So, I  would like to repeat this, the euphoria of the possibility to  resolve any problems quickly due to insufficient knowledge or  information of a distorted nature, is the greatest danger.    [Kuzmenko] Quite acute, I think, was a question asking the  president whether he was not ashamed at Ukrainian Acting Prime  Minister Yefim Zvyahilskiy's actions. The journalist's opinion  was that these actions were antimarket.    [Kravchuk] I would like to specify one detail. The  Zvyahilskiy government as such is nonexistent. This is the  government which was left by Prime Minister Kuchma. This  government, in its full composition, was not reshuffled. Taking  into account the situation which took shape on the eve of the  new elections, we considered it to be inexpedient [to change the  government]. In other words, as the president, it seemed to me  that the majority of deputies at first agreed to the fact that  it would just be inexpedient to form a new government for six  months, because it is clear that the new parliament would form a  new government. And this is only natural.    I cannot say that I am ashamed of the Zvyahilskiy government  because, despite the situation, it is exactly now, although with  difficulty, that the reform began to make its first steps and we  began to earn some currency to pay Russia for the power sources.  But the real fact is that the first steps toward reforms,  toward privatization, toward... [pauses] We are on the eve of  possible... [pauses] preparation of the monetary reform. This  is a reality. This is why now one cannot blame the government  that works... [pauses] that we must be ashamed of it. I would  not like to discuss and use such categories altogether. Every  government is doing what it can. It cannot do more than that.  The next government will probably do more, I am convinced of  this.    [Kuzmenko] Answering the question on a concept of economic  independence for Ukraine's separate regions, President Kravchuk  said:    [Kravchuk] I adhere to the idea that regions should have the  broadest possible economic independence. This refers to the  mobilization of incomes, the administration of incomes,  budgetary relations, the use of property, if this is the state  property, the management of the property. Everything which has  to do with production and social relations... [pauses] and they  should have appropriate legally approved sources of receipts and  they should work without the center.    As far as political federalization is concerned, I believe  that this issue is premature. I do not rule out a possibility  of working out political institutions, too, in future, on the  basis of working out mechanisms of economic independence. But  to raise the issue on complete federalization of our, for  example, state today, immediately... [pauses] Well, first, this  is objectively impracticable and, second, this could certainly  affect both the reforms and all other political and economic  processes, even to endanger the possibility of preserving the  integrity of the state as such.    [Kuzmenko] In the context of this, the Market Reforms Press  Club's sitting did not abstain from topical questions on the  subject of Crimea. Explaining his position on this issue, the  Ukrainian president said:    [Kravchuk] I favor the idea of granting the broadest  possible  economic powers to Crimea. I had a talk with the president,  with [word indistinct] Saburov on these issues. I understand  that it would not be easy to coordinate their economic  independence with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine.  However, there is the president's decree on granting relevant  economic status to Crimea. Such a decree does exist, and  proceeding from this decree and the law on the delimitation of  plenary powers between Ukraine and Crimea, I believe that it is  necessary to conduct a flexible policy here. One can even say  that we could consider Crimea as a testing ground for economic  reforms, if they would have been carried out there.    As far as other issues are concerned, now noneconomic  issues are being aggravated. Not a single economic decree has  been issued in Crimea so far, and no economic decisions have  been made either. There is a decree on a referendum, we had to  revoke it; a decree on changing over to Moscow time; and a  groundless dismissal of Astakhov from the post of the chairman  of the TV and radio company [of Crimea]. By the way, today I  rescinded this decree by Meshkov. That is to say, excuse me for  saying this, there is a political intrigue. There is a gross  violation of the legislation by the president of Crimea, and not  only the legislation of Ukraine, but his own legislation,  according to the principle: There is the president, the people,  and God. This is a dangerous stand, a dangerous policy. I  believe that this is just some kind of misunderstanding. Maybe,  these are the first steps of euphoria. I am waiting for this to  stop. This cannot last forever. As far as economy is  concerned, I am ready, and I again say we and the government are  all ready to consider the issue so that the economy of Crimea  would work in the interests of the people.    [Kuzmenko] Among the questions asked at the meeting, was the  following: What importance and significance does the president  attach to private capital in Ukraine's market reforms, and what  is the role this capital can play in the sphere of the economy  in the very near future? Here is how Mr. Kravchuk explained it:    [Kravchuk] There cannot be a real, civilized market without  private ownership, without private capital and accordingly  without banks and without financial structures. I am in favor  of resolutely going in this direction. Resolutely!    What needs to be done, let us say, in terms of privatization  in the broad sense of the word is the Supreme Council should  adopt a provision that land together with the facilities can be  an object of purchase and sale. This is the one thing that  needs to be done.    I issued a directive stating that we were to sell  incomplete-  construction together with the land. Immediately, the land code  was amended stopping it. That is, this is unrealistic until  there is clarity on this issue, in parliament and executive  power and at local authorities, that land is an object of  purchase and sale together with the facilities built on it.    [Kuzmenko] The Ukrainian president said that inconsistent,  irregular progress along the path of reforms was primarily  caused by the government's ineffective actions. A correspondent  asked the president a question about the idea of cancelling the  early presidential election [on 26 June]. This is how Leonid  Kravchuk commented on this situation:    [Kravchuk] I do not wish to alter my point of view. I  expressed myself in favor of both early parliamentary and  presidential elections. I am not altering this position. I  only repeat that one cannot do the electing without knowing who  to elect. This is why my view is this: The new parliament, I  once again emphasize, cannot stand aside. It is simply  impossible to imagine that there already is a new parliament.  The election is drawing nearer and parliament is not voicing its  view. It must express itself prior to the election on  principle. This purely is a parliamentary prerogative. People  are (?demanding this).    The status of the president is to be determined. The main  parameters of executive power, its plenary and functional  powers, and cooperation, are to be determined at constitutional  level. This has to be a constitutional law. It cannot be  otherwise. And only then, an election is to be appointed. That  is all. If they manage to have it done by 26 June, the  presidential election will go ahead on 26 June. But what if  not? The new parliament all of sudden says: Let the president  be elected on the basis of the powers that exist today under the  old law. Well, there will be an election then. What else can  be done?    One should, however, forecast the situation that there will  be tomorrow. What can this lead to? One can take a purely  legal stand and say: We adopted and signed [a decree on the  presidential election], so let us execute it and not a step  backwards. Can this be done? Yes, it can. But the situation  has changed in time. Look at what difficulties have arisen in  the economy and what processes have begun regionally, for  instance, in Crimea and all. Not to see all this and not to  take all this into consideration and just to say there should be  elections for the sake of elections, I cannot.    I do not decide. As president, however, I cannot be silent  and not tell the people what has happened and what can happen.  I have my personal view, but I do not decide it. The election  must take place, but with the powers and functions expressly  determined at constitutional level with the participation of the  new parliament. Nobody will make me change my mind. If this is  to be without me, let them decide. After all, I am not blocking  these processes.    [Kuzmenko] It is known that Ukraine is preparing to  introduce  its own currency unit. In this connection, the president said  the transition to the hryvnya would be open and would take  account of the interests of all Ukrainian citizens.    [Kravchuk] There is another problem which is that of the  hryvnya's stabilization fund. When we settle all the issues  with the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and manage to clarify  all those budgetary and other matters, the IMF will grant us a  stabilization credit. This is very important and it will be  hard to work without this.    I would still like to return to commodity bonds. The  Supreme Council vetoed them. There were opportune remarks. We  now have worked this document over and its character now is  entirely different. We have set up Ukraine's Credit Fund, which  will specifically deal with attracting credit, including through  commodity bonds of Ukraine's material resources rather than its  national ones. It will be entities engaging in economic  activity that will be responsible for the credit granted, rather  than the whole of Ukraine, who was granted responsibility for  it. That is, a clearer and more understandable mechanism has  been worked out and it should be put into practice because  credits have to be attracted. This money will primarily be  invested, because it will have to be returned at a relatively  low interest rate of up to around 7 percent, which is a normal  international interest rate.</p>

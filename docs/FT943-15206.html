			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Sport: Oh so nice not having to care The fun of this World Cup has been that I can take it or leave it. Caring too much about sport can literally make me ill: I smoked 30 cigarettes in two hours during the last frames of the snooker World Championships earlier this year, so desperate was I for Jimmy White to win. And the 1990 World Cup, glorious though it was, gave me perhaps one minute of pure pleasure within far too many hours of churning stomach pains. However good this year's competition has been, the best thing about it has probably been the fact that England are not there. I want to care about sport but I panic when the caring is a primitive, unstoppable thing, as it was when I watched England in Italia 90. I cared so much that I had no control over my feelings. The misery that this caused made me marvel at the people who willingly submit themselves to this degree of emotion every Saturday of the football season. Of course, occasions such as the last World Cup are the ones that make sport worth engaging with. Never, never shall I forget the sensation that I felt when David Platt scored in the last minutes of England's game against Belgium: it was as if the whole of myself had been hurled into the net along with the ball. Obviously this World Cup has contained nothing comparable, indeed nothing very much at all that I shall remember. But it has produced an easy stream of lesser emotions. Not the least of these has been a rather mean-minded schadenfreude: a comfortable delight in observing the suffering of more successful teams than England, and in seeing their fans go through what I went through four years ago. Yet one has to care a bit. Otherwise football matches, however exalted, would be almost always unwatchable. The English - and probably every other nation - are masters at fabricating preferences for themselves. This becomes ridiculous when the pretence at caring turns into a reality, and people find that they are worked up about something for which they have no real feeling (like the tennis career of Jeremy Bates, which engages most of its followers for only two weeks of the year). Still, to care when one can choose to stop caring is extremely pleasurable. Hence England's interest in the Irish team. How much do the English really care about Ireland? Not very much at all. But the progress of the Irish gave England a pretend stake in the World Cup: they could watch, patronise, be generous, make jokes about the England B team, care and then suddenly not have to care at all. A transient relationship, undemanding and thus unrewarding - as such things always are - but far more enjoyable, in its way, than the inescapable anguish of love. If England had been in the World Cup how, for example, would I have felt about those mad referees that have become the competition's talking point? Without England, I admit that they have been a source of comedy. It is the difference between having a row with a traffic warden, and watching somebody else have a row with a traffic warden. The first arouses an unbearable, frustrated anger; the second arouses sympathy, but also an appalled hilarity. If England had been one of the teams in that Bulgaria-Mexico match, the one in which that Syrian referee was producing cards from his pocket like a malfunctioning robot magician, on the following day I should have been deliberately starting conversations with taxi drivers in order to get rid of my molten reserves of fire. Distanced as I was, however, I could not help but enjoy this magnificent farce that was being played out for me. But it is all wrong, of course. Players can climb towards these few games for four years, and then be thrown back to the ground by the whimsical gesture of a power-crazed petty official who is probably consumed with jealousy for their youth, wealth and talent. And what power these officials have] In tennis, if a referee makes what a player considers to be a bad decision, then the injured party can simply stop the game while he says exactly what he thinks of the referee's warped vision and warped mind. I am not saying that this is right, yet it is surely equally wrong that if one of those poor Bulgars or Mexicans had questioned the referee's card tricks they, too, would probably have been off the pitch. But it is the faith that is placed in the official judgments that is the real problem. Cricket succumbed to the need for video evidence, to help in the making of difficult decisions - why can't football? Referees are ageing men who are expected to run around for 90 minutes (or, in this competition, for far longer - at 90 minutes these games are just getting started), to have a perfect view of every incident and to make the right judgment about it every time. Should they really be shaping the progress of the World Cup? But football is an unfair sport, and in the end these referees simply reflect this. Over a period of time, a good team will win more often than a bad one. Yet in a single match anything can happen - not just because of mad official decisions, but because the connection between great play and goals is insufficiently strong. In a competition like the World Cup, every team is as vulnerable as each other; and it is our ever present sense of this vulnerability that makes football so very hard on our emotions.</p>

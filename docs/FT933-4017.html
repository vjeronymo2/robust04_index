			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jigsaw theory proves a puzzle - Cadbury Schweppes latest US move CADBURY Schweppes' proposed Dollars 334m (Pounds 217m) acquisition of A&amp;W Brands, the biggest US producer of root beer, has filled out part of the jigsaw which the British confectionery and beverages group has been assembling on the other side of the Atlantic. But the deal, which comes three weeks after Cadbury snapped up 20 per cent of Dr Pepper, the third largest US soft drinks company, has left observers puzzling over the eventual grand design. As one industry analyst put it yesterday: 'Either Cadbury has a secret master plan for the US market and has really thought out all the moves in advance. Or else the company is just grabbing at opportunities as they come up and hoping everything will come right in the end.' A&amp;W's sales last year of Dollars 130.8m are a fraction of the Dollars 47bn US soft drinks market. But the acquisition would be a sizeable leap for Cadbury, raising its US market share to 5.6 per cent from 3.4 per cent and increasing its worldwide soft drinks volumes by 20 per cent. Cadbury believes A&amp;W's brands, which include cream soda and citrus- and ginger-flavoured products, would give it more weight with independent bottlers. It also sees scope for cost savings and says the acquisition of A&amp;W, which has an operating margin of 20 per cent, would enhance cash flow after the first year. Still, A&amp;W offers only a small step towards the US presence which Cadbury thinks it needs to present itself as a credible global player in soft drinks. Dr Pepper, with its 10.4 per cent share of the US market, remains the best hope of fulfilling that objective. However, it is still unclear how that hope can be fulfilled. Last week, Dr Pepper installed a 'poison pill' to deter Cadbury from raising its stake above its current level of 25.9 per cent and has responded coolly to calls by the UK group for talks on closer co-operation. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, put a brave face on these rebuffs yesterday. He said that he had not been surprised by the poison pill and that Cadbury was still on speaking terms with Dr Pepper, which bottles most of its soft drinks concentrates and distributes some of its brands in the US. He said Cadbury's intentions were not hostile and it had not so far asked for a seat on Dr Pepper's board. A bid for the rest of the company was 'not on the cards' at present, though Mr David Jinks, Cadbury's finance director, said pooling the companies' US drinks businesses in return for a bigger stake in Dr Pepper could be an option eventually. However, Cadbury could not point to any imminent breakthrough in an apparent stalemate which has left it with more than Pounds 150m pounds invested in a company over which it exercises no management control and on which it is receiving no dividend. Almost as perplexing to some observers is Cadbury's renewed interest in the US at a time when growth of the overall soft drinks market has slowed sharply - though the non-cola segment in which the company competes has fared much better. Two years ago, Cadbury transferred its worldwide beverage headquarters from the US to London. The move, which led to the resignation of Mr Jim Schadt as head of the business, was widely seen as reflecting a shift in emphasis to markets closer to home. The company is believed at about the same time to have considered, but decided against, making a takeover bid for Dr Pepper. Last spring, Cadbury executives were talking of the company's small residual holding in Dr Pepper as a financial investment, which was likely to be unwound. Yesterday, Mr Cadbury said the recently enlarged holding in the US company was a long-term investment. But while it has yet to show a tangible returns, there was a 32 per cent rise in profits.</p>

Our first task is to ensure that Hong Kong continues to  deliver a sound business environment. We know that during the  transition to 1997 political change is inevitable. The  Government can help the business community to meet this  challenge through achieving the highest standards of policy and  administration.    -- We must manage government finances in a way that delivers  high-quality public services without stifling enterprise.    -- We must ensure that taxes remain simple and low and that  government regulation is equitable and stable.    -- We must avoid arbitrary administration which creates  uncertainty for investors and encourages corruption.    -- We must remain willing as a government to test official  policies and proposals against "competition" from the  Government's critics, just as business firms pit their products  against their rivals.    Our second responsibility is closely linked to the  Government's partnership with business and the community at  large.    It seems to me vital for our future prosperity that business  remains free to defend its own commercial interests. It is  equally vital for our stability that the community continues to  feel confident that its wider concerns are respected.    For this reason, we must put in place arrangements for the  1994 and 1995 elections which will be fair and open and, at the  same time, acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.    If we were to abandon our efforts to achieve such  arrangements, we would be retreating from honest administration  and accountable government, and the costs would be considerable.    -- The business community could no longer be certain of a  level playing field in which political patronage played no part.    -- The community would no longer be sure that its best  interests were paramount.    -- The legislature would no longer command the public  support  needed to challenge the mistakes and misdeeds of the  administration.    You might well ask: does all this really matter? Can we not  stick to arrangements which served us adequately for so many  decades in the past?    The reality is that we have very little choice. For a start,  the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law require us to make  constitutional changes.    The framers of those documents had the wisdom to see that  our  political institutions must develop to match the aspirations of  a more sophisticated, more affluent and more educated community.  They decreed that standing still was not an option.    -- Hong Kong today is a sophisticated and prosperous  society.  We have a highly educated, much traveled and well-informed  community that wants to have a say on the way in which it is  governed.    -- Hong Kong's business community now takes for granted a  very high quality of public service, with particular stress on  the Government's fair dealing and impartiality. These  expectations can only be met convincingly when policy is debated  in public by a credible and genuinely representative  legislature, and government officials can be called to account  for their conduct.    -- The international business community regards legislation,  regulation and taxation as part of the total competitive  environment. Governments are expected to take decisions in  these areas through processes which command respect for their  integrity and accountability. The political arrangements of the  past would have looked increasingly unsatisfactory by these  criteria.    I come now to our third responsibility. So far I have talked  of partnership in broad terms. But I would like at this point  to narrow my focus.    After 31 years as a civil servant, I am fully convinced of  the importance of preventing the public sector from crowding out  private enterprise.    I believe we have a duty to encourage as much commercial  partnership between the Government and the private sector as  possible. This principle is particularly important when it  comes to creating the infrastructure which Hong Kong will need  in the next century.    It would be very easy, given Hong Kong's unbroken record of  annual economic growth and regular budget surpluses, for the  Government to throw money at our infrastructural problems.    But we must resist any temptation to follow this route, even  when politically it seems the attractive thing to do. Instead,  we have to take forward our plans for the airport, for port  development, for new road and rail transport facilities, in the  most cost-effective way open to us.    For those projects which generate their own revenues the  Government has to make a vigorous effort to find partners from  the private sector to lighten the demands on the taxpayer by  providing opportunities for the private investor.    -- Only in this way will we ensure that projects are subject  to the full discipline of market forces.    -- Only in this way can we be sure that rates of return and  quality of service are competitive by market standards.    The massive scale of the infrastructural projects which we  will undertake in the next few years makes it even more  imperative to see that they offer the community the best value  for money.    Our fourth and our major responsibility is concerned with  the  most significant influence on our future: the resumption of  Chinese sovereignty in 1997.    I have taken up the post of Chief Secretary with no  illusions  about the complexity of the challenges which the transition to  1997 must bring. I am, personally, totally committed to a  successful transition.    Let me repeat my own conviction that the Joint Declaration's  pledge of "one country, two systems" will create enormous new  opportunities for Hong Kong, and for the business community in  particular. But it is important that we work together to ensure  that this concept can and will be implemented after 1997.    As I have mentioned earlier, both the Joint Declaration and  the Basic Law decree that the resumption of sovereignty will be  accompanied by the development of our political institutions  providing for greater participation by Hong Kong people in  managing their own affairs.    Both documents also provide that our social and economic  systems, and our life-style, will remain basically unchanged.  Indeed, they give firm undertakings to maintain:    -- The capitalist economic and trade systems previously  practised in Hong Kong;    -- The status of a free port and the continuation of a free  trade policy, including the free movement of goods and capital;  and    -- The status of an international financial centre...and a  freely convertible currency.    These, and the other pledges set out in the Joint  Declaration  and the Basic Law, provide me with the necessary reassurance to  recommend Hong Kong as Asia's premier business location not just  for the present but far into the future.    I am determined during my term as Chief Secretary to make a  positive contribution to a successful transition.    No one needs to be reminded of the difficulties we have had  during recent years. The transfer of sovereignty was always  going to be a difficult enterprise, and one should not be  surprised if there are some disagreements along the way.    But, if the present and the future sovereign powers disagree  on some things, that is no reason to disagree on everything.  Indeed, our record over the last two years has shown how much  we and the Chinese Government can agree on, despite our  difficulties.    Let me sum up. Hong Kong businessmen have an outstanding  track record when it comes to delivering business success. The  Government is determined to maintain the conditions which make  Hong Kong the ideal place in which to live, work and invest.  But we cannot do so on our own. We need to foster a  constructive partnership, both with business and with the wider  community.    We are already hard at work building the infrastructure  which  Hong Kong will need in the next century; particularly to  maintain our ability both to assist and to profit from rapid  economic growth throughout southern China and the coastal  provinces. The Chinese Government has been very open about its  own determination to preserve Hong Kong as a thriving centre for  international business.    With these factors in our favour, we can together face the  future with considerable confidence.</p>

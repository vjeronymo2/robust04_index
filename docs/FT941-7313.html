			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Nott ventures into ProShare Gillian Nott, 48, a former BP executive, is to be the next champion of Britain's small shareholders. On April 1 she takes over from Geoffrey Maddrell as chief executive of ProShare, the body which promotes wider share ownership and is sponsored by the public and private sector. Nott differs from Maddrell in a number of ways. Maddrell, 57, had been chief executive of a big plc (Tootal, taken over by Coats Viyella in 1991). Nott, by contrast, comes from a venture capital background. She spent 12 years with BP and was director of the oil company's venture capital business until it was sold a year ago. Since then she has worked as a consultant and has recently completed a study for the Institute of Directors on the provision of enterprise capital in the UK. She describes herself as a 'moderately active' investor and says that after she left BP she wanted to do 'something completely different' and preferably 'public spirited'. She refused to comment on the size of her salary but it is thought to be less than the Pounds 100,000 a year which Maddrell was paid by a Sainsbury charitable trust. It has been known for some time that ProShare was looking for a replacement for Maddrell even though he has only been doing the job since October 1991. ProShare says he had been hired to get the organisation up and running and now it is time to hand over to someone with fresh ideas. Maddrell has picked up a number of non-executive directorships and a couple of chairmanships and will take over from Sir Peter Thompson as ProShare's non-executive chairman. Sir Peter moves up to president, replacing Sir John Harvey-Jones who is retiring.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Fidel Castro broke away from the agenda of  the summit today and addressed the Ibero-American Summit after  the session for each of the participants to speak had ended.  Castro warned democracy must be understood within the context  of a great discussion among Latin Americans, and he demanded  solidarity for the people of Cuba who are suffering due to the  U.S. blockade, which he described as criminal. Castro requested  the floor from Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who  was presiding over this afternoon's session. Castro said:    [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, I will say I respect  your ideas. I sincerely respect your ideas, concepts, and  thoughts about democracy. We would have to hold a summit to  discuss what democracy is, what participation of the people is,  and why millions die in this hemisphere each year from disease  and hunger when they could be saved. [end recording]    Following Castro's speech, Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez  de Lozada responded, saying even though there is still much to  study and understand about the Cuban experience, he trusts that  democracy will come to the island and that Castro will be at the  head of a second Cuban revolution.    [Begin Sanchez recording] Possibly [words indistinct], but I  know a change will occur, and we all wish you [words indistinct]  respect that all this [words indistinct] big river, big ocean  [word indistinct]. [end recording]    This was the second time Castro addressed the summit. His  first speech was scheduled, the second was not. We asked  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for his views  regarding Castro's speech. Gaviria said: The speech Cuban  President Fidel Castro made follows the pattern of words the  Cuban Government uses at international meetings. They never  sidetrack from this pattern. President Gaviria was also asked  what he thought of the fact that Castro was wearing civilian  clothes. Gaviria said: We were accustomed to seeing him in his  olive green uniform, but we saw him wearing a guayabera today.  It is an encouraging change, Gaviria said, adding there are  also encouraging signs for Latin American democracy.</p>

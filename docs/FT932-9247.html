			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: How a hole follows a holiday - BT's pension scheme is Pounds 750m in deficit BRITISH Telecom ann-ounced yesterday that Pounds 750m had been wiped out of its pension scheme between January and the end of March, outlining at a single stroke the peculiar predicament of pension schemes all over the country. What lies behind the gaping hole is much more than simply an overstaffed UK corporation trying to finance a swingeing redundancy programme. Instead, it is the effect of new UK tax changes and the sharp drop in dividend growth at UK companies which have left the BT scheme some 5 to 6 per cent short of the cash it needs to meet its liabilities on an ongoing basis. Certainly, BT's decision to axe 29,000 workers last year has had some effect. Indeed, according to the pension scheme's accounts for the nine months from March to December 1992 show that the redundancy programme reduced a Pounds 913m surplus to Pounds 119m and noted that the company would have to end its own contributions holiday beginning with the 1993-94 fiscal year. But following a second actuarial valuation just three months later, the scheme discovered the modest surplus had turned into a Pounds 750m deficit. Mr Michael Hepher, managing director of BT, said that the government's decision to cut the proportion of Advance Corporation Tax that pension funds can reclaim from the Inland Revenue on dividends paid by UK companies had effectively sliced Pounds 500m off the value of its assets. Moreover, the anticipated income from dividend growth in UK equities has simply not materialised over the past year. Most actuaries have built an assumption of 5 per cent growth in UK dividends into their valuations of scheme assets. Pension fund assets reflect not market value but the anticipated income they will produce. Thus, lower dividend income or lower tax rebates will have a fearsome effect on valuations. The assumption of annual dividend growth of 5 per cent is modest when seen against the double digit growth of the late 1980s or even the 8 per cent growth of 1991. But, according to Mr Andrew Collins, research actuary at William M Mercer, dividends actually decreased by 0.1 per cent in 1992 and, in the first quarter of this year, shrank an additional 1.8 per cent. Actuaries now beginning scheme valuations are unlikely to change their assumptions of dividend growth for the future. They are required to take a long-term view and, over time, 5 per cent is considered a conservative reckoning. However, Mr Collins added that actuaries might drop one or two years' of assumed dividend income from their calculations of the value of assets. 'If you knock out one year's dividend growth with an annual 5 per cent growth assumption, you will knock 5 per cent off the value of your pool.' For the approximate Pounds 7bn in UK equities in BT's scheme, such a calculation would reduce the value of assets by Pounds 350m in the future. Retrospectively, the lower-than-expected dividend growth wiped nearly Pounds 500m off the value of the pension scheme assets, said Mr Hepher. That, with the ACT change, has left BT with a gaping chasm in its pension scheme - actuaries see little reason why other UK pension schemes should not be similarly affected. 'I do think that these ACT changes are quite significant,' Mr Hepher said. In his budget address in March, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced that from the current tax year, pension schemes and other tax-exempt investors would only be able to reclaim 20 per cent of the dividend paid, down from the previous 25 per cent. This had the effect of cutting the income on UK equities by 6.25 per cent. BT's pension scheme is about 58 per cent invested in UK equities and the income cut is substantial. Moreover, actuaries must project the income cut some 20 to 25 years into the future, compounding its effect. Mr Andrew Wilson, research actuary at R Watsons, said that the Treasury may not have fully understood the compound effects its tax changes would have. 'If you assume that BT is 4 per cent of the UK pension fund market, it would account for about Pounds 24m of the Pounds 600m the tax change is expected to raise. But if you compound that over 20 years, that will cost BT Pounds 480m,' he said. Since the changes were announced, actuaries have been warning pension funds that the tax changes might well force companies to either increase their contributions to the pension scheme or make benefit cuts. 'The government may realise that there's more to their ACT changes than just a little bit of tax being raised,' Mr Collins said.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS' WOES CONTINUE IN VENTURA  </P> <P> Even when College of the Canyons was firmly entrenched atop the Western State  Conference baseball standings, Coach Len Mohney did not have an abundance of  confidence in his pitching staff.  </P> <P> And now that the Cougars are struggling to keep pace with Ventura, Valley and  Moorpark, Mohney is downright fearful.  </P> <P> "We're in a scary situation every time we send a pitcher out there," Mohney  said. "We don't have a stopper on this team. Maybe that's why we can't win any  of the big games."  </P> <P> Pitching is not Mohney's only concern, however. Fielding is also a problem for  the Cougars, who committed seven errors in a 9-3 WSC loss to host Ventura on  Saturday.  </P> <P> "We have not put one game together all year where we have pitched, played  defense and hit," Mohney said.  </P> <P> To compound the Cougars' problems, their last two losses have come against two  of the top teams in the WSC -- Valley and Ventura.  </P> <P> "We have not won a big game all year," Mohney said. "The only reason we are  close is because we haven't lost to the bottom teams in the conference."  </P> <P> Canyons (15-13, 8-4 in WSC play) has lost twice to Ventura to fall a game off  the league lead and will face another contender when it travels to Moorpark on  Thursday. Ventura (21-8, 9-3) has won two games in a row and five of its last  six.  </P> <P> Mental mistakes and throwing errors cost Canyons on Saturday. The Cougars also  made a costly baserunning error in the seventh inning when Adam Grant was  picked off second base by Ventura catcher Tom Couture with two men on and none  out.  </P> <P> Shane Espitia, pitching in relief of Dean McMillin, then walked Randy Cooper  and Gary Morgan to load the bases. After Chris Joy struck out, the Cougars  scored a run on a passed ball before Ernie Perez grounded out to end the  inning.  </P> <P> "That was a big mental breakdown for us to get picked off and a real killer to  only get one run in that inning," Mohney said.  </P> <P> Ventura, leading 4-3 after thwarting the Cougars in the seventh, rallied for  three runs on two hits and two Cougar errors in the home half of the inning and  added two more runs in the eighth to clinch the victory.  </P> <P> Canyons touched McMillin for two runs in the first on Cooper's home run over  the left-field fence. McMillin, a freshman left-hander, allowed nine hits in  six innings. But Canyons repeatedly failed to get a clutch hit with runners in  scoring position.  </P> <P> Ventura tied the score, 2-2, in the bottom of the first, turning a hit and  three Cougar throwing errors into a pair of runs.  </P> <P> Ventura added two in the fourth to take a 4-2 lead. Chris Ames singled to score  Brent Cookson, who had walked and advanced to second on Joel Gaxiola's  sacrifice. Darrel McMillin walked, advanced to third on Ames' single and scored  on David Eggert's ground out.  </P> <P> Mike Teich (1-1) took the loss and McMillin (7-3) was the winner.  </P></p>

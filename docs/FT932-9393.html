			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / IG Metall gives warning: First sign of compromise emerges in pay dispute IG METALL, Germany's powerful union, will expand its strike to the whole of eastern Germany next week unless talks that resumed in the Saxon capital of Dresden yesterday lead to a break in the deadlock with employers. But last night there was the first sign of a tentative compromise, when the union said it had reached agreement about exempting less well-off enterprises from the sharp pay rises being sought. This accord came after seven hours of talks. The union said formal talks with employers aimed at ending the 11-day-old strike in some eastern German enteprises would begin later. Earlier, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the president of IG Metall, said that more engineering and steel plants would be targeted throughout eastern Germany's five states, in a move which could paralyse what remains of the region's industrial sector. 'In my opinion, the strikes will last for quite some time,' he said. 'Despite all the ostensible protests from the employers' federations of their readiness to compromise, IG Metall is nevertheless prepared that the conflict over eastern wage contracts will not be settled this week,' he added. Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical engineering employers' association, said the union's attitude would lead to a long labour dispute in eastern Germany. More than 40,000 eastern German workers from among 90 enterprises are now taking part in the action. Beginning next Monday, a further 15 plants in eastern Berlin, and nine enterprises from the engineering sectors in Thuringia will start indefinite strikes for the first time. IG Metall is determined to keep up the pressure on the employers so that they will reinstate a contract, signed in March 1991 with the union. This contract would have equalised western and eastern German wages levels by next year. That would have entailed pay rises of more than 20 per cent for the steel, engineering and electrical sectors in eastern Germany, where wage levels are at present about 65 per cent of the western German levels. IG Metall insists it is prepared to compromise on a number of issues. These include putting back the timetable towards income parity, as well as compromising on extra Christmas pay, holidays, working hours, and other benefits. But a union official yesterday said that IG Metall would not compromise on the basic wage, the principle of the original contract. 'That is what is at stake,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman for Berlin-Brandenburg. For their part, the employers, especially its members from the Mittelstand  -the small and medium-sized enterprises  - are determined not to reinstate the contract. This strong lobby in Gesamtmetall has more to lose in eastern Germany than the large western German companies which can afford to pay the increases.</p>

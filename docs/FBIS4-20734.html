			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Don Blankarn (name as transliterated), </F> Canadian member of Parliament; place and date not given: "We  Were Going To Discuss Investments and Deals in Canada With  Him"--first two paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction]    [Text] According to his planned itinerary, al-Turabi was  supposed to meet three Conservative members of Parliament  [MP]--Don Blankarn [name as transliterated], Allan Redway, and  Harry Chadwick--at a working luncheon in Toronto at noon on 26  May 1992. The attack at Ottawa Airport on 25 May 1992 caused the  meeting to be postponed.    AL-MAJALLAH spoke with MP Don Blankarn about the nature of  this meeting that did not take place and about his intervention  to ensure that al-Turabi obtained an entry visa for Canada after  his first application to the Canadian consulate in Washington  was rejected.    [AL-MAJALLAH] Were there arrangements for a meeting between  you and al-Turabi during his visit to Canada?    [Blankarn] Yes, we were supposed to meet with him on 26 May  1992 (the day following the attack at Ottawa Airport). We had  prepared for a working luncheon that was supposed to take place  at the Golf Club in Toronto, but al-Turabi unfortunately was  attacked in Ottawa.    [AL-MAJALLAH] Who arranged for the meeting?    [Blankarn] Ziyad Muzaffar (a Canadian of Pakistani origin  who  made arrangements for al-Turabi's visit to Canada and was with  him at Ottawa Airport at the time of the incident) contacted me  and spoke to me about the subject. I undertook to arrange the  meeting with the two other MPs.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What were you going to discuss at the meeting?  I mean, were the discussions going to be of a political nature,  a commercial nature, or both together?    [Blankarn] The meeting was to discuss commercial subjects.  We  were going to discuss with al-Turabi the question of investing  certain funds in Canada as well as other commercial deals  involving exporting and importing certain goods.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What is the nature of these investments?    [Blankarn] We have a large Islamic community in Canada. We  were scheduled to discuss with al-Turabi the question of  establishing an Islamic bank here. Al-Turabi is a man who knows  a lot in this area.    [AL-MAJALLAH] Where exactly was it planned to establish this  bank?    [Blankarn] No exact place had been agreed on, but the idea  was to establish an Islamic bank in Canada. It was just a  general idea. Al-Turabi knows a lot in this area. We were  supposed to discuss the idea with him, in addition to discussing  the investment of certain funds in Canada.    [AL-MAJALLAH] But al-Turabi holds no official position in  the  government; nor is he a businessman, to discuss such matters and  conclude commercial deals in behalf of the Sudanese Government.    [Blankarn] But he is the real power behind the government.  He  may not occupy an official position, but he represents the real  power. I helped him obtain an entry visa to Canada.    [AL-MAJALLAH] What kind of visa was he given? Is it true  that  the Canadian consulate in Canada refused at first to grant him a  visa?    [Blankarn] It was a normal tourist visa. He encountered  certain difficulties when he applied for it, but I intervened to  ensure that he got it.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELMA SUPT. QUITS, WILL DROP SUIT  </P> <P> Selma's first black schools superintendent resigned Monday and said he would  drop his $10-million racial discrimination suit against the city and the school  board in return for a cash settlement.  </P> <P> Norward Roussell cited the stress of the turmoil surrounding his case since the  school board voted late last year to dismiss him.  </P> <P> He said the settlement was "close to" what he would have received if his  three-year, $69,500-a-year contract had been renewed, about $208,500.  </P> <P> The vote by the white-controlled board not to renew Roussell's contract sparked  protests by blacks, some of whom were arrested during demonstrations.  </P> <P> The board said it voted to dismiss Roussell him because of his management  style.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Eleven rightist organizations, including FRONDE, the  National Front of Haitian Democratic and Nationalistic  Organizations [Front des Organisations Democratiques,  Nationalistes Haitien] of (Roosevelt Frage); the Union of  Patriots for the Advancement of Limbe [Union des Patriotes pour  l'Avancement de Limbe] of (Emmanuel Saimphar); and the Committee  of Resistance for the Safeguard of the National Sovereignty  [Comite de Resistance pour la Sauvegarde de la Souverainete  Nationale] of Robert Abellard, forcefully denounce the intention  -- which they call discriminatory, biased, and detrimental to  the greater populace -- of the international community in  general and of Lawrence Pezzullo in particular to entrust the  distribution of the fuel on a tanker expected to reach Haiti on  12 January to a predetermined sector of the national life.    They firmly ask the international community to distribute  this fuel equitably, without regard to political affiliation or  social stratum. This commitment must be published in an official  statement before the arrival of the tanker. Should the  international community fail to make this commitment, these  officials promise to oppose radically the distribution of fuel.</p>

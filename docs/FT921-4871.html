			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: PolyGram Philips may have omitted its dividend last week, but there is no denying the contribution to its finances from PolyGram. Small wonder it says it has no intention of reducing its 80 per cent stake. Despite an acquisition spree last year, the music and entertainment subsidiary increased its earnings by a quarter and yesterday raised its dividend by a fifth. Its US businesses made an operating profit, while the return from the 30 per cent stake in Really Useful Group more than covered the investment's six-month financing costs. It is curious that worldwide recession did not put more of a brake on consumers' appetite for music and video. But PolyGram appears capable for the moment of competing with the world's entertainment giants, even though its integrated marketing strategy is still in its infancy. In the long term, the picture is less clear. With global stars demanding huge contracts which rank them as corporations in their own right, the stakes are ballooning to the point that a shakeout seems inevitable. PolyGram's list of new talent is long enough to suggest it has a good chance of survival. Assuming Philips holds on until it thinks otherwise, investors should take their cue from the parent.</p>

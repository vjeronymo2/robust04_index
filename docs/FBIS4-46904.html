			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Kolesnik, people's deputy of the Republic of </F> Tatarstan, under the rubric "The Deputy's Tribunal": "Mutually  Advantageous Trade Is the Best Policy"]    [Text] I must write about the significance of the Treaty  between Tatarstan and Russia since its consequences extend not  only to Tatarstan and Russia. Analysis of it is important, and  from a purely utilitarian standpoint, so is analysis of the  practical possibilities for Tatarstan to realize its economic  sovereignty. Of course these possibilities are not unlimited. On  the one hand, our own base must be prepared in order to realize  them. On the other, we must consider what we can really do and  what is more important to us. I must certainly mention that  before the Treaty was concluded, our potential to maintain  foreign ties was very limited. When it was signed, we received a  legal base, and that is important not only to us but especially  to partners in contracts. What we can and cannot do in  accordance with the Treaty in the area of foreign ties is  precisely what our analysis is devoted to.    I must say that in the process of negotiations (and I was a  participant in them), the Russian side admitted but by no means  agreed to recognize the possibility of Tatarstan's independent  foreign-economic activity. But now the Treaty stipulates  Tatarstan's participation in international relations and the  opportunity to establish relations with foreign states, conclude  with them agreements which do not contradict the Constitution  and international obligations of the Russian Federation, the  Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, or the Treaty, and  participate in the activity of the appropriate international  organizations.    So, Tatarstan has the right to conclude agreements but not a  treaty with foreign states, which in fact restricts the range of  its foreign activity to economics and trade. In addition, these  agreements, we point out, must not contradict, first, the  Constitution of the Russian Federation, secondly, its  international obligations, and, finally, the Treaty itself. Such  an entry is read, first, as "not affecting the sovereignty and  integrity of the Russian Federation"; second, the sides are  guided by clearly defined norms fixed in international treaties  and other agreements of Russia; and third, Tatarstan has the  right to enter international relations only on questions under  its jurisdiction. And, in concluding agreements, our republic  does not have the right to deal with questions of the  international relations of the Russian Federation as a whole, or  with questions of war and peace. The last, according to the  Treaty, is under the jurisdiction of the RF [Russian Federation].    In practice this means that we can conclude primarily  agreements of an economic character. This is reflected even more  definitely in the agreement between the governments of Russia  and Tatarstan on questions of foreign-economic activity. There  the following are classified as exclusively under our republic's  jurisdiction:    concluding foreign-economic agreements with subjects of  foreign federations and administrative-territorial formations of  other countries;    concluding trade-economic agreements with foreign states;    attracting state, bank, and commercial credits and loans  guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan Government and  monitoring their use;    forming and monitoring the use of the Republic of  Tatarstan currency fund;    formulating and conducting a policy to attract foreign  investments to the republic's territory;    offering state guarantees to participants in Tatarstan's  foreign-economic activity;    participating in the work of international economic and  financial organizations and organs;    receiving aid from foreign partners and using it;    offering credits, loans, and aid to foreign partners;    creating free economic zones on the republic's territory.    So does the Republic of Tatarstan have the right to  participate in foreign policy relations? The Treaty does not  directly restrict this activity and it says that the republic  "participates in international relations," but only outside the  limits of the powers of the Russian Federation as a whole.    In this way, our republic is considered to have a broad  range  of foreign-economic activity. And the sides have apparently  agreed that the best policy is mutually advantageous trade. But  to be precise, Tatarstan has been given complete freedom of  action on its territory under the condition of full  responsibility for it (guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan).  But foreign policy activity is subordinated to the interests of  foreign-economic activity and entails a set of questions to be  resolved jointly with the Russian Federation. In accordance with  the agreement, the following are included in those questions:    protecting Tatarstan's economic interests and its  enterprises and citizens abroad, which really means Russia's  representing our republic's interests in the courts or  arbitration tribunals of third countries;    regulating payment-accounts relations with foreign states,  which indicates the need for Tatarstan to follow the procedure  for mutual settlement of accounts established by Russia for the  particular foreign state;    establishing a trade-economic regime in relations with  foreign states and international trade-economic and  currency-finance organizations--this means jointly establishing  a regime in trade for countries with which Russia has not  defined such a regime and following the established regime in  places where it was defined earlier;    licensing Tatarstan's investments abroad, and with joint  jurisdiction that means Russia's controlling our republic's  investments.    In other words, this means foreign policy on questions of  economics, finances, and trade handled by Tatarstan jointly with  the Russian Federation.    Overall one can conclude that the provisions of the Treaty  and corresponding agreement have finally fixed de jure what the  republic tried to achieve so persistently throughout the entire  negotiation process. But I must mention that it is hardly wise  to be content with that. Among other things, it is not clear how  "coordination of international and foreign-economic ties," which  is classified among jointly executed powers, is going to be  carried out. For, as analysis of the Treaty and the agreement  shows, they do not envision a coordinating mechanism. On its  territory the Republic of Tatarstan is under its own  responsibility in executing the entire list of powers, under the  condition that these actions satisfy the provisions of the  Treaty and the international obligations of the Russian  Federation.    Or here is another feature. Agreements concluded by  Tatarstan  must not contradict the Russian Federation's international  obligations. Hence, we must know Russia's trade-economic policy  in detail and systematically study the very respectable volume  of its trade-economic agreements and treaties. Of course, we do  not have to do this, but then we are forced to entrust this  expert study to someone else. This means that in  foreign-economic activity Tatarstan may prove not to be  self-sufficient.    All this points to the persistent need to formulate a state  foreign-economic doctrine of Tatarstan which takes into account  Russia's policy in different regions of the world. Against the  background of the unstable political interests of the present  Russian Government, "coordinating" our interests with the  Russian Federation will not be simple. Everyone knows very well  that in economics, as in politics, incidentally, not all  interests coincide. So we are obliged even now to intensively  prepare cadres of specialists devoted to the republic's  interests and able to figure out the stratagems of Russia's  trade agreements and of the economic legislation of the  countries which are our future partners. We certainly have to  create a Department of Foreign Relations. The task of studying  and monitoring Russian foreign-economic policy must be primary  among the duties of this department.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Good vibrations from virtual reality The day of the virtual reality one-piece body suit has moved a step closer with the unveiling of the Interactor body vest, writes Richard Rosen. Interactor, from Aura Systems, is the world's first system to mimic feeling as well as vision and sound. The user puts on a body harness, which is connected to a games console, television, or stereo to receive the sound. This triggers a magnetic actuator which causes body pulsing vibrations; in effect, it turns the body into a loudspeaker cone. A volume adjustor allows the user to adjust the intensity of the vibrations. Used with a computer game it translates into a buffeting as the player hits and is hit by the opponent. Interactor is due to be launched in the US in April at under Dollars 90. Aura Systems: US, 310 643 5300</p>

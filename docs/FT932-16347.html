			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV advances by 18% to top Pounds 10m SCOTTISH Television, which last year regained its franchise with a Pounds 2,000 a year bid, yesterday reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.62m to Pounds 10.1m, for 1992. Sales were up some 11 per cent at Pounds 126.1m. Advertising revenues rose 3 per cent to Pounds 90.8m and the sale of programmes was 32 per cent up at Pounds 23.2m. Mr Gus Macdonald, managing director, said new orders had already been received for series like Doctor Finlay and Taggart which would ensure 'another significant increase for 1993'. He believed that operating margins of 14 per cent before the levy were among the best in ITV. Reorganisation, including the cost of early retirement and voluntary redundancy, led to a Pounds 4.61m exceptional charge. The company has written off its Pounds 1.8m share of the start-up costs of Good Morning Television, where it has a 20 per cent stake. Earnings per share rose from 11.4p to 13.9p. The final dividend is 8.2p to give 9.92p (8p) for the year.</p>

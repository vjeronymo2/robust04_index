			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- According to Churkin  there are many problems in the implementation of the Geneva  talks. One of them is how to bring the parties in the conflict  fully to agree to what the foreign ministers of the United  States, Russia, and the European Union [EU] proposed in Geneva.    Asked what response he received from Milosevic today,  Churkin  said: "Mr. Milosevic and Belgrade strongly support the decision  to bring an end to hostilities. As regards the concept of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina union and the territorial division -- this is  left to the Bosnian Serbs to pass their judgement. I hope, for  two reasons, that their position will be positive -- because the  percentage of the territorial division (51:49 per cent) is not  negotiable, and this is valid for all sides in the conflict, not  only the Serbs, and because this agreement is in the interest of  both the Serbs and the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia."    As expected, the sanctions were discussed at the talks  today.  Churkin said that he "explained to President Milosevic the  paragraph referring to the sanctions from the final document of  the ministerial meeting."    "This paragraph opens very good possibilities for the  Serbian  side. The key members of the international community -- Russia,  the United States, and the EU -- said jointly for the first time  that the realization of the Geneva agreement would bring about a  gradual lifting of the sanctions. I believe this is a strong  incentive." Slobodan Milosevic and Vitaliy Churkin also  discussed the problem of Brcko. "I received assurances from the  Serb side that they are not carrying out offensive operations  there," Churkin said. He added: "I also received support for  the idea to end hostilities. I concluded after the talks today  that the Bosnian Serbs would not oppose the deployment of  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] along the demarcation lines in  the Brcko region."    Asked to comment on the recommendation by the Duma to the  Russian Government to lift sanctions against the FRY, Churkin  said that he has not had the chance to see the full text of the  decision. "Let me remind you that the recommendation was passed  following the decision by the U.S. Senate [on lifting the arms  embargo]. I hope that our two legislative bodies will not  oppose each other, as our governments are not opposing each  other. On the contrary, I hope they will work on a joint  position."    At the end Churkin was asked if he was going to Pale from  Belgrade. He gave a brief answer: "No, I am returning to  Moscow today."</p>

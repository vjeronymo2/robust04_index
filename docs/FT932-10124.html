			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / School inspection tender attracts few bids THE FIRST wave of putting school inspections out to competitive tender failed to produce more than one bidder in more than half the schools involved, it was announced yesterday. The Office for Standards in Education, the government's body created to inspect schools, said yesterday that of the 257 schools and groups of schools due to be inspected next term, only 17 failed to attract bids, but 118 attracted only one bid. The maximum number of bids attracted by any school was five, and 440 competitive tenders were received. Professor Stewart Sutherland, Her Majesty's chief inspector, said: 'This is a very encouraging response to what was always likely to be the most difficult tender exercise, since there are only 370 inspectors on the register so far.' About 60 per cent of the bids came from inspectors with local education authority backgrounds. Prof Sutherland said applicants were sifted before acceptance on a training course, where the failure rate was about 10 per cent. Ofsted said it planned to spend more than Pounds 55m in the next year as it established new inspectors. Labour condemned the results. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, described the contracting-out process as 'inspecting schools on the cheap', and said: 'The consequence of privatising the inspectorate is the disintegration of inspection not the improvement of it. Today's news will result in the total undermining of confidence in the new inspection regime.' Ofsted denied this. It said: 'If people bid too high, they won't get the contract. Single tenders are still competitive, and we have no reason to think that single bids are less value for money than the others.' On the issue of the test boycott, Prof Sutherland said tests for seven-year-olds had proved useful.</p>

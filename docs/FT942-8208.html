			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: USAir steps up cost-cutting USAir, the troubled US carrier in which British Airways holds a 22 per cent stake, yesterday announced plans to subcontract its air freight and mail handling operations in 35 cities. The move is part of a cost-cutting drive. It said the change would save Dollars 10m a year. The operations employed 510 full-time and 122 part-time workers, and those affected would be invited to apply for other jobs within the company. USAir also announced it was evaluating the savings potential of subcontracting its in-flight catering services at airports later this year. Although food preparation is usually undertaken by sub-contractors, other parts of the operation, such as loading of food and drinks, are carried out by airline employees. USAir suffered net losses of Dollars 349.4m last year, and warned in March its deficit would be even bigger this year. British Airways has said it will not invest any more in the airline until it gets to grips with costs. Of all the large US carriers, USAir has by far the highest costs in relation to miles flown. Its difficulties have recently intensified because two low-cost carriers, Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, have swept into its main markets offering much lower fares.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SANITIZED 'SHOW BOAT' STILL STEAMS ALONG  </P> <P> Few shows in the annals of the American musical have engendered as much  excitement, as many unforgettable songs or as much scholarly debate as "Show  Boat." Since the original score and orchestrations were lost for more than 50  years, what is or is not an authentic piece of Jerome Kern's and Oscar  Hammerstein's original 1927 Broadway musical has fueled contentious scrutiny.  </P> <P> What "Show Boat" is, is a brilliant hybrid, born on the cusp of the fading  European operetta and heralding the emergence of the full-fledged American  musical.  </P> <P> It dealt with unprecedented themes (discrimination and miscegenation) and  required one of the earliest interracial casts. And it has triumphed over  changes of the last six decades, buoyed by its elegance and the magnificence of  its songs. What a collection: "Make-Believe," "Ol' Man River," "Can't Help  Lovin' Dat Man," "Bill," "Why Do I Love You?"  </P> <P> The joys of this musical will endure well beyond the 1926 Edna Ferber novel on  which it is based -- and so, no doubt, will the disputes. How much you like  Opera Pacific's version of "Show Boat" at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center will depend on how knowledgeable you are about the history of the  63-year-old show and how much authenticity matters.  </P> <P> This "Show Boat" is a well-sung, vigorous and attractive production, calculated  to be untaxing (which should not equate with unmoving) entertainment. It has an  undiminished supervaudevillian in Eddie Bracken as the show's comic  centerpiece, Cap'n Andy; a vocally powerful yet physically dainty Magnolia in  Patti Cohenour; a glamorous, seductively understated Gay Ravenal in Ron Raines;  a properly flinty Parthy Ann in tall Claudia Wilkens; an ample, open-throated  Queenie in short Consuelo Hill; and a loose-as-a-goose, lively Frank Schultz,  the buck and wing man, in Keith Savage.  </P> <P> Other choices are more equivocal. Lubitza Gregus' hounded Julie has the restive  darkness of a tormented woman, but not always the vulnerability that should go  with it. Jeanette Palmer plays Ellie May as a dumb and giddy blonde, but  forgets the serious subtext that makes her yearn to become a tragedian, even if  she can't hack it. The casting of Michel Warren Bell as Joe, however, is the  thorniest. Bell can deliver a song and a half ("Ol' Man River"), but he is too  urbane and young to make us believe he's been towing barges or lifting cotton,  let alone "tired of livin' and skeered of dyin'."  </P> <P> This is where opera company stagings of musical theater hit their major snag:  in the casting of accomplished singers who are less adept as actors. (The L.A.  Opera "Oklahoma!" is a recent case in point.) Few here need body mikes, but all  get them, often to wretchedly cavernous effect.  </P> <P> This "Show Boat" revival is based on director Michael Kahn's 1982 Houston Grand  Opera production and, under current director Mike Phillips, claims to be  offering the "original full score." Original, yes; full, no.  </P> <P> The orchestrations are lush and lilting, but several numbers and/or half  numbers have been dropped, as well as some characters (Rubber Face, Old Sport,  the faro dealer, who can't be there since his scene is gone too).  </P> <P> Vanished is Gay Ravenal's "Till Good Luck Comes My Way," which firmly  establishes him as a gamblin' man, and parts of the opening sequence of Act II,  which takes place at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. (That date is correct in  the program, but shown as 1892 on Helen Pond's and Herbert Senn's set,  originally designed for Houston Grand Opera. You'd think there would have been  time to fix it.)  </P> <P> Gone too is the second-act scene in the lobby of Chicago's Sherman House, where  Parthy and Cap'n Andy have come in search of Magnolia and Gay -- and where  Cap'n Andy meets his three coquettes (two at Opera Pacific). Instead, we're  back on the top deck of the Cotton Blossom in a scene originally written for  the 1936 "Show Boat" film. It gets us to the same place in the end, but not via  the 1927 route.  </P> <P> More important than achieving the exact letter of the original, is not falsely  claiming to do so -- and working harder at achieving its spirit. This is 1990,  after all, and some streamlining can make sense. What does not make sense is  Opera Pacific's bowdlerizing -- as have countless other productions -- of the  word "nigger" from the lyrics of "Ol' Man River" on the grounds that it is  "insensitive" and has lost its "shock value." The treatment of blacks in 1927  was not nice. Eschewing the word is truly offensive, since it sanitizes a  version already too squeaky clean by the glossing over of the harsher aspects  of black life -- aspects that the 1927 show had the honesty and guts to  explore.  </P> <P>  At the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive in Costa  Mesa, Tuesday through Sunday, 8 p.m., with matinees Saturday and Sunday at 2.  $17-$60; (714) 740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.  </P> <P> 'SHOWBOAT'  </P> <P> Opera Pacific's revival of the 1927 musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar  Hammerstein II.

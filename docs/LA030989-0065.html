			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY WANTS INQUIRY INTO SDG&amp;E MERGER SWITCH  </P> <P> The city of San Diego on Wednesday demanded that federal regulators subpoena  two former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric board members to help determine if  Southern California Edison used "improper financial inducements" to coerce  SDG&amp;E's board members into approving the proposed merger between the two  utilities.  </P> <P> The city Wednesday asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to subpoena  former SDG&amp;E board members Charles (Red) Scott and O. Morris Sievert --  both of whom resigned after the SDG&amp;E board vote.  </P> <P> The city hopes to uncover evidence that SDG&amp;E board members who first  opposed Edison's merger proposal changed their votes because of financial  inducements and unidentified "threats."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Abrupt' Reversal  </P> <P>  The filing Wednesday was prompted by the "abrupt and unexplained" reversal by  SDG&amp;E board members, who last summer rebuffed Edison's first merger offer.  SDG&amp;E's board on Nov. 30 accepted a sweetened stock-swap merger offer from  Edison.  </P> <P> Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps denied any improprieties in the board vote. "The  (negotiations) leading to the merger vote were conducted at an appropriate  arm's-length distance," Phelps said.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E had not seen the filing on Wednesday, according to SDG&amp;E  spokesman Maurice Luque. Attorneys representing Scott and Sievert were not  available for comment on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The city also will petition the state Public Utilities Commission for authority  to subpoena Scott and Sievert, San Diego City Atty. John Witt said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We're interested in knowing what the directors were told prior to their  voting," said Witt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision 'Puzzling'  </P> <P> David Bardine, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who represents the city in FERC  proceedings, was not available for comment on Wednesday. However, Witt said  that Bardine's firm "has a pretty good idea" of what Edison told SDG&amp;E's  board members before the Nov. 30 vote.  </P> <P> The city "finds puzzling the decision of most of SDG&amp;E's directors to  recommend (the) merger -- after having previously opposed the merger proposal,"  according to the Wednesday filing.  </P> <P> The filing also suggested that Edison might have "exercised improper economic  leverage against SDG&amp;E by denying access to transmission capacity" to parts  of the country with excess electricity.  </P></p>

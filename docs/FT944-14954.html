			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Solid advance at Metsa-Serla Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, said yesterday its profits after financial items had more than trebled in the first eight months of the year, to FM382m (Dollars 82.7m) from FM124m in spite of flat sales and a drop in operating profits. The rise in earnings stemmed from a steep fall in net financial expenses, to FM153m from FM504m, as interest charges tumbled and the group made a net exchange rate gain of FM68m. However, Metsa said an upswing in the forestry industry that began at the beginning of the year had gathered strength during the summer. It said demand and prices were rising and that profitability would be stronger in the last four months of the year. It forecast full-year profits at least double 1993's FM303m. In the first eight months, sales reached FM6bn, virtually unchanged from a year ago. An increase in expenses and losses from associated companies pushed down operating profit, to FM535m from FM628m. In the three main business areas - encompassing paper, paperboard, corrugated board, tissue and chemicals - both sales and operating profits were down. Sales of sawn goods and pulp, however, rose to FM1.55bn from FM1.32bn, while operating profit rose to FM282m from FM137m. Metsa said it would spend more than FM700m on new investments over the year. It has a 28 per cent stake in a 500,000 tonnes-per-annum pulp mill being built at Rauma in Finland, and is expanding a sawmill at Kyro which will raise Metsa's sawn goods capacity to 130,000 cubic metres a year by the end of next March. The group said it had taken an extraordinary charge of FM44m in the eight-month accounts to cover its share of a fine for price fixing imposed in July by the European Union on European board manufacturers.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / All for a share in democracy: Political uncertainty in Italy is not expected to halt the country's privatisation programme Nobody ever said selling off Italy's sprawling public sector would be easy, and in the past eight months a change of government, political infighting, and stock market fragility have complicated the task. However, it will be a bitter irony if the latest and most serious government crisis derails the programme, because in the last two months the momentum of the sell-off has picked up again. In late September, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, badgered by institutional investors for a firm signal on privatisation, outlined a revised timetable. The government has since finally found a buyer for the last morsels of SME, the state-owned foods, supermarket and catering group, which has taken nearly two years to dismember and sell. It has also appointed an international adviser for the sale of further shares in Stet, the telecommunications holding company. A committee of the upper house of the Italian parliament last week agreed a framework for independent regulation of privatised Italian utilities. Most importantly, ministers have proposed a two-stage privatisation of Enel, one of the world's biggest electricity companies, from mid-1995. A simultaneous effort by the government to stimulate demand for shares, by encouraging the establishment of investment funds and pension funds, is raising hopes that the state-sector culture in Italy is changing. 'Demand for 'real shares' will come from Italian mutual funds not from small savers,' says Mr Gianmario Roveraro, managing director of Akros Finanziaria, a growing financial services group. One reason for the hiatus in the privatisation programme was the inexperience of the new government. Of the Treasury, Budget and Industry ministers, who are directly responsible for detail of privatisation, only Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, was at all familiar with the procedure of committee, cabinet and parliamentary approval. It was he who signed the documents permitting the June privatisation of Ina, the Treasury-owned insurer, the only public offer of state-held shares under the Berlusconi government to date. The delay was not particularly worrying. Mr Berlusconi's predecessor, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was also criticised for failing to implement the July 1992 privatisation decree quickly - until late last year, when he initiated a flurry of share offers in state-controlled banks. Moreover, new ministers had the crucial 1995 budget to worry about, and, as one analyst puts it, 'it's better that the big privatisations should be done well, than that they should be done in a hurry'. What unsettled the markets and the managers of state-controlled companies was the way some in the new government put a party political spin on the debate when it came into office in May. This was partly because new ministers and members of parliament wanted to stamp their mark on privatisation policy, but also because of clear divisions within the coalition. For example, the populist Northern League wanted to see the rapid break-up and sale of state companies, encouraging competition that would benefit private industry and finance in the north of the country. The far-right MSI/National Alliance resisted the rapid break-up of state monopolies, partly, opponents claimed, in order to install its own supporters in board or senior management positions prior to privatisation. These factions staked out positions at every level of policy, from the debate on regulation or shareholder structure to the choice of banks to co-ordinate the sales. Top managers in state industry now say they are being left to get on with preparing for privatisation, and advocates of a controlled and politically neutral reduction of the state's presence seem happy again. 'At the beginning and in the first months (of this government) there was strong pressure to go back to the old system,' says one manager.' All of a sudden, that pressure has faded out.' That may be a sign that disruptive elements in the new government are settling in, or possibly that they are too distracted by crises to worry about shaping privatisation policy to their own ends. The Treasury and managers of the state-owned companies do not believe current political turmoil will halt the programme. No mainstream party actively opposes privatisation. At issue has been its timing and form. And both the government and IRI, the state holding company that controls Stet, need the proceeds to reduce debt. But the replacement of key ministers, a change of coalition, or even a general election, could seriously delay the tough timetable set by the current administration. And even if the existing coalition survives, the task is not easy. For example, although ministers' agreement on a plan for the sale of Enel was hailed as progress, the proposed structure of the group reflects an uneasy compromise between feuding coalition members: the Northern League wanted to break up the company and allow tariffs to vary across the country; and the National Alliance, with the support of Enel management and trade unions, backed an integrated group and single-tariff structure. Under the government plan, there will be a single tariff. But before launching a first tranche of Enel shares around the middle of next year, the generating activities (accounting for 80 per cent of electricity produced in Italy) will have been hived off into one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, in preparation for the sale of production capacity within three years. This formula risks displeasing all. Enel unions staged a one-day strike last week and opponents could delay parliamentary approval of a single authority to regulate the sector, setting back the timetable. Furthermore, Enel's estimated market capitalisation of L20,000bn-L30,000bn (Pounds 11.8bn) would make it one of the largest companies on the Milan stock market, which could mean small investors find it difficult to digest. The other candidates for privatisation next year - Stet, the telecoms holding company, and the Agip/Snam energy activities of the state holding company, Eni - are almost as big. The government also wants to complete privatisation of IMI, the financial services and banking group, and Ina. The sale of shares in state-controlled banks in late 1993 and early this year went well, but they were already quoted and the market was buoyant. The sale of nearly 50 per cent of Ina, owned by the Treasury, was received less enthusiastically, and post-sale trading was sluggish. A solution would be to sell thinner slices of Stet and Enel, possibly only 10 per cent. But that would prolong uncertainty for their managements - a particular concern at Stet and Telecom Italia, its operating arm, as they need to give firm guarantees on future ownership to attract international partners. The second problem with partial privatisation is that it could put a brake on the cultural change that the sell-off was supposed to stimulate. Already the pioneers of shareholder democracy in Italy - small investor associations, employee shareholder groups and their advisers, for example - allege the government has not done its best to release former state companies into the free market. In the case of Ina, for example, they claim the insurance company's board is still under the control of the Treasury, which appointed 10 of Ina's 13 directors, after privatisation. They also claim that Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, has extended its influence over the former state-controlled banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana, and Credito Italiano, to the detriment of small investors. The Treasury believes it can show its willingness to relinquish control by removing its direct representatives from the boards of former state companies, even partially privatised ones, as it has done at Ina. But that is unlikely to satisfy the most zealous privatisers. For them, only a convincing attempt to diffuse ownership of Italy's largest companies will do. As one Italian investment banker puts it: 'Up to now, Italian industry has been managed by the Agnellis, De Benedettis, and Ferruzzis, and at the end of the day by Mediobanca - plus the state. If you don't have more players, you don't have a shareholder democracy, and that should be the main macroeconomic goal of the privatisation programme.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PUBLIC OFFERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Date              Stake         Amount                                                  sold         raised                                                             (Lira bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Credito Italiano   Banking                       December 1993       67%         1,900 IMI   Banking                       January 1994        33%         2,400 Banca Commerciale Italiana   Banking                       February 1994       54%         2,800 Ina   Insurance                     June 1994           47%         4,500 Enel   Electricity                   1995                  -             - Stet   Telecommunications            1995                  -             - Eni   Energy/chemicals              1995?                 -             -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

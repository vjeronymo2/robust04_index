Research into the project, which was undertaken by the Hebei  Provincial Institute of Water Conservancy and the Yanghe beach  development headquarters of Xuanhua County, has utilized the  excess water to serve local farmers, according to local  officials.    The achievement has passed a provincial appraisal and is  believed to have reached the international advanced level.    The Yanghe River is a major tributary on the upper reaches  of  the Yongding River. In the rainy season floods used to wash  down the river large quantities of silt, destroy houses and  leave the farmland along the river banks seriously damaged. In  particular, a huge amount of silt used to be washed into the  Guanting Reservoir, which supplies water to Beijing.    In 1989 researchers began to make observations and collect  data from experimental zones, aiming at making scientific use of  the floodwaters.    After some four years of research and experiment they helped  local farmers to build 3,000 m [meters] of dikes and 46,100 m of  canals, and used the floodwaters to irrigate 8,226 ha and grow  160,000 trees.    So far, the efforts have brought about increases in the  outputs of maize and rice in the locality, and stopped 1.62  million tons of silt from entering the Guanting Reservoir.</p>

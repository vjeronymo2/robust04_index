			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Iveco Ford Truck Pounds 39m in the red IVECO FORD TRUCK, the UK truck maker, plunged to a net loss of Pounds 38.6m last year from a deficit of Pounds 19.9m in 1990 and a profit of Pounds 9.6m in 1989. In the past two years the UK truck industry has suffered the steepest decline into recession in the post-war period. Iveco Ford Truck is jointly owned by Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, and Ford of the US, with Iveco holding management control. Last year's loss was exacerbated by redundancy costs as the workforce was cut by some 30 per cent. The loss before special items, such as restructuring costs, totalled Pounds 27.9m. Truck production at Iveco Ford's Langley, Berkshire, plant fell by 32.7 per cent last year to 5,826, the lowest point for more than 10 years. The plant was on short-time working for much of the period. The Iveco group, which includes Seddon Atkinson, saw a 39.9 per cent drop in UK new truck registrations last year to 7,555 in an overall UK truck market which shrank by 33.7 per cent to 32,184.</p>

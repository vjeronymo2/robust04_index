			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed account of "speech by Russian President B.N. </F> Yeltsin at reception in honor of military academy graduates" in  Moscow on 28 June: "It Is Up to You To Reform the Army"]    [Text] Comrade generals and admirals, comrade officers!    Esteemed representatives of foreign countries' armies!    Today, in Moscow's Kremlin, we honor our military academy  graduates, representatives of our glorious officers corps.    Such graduation ceremonies take place each year. A fresh  cohort of highly skilled professionals joins our Armed Forces  each year.    The Russian Army's hopes are assembled in this splendid  hall.  You are among those on whom its might and combat ability will be  founded.    On the whole, Russia's Armed Forces meet the contemporary  demands as regards ensuring the country's military security.    The young Russian Army confirms this not only in the course  of major maneuvers and strategic exercises. Its units and  combined units successfully perform peacemaking functions in  line with our country's international commitments.    The main avenue of our military policy is to reform the  Armed  Forces. They must satisfy the real needs of the country's  necessary and adequate defense.    Gradually (and I emphasize: gradually) the Army's numerical  strength will be brought to 1.5 million men.    The mechanism for the Army's manpower acquisition will also  change gradually. We are talking about increasing the  proportion of servicemen serving on contract.    We will continue to give major attention to the development  of Russia's new military infrastructure and to ensuring that it  is effectively supplied and organized.    We need to learn to pursue a balanced military-technical  policy. The root of the problem is to ensure that the tasks we  are resolving should be in line with the real potential of the  country's economy.    It is no secret that today we have limited resources and  this  is having an acute impact on the Army. It is that much more  important to allocate them properly. We will have to reduce the  categories and modifications of armaments, the backup services  for them, and the range of munitions, consumables, and spares.  Diversity in this sphere is an unaffordable luxury.    At the same time, however, it is categorically impermissible  to squander -- under the pretext of cutbacks -- the unique  scientific and technical potential created within the Armed  Forces.    There are international treaties and agreements. The  commitments we have made will be honorably fulfilled. But there  cannot be any question whatsoever of any so-called  "overfulfillment."    This is the president's clear-cut position, this is the  principled demand made of the Armed Forces' leadership.    The majority of those in this hall will soon return to the  forces. I hope that you have soundly mastered one of the main  lessons of the science of victory.    It is that the Army's strength lies not only in the  personnel's combat skills, and not only in the extent to which  the military art has been mastered by commanders and troop  leaders -- even though there can be no army without this.    Its strength is rooted not just in military discipline --  even though there can be no army without this, either.    The Russian Army has been invincible whenever humanity  within  it has gained the upper hand over callousness. Whenever  commanding officers have realized that each and every one of  their subordinates is neither a robot nor a blind instrument,  but a human being.    Humanity means neither permissiveness nor mollycoddling.  Humanity in the Army means persistently teaching each and every  serviceman to perform his combat task and survive in any  circumstances.    The main point in this process is not to forget your  subordinates' dignity and to always feel personally responsible  for their lives.    This is the behest of our best troop leaders, this is taught  to us by the combat experience of our best field commanders. I  believe that you will not only continue but will also  consolidate this glorious tradition. It must be honestly  admitted: We have not been and are not always loyal to this  tradition, whether in the past or in the present.    In a democratic state, the rights and duties of servicemen  must be defined only by the law. The entire legal basis of the  Armed Forces' organizational development and activity must be  brought in line with the Constitution and the fundamental  provisions of the military doctrine.    In order to improve the overall system of Armed Forces  command and control and strengthen their ties with society, we  will gradually introduce and strengthen elements of civilian  control over the process of military organizational development.    It is impossible not to mention the system of military cadre  training at a reception in honor of military academy graduates.    We do have a concept for developing the military education  system. The tuition plans and programs of higher educational  establishments have been clarified. The training of officers in  many specialized fields, who are in short supply in the Russian  Army, has been organized. This work must be continued.    The main avenue must be a line of rationally expanding and  integrating the military education establishments. The quality  of training must be enhanced by reducing their number.    We will continue to give special attention to questions  concerning social protection for the Armed Forces personnel and  members of their families, as well as for servicemen in the  reserve. For those who have spent the best years of their lives  serving the motherland.    We are implementing a program to provide housing for  servicemen and persons discharged from military service in  1994-1995. Money allowances and pensions have been increased,  as have the salaries of the Russian Army's [civilian] workers  and employees.    Additional sources of finance to meet military needs are  being sought for this purpose, despite all the complexities.    It may well be that the Ministry of Social Protection will  have to create a special department for the affairs of persons  discharged into the reserve, military invalids, pensioners, and  veterans.    I take advantage of this occasion to also dwell on questions  concerning the Armed Forces' external activity.    This primarily involves the formation of a collective  security system in the CIS.    Nobody and nothing can relieve Russia of its political and  moral responsibility for the future of countries and peoples  that have marched in step with the Russian state for centuries.    Next comes the creation of a promising European security  system.    We advocate that this system should be all-embracing. It  should also mean more than just a bloc structure, like NATO.    What is needed is a broader partnership system which would  pool and boost all currently operational mechanisms of the CSCE,  the European Union, the Western European Union, the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council, and so on.    The new edifice of European security is hardly likely to be  successfully built if its architects try to exclude Russia from  their plans. But we also need to actively participate in the  existing institutions for cooperation, not to isolate ourselves  from them but, on the contrary, to more strongly influence their  work from within.    Proceeding from Russia's special strategic position in  Eurasia, we must single out the creation of an effective  security system in the Asia-Pacific region as a special avenue  of our military policy.    We will continue to actively participate in peacemaking  operations, in the work to monitor armaments and the  proliferation of nuclear technologies, and, on the whole, in  ensuring strategic stability in the world.    Russia's foreign policy is gathering pace. A few days ago  our country joined the "Partnership for Peace"  military-political process. Russia concluded the agreement "On  Partnership and Cooperation" with the European Union.    Attendance at the conference of the world's seven most  developed states lies ahead. This will be, moreover,  participation with fully equal rights in political matters. In  other words, the political eight will begin their work.    Each such step offers fresh opportunities to our country.  This will directly affect the Army. The more efficiently we  operate, the more real opportunities we will gain to solve its  urgent problems.    The second anniversary of the formation of the Russian  Federation Armed Forces was marked only a short while ago. But  its history goes far beyond this date. Today's Army is a direct  heir of the glorious traditions and truly great victories of the  Russian host.    It covered itself with glory on the ice of Lake Peipus  [Aleksandr Nevskiy's 1242 victory over the Teutonic knights] and  at the battle of Kulikovo [Dmitriy Donskoy's 1380 defeat of the  Mongols], near Poltava [1709 defeat of Sweden] and Borodino  [1812 victory over Napoleon]. The Russian Army's legendary  might was augmented by the military feats of Aleksandr Nevskiy,  Dmitriy Donskoy, Aleksandr Suvorov, Fedor Ushakov, Mikhail  Kutuzov, and other eminent military leaders.    Our forebears' tradition of gaining victory, of defending  the  Russian state's freedom and independence with arms in their  hands, was continued by the Red Army soldiers in harsh battles  against German fascism.    Now, 53 years after the start of the Great Patriotic War, we  realize the full extent of the grandeur of the feat accomplished  by our grandfathers and fathers.    We give the due credit to the talent of celebrated troop  leaders like Zhukov, Vasilevskiy, Konev, Rokossovskiy,  Chernyakhovskiy, and many others.    Dear graduates!    You are celebrating! I congratulate you with all my heart on  the successful conclusion of your training!    Tomorrow you will return to the ranks and will take on new  and more onerous duties. I am confident that the personnel of  units, ships, and combined units under your leadership will  successfully perform their tasks to defend Russia's state  interests.    On this memorable day I would like to wish the officer  graduates from foreign armies success in their service. I have  no doubt that you will retain the warmest memories of the  academy, of Moscow, of our country and its people.    Special thanks are due to the command and teaching staff of  the military academies. I wish you fresh creative  accomplishments in your noble work.    I wish you all success in your very hard but honorable work  for the sake of Russia and for the glory of the fatherland!    Godspeed, dear graduates! Success and happiness in your hard  service as officers!</p>

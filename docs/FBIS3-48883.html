These policy officials later met Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura at the prime minister's official residence,  and requested that the government respect these basic guidelines  in the process of drafting the budget.    With regard to the focal issue of income tax cuts, the  guidelines deleted the wording in the orginal version that this  should be done "basically without issuing special government  bonds," and settled with the more abstract expression that "in  order to bring about an early economic recovery, positive  measures should be taken while paying attention to maintaining  sound fiscal policies." A final decision on this issue will be  left to the meeting of the ruling parties' representatives or of  the economic affairs committee.    The basic guidelines reflect the political values of the  coalition government, which puts forth the slogan of  "responsible change," in its first effort to compile a budget.    Concrete policy measures cited as the main points of the  draft budget include: 1) new agricultural policy in light of  the agreement concluded at the GATT multilateral trade  negotiations (the Uruguay Round); 2) the development of new  sources of energy; and 3) fiscal and administrative reform  measures, including the consolidation and rationalization of  various subsidies, and relaxation of regulations.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Greenspan seeks to allay inflation fear: US Federal Reserve chairman aims to bolster confidence in the dollar Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday sought to bolster international confidence in the dollar by arguing that many investors were too pessimistic about the outlook for US inflation. He said an increase in US long-term bond yields this year was to be expected given faster economic growth and an increase in global demand for capital. But long-term rates were higher than they needed to be, because they embodied an excessive 'inflation premium'. 'I think that the inflation premium is too high, that nominal long-term rates. . . are higher than they should be' and would decline if the Fed held 'inflation increasingly to a path of stable prices'. This situation was partly a lingering consequence of high US inflation in the 1970s which undermined confidence in US monetary policy. The inflation premium in long rates reflected a 'still sceptical world financial market view that American fiscal and monetary policies retain some inflation bias'. Speaking before the House budget committee, Mr Greenspan did not comment directly on the dollar but instead tried to address fears underlying heavy recent selling. There had been some 'recent firming of prices of some products and raw materials'. However, 'owing to constrained increases in unit labour costs, broad measures of producer prices for final goods have not generally reflected the increases in those input costs. In addition, monetary and credit growth remains quite muted.' The outlook for inflation was thus 'quite reasonable' and monetary policy was 'dedicated to ensuring it remains that way'. Mr Greenspan gave no sign that present inflationary pressures were sufficiently intense to require another increase in short-term interest rates in the near future. He seemed, instead, inclined to wait and see what effect the rate increases already announced would have on prices and output. Questioned about deficiencies in the consumer price index, he agreed it overstated the underlying rate of inflation for various technical reasons. The upward bias probably lay in the range of 0.5-1.5 percentage points, he said. This would imply that the 'true' rate of inflation was closer to 2 per cent than nearly 3 per cent, as indicated by the official index. It would also imply that real short-term rates were higher than generally assumed. Mr Greenspan cautioned against assuming certain levels of unemployment or industrial capacity utilisation would automatically trigger upward pressure on inflation. He said manufacturing capacity utilisation, at a shade under 83 per cent, was well above its historical norm. However, 'there is no clear-cut trigger point for capacity utilisation as a signal for emerging inflationary pressures'. He also reacted sceptically to claims by some economists that the US jobless rate, now 6 per cent, was at or below the 'natural rate' of unemployment - a national threshold below which inflation is assumed to begin accelerating. The 'enormous complexity and dynamism of our labour markets' made such calculations impractical. He would watch carefully for signs of resource pressures in the labour market. 'I do not think that any one estimate of the natural rate is useful in the formulation of monetary policy,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "MiGs Contract Ready But It </F> Will Not Be Signed Tomorrow"]    [Text] In yesterday's issue of IZVESTIYA our Washington  correspondent, citing a statement by Arkadiy VOlskiy, reported  that Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier of the Russian  Government, had not arrived in the U.S. capital as planned to  open an exhibition of progressive technology because he had  flown to Malaysia to sign a contract for MiG-29 fighters.    According to information I received from confidential  sources, the vice premier is still in Moscow. The  Russian-Malaysian contract for the sale of 18 light Mig-29  front-line fighter is indeed already ready and has been agreed  by the participants in talks but it is to be signed in the near  future, in the summer. A few details have to be sorted out.    These details concern in particular the palm oil consignment  which will go to pay for our aircraft. As we know, when he was  vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy visited Malaysia and suggested  selling our MiGs in practice mainly for palm oil. But the  Russian Government rejected such terms for a contract and  insisted on the currency equivalent. Now there is a decision.  It remains to be approved.    It is true that at the Malaysian side's request our aircraft  builders embarked on unprecedented innovations in equipping the  Russian fighter. Thus, the aircraft delivered to Kuala Lumpur  will have installed on them "Takan" close-range navigation  receivers which operate in tandem with the U.S. ground station  produced by the same firm. The MiGs are being further equipped  with "Collins" radio stations operating on the emergency  frequencies used in Southeast Asia. The fighter will acquire  the GPS-21 satellite navigation system which can get their  bearings equally well from Russian and U.S. satellite signals.    At the Malaysians' request all instruments on our aircraft  will be recalibrated from meters and kilometers to feet and  miles, which are used in that country. The Malaysian military  pilots will train at our air force bases and in flying  academies. And most important Russia for the first time  together with Malaysia is creating a fundamentally new subunit  there to service aircraft -- the technical service center, which  will be able to help not only Malaysian military aircraft but  also the fighter aircraft of other states.    In the opinion of the exporters of our aviation equipment  all  this additional equipping of Russian fighter aircraft will help  them integrate more easily with the ground-based airfield  services of the Malaysian Air Force and will ensure their easier  introduction into existing infrastructures and will consequently  make the purchase of such aircraft cheaper and more accessible.    Our MiGs have been the basic aircraft in this region only in  India and Vietnam so far. Now, after the signing of the  contract with Malaysia, it is not ruled out that the Russian  combat aircraft will appear in other Southeast Asian countries.    This breakthrough to new arms markets previously closed to  Russia is regarded by specialists as a very great gain for  Russian exporters of combat equipment.</p>

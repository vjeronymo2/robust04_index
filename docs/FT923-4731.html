However, Mr James Laing, a partner in Strutt &amp; Parker, the land agents, said it was ridiculous to suggest that the UK land market was in crisis.

This was affecting values for properties made available through retirement, death and business changes. But it suggested demand remained reasonable, 'considering the poor market.

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'A DEADLY COLLISION': RESTRICTIONS NEEDED ON TRACTOR-TRAILERS  </P> <P> The opening of the Interstate 405 car-pool lane, between John Wayne Airport and  the El Toro Y, was a joyous occasion for myself and my 2- and 3-year-old sons.  We had anticipated a relaxing and time-saving ride each day between our home in  Mission Viejo and their day-care school in Irvine.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the realistic outcome has been somewhat like an amusement park's  "ride from hell and back" each day. Motorists utilizing the commuter lane  apparently do not understand that the 55-m.p.h. speed limit, applicable in most  of our state, still applies to them.  </P> <P> During the few weeks the car-pool lane has been open, we have been honked at,  flipped obscene gestures, passed on the left meridian and flashed by  headlights. I could possibly understand this harassment if I was only obeying  the law and traveling at a speed of 55 m.p.h.; however, my average speed, to  avoid being shot at, has been 65 m.p.h.  </P> <P> DEBBIE RUSSELL  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

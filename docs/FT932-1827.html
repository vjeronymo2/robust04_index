			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Embattled and embittered: Lloyd's annual general meeting today threatens to fuel the anger of hard-hit Names The embattled public relations team at Lloyd's of London jokes that the insurance market has recently become the City's equivalent of the royal family, as staff reflect on the almost feverish media interest in the misfortunes of the Names. The clamour looks set to intensify over the next few weeks after losses of up to Pounds 3bn for 1990 are reported today. The third successive year of record losses, to be announced by Mr David Rowland, the market's chairman, at today's annual general meeting at London's Royal Festival Hall, will force many hundreds more Names - the individuals whose personal wealth supports the market - into financial ruin. The scale of the latest losses is startling: The 27,770 Names trading in the 1990 year at Lloyd's face losses of between Pounds 2.8bn and Pounds 3bn, a record in the market's 300-year history. Average losses per head will be more than Pounds 100,000. Cumulative losses at the market between 1988 and 1990 will amount to more than Pounds 5bn. Under its three-year accounting rules, Lloyd's expects to report a loss of Pounds 1bn for 1991, next June. Already 2,000 Names - of more than 33,000 trading in 1989 - have applied for help from the Lloyd's 'hardship' committee, which re-schedules the debts of Names and allows them to live in what it describes as 'modest' circumstances. Normally, hardship cases can expect to retain an income of between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year and can live in a house which, in London, would be valued at about Pounds 150,000. Mr Christopher Stockwell, who chairs the independent Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, says between 5,000 and 10,000 Names 'could be completely ruined'. He claims that 17,000 Names have joined the action groups which his association represents, and are either considering or taking legal action to recover their losses. He warns that Names are determined to continue their campaign for compensation, even at the expense of the market's future. 'We are not going to lie down and be walked on,' says Mr Stockwell. The problems and anger of the loss-making Names are the biggest challenge facing the market, whose fortunes in some other respects are brighter than for some time. First, during 1992 and 1993, rates - or prices - for the motor, commercial insurance and reinsurance policies sold by Lloyd's have risen sharply, generating huge flows of cash into the so-called 'premium trust funds' held by the market to meet claims. These so-called 'hard' market conditions mean that most underwriters now believe they are trading profitably across the board. Second, Lloyd's business plan, devised by Mr Rowland and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, and published two months ago, imposes radical reforms on agency businesses and syndicates trading in the market. These underline the shift to a more active management style. Mandatory cost-cutting measures should reduce overall expenses by 20 per cent from Pounds 885m in 1991 to Pounds 665m in 1995. Third, moves are advanced to bring corporate investors to the market, whose commitments should help shore up the recent erosion of the capital base. Lloyd's expects to publish a rulebook, outlining the detailed terms on which so-called 'incorporated Names' would be allowed to participate. It is hoped that as much as Pounds 500m in corporate capital will be raised by next year. Fourth, the strong cash flow into the premium funds should allow Lloyd's to soften the impact on Names of the 1990 losses, and thus allow as many as possible of the 19,700 Names active this year to continue underwriting next year. New rules will allow Names to borrow from the premium trust funds - which contain about Pounds 10bn - to pay part of their 1990 losses. In addition, many syndicate managers are calling for cash from their Names only when claims are paid, rather than when provisions against expected future claims are set. Finally, Lloyd's emphasises that at least Pounds 600m of the 1990 loss has effectively been provided for by two different parts of the market, and therefore 'counted twice'. 'Double' provisioning arises because some Names contend that the negligence of Lloyd's agents is responsible for their insurance losses, and that these should be paid for by other Names on rival syndicates which insure agents against legal liabilities. Until the dispute is resolved, both sets of Names have to set up provisions against the Pounds 600m portion of the overall loss. Despite such positive trends, there are signs that the precarious finances of some loss-making Names, and the publicity which surrounds them, have undermined the confidence of both policyholders and investors. This is especially so in the US, which generates up to 40 per cent of Lloyd's business and from which the market is hoping to attract new corporate investors. Brokers, who place business in Lloyd's on behalf of commercial insurance buyers, say some of their American customers are beginning to ask detailed questions about the underlying security of Lloyd's policies. 'We are spending an awful lot of time getting the facts straight,' says Mr Andrew Pinsent, chairman of the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee. 'We are constantly reassuring people that Lloyd's pays valid claims.' There are also concerns in the US that potential investors might be put off by the rising controversy surrounding Lloyd's and the actions of some Names. Earlier this month, Lloyd's moved to tighten its rules for calling extraordinary general meetings (EGMs), after it emerged that some hard-hit Names were aiming to organise a series of protests at such gatherings. After Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer whose family has suffered heavy Lloyd's losses, announced an initiative to call an EGM to vote on a motion to liquidate Lloyd's, the market's ruling council moved swiftly to tighten the rules governing EGMs. Mr Rowland explained that Lloyd's efforts to attract fresh capital would be adversely affected by reports that Names were discussing motions to liquidate the society. 'I must do everything I can to maintain confidence,' he insisted, after increasing the number of Names' signatures required for EGMs from 100 to 1,500. However, the rule change came too late to stop another EGM, called by supporters of another disgruntled Name, Mr Claud Gurney, to be held on July 5. It will consider a motion to charge future investors a premium for their participation, to help bail out badly hit Names. Nor will the reform deter Mr Stockwell, who claims that his association could mobilise the 1,500 signatures necessary for an EGM 'overnight'. 'We don't believe Lloyd's can have a profitable future if it decides to abandon the burnt Names,' says Mr Gurney. 'The goodwill represented by the Lloyd's brand name should be disposed of for the highest possible price.' Activists are also threatening to intensify their publicity and legal campaign against the Lloyd's establishment. There are several possible legal actions pending against at least two of the market's former chairmen on the grounds of 'deliberate non-disclosure and misrepresentation at a regulatory level'. 'They (the chairmen) owed fiduciary duties which they breached,' says Mr Astor. Mr Philip Dinkel, a supporter of Mr Gurney, says that defeat of the July 5 EGM motion will lead 'to the next layer of litigation. It is the inevitable outcome.' These developments are underscoring the importance of current efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement to compensate loss-making Names. In the autumn Lloyd's hopes to make loss-makers an out-of-court offer, financed mainly from errors and omissions insurance funds (which cover agents against negligence claims). The indications are, however, that with limited errors and omissions funds, the proposed settlement is unlikely to be generous enough to satisfy the demands of the hardest-hit Names, many of whom could be bankrupted three or four times over by their losses. So far Lloyd's has ruled out proposals to supplement these funds by raising cash externally in the money markets, on the grounds that the cost of such an exercise would depress profitability and dissuade new corporate investors from committing fresh capital. Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton would prefer to defuse the crisis without having to resort to raising debt. But Mr Stockwell predicts that Lloyd's may be forced to reconsider. He says: 'Lloyd's goes into the future with a mortgage or it has no future at all.'</p>

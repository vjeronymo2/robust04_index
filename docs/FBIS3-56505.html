The objective is to restructure the inner parts of the State  Directorate for National Security in light of problems facing  the State Directorate for National Security under conditions of  independent statehood.    With the same decree, Davit Shahnazaryan--the Armenian  president's ambassador on special missions--has been appointed  acting head of the State Directorate for National Security.  Within three months he must conduct an inspection of the  quality of the services of the Directorate and draw up and  submit for the government's approval the bylaws, structure, and  list of permanent staff.</p>

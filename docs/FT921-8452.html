			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / European Diary (Germany): German film is US hit but hard to see at home - It's true, but is it cinema art? TEMPERS are running high in Germany's film world. Causing the controversy is a film which has won critics' plaudits and a leading award in the US, but has been denied a shot at the Oscar because a German jury refused to submit it for the Hollywood prize. At a time of earnest debate about the failing artistic and financial health of the German film industry, an Oscar nomination would have provided a vital shot of confidence. German cinemas are dominated by Hollywood films and home-grown efforts often find it hard to get a showing. But what makes this more than just a local spat is the fact that the film, Hitlerjunge Salomon, deals with the highly opportunistic survival of a young Jew in Nazi Germany. Described by the New York Times as 'wrenching and darkly funny', it is based on a true story. Solomon Perel, now in Israel, stayed alive by fleeing wartime Germany and then Poland to Soviet-held territory and then, after his capture by German troops, passing himself off as an Aryan. Thus the jury's decision has raised charges by the film's makers of a refusal to look too closely at Germany's anti-Semitic past, as well as of inattention to the film industry's own interests. In the US, where it is called Europa, Europa, the film - shown in German, with subtitles - has taken more than Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.2m). Last month the Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded it the Golden Globe award for the best foreign film of 1991, regarded in the industry as second only to the Oscar. 'It's a hit,' says Mr Tom Bernard, marketing vice-president at Orion Classics, the US distributor. 'It's on the way to becoming the highest grossing German film ever in the US.' Such a film, you would think, must be easy to see in Germany. But you have to search hard. In Frankfurt it can be seen in one small cinema, outside the city centre, and until recently had only an early evening showing. Cinema owners clearly expect little from a film which deals with such a sensitive subject and which Die Zeit, the heavyweight weekly, described as 'a mixture of truth and striving for effect, of bitter seriousness and sheer sentimentality'. This comment hints at the reservations over quality which clearly swayed the eight-man jury charged with making the Oscar nomination in the best foreign language film category. Comprising representatives from the production, distribution, technical, and commercial side of the industry, the jury has stuck to its controversial decision of last October. 'This is shocking,' says Mr Bernard, all too well aware that an Oscar would enhance the film's bankability and prestige. In an open letter in Hollywood, top German directors such as Werner Herzog, Volker Schlondorff (maker of the Oscar-winning Tin Drum), and Wim Wenders, actress Hanna Schygulla and others stated their deep regret at what they called the jury's 'painful' decision. Apart from the question of quality, the film's artistic origins also have to comply with Academy Award rules. The main creative influences have to be German for the film to qualify. But Hitlerjunge Salomon was a German-French production, with a Polish director, Ms Agnieszka Holland, and a strong non-German element on the technical side. Much of the funding came from Germany, however. In the end, the jury seems to have decided against Hitlerjunge Salomon on both the quality and 'artistic control' counts. Mr Artur Brauner, the joint producer, is incensed. So is Ms Holland, another film of whose (Angry Harvest, also produced by Mr Brauner) was put forward by the jury a few years ago. The story itself is compelling, tragic, and humorous, qualities that not all critics feel are fully evident in the film version. As the Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote: 'The story of Solomon Perel is authentic. The film removes this quality.'</p>

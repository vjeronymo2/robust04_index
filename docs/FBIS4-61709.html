			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- The upcoming Victory Day  celebrations were one of the main topics of today's newspapers.    Despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, people of  Russia are waiting for this day to come, the newspaper  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI said. "Although our souls are often filled  with worries and concerns about how to survive in this hard  time, Victory Day returns us to the Russian roots," it said.    "There are no military parades anymore... But there is the  eternal flame at the soldiers' tombs. There are war veterans.  Many gray-hair defenders of the fatherland will get together  for their holiday to reminisce about their war days and their  youth," the newspaper said.    Its article "The Altar of Victory" reminds the readers that  "only consensus may help the nation survive in critical  conditions. It will always be like this in spite of differences  in historic situations."    The newspaper RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA shares this opinion. It  publishes an excerpt from the memoirs of Aleksandr Buchin, the  chauffeur of legendary Marshal Georgiy Zhukov.    The military daily KRASNAYA ZVEZDA stressed the need to  restore spiritual values in Russia. "As never before this task  is urgent today when our society is in a spiritual crisis." For  many young people, profit is the only goal in life. The once  sacred notions of duty, honour and patriotism are no longer  revered and respected. As a result, the future of the state may  be put at stake, the newspaper said.    The trade union daily TRUD has started a new rubric, "How Is  Life, Veteran?" The newspaper said that only 4,300,000 war  veterans have survived. Many of them have been denied  privileges that their colleagues enjoy. TRUD called on the  heads of local administrations and local councils to adopt  programmes of assistance for war veterans and do everything  possible to make their life easier.    The newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA recalls that the countries  of the anti-Hitler coalition, which included, apart from Russia,  the United States, Britain and France, also celebrate May 9.  "The war veterans of our allies also contributed to the  victory," the newspaper said. It described Viktor Suvorov's  book (former Soviet KGB agent who defected to the West)  "Icebreaker" as a myth.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also ran a big article devoted to  Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's new book "The View From the Kremlin."  The president is trying to "convince himself and others that he  had done everything possible to prevent the October 1993 bloody  drama and that his policy is the best and the only way out for  Russia," the newspaper said.    The youth daily KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes photographs  of  former residents of the village of Isakovo near Moscow who were  killed in the war. Thankful villagers unveiled a war memorial  on 9 May 1984 in their memory. "How many are there such obelisks  in Russia -- thousands? Dozens of thousands? Ten years ago  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA shorthand typist Yekaterina Blagodareva  told the story of just one because she would not have the heart  to talk about others," the newspaper said.    PRAVDA carries a series of photographs of war photographer  Aleksandr Ustinov. The events he caught on his pictures "belong  to history -- celebrations in Moscow in May 1945, legendary  Marshals Georgiy Zhukov and Konstantin Rokossovskiy and other  unforgettable scenes and faces," it said.</p>

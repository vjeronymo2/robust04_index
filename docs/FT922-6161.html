			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: MP no Euro sceptic Sir, Philip Stephens's description of Labour MPs who voted against the Maastricht Bill as '61 of the party's Euro-sceptics' is an unresearched generalisation ('Tories shrug off backbench revolt on Maastricht', May 22). I voted against and am by no means a Euro-sceptic - quite the reverse. I voted against because the 'British version' of the treaty seeks to create a Europe which pays no attention to the social needs and the employment rights of ordinary workers employed or unemployed. In fact, it negates the clear implications in the change of title from European Economic Community to European Community. That is not the sort of Europe I want to see. The interests of most of my constituents focus on the Social Chapter 'which in our case we have not got'. Our European colleagues have all got a much better deal - the deal that I want for Britain. I voted against the Bill because I am a Euro-enthusiast, not a Euro-sceptic and I believe more than a few of my new colleagues did the same. Colin Pickthall, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

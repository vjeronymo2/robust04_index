			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEWS OF AFI FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of a selection of the screenings today and Sunday  at the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the  Cineplex Odeon Cenutry Plaza Cinemas.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> 'Woman Demon Human'  </P> <P> China, 1988, 106 minutes  </P> <P> Noon  </P> <P>  Huang Shuquin, one of China's few women film makers, finds complex meanings  and considerable ambiguity in her story of an actress coming to terms with her  life and career in this exquisitely nuanced and strikingly original film. Her  heroine has from her youth defied convention in insisting on playing male roles  in the Chinese opera which require mastery of martial arts and gymnastics.  There's an interplay between Qiu's fascination with a demon in a popular opera  and in her own independent nature that gives the film a strong feminist spirit.  RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME issues warning over copper squeeze THE LONDON Metal Exchange yesterday reacted to widespread suggestions of that its 'flagship' copper market, on which most contracts around the world are based, was being manipulated to boost the price. It formally warned market users that it was continuing to monitor very closely the acute technical supply tightness that had developed between September and early October and 'will not hesitate to take such steps as are deemed necessary in the light of any changing situation'. Mr David King, chief executive, strode on to the floor of the exchange to remind members that LME rules gave the board draconian powers to ensure there is an orderly market. He said later: 'We wanted to make very clear what powers we have and that we won't hesitate to use them'. An earlier warning on July 14 that the LME was monitoring the copper market had little impact and yesterday's intervention also had no immediate effect. The backwardation (premium for metal for immediate delivery) for September to three months last night remained Dollars 17 a tonne. Analysts suggested the LME's action was proof that the copper market was being manipulated because if ordinary market forces were at play the board would not have been so overtly concerned. One trader pointed out that market volumes were huge so it was therefore easy to trade and for positions to be unwound. But those behind the squeeze would probably defy the LME's authority. Options activity suggests those behind the squeeze are looking for copper prices of Dollars 2,000 a tonne in September to October. Last night copper for delivery in three months was up Dollars 11.25 to Dollars 1,965 in spite of LME stocks standing at a 15-year peak of 463,000 tonnes. The situation is highly reminiscent of the technical squeeze in December, 1991. That resulted in the LME board taking the unprecedented step of limiting the backwardation to Pounds 25 a tonne a day (until recently LME copper was quoted in sterling). Unusual activity has kept the copper market in turmoil for much of this year. The price fell by one quarter in only five weeks, culminating in a 5 1/2 -year low of Dollars 1,705 a tonne in May. Several LME trading houses suffered huge losses because of that sudden and steep collapse. Now the price has bounced back and, according to Mr Simon Hunt, chairman of the Brook Hunt and Associates consultancy group, a 'ferocious battle is being fought out on the LME between the copper bulls and bears'. He says the bulls, mainly financial institutions together with one or two big metals market players, are rumoured to have bought forward more than 600,000 tonnes of copper. Mr Hunt warns: 'There is a mixture of knowledgeable selling (the trade) and ignorant buying (the institutions) which, against the background of deteriorating fundamentals, is bound to cause copper prices to fall suddenly and sharply at some time this year'. He says continuing high prices will delay necessary cuts in copper output and will lead to a cumulative supply surplus of 1m tonnes by the end of this year and one of 2.9m tonnes by the end of 1996.</p>

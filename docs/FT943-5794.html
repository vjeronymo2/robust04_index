			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / 'Mr Clean' foresees new power bloc: Japan could soon have a cohesive opposition Japan's fragmented opposition parties are just weeks away from pooling forces to create the first powerful opposition group for nearly 50 years. That is the belief of former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu, 64, father of the reforms to have swept Japanese politics over the past year. The 'Mr Clean' of Japanese politics yesterday took a break from campaigning in his home prefecture of Aichi, the heartland of the Japanese car industry, which is due for a critical by-election in 10 days, to explain his hopes. If Mr Kaifu is right, Japan's frustrated economic partners will have cause to throw their hats in the air. Lack of a coherent opposition during nearly four decades of one-party rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic party is commonly held to have suffocated political debate. This has bolstered the power of the state bureaucracy, often tempted by economic protectionism, which is blamed for contributing to Japan's huge current account surplus. The new group, provisionally named the 'new-new party' by the Japanese press, would have about 200 lower house seats, so rivalling the LDP for size. Mr Kaifu created a stir two months ago by leaving the LDP, in a failed attempt for the premiership, which was seen by his enemies as fumbled opportunism. He was prompted, he said, by distaste for his colleagues' decision to form a coalition with the LDP's traditional foe, the Social Democratic party, to attain the parliamentary majority needed to return to power after a humiliating year in opposition. 'The LDP lost all the honour of the past by choosing a prime minister from the SDP, just to get back into government. It is my responsibility, as the one who started reform, to say this was wrong,' said Mr Kaifu. He had repeatedly warned that the LDP was losing its way ever since being ousted by the old guard three years ago for being too keen on reform. In the weeks since leaving the LDP, Mr Kaifu has built a prominent place in the pro-reform opposition. He is working with Japan's other two most popular post-war prime ministers, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa and Mr Tsutomu Hata, to create the new super-party, the subject of intense backroom bargaining over the past month. Mr Kaifu was certain the 10 parliamentary opposition groups will shortly agree a common policy platform and joint electoral candidates. 'I assure you we will succeed,' he said. He is ostentatiously non-committal on suggestions that he is a candidate to lead the new super-party. Much depends on the outcome of the Aichi by-election for an upper house seat on September 11. It will give a measure of Mr Kaifu's own electoral value, as leader of the campaign, and could help win over those opposition members still doubtful about joining the super-party. It will also be watched closely by the government coalition, as the first election test since it grabbed power at the end of June. Aichi's upper house poll will also give a clue to whether or not political reform really will shake up Japan's power structure, because it will take place under electoral rules similar to those due to come into effect for the more powerful lower house next year. There will be single candidates from the government and opposition coalition groups, fighting openly for a single seat, rather than a cosy share-out of several seats, as under the old multi-seat constituency system. Mr Kaifu, making a brief stop in his Tokyo office before returning to Aichi to campaign for the opposition candidate there, believes the outcome will make or break the government. 'It is going to be difficult for an administration composed of opposite poles to come up with an ideology. The only way they can survive is to maintain the status quo,' he said. 'The SDP and LDP are like oil and water. They cannot compromise, and can only delay on important decisions like tax and post-war reparations,' he argues. In theory, the opposition should have an advantage in Aichi. Mr Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the Buddhist-backed Komeito, the Clean Government party, the second largest opposition group, has a seat there. There is also support from local unions linked to the Democratic Socialist Party, an important opposition group supported by Toyota, the powerful car maker based there. All this invites the question of whether the reforms started by Mr Kaifu in 1991 really will produce a new breed of skilled politicians better able to make policies that respond to voters' aspirations, rather than scheme for power. 'Yes, reform did go through a lot of detours,' he admitted, referring to the success of LDP party elders in watering down his original plans. Yet a vital general principle has been introduced. Politicians will henceforth be held more directly accountable for their policies, by virtue of a more competitive electoral system, Mr Kaifu argued. That will make the job of prime ministers in the mid-1990s far harder than was the case when Mr Kaifu held the post. When asked if he wants another crack at the leadership, post-reform, Mr Kaifu laughed uproariously. 'That's not in my mind just now,' he said. 'I just want politics to be clean.'</p>

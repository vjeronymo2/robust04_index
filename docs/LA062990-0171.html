			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-TRAINED DOCTOR AND HIS WIFE CHOSE NOT TO GO BACK  </P> <P> Dr. Jose and Nora Cueto unwittingly beat the exodus from Cuba by nearly a  decade. Jose received a scholarship ("we were not a wealthy family, never owned  our own home") from the University of Havana for a year's travel. He took  advantage of it first by going to Niagara Falls on his honeymoon in 1952.  </P> <P> The couple intended to return to Cuba, but Jose spent two years completing his  surgery internship in Detroit, and Nora stayed with him.  </P> <P> The last time they visited Cuba was in the winter of 1958, when they celebrated  Christmas with their families. Jose was offered a job as director of a hospital  there, but he didn't like the sound of the fighting in the hills. He decided  the United States was safer.  </P> <P> "There was a five-year wait to become a citizen, and citizenship is required to  practice medicine," the Santa Ana doctor said. He remembers confronting signs  that read "graduates of Latin American universities need not apply" when  searching for a job.  </P> <P> He was in the U.S. Navy when the Batista regime fell, and on New Year's Day,  1959, colleagues congratulated him for the coup that brought Fidel Castro to  power. He remembers that day as the one when he learned how to pronounce the  word chaos in English. His response was, "Now there will be chaos!"  </P> <P> Dr. Cueto says 80% of his patients are Cubans. Despite his 15-hour workdays, he  reads the newspaper daily and writes letters to the editors. He is very  concerned with the way Cuba is portrayed.  </P> <P> News reports, he said, imply a vast improvement under Castro by noting the  large number of Cuban physicians and engineers sent to Communist nations such  as Nicaragua. But these physicians receive their degrees after only two years  of education rather than the six to 10 demanded in Western nations and in  pre-revolutionary Cuba, he added.  </P> <P> Jose and Nora served as sponsors to bring people out of Cuba -- relatives,  children of friends. His brother, Juan, emigrated via Spain and now works as an  administrator in Jose's office.  </P> <P> The Cuetos' five children were born here -- all in different states. Their two  daughters -- Nora and Ana Maria -- married Americans. Two of their three sons  -- Jose and Juan Antonio -- married Mexicans. Their other son, Victor, will  marry his Mexican fiancee next month.  </P> <P> Unlike the majority of Cuban exiles, the Cueto family left nothing behind. "The  only thing my family lost was fear and the demand to talk like a hypocrite!"  Jose said.  </P></p>

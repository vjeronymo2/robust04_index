			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: OZONE CLEANUP DISCOVERY  </P> <P> In a termite mound in the remote Boola Boola Forest of Australia, scientists  have found a hint that a natural process may be working slowly to remove  ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from the atmosphere. If the hint  turns out to be correct, it could mean that CFCs in the atmosphere could be  reduced eventually.  </P> <P> The discovery was made by researchers at the Oregon Graduate Center's Institute  of Atmospheric Sciences, who measured methane emissions from termite mounds in  Australia, comparing the composition of air inside the mound with air outside.  Among the chemicals they measured were CFCs. CFC levels inside the termite  caverns, separated by 10 inches of soil from the air outside, were  significantly lower than outside. Oregon researcher M. Aslam Khalil speculated  that something in the soil must be removing CFCs from the air as it filters  through the walls to fill the mounds, either breaking down CFCs or trapping  them.  </P> <P> Khalil believes there is an unknown chemical breakdown process at work. If the  chemical could be identified, scientists might be able to use it to break down  CFCs before they can reach the atmosphere, the researchers speculated.  </P></p>

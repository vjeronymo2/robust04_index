			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] European Automakers Begin Reorganizing    Aiming to complement each other with regard to market  [position] and car models, Renault and Volvo will merge by  January 1994. The curtain has risen on the drama of the European  auto industry's reorganization.    There are two major factors driving the reorganization. One  is the rapid deterioration of the European auto market. The  number of new passenger cars registered in the 17 European  countries from January through July was 6,965,800. Compared to  the same period last year, this was a decrease of 18.3 percent.  The Japanese new car market also dropped off during the same  period, but only by 7.1 percent.    Regarding this rapid market shrinkage, the research  department of a major automaker said, "The European economic  recession is largely to blame, but another cause is that auto  emission standards have become stricter due to EC integration,  which began this January." And about the current sales slump, an  auto analyst in Europe predicted, "Just as the wave of  prosperity from 1985 to 1989 was long, this slump will also be  long." This analyst is thus of the view that "the sales slump  will continue for a while."  <H5>  The Threat of Japanese Cars </H5>   The second factor driving reorganization is the Japanese  auto  offensive. In 1980, 1,220,000 Japanese cars were exported to  Europe, whereas in 1992, that number was up to 1,600,000.    Since last year, Nissan has increased the models being  produced at its British plant. Honda and Toyota are also  starting up new plants in England. And Mitsubishi Motors, in a  joint venture with Volvo, plans to begin production in 1995. The  number of Japanese cars is thus expected to increase still  further.    "The Japanese auto industry has 30 percent greater  productivity than the German," said Mercedes' Environmental  Policy Director Lacheem, who fears that competitiveness. The  view of one auto analyst in Europe--that "Japanese market share  here, as in the U.S., will rise to near 30 percent (it is now 12  percent)"--is not necessarily an exaggeration.    Against this offensive from Japanese autos, the EC Committee  has established monitoring levels for them and implemented  import volume restrictions. Moreover, despite the fact that on  April 1 the committee decided to reduce the 1993 monitoring  level to 1,089,000 vehicles--9.4 percent less than the previous  year's actual number of imports--on September 4 it cut this  level by nearly 10 percent more, to 980,000 vehicles, 18.5  percent less than the previous year's number of imports. "This  was because the drop in the European market became even more  serious than at the time of the April agreement," said EC  Committee Vice Chairman Bangeman. Even so, it could probably  still be said that the Europeans acted precipitously.    The main reason for this is that, amid the severe slump in  the European market, Japanese cars have steadily been extending  their sway.    Although the volume of Japanese cars continues to be down by  a double-digit rate from last year, their 12 percent market  share for January-July represents an increase of 0.2 points from  the same period last year. And in 1999, the restrictions on the  import of Japanese cars will be lifted. It will soon be  impossible [for the Europeans] to rely only on politics.  <H3>  Mergers, More Car Models, Personnel Reductions;  Manufacturers Also Frantically Restructuring </H3>   In particular, "Mercedes Benz of Germany has been undergoing  a major transformation since its new president took over this  May," said Nobuyoshi Yoshida, Director of the Automobile  Management and Development Research Center. Until now, Mercedes  has limited its annual production to 600,000 vehicles, and has  covered rising personnel expenses by increasing car luxury and  price. It recently announced, however, that it will begin local  production in the United States; moreover, it will begin making  cars for the masses. It has thus embarked in a new direction.  And though it reduced its work force by 13,000 people in 1992,  it plans to cut another 27,000 by the end of 1994.    "Mercedes' entry into mass cars is especially significant,"  said Director Yoshida. "It's because the European automakers,  which, until now, have existed through a certain degree of  isolation, have been caught by the competition." At the Motor  Show held in Frankfurt, Germany in September, there was an  abundance of concept cars in the compact category. They included  Mercedes' Vision A, with a displacement of 1.2 liters; BMW's E1;  Opel's Tigora; and Ford's Sub B. Competition in the compact car  market is likely to become quite fierce.    Accordingly, in addition to making cars that are appealing,  a  major point will be how to reduce their cost. In this  connection, the use of common parts by different companies,  which is already being done, should develop even further. And to  strengthen the benefits of this practice, companies will  probably form tie-ups--that is, mergers.    Here, the company that might be mentioned first is Fiat,  which has survived due to Italy's protective policies. When EC  integration was decided and market liberalization began, Fiat  rapidly lost competitiveness. In 1989, it had the top share in  the European market, whereas in 1992 its share dropped to  fourth. Rumors are circulating that it will merge with France's  Peugeot.    There is also a report that the company with the  ninth-ranking market share, Rover of England, will be acquired  by VW. This spring, VW, whose position in England is weak,  converted its distribution subsidiary there to a full-faceted  subsidiary. This is thought to be a preparatory step for  acquiring Rover.    Moreover, Mercedes and many other European companies, aware  that their productivity is inferior to that of Japanese  companies, want production technology from the latter. The Dutch  commercial vehicle manufacturer, Dafu, due to, among other  things, administrative difficulties, has asked Mitsubishi Motors  to buy its plant in England.    But Japanese companies are also in dire straits and cannot  vigorously lead the way in reorganization. If the yen continues  to appreciate, however, it will become hard for them to export  to Europe, forcing them to switch to producing there.    The number of tie-ups between Japanese and European  automakers is still limited. Nevertheless, one possible approach  is, like Mitsubishi Motors, to form a joint venture with a  Europeanmaker and produce a new line in an existing European  plant. In the future, the relationship between Japanese and  European makers will probably extend beyond sales cooperation in  the Japanese market to production cooperation in Europe.</p>

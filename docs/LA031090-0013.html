			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CURBS ON CIGARETTE SMOKING  </P> <P> You present a cogent editorial on the dangers of smoking. It calls for action  now! It points to the deaths and illnesses and economic losses caused by  smoking . . . and then it asks what are the Bush Administration's plans to do  something about it.  </P> <P> The front page and the Business section run stories about how the tobacco  companies aim their advertising at young, at minorities and at women trying to  lure them to this insidious drug.  </P> <P> But your same newspaper runs full-page ads for cigarettes and tobacco products.  Apparently the same people who write your editorials don't control your  advertising. Apparently promoting addictive drugs that kill and main outweighs  the loss of advertising income. Don't ask what the Bush Administration will do  about smoking; what will The Times do about it.  </P> <P> BOB FIRESTONE, M.D.  </P> <P> Nipomo  </P></p>

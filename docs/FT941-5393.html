			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Multilingual pictures centre could give Europe edge on Hollywood Sir, The answer to your article 'Quest for a strategy to match Hollywood' (Can Europe Compete? March 1), is yes: Europe can compete by concentrating on communication instead of cultural isolation. This can be done by addressing the problem of language. European film producers and culture ministers have to think multilingually if they want to compete with Hollywood. This is what US film producers did in the 1930s when they had their movies dubbed in the relevant languages before selling them in Europe. Beacuse the home market is so small, such an investment is impossible for low-budget producers in Europe who have many more languages to consider. One solution is a cultural communications centre to act as mediator for participating countries and to enable producers to have material translated, subtitled or dubbed. Distributors are undoubtedly more willing to take on films ready for distribution. Working with professionals on a freelance basis, the centre would not require an army of people; it could make services cheaper and European films more accessible worldwide. There are markets in south-east Asia, where works of art are frequently savaged with one or two voices speaking over for the whole cast while the original can be heard in the background. Better service now would not diminish the future market for European producers. Europe could then create a Hollywood, albeit without the stars, but possibly with success.

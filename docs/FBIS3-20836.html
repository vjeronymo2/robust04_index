			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Slobodan Djukic: "Drop the Hammer, Pick Up the </F> Sickle"]    [Text] Niteks, a textile factory in Serbia, is prepared to  pay its excess employees 36 months of wages to leave their jobs  and return to the countryside or open a private business. Niteks  has about 1,500 employees; some 500 of them are underemployed.    Approximately 1 million people, white collar and blue collar  workers, are supposed to lose their jobs throughout Serbia soon.  The new economic program foresees that about 200,000 of them  will return to farms. Many other Serbian companies are trying to  convince their work forces, which migrated from the countryside  to the cities, to exchange their hammers for a sickle. The  management of the Smederevo ironworks, a huge investment, is  trying to motivate its workers to cultivate edible forest  plants. The Crvena Zastava automobile factory in Kragujevac is  planning to open a farming center.    However, it seems that it will be difficult to persuade  people to return to the countryside. The state program could be  enforced only by using repressive measures and massive layoffs.  It is questionable whether these people are really ready to  return to the countryside; some of them have no place to which  to return. People have migrated to the cities because they have  found city life more comfortable, with more job and education  opportunities. Now they feel shortchanged on all counts; they  have lost their work, they are pressured to return to the  village, they cannot send their children to school. It is hard  to expect that all the problems will be solved with economic  measures. Will the proponents of such a policy be forced to  resort to violence, as was the case in China during the Cultural  Revolution or as the Pol Pot regime [in Cambodia] did when it  forcibly relocated the population, abolished the use of money,  and established cooperatives?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the news desk] </F>   [Text] The British Government radio [BBC] announced last  night that 100 writers and broad-minded [rowshanfekran] persons  abroad, who have fled Iran, sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali  expressing concern about the fate of 'Ali Akbar Sa'idi-Sirjani.    Support for Sa'idi-Sirjani by this group of broad-minded  individuals comes at a time when a number of so-called writers  in Iran have also tried to lobby for Sa'idi-Sirjani.    It is worth mentioning that Sa'idi-Sirjani has been charged  with smuggling of drugs and with corruption and was arrested a  while ago by antidrug officials.    One of these broad-minded persons who supports  Sa'idi-Sirjani  told our correspondent: The charges leveled against  Sa'idi-Sirjani are not unforgivable sins, as most of the writers  and broad-minded persons indulge in taking drugs.    In answer to a question on his views about the smuggling of  drugs, he said: The court should prove this charge.    When asked what was the meaning of the collecting of  signatures at home and abroad, he said: If the government  arrests people for these reasons, there are many who will be  concerned!    It may be mentioned that on 25 April the director general of  internal security of the Information Ministry announced in an  interview that Sa'idi-Sirjani and Niaz Kermani were members of  the SAVAK [shah's intelligence organization] and have admitted  to the transporting, distribution, and use of drugs. They have  also confessed to producing, stocking, and distributing liquor  and to immoral acts.</p>

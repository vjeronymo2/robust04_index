			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (5): Sensitivity over surplus - Trade In the quest to prove that the Japanese market is open, the country's car makers have been doing US producers the favour of sharing cherished showroom space. And electronics companies are doing their bit for trade harmony, with Matsushita Electric Industrial selling US-made hiking gear for the great Japanese outdoors. The mix of a soaring trade surplus and a US election campaign has made Japanese companies all the more sensitive to political symbolism. And with the European Community keen to convene negotiations to remove 'structural' barriers to balanced trade, EC companies may be the beneficiaries of Japanese corporate favours in coming months. At the centre of this activity is the Japanese trade surplus, which is likely to set a new record this year surpassing the Dollars 82.7bn of 1986. The sheer size of the figure inspires trade friction, regardless of the structural changes made by Japan over the past six years, and generally regardless of the corporate favours. Having watched the surplus fall in successive years to Dollars 52.1bn in 1990, the Japanese government was dismayed by the jump to Dollars 77.8bn last year and is even more uncomfortable at the prospect of the surplus topping Dollars 100bn in the current year. The resurgence has come with the slowing of the economy, as demand has fallen for imports and Japanese manufacturers, who over-invested in new capacity in the late 1980s, have increased exports. Given the embarrassing surplus, the government has good reason to maintain a low profile this year, other than for the announcement of new trade favours and promises to stimulate the domestic economy. However, the Japanese government has been uncharacteristically aggressive in recent weeks and caused confusion in Washington with the timing of its first report on unfair trading policies. The report, which found that the US had nine black marks out of a possible 10, was conceived when Japan's surplus was falling and was intended to show that not only the EC and the US could find fault with trading partners. While not providing for punitive action against violators, the report did achieve its aim of 'stimulating discussion'. US Congress representatives dismissed the report on the grounds that 'people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones', while even the Bush Administration complained that Japan was 'not in a position' to criticise US policy. However, at least a few officials in Tokyo were pleased that they had created a small stir in Washington and given the impression that Japan had become less passive. Meanwhile, Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, dispatched letters to the US and EC complaining that they had failed to honour deadlines for reports under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Japan, one of about 15 countries to meet deadlines for submissions on industrial tariffs, presented a 450-page report, while the US furnished only a few pages and said that reductions were still under consideration. And the foreign ministry also sent a separate letter to the EC complaining that a Commission review of bilateral relations was no more than a collection of trade whinges and had ignored the potential for improved political and cultural ties. Japanese officials were particularly annoyed that the report bluntly suggested that the EC 'convince Japan' to cut the trade surplus. There is concern in Tokyo that the Commission will be tempted to use Japan as an issue on which to unite EC sentiment. When Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, met Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, in early July, EC irritation at Japan's Dollars 27bn surplus was made clear and it was suggested that the two sides establish an 'experts forum' to study the 'structural' causes. The proposal echoes the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) launched by the US in which Japan promised to increase infrastructure spending and to speed the approval of larger stores in an attempt to change spending patterns and stimulate demand for imports. If the trade surplus continues to increase, Washington will be under pressure to concede that SII was of limited use and to devise another initiative to redress the imbalance. But, by focusing on the raw figures, Japan's trading partners are ignoring policy changes and overlooking the competitiveness of Japanese products. The first signs of recovery in the US were accompanied by an increase in Japanese exports, essentially because US consumers and companies were choosing to buy Japanese. And manufacturers of machine tools are able to export excess domestic capacity to the EC and Asia because of the enduring demand for quality production equipment. That doesn't mean Japanese companies are completely free of blame. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) explains that some companies which expanded capacity in the late 1980s got their numbers badly wrong and are now being forced to export. And the ministry also concedes that the financial 'bubble' of the late 1980s distorted the improvement in the trade balance, having prompted an unsustainable increase in imports of luxury goods, including European prestige cars. But Japan has done much since the mid-1980s. The yen has appreciated sharply, domestic demand was stimulated, markets were opened and import promotion campaigns were christened. Yen appreciation was supposed to make exporters less competitive, but companies adapted and have kept or expanded market share in industries such as cars and machine tools. At the same time, leading manufacturers have established factories in south-east Asia and China dependent on high value-added components made in Japan. These factories have created demand for imports from Japan and are exporting competitively-priced Japanese-branded goods to western markets. In the longer term, Japan will face political pressure not only from the EC and US, but also from the Asian countries which have recently surpassed the US and Canada as its largest regional market.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Labour members 'back vote reform' LABOUR PARTY members have given 'substantial backing' to the case for electoral reform - with 60 per cent of constituencies agreeing the party should end its support of the first-past-the-post voting system, an MP said yesterday. Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr and chairman of the Labour campaign for electoral reform, said the findings 'nail the lie that Labour is losing interest in electoral reform'. Labour modernisers today seek to intensify pressure on union leaders to fall into line behind Mr John Smith's party reforms. Writing in the Fabian Review, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, says the party must resist those on the left whose solutions offer a return to Labour's past.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY ISN'T FINISHED WITH CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS;  </P> <P> MEXICO: THE THIRD-PARTY LEFT ONLY SEEMS TO BE OUT OF THE POWER LOOP. ITS  POPULARITY IS STRONG WHERE MORAL AUTHORITY COUNTS: IN THE GRASS ROOTS.  </P> <P> This time last year, after a highly disputed presidential election, Mexico was  bordering on a constitutional crisis. Opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas  had delivered what seemed then to be an almost fatal blow to the official party  and its designated heir, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.  </P> <P> Today Cardenas sets out on a one-week tour to present his case to influential  people in the United States (including Los Angeles). Back home, Salinas seems  to be firmly in charge, and his party is still in control of all but one state.  Where does that leave Cardenas and his movement?  </P> <P> Many Americans, reading about Salinas' accomplishments, might think that last  year's turmoil is only a memory, that the democratic clamor of the people has  subsided, that the Cardenas-led opposition is becoming irrelevant. In fact,  beyond the superficial image of "business as usual," Mexico's political system  is still suffering from last year's schism. There is a profound cleavage and  antagonism between the government and the opposition due to Cardenas'  democratic obstinacy and his refusal to recognize the validity of last year's  official election results.  </P> <P> Many analysts, both in Mexico and in the United States, see this  Salinas-Cardenas confrontation as a zero-sum game in which all Salinas'  achievements must be counted as Cardenas' losses. The spectacular moves and the  firm hand shown by Salinas during his first year have created the impression  that he has consolidated power and gained political credibility at the expense  of the strength and prestige built by Cardenas during the presidential  campaign.  </P> <P> It is true that today Salinas enjoys a high rate of approval, particularly  among the middle classes, direct beneficiaries of his economic program. But,  surprising as it might seem, this approval has not been accompanied by a  proportionate decline in Cardenas' popularity. A recent opinion poll conducted  in Mexico by the Los Angeles Times showed that while Salinas' approval may be  as high as 69%, Cardenas is viewed favorably by at least 50% of his  compatriots. This apparent aberration is simply evidence of the transition  Mexico is now experiencing. The public is torn between old and new: between the  traditional sense of security given by the authoritarian presidency and the new  aspirations of electoral democracy, pluralism, a peaceful alternation of power  and government honesty and accountability. Mexicans are divided between the  hope of social justice and economic equality represented by Cardenas and the  dream of efficiency, prosperity and economic modernization expressed by  Salinas.  </P> <P> Over the last year, Cardenas has been trying to mobilize people to solve these  differences and take these issues to the polls. He has organized a new  political party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and is demanding  that the government devise a fair and competitive electoral system where vote  counting is clean and open.  </P> <P> The results are mixed. His greatest political achievement has been to keep  alive his almost mystical link with the Mexican people. As he travels week  after week across the country, Cardenas continues to turn out huge crowds and  evoke extraordinary devotion from broad sectors of Mexican society. He has been  able, so far, to use this moral authority to keep the disenchanted masses and  his frustrated supporters away from violent confrontations with the government  -- a gain for Mexico and a true gift to the government of Carlos Salinas.  </P> <P> Cardenas' most notable failure has been his inability to oblige the government  to accept meaningful electoral reform. A year ago, facing a crisis of  legitimacy and driven by the need to build support and consensus, Salinas  adopted one of Cardenas' original demands: serious political reform. Salinas  failed to deliver, and Cardenas' did not have the force necessary to make it  happen. He has until now not been able to transform his personal following into  an effective political instrument to defend the vote.  </P> <P> Encouraged by their successful confrontation with Cardenas and the PRD, the  government and the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) have continued to  tamper with elections throughout the country. The most notable example was the  local elections of Michoacan on July 2, where an independent tribunal of  respected citizens concluded that the PRI stole at least 14 of the 18 seats in  the legislature.  </P> <P> The tactic of the government and the PRI has been to adopt a hard line with the  left-of-center opposition and a soft stance with the rightist National Action  Party (PAN). Michoacan and Baja California, where a PAN governor was sworn in  last week, are the expressions of this "selective" democracy. In exchange for  minor changes in electoral legislation, the PAN voted with the official party  last month to approve several constitutional amendments that reinforce the  one-party system. Cardenas faces a tough dilemma. He can continue to fight for  change in the electoral arena, exposing his party and his supporters to the  frustrating exercise of one defeat by fraud after another. Or he can adopt new  but risky tactics of civil disobedience and boycotts. The government's message  is clear: Either Cardenas, like the PAN, accepts the rules of the old game, or  he and his supporters will be increasingly ostracized. The government hopes  that if Cardenas does not come back to the fold -- that is, to the system  controlled by one party -- he can be driven to radicalism and his moderate  supporters scared away. There is no evidence that Cardenas can be co-opted, but  the determination of the government not to change the country's electoral  system could indeed drive voters to frustration and the democratic forces of  Mexico into a dark alley of despair.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Court Backs State in Mission Case: The California Supreme Court ordered an  appellate court to review its decision blocking collection by the state of  about $300 million. The case involves reinsurance payments that the Department  of Insurance maintains are owed to defunct Mission Insurance Cos., a former  writer of workers compensation insurance. The money is due, said Insurance  Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie, from reinsurance companies that shared in  insurance premiums collected by L.A.-based Mission in exchange for sharing the  potential risk.  </P></p>

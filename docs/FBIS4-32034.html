			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister of the </F> republic of Serb Krajina, by Predrag Sarac; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Sarac] The continuation of the negotiations on  economic cooperation between the Republic of Serbian Krajina  [RSK] and Croatia has attracted much attention. Even though  everything was ready for the continuation of the negotiations in  Krajina and in Plitvice, the failure by the Croatian delegation  to turn up has practically blocked the negotiating process.  What was in fact happening during the consultations shortly  before the talks were supposed to take place? There were plenty  of comments, but we sought the answer from Borislav Mikelic,  head of the government and the Krajina negotiating delegation.    [Mikelic] Their rejection of the continuation of the  negotiations and failure to come to Plitvice, because we had  allegedly not agreed to allow five journalists to come here, is  a transparent thing and cannot be the reason as to why there are  no negotiations.    It appears to me that the central thing in all this is that  Sarinic [chief Croatian negotiator] had realized that he would  not be the host in Plitvice, but us, that he would not be able  to promote himself in Plitvice, and that he would not be able to  manifest what he wants, that he would be under the completely  equal conditions, like us. He had realized that, in the  presence of the international community, the talks would be held  in the way they should, that there would be no pressure, nor  agreements prepared in advance according to which the Serbs  would allow this and that, without at the same time seeing what  is behind this.    [Sarac] What should be done next? Will the negotiations  continue?    [Mikelic] In our view, everything that we had prepared, the  platform that had been prepared by our government, we are  prepared to continue the talks tomorrow. We have therefore not  disrupted the talks. We have not given up the negotiations. We  were not the cause of the talks' failure either. Those who did  not come to Plitvice, because of the journalists, I think that  they are responsible for not coming to Plitvice.</p>

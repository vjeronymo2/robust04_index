			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PACO'S STORY BY LARRY HEINEMENN (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> The pain that Paco suffers from the hideous wounds he received in Vietnam pale  before the cruel indifference of the people he encounters in a small Midwestern  town when he returns home. Paco is not one of the cliched, murderous,  drugged-out vets of pop fiction, but a simple man, thwarted in his search for a  decent life. His story is told in rambling monologue by the unnamed "ghost" of  a dead buddy, and Heinemenn argues in this powerful, National Book  Award-winning novel, that the callous indifference of the American people has  reduced Vietnam veterans to living ghosts. How can the wounds that Paco and  thousands of others endured ever heal if the scabs are constantly being pulled  off through neglect and voyeurism?  </P></p>

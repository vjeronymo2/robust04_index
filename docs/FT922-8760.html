			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Brazilian state to privatise services THE government of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and richest state, is launching a programme to privatise its public services. Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, state governor, said he was seeking private funding for the maintenance and operation of existing services, as well as the construction of new public works on a concession basis. The first stages of the programme, approved last week by the state legislature, would include privatisation of the road network, water treatment plants, small energy generation projects, and expansion in the use of natural gas, the river transport system and inter-municipality bus services. The programme is open to foreign participation. Mr Fleury said there had already been interest from Canadian, French, Spanish and British companies, including Northwest Water. Most were planning to bid in a consortium with Brazilian companies. He had received offers of finance from foreign banks as the projects would be a private, rather than state, initiative. Tenders for concessions will be offered in 30 days for international bids. Sao Paulo is the centre of Brazilian industry and has a GDP of about Dollars 170bn (Pounds 96bn) - 39 per cent of the national total and more than that of Argentina. Its population is 31m. Explaining the decision to privatise, Mr Fleury said the state no longer had the capacity to invest in public works. 'There are two ways to overcome this  -putting up taxes, which is not feasible, or privatising.' In the initial stages alone, the programme would save the state Dollars 600m.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 31.9 MILLION AMERICANS IN POVERTY IN '88; 13.1% RATE  </P> <P> The nation's poverty rate was 13.1% last year, about the same as in 1987, the  Census Bureau reported today. That means 31.9 million Americans were living in  poverty in 1988.  </P> <P> In 1987, about 32.3 million people, or 13.4% of the population, were living in  poverty. The Census Bureau said the changes between 1987 and 1988 were not  statistically significant.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau also reported that Americans' median household income was  $27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier after adjusting for the rise in  consumer prices. Again, the change was not considered significant.  </P> <P> Per capita income, meanwhile, rose 1.7% to an all-time high of $13,120 in 1988,  a change that was considered significant.  </P> <P> "It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same or improved," said  William Butz, associate director for demographics at the Census Bureau.  </P> <P> The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by 0.3% last year  to 10.1%. The poverty rate for blacks was 31.6%, down from 32.6% in 1987, and  the rate for Latinos dipped to 26.8% from 28.1%. None of those changes was  considered significant.  </P> <P> Regionally, the only statistically significant change in the poverty rate  occurred in the Midwest, where the rate dropped from 12.5% in 1987 to 11.5%  last year. The poverty rate in the South was 16.2% in 1988, up from 16.1%. In  the West, the rate was 12.7%, up from 12.5%, and in the Northeast, the rate was  10.2%, down from 10.9%.  </P> <P> Today's report on poverty in 1988 was prepared by the Census Bureau based on a  survey of about 58,000 U.S. households last March.  </P> <P> While debate rages over the cost and adequacy of programs to fight poverty,  battles also continue over defining and counting it.  </P> <P> Advocates for the poor insist the formal definition underestimates the problem  because it does not really reflect their spending habits.  </P> <P> But other researchers contend the measurement may overestimate poverty because  it only considers people's cash income and not government assistance.  </P> <P> The official definition of poverty was developed by the Social Security  Administration in 1964 based on Department of Agriculture research on what  people spend on food.  </P> <P> Agriculture analysts had calculated that people spent about one-third of their  income to eat, and developed a variety of plans to provide adequate nutrition  at high-, middle- and low-cost levels.  </P> <P> The definition of poverty was then set at three times the cost of the lowest  price food program, known as the thrifty food plan.  </P> <P> Adjusted annually for inflation, the poverty threshold has risen from about  $3,000 per year in the early 1960s to nearly $12,000 today for a family of  four. The poverty level varies slightly for urban and rural residents and rises  with the size of family. Many assistance programs kick in at 125% of the  poverty rate.  </P> <P> In recent years advocates for the poor have challenged that thinking,  contending the cost of living has changed over the years.  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Butte Mining puts value on litigation claims Butte Mining, the UK-quoted company whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages from former managers and promoters  - estimates that, if it succeeds with its maximum claim for nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), this would be worth 129p a share. Yesterday Butte shares, which languished at 2 3/4 p at the beginning of 1994, moved up  1/4 p to 4 3/4 p. In the annual report, Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, includes estimates of how much the litigation might bring shareholders - estimates are made complex because others have first call on some of the proceeds. For example, Deutsch &amp; Frey, its US contingent-fee attorney, is entitled to one third of the gross proceeds from the litigation while the management team is entitled to a further 5.25 per cent, but of that 4.5 per cent would be paid only on proceeds above Pounds 15m. Mr Lloyd-Jacob suggests that, assuming the number of Butte's issued shares remains at 287m and the exchange rate is Dollars 1.5 to the Pounds , an award of Dollars 100m would be worth 12p a share; one of Dollars 200m would be worth 25p a share; one of Dollars 300m, 38p; Dollars 400m, 51p; Dollars 500m, 64p; Dollars 600m, 77p; Dollars 700m, 90p; Dollars 800m, 103p; and Dollars 900m, 116p. The US lawsuits are expected to come to trial within two years, says Mr Lloyd-Jacob, and the prospects for significant awards are 'excellent.' Mr Lloyd-Jacob says that in 1993 executives deferred their salaries and 'sometimes paid (Butte's) bills themselves. He was paid only Pounds 12,500 of his Pounds 50,000 entitlement.</p>

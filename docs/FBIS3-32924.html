			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 15  February.    Luis German Carcoba Garcia, the president of the Business  Coordinating Council, has noted that "excessive surveillance  along the border by U.S. immigration officials is a bothersome  and delicate issue that violates human rights." He added,  however, that the situation will not affect trade relations  between the two countries. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television  Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94)    In an address to the Business Opportunities Seminar in  Guadalajara, Gilberto Jimenez Garcia de Alba, the president of  the National Council for Foreign Trade, said that exports of  Mexico's nonpetroleum products increased 17 percent during 1993.  He added that higher nonpetroleum exports, $15 billion in  foreign investments, and overall price stability "confirm that  we are on the right track." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0112  GMT 11 Feb 94)    In a speech to the Business Opportunities Seminar in  Guadalajara, Eugenio Carrion, the under secretary of commerce  and industrial development, said Mexico has one of the most  attractive markets in the world. He said proof of this was the  record growth of many companies on the Mexican Stock Market.  Companies such as Cifra, Gigante, and Comercial Mexicana  registered growth of 14-24 percent. Mexico offers a stable  economy, low inflation, and virtually no foreign debt, all of  which attract investment. Carrion also said "Mexico can supply  the U.S. Hispanic market," which spends about $230 billion a  year, which is equivalent to 75 percent of Mexico's overall GNP.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2231 GMT 9 Feb 94)    Jaime Serra Puche, the secretary of commerce and industrial  development, has said foreign investment surpassed $40 billion  over the past five years. He met in Guadalajara with local and  foreign business leaders and announced that investments meant an  influx of capital totaling $15.6 billion during 1993 -- an 87  percent increase over 1992. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television  Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 9 Feb 94)    Mexican crude oil prices increased in January, according to  a  report issued be Mexican Petroleum (Pemex).

(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0026 GMT 10 Feb 94)    Pedro Aspe Armella, the secretary of finance and public  credit, says interest rates are continuing to fall. He called  this a "memorable event, because rates on the money market have  reached a single digit figure -- 9.75 percent." Meanwhile,  consumer prices rose 0.8 percent in January. This is the  smallest increase in 22 years. Officials pointed out that this  is the first time the inflation rate fell below 1 percent for  this time of year.

Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee,  provincial governor, and first secretary of the provincial  military district's party committee, attended the session and  made an important speech.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and government,  Jia Qinglin expressed his kind regards to all officers and  soldiers of the provincial military district and wished them a  happy new year. He thanked all officers and men who have  defended, supported, and contributed to Fujian's two  civilizations. Subsequently, he briefed them on Fujian's  achievements in establishing the socialist market economic  structure and other aspects of social undertakings.    Jia Qinglin said: All these achievements cannot be separated  from the support of the People's Liberation Army or from the  hard work of soldiers and civilians.    Jia Qinglin pointed out: To scale a new height in economic  development, Fujian needs a more stable and relaxed environment.  Armed forces units in the provincial military district undertake  the important responsibility of safeguarding the motherland's  southeastern coast. They should have a strong sense of mission  and responsibility, strengthen their training on combat  readiness, improve their tactics and skills, and enhance their  combat effectiveness.    Jia Qinglin stressed: In this new situation when we are  stepping up the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure, we should make major efforts to carry forward the  Fujian Army's and civilians' glorious tradition in two-support  work, strengthen the unity between the Army and the government  and between the Army and civilians, enhance the friendship  between the Army and localities and between the Army and  civilians, and jointly create a safe and stable social  environment.    The session summed up the provincial military district's  work  last year and arranged this year's work. At the session, the  provincial military district commended a number of advanced  units and individuals and conferred Merit Citation Class Two and  Three on those who had performed extraordinarily well.</p>

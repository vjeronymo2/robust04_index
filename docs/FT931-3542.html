			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Calling time on drinking with the boys: How women see their role in the unions AS WOMEN trade unionists gather for their annual conference in Blackpool this week they will be forced to confront one unpleasant fact. The movement itself - far from being able to report gains in promoting women to top jobs  -appears to be going backwards. In 1990 there were five female general secretaries of TUC-affiliated unions. Today only one is left: Ms Elizabeth Symons, who leads the small Association of First Division Civil Servants. According to one woman union official, many men in unions 'are still making the right noises, but have done very little to shift their attitudes'. The apparent decline in the fortunes of women within unions has been partly structural and partly cultural, she says. Women have often lost out - or given up the battle of working in an often hostile environment - as tiers of union management have been stripped out to save costs. 'Women working for unions have to work extremely hard to prove themselves,' the official continues. 'If they're not endlessly drinking with the boys then they're considered not to be playing the game and they don't get on. Some women have decided to get out and make their contribution to the labour movement in some other way. To some men, that's seen as bottling out - not being able to stand the pressure.' Two of the unions which will be calling at the conference for a law to make employers publish annual figures on the number of women they have promoted have themselves lost their female leaders. At the Association of University Teachers, Ms Diana Warwick has moved to a new job and has been succeeded by a man; at the National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades, Mrs Helen McGrath lost her general secretary's job to a male competitor as the result of a merger. The trend towards fewer, larger unions has been responsible for other casualties. Ms Brenda Dean, as general secretary of the Sogat print union, was the best known woman trade unionists of recent times. She disappeared from view after the union's merger with the National Graphical Association and has recently reappeared as head of the watchdog body which monitors premium-rate telephone services. The merged print union is led by former NGA general secretary Mr Tony Dubbins. The Health Visitors' Association, in the past always female-led, has been subsumed into the male-led MSF general technical union. The loss of female figureheads is arguably bad for unions' public image at a time when efforts are being made to broaden appeal. Women are less likely to join unions than men, but are becoming an increasingly important part of the workforce and now make up about a third of union membership. As traditional male jobs in manufacturing are lost, unions are promoting themselves to women in order to keep up their memberships. It could be seen as just bad luck that the movement is now down to one female general secretary. However, representation at the next level down is also poor and apparently getting worse. According to the Labour Research Department, seven of the 10 largest unions have seen a decline in the number of female national full-time officials in recent years. The greatest progress seems to have been made on national executive committees - the top ruling bodies - where almost all of the biggest 10 unions have improved their female representation. The new 'super-union' Unison, which comes into being on 1 July, will have at least 44 out of 67 seats on its executive occupied by women. About 1m of the 1.4m membership of the new union, formed out of Nalgo and Nupe, the local government unions, and Cohse, the health service union, will be female. However, even in this female-dominated union, the very top jobs will held by men for some time to come. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, will lead the new body until he retires in 1996.</p>

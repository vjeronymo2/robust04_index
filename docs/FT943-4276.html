			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Shares fall 29p as Litho advance is less than expected Shares in Litho Suppliers, the printing products distributor which came to the market last November, fell 29p to close at 197p yesterday after it reported a lower-than-expected interim pre-tax profits increase of 10 per cent to Pounds 2.5m. Turnover at the Midlands-based group was marginally ahead at Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 29.7m) helped by a 29 per cent rise to Pounds 1.7m in sales of traditional equipment such as plate and film processors and graphic arts cameras. Sales of consumables such as printing plates, films and chemicals, which account for 83 per cent of total turnover, advanced by 2 per cent to Pounds 25.1m. The division has increased the number of own-label products. Mr John Byford, joint managing director, said small and medium-sized companies, Litho's main customers, were still experiencing a patchy recovery. 'However, the recent recovery experienced by some larger printers may now feed through,' he added. Cost of sales rose from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 24.5m and operating profits fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.5m. Operating margins remained 19 per cent. Net interest charges fell from Pounds 593,000 to Pounds 49,000 following the decision to use most of the proceeds of last year's Pounds 14.1m placing and intermediaries offer to cut borrowing. Net cash stood at Pounds 2.2m. Litho has acquired Lonchem, a chemical products manufacturer, for Pounds 1m and is set to buy a printing inks manufacturer. The interim dividend is 2.73p, a 5 per cent rise over the level indicated in last year's prospectus. Earnings per share were 6.1p (6.3p).</p>

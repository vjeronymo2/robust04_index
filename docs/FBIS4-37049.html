			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 4 -- The man behind the success of  Prithvi is 62-year-old Dr Avul Pakir Jainalaben Abdul Kalam who  believes that India should acquire deadly missiles that will put  the fear of God into its enemies.    Towards that goal he has been working relentlessly for the  past 15 years. According to his friends, Dr Kalam's only dream  is to make India a respected, if not feared, world power by the  end of this century.    Dr Kalam, an aeronautical engineer and bachelor, has been  the  architect of India's integrated guided missile development  programme and the most important achievement of the programme is  that it is the first successful endeavour in the country to  harness indigenous talent to design and develop state-of-the-art  tactical and strategic missiles.    Of the five families of missiles that he committed himself  to  develop and deliver four surface-to-surface missile Prithvi,  medium range ground-to-air Akash, short-range quick reaction SAM  [surface-to-air missile] Trishul and the Anti-tank guided  missile Nag are close to production stage.    His most ambitious project, Agni, the intermediate range  ballistic missile, has already completed three tests. For him  Agni is truly like a child. The bachelor Tamilian in his poem,  "Ancestors' desire" tells about his parents, now dead, wanted  him to marry and have the children and how he could not satisfy  their desire.    But after Agni was successfully launched, Dr Kalam wrote:  "My parents appeared in my subconscious mind.       Smiles on their faces, tear filled eyes, blessing me  with grace       For their grandson `Agni', the symbol of strength       And a continuity of their name."    In another poem "From Tipu's rockets to Agni," Dr Kalam said  "I was walking on the historical shores (of Cauvery) in  Srirangapatnam where two battles took place in the 18th century.  India made the world's first war rocket. These rockets are in  the British War Museum. Small tube with gun powder, tiny nozzle  and warhead. The use of these rockets defeated the Britishers.  History repeats."    Dr Kalam was born in the temple town of Rameshwaram six  decades ago. Memories of doting family and a secure childhood  explain the serenity on his face. Perhaps the only unpleasant  event of his childhood he can remember was when he was separated  from his brahmin friend by a new teacher who had his own ideas  about social harmony. Dr Kalam who always sat on the front bench  with his friend, was ordered to sit in the back row of the  classroom.    "Even today, I am living with the image imprinted on my  subconscious mind, of Ramaswamy crying in the class when I  changed my seat to the rear row", writes Dr Kalam in his  annotation to his book of poems "My journey".    Dr Kalam, the Agni man, says the benefits of defence  research  should also be used for humanitarian work, particularly in the  field of medicine. He has founded a society for biomedical  technology for this purpose.    After studies, Dr Kalam got his first job as an aeronautical  engineer with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Kanpur. He  then joined with Satellite Launch Vehicle Programme, and led the  team that made Rohini and Menaka, those tiny rockets which  aroused scepticism even derision. But the two rockets instilled  pride -- and passion -- in Dr Kalam. No longer did Indian  payloads need to ride on the French-built Centaur rockets. The  success convinced him that with will and even without money,  Indian science and technology could attain dizzy heights.</p>

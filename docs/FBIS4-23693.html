			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sven Lunsche] </F>   [Text] Almost R65-billion [rand] will be spent on social  services in fiscal 1994/95, most of it coming from existing  programmes, according to preliminary estimates. The share of  total state spending going to social services has risen markedly  over the past few years. In the 1993/94 Budget 44 percent of  spending was allocated to social services.    If a similar percentage is applied to this year's  R125-billion Budget then social services will cost about  R55-billion.    Such spending should go a long way in helping the government  get its reconstruction and development programme (RDP) off the  ground. Included in the funds is money earmarked for spending on  education, housing, social security and welfare, health  facilities, electrification, small business and job creation.    The government has announced the establishment of a  R2.5-billion RDP fund as part of the 1994/95 Budget, jointly  administered by Minister without Portfolio, Jay Naidoo, and  Finance Minister Derek Keys. Money from this fund is to be used  as "seed money", says Bernie Fanaroff, an adviser to Mr Naidoo.    Mr Fanaroff sees the two main functions of the RDP fund as a  kick-start for development projects and reemphasising spending  priorities within existing government departments. He says the  government will be looking at the provinces to provide "coherent  and integrated projects within the RDP".    Analysts say that the key to the success of the RDP will be  a  shift in spending priorities within government departments. If  previous trends are maintained this year, less than 10 percent  of this amount will be capital expenditure, but analysts point  out that salaries of teachers, for example, are a key to the  success of education projects.    Billions of rands in development finance have also been set  aside by parastatal institutions. The largest of these, the  Development Bank, financed projects valued at R1.75-billion in  1993/94 and arranged an additional R750-million from other  borrowers.    A spokesman says that similar amounts could be expected this  year.    Jolyon Nuttall, communications director of the Independent  Development Trust (IDT), says that the IDT plans to disburse  over R530-million for calendar 1994.    The provision of electricity to 350,000 homes, one of the  short- term objectives of the RDP, could cost up to  R1.5-billion, but Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] has  stated that it will be able to meet this target.    The biggest question mark hangs over foreign aid.  Provisional figures released by the Department of Foreign  Affairs show that almost R4-billion in aid and concessionary  loan finance had been guaranteed by foreign governments soon  after the elections.    Most of this money will be spread over a period of up to  three years and at most a third will be available this year.    Mr Fanaroff says only grant aid would be added to the RDP  fund and that the government was drawing up guidelines to  evaluate foreign aid.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Committed spending on social services 1994/5                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Government budgeting allocation to so-|R55 billion                           |  |cial services                         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |RDP Fund                              |R2.5 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Development Bank Of Southern Africa   |R2.5 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Foreign Aid                           |R1.5 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Eskom                                 |R1.3 billion                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Independent Development Fund          |R530 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kagiso Trust                          |R410 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Small Business Development Corporation|R310 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial Development Corporation    |R220 million                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                                 |R64.27 billion                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia Trevisan] </F>   [Text] The AEVB (Brazilian Evangelical Association) has  issued a 10-point leaflet to advise evangelical voters, and in  August it will hold a debate with the four most popular  candidates. The leaflet warns of the possibility that some  evangelical leaders could try to influence voters' decisions,  and upholds the moral standards of the candidates.    The leaflet states: "No evangelical voter should feel bad  because he disagrees with his pastor or spiritual leader." The  text states that the vote for president should be based on  government programs. It also condemns the spreading of rumors,  such as those against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during the 1989  elections.    The leaflet approves of the religious vote. If the voter  feels that he or she identifies with the candidate, but not with  his party, the leaflet recommends: "It is suggested that even  so, a vote of support be given to our fellow believer as long as  he qualifies for the post."    The AEVB is identified as the most progressive sector of the  evangelical community. It opposes the National Ministers  Council, which is linked to the IURD (Universal Church of the  Kingdom of God) headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, and is a dissident  faction of the Assembly of God.    The IURD rejects Lula. The last issue of FOLHA UNIVERSAL  carries an article stating that the PT [Workers Party] upholds  the legalization of abortion and homosexuality. The article  said that the PT "is the product of the Roman clergy, and is at  the service of the interests that have always prevailed in the  history of the Roman Catholic Church."    IURD state Deputy Paulo Cesar De Velasco says the church  intends to support one candidate. He commented: "It will not  be Lula, nor will it be Brizola." Quercia is the only candidate  praised by De Velasco: "His running mate [Iris Resende] is  evangelical and uses language that can be understood by the  people." De Velasco believes Fernando Henrique Cardoso is  "inconsistent" from the religious viewpoint.</p>

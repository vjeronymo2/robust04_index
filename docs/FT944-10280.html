			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer with face, ears and feet Compaq Computer, the world's largest personal computer company, has produced prototype novelty PCs - one called Mr PC Head - in an attempt to increase sales to home users, writes Geof Wheelwright. It recently asked a group of seven- and eight-year-old children what they thought the ideal computer would look like. The result is the Mr PC Head prototype, which looks like a computer monitor with a face, ears and feet. Although it may never become a commercial product, the effort demonstrates how keenly Compaq is studying what it believes is a vast potential consumer market. It believes that PCs will need to look and operate a lot more like traditional consumer electronics products if they are to make further inroads into the home. Compaq: US, tel 713 370 0670.</p>

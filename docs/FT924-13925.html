			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (2): User and service divide - Client-server technology permits more flexible applications THE client-server model separates information technology systems into users (clients) and services (servers) and meets a rising demand for cheaper, more flexible and more responsive applications. 'Client-server technology will affect large segments of suppliers and users and client-server products will account for some 23 per cent of the software products market by 1996,' says market researcher Ovum in its 1991 report 'Client-Server Computing: Commercial Strategies'. The client-server model provides an economical way to distribute computer power, while maintaining the controls associated with centralised computing. It takes advantage of the lower costs of open, component-based systems and the trend towards industry-wide standards in software and communications. Client-server systems use standard software and communications networks to distribute functions across multiple computers with different operating software. Powerful personal workstations, with advanced graphical user interfaces and local processing power (the clients), sit at the front end. Special-purpose 'servers' - providing services such as shared printing, communications links and database storage - are available, through the network, to workstations. So far the client-server approach has been used mainly for database applications. Using an IBM-designed standard called SQL, client workstations are able to send complex requests for data to remote server computers. But the past year has seen moves to broaden the appeal of the client-server approach and use it for more traditional data processing applications - particularly those which involve transaction processing. Database suppliers such as Sybase, Oracle, Informix and Ingres have been in forefront and have placed increasing emphasis on the transaction processing features of their database products. At the end of September IBM announced a version of its popular CICS transaction processing software which uses the client-server approach. It is based on AIX, its version of the Unix operating system, and runs on IBM's RS/6000 workstation computer. CICS is, perhaps, IBM most successful software product with over 33,000 sites worldwide. It is the market leader by a wide margin and IBM's decision to move it to an open environment and re-engineer it to use the client-server model is important. IBM's announcement came in response to a trend towards the use of open systems as a base for transaction processing applications. The use of the client-server model provides an appropriate infrastructure for complexities associated with transaction processing in modern computing environments, which can be based on a variety of hardware and operating systems from different manufacturers. Traditionally, transaction processing applications have been based on single-supplier, proprietary computer systems such as IBM's System 370 mainframe. Until recently, proprietary systems were the only systems which could provide the infrastructure to cover security of access, data integrity and disaster recovery. IBM's decision to move CICS into an open environment - backed up by an unprecedented policy to licence CICS to other manufacturers - comes against a background of important activity in the transaction processing area. Computer suppliers see transaction processing as an important factor in promoting the cause of open systems. Many companies rely on transaction processing as the base for important online operational tasks such as accounting and customer service support. If open systems are to continue expanding, they must be able to cope with complex transaction processing and, in the past two years, the standards infrastructure has grown to include the mechanisms to make this possible. The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF), for example, has published a standard for distributed computing which covers this. It includes a technique called the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which can pass the complex messages through a network, regardless of the operating environment or computer hardware. IBM's new version of CICS uses the RPC to allow it to work across different systems. But IBM is not alone in seeing the advantages of offering open systems transaction processing. Hewlett Packard announced that it would licence IBM's open CICS software, hard on the heels of the IBM announcement and other key manufacturers are expected to follow suit. Both Stratus - which already has strong links with IBM - and Sun Microsystems have been suggested as possible future CICS licensees. Meanwhile Unix International, a rival faction in the open systems market, has put its weight behind an alternative transaction processing system, Tuxedo. This again uses the client-server model of computing to provide support for transaction processing in a mixed environment. One of Tuxedo's main sponsors is the Japanese-owned, UK-based manufacturer ICL, which uses Tuxedo on its Unix-based computers. Mr Nicholas Connor, marketing manager for distributed information systems at ICL, says the future of open client-server systems is tied closely to transaction processing. 'Client-server systems will grow more complicated and will need to be transaction-based,' he says. 'A simple business requirement, like, say, adding a new employee, generates several transactions. One to update the payroll file, one to up date employee file, one to update the pension file and so on. The business requirement is for a single transaction - but current systems demand many different entries. Tuxedo provides the mechanisms with which to enter it just once and then distribute it automatically through the system,' he says. Mr Connor suggests that this sort feature will give companies the opportunity to improve customer service too. 'The introduction of a new telephone subscriber or a new client for a bank poses the same problem. Automatic transaction processing and distribution would enable them to improve their service to customers. In the current economic climate this is obviously very important,' he says. Although Tuxedo and IBM's CICS look set to compete with each other in the market for open transaction processing systems, they could end up co-operating. Tuxedo is able to work with CICS systems already and IBM has announced that a version of Tuxedo will be available for its mainframe computers - running with its AIX/Unix - next year. Either way, transaction processing in an open client-server environment looks set to become a big issue for suppliers and users of computers across the industry.</p>

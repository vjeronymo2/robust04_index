			<p>BFN     [Text] It took us 15 years to answer society's questions on  what has come to be known as a "video." It was a question that  may never have been raised or answered. [as published] After 15  years, video clubs named cultural products stores and an  organization affiliated to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic  Guidance were set up, and a magazine named "Video and Satellite"  was published.    The video had remained an underground phenomenon for 15  years  and now, when it is displayed in store windows, it has been  drained in every possible way. This is why the cultural  products stores were not greeted very enthusiastically. The  video films had already exerted their destructive effect before  they became public. In those days, the video cassettes  circulated around the clock, from hand to hand, and perhaps this  is still happening.    The interior minister said in an interview: "The cabinet is  discussing the confiscation of all unauthorized satellite  antennae from rooftops and the Interior Ministry will take steps  in this direction shortly."    He said: "I give my word that in the next two months, with  the forts of the law enforcement forces, all the satellite  antennae in Tehran will be collected."    Is this the way to combat the satellite [programs]? Can we  not perceive the difference in the words and deeds of the  interior minister? If the satellite programs can be considered  immoral and contrary to values, why is the magazine "Video and  Satellite" published? Why are we still acting defensively?  When the first satellite dish appeared on the rooftop, was it  so minute that it could not be seen? Now two years later it is  being decided that since a certain Arab country has announced a  punishment for having satellite dishes, we should also think on  the same lines.    When is the satellite authorized and when is it  unauthorized?    This commentary should not be considered a case in favor of  satellite dishes on rooftops, but why was this done so late?    The satellite is an international phenomenon and cannot be  restricted in one region or even on one continent. One must  view it in the international context and not as a minor issue.  Satellite technology is progressing by leaps and bounds and  perhaps by the next year satellite dishes with a diameter of  only 35 centimeters may flood the regional and domestic market.  Then what can be done? No promises will be of any use then.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LIMITED PERMIT MAY RESOLVE CHURCH DISPUTE  </P> <P> An expansion plan that appears to resolve eight years of disagreement between  the Neighborhood Church and its neighbors has won approval from the Palos  Verdes Estates Planning Commission.  </P> <P> The panel this week recommended that the City Council give the Malaga Cove-area  church a permit to build a new social hall by replacing a former garage and  servants quarters and adding 1,775 square feet of new space. The church  building was once an ornate private villa.  </P> <P> Church officials and the Malaga Cove Homeowners Assn. appeared jointly before  the commission after signing an agreement permitting the social hall but  limiting some church functions that caused increased traffic and noise --  particularly the large number of weddings that had prompted critics to label  the bluff-top ocean view church a "wedding chapel."  </P> <P> Residents near the church launched a vigorous fight in 1981 against the  church's original proposal for a free-standing, 4,150-square-foot social hall.  The city turned it down in April, 1987, and the church and the neighbors began  working on a new proposal more than a year ago.  </P> <P> The agreement, which will be a part of the city permit for church expansion,  limits the number of weddings to 114 a year, prohibits Sunday weddings, and  allows no more than 18 wedding receptions annually. Those events may not  include a sit-down dinner or live music. Limits also will be placed on the  number of social events not directly related to church activities.  </P> <P> Critics contended that the church has had more than 285 weddings a year, but  the church said the number never exceeded 190.  </P></p>

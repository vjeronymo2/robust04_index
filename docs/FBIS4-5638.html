			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Finance Mar'ie Mohmmad  gave assurances yesterday that the government will not devalue  the rupiah or take other radical steps to offset the deficit  caused by the fall in oil prices, which is likely to continue to  be a problem this fiscal year.    "There will be no drastic measure to stabilize the monetary  system," the minister told newsmen following a meeting with  President Suharto at Bina Graha [Presidential office].    He acknowledged that faltering oil prices will affect the  state budget, but he said that the government is prepared to  handle shortfalls in revenue from the oil and gas sectors.    The government's budget expects Rp [rupiah] 12.85 trillion  (US$6.11 billion from oil and gas, which is to account for 18.5  percent of estimated total state revenue of Rp 69.74 trillion  ($33.2 billion).    The estimate on the receipts from oil and gas is based on an  average oil price of $16 per barrel, far higher than the actual  price which is currently fluctuating between $13 and $14 a  barrel.    Oil experts see no end to the glut in sight, with some  predicting that oil will drop as far as $10 per barrel.    Mar'ie said that a devaluation had been discussed with the  Budgetary Commission of the House of Representatives (DPR), but  firmly rejected it as an option.    Mar'ie's statement on the government's resolve to stay the  course has been repeated several times to reassure those left  gun shy by the actions of former finance minister J.B. Sumarlin.    These included the 45-percent rupiah devaluation in  September  1986, in order to handle falls in state revenues from oil and  gas, and the withdrawal of Rp 10 trillion (US$5 billion) from  the accounts of state-owned companies in 1990 to push down  inflation.    Mar'ie said yesterday that the government will reduce  spending or draw from its reserves if a deficit is run again.    The government has set aside around Rp 3.5 trillion ($1.6  trillion) in budgetary reserves for emergency purposes. Part of  this will be used to offset last year's Rp 1.8 trillion deficit.    "We could use the reserves again if the state revenues in  the  current fiscal year do not meet the current projection," the  minister said.    Meanwhile Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance  Saleh  Afiff said yesterday that the government will not change its  policy on commercial offshore loans.    "There will be no change in the government's monetary  policies, including that on the control of the inflow of  commercial offshore borrowing," he told newsmen following a  ministerial meeting on the economy at his office.    Affif said the strict control of commenercial loans is  essential to maintain the balance of payment at a safe level.    The government-set annual ceiling on offshore commercial  loans of about $5.6 billion to $6.5 billion applies until the  next fiscal year.    The ceilings on foreign loans to the central bank, state  banks and private banks are set at $500 million, $1 billion and  $500 million a year respectively.    Private companies under the existing ceilings are allowed to  borrow up to $2.8 billion from foreign creditors in this fiscal  year and up to $2.9 billion in 1995-96, while state companies  may borrow up to $1.4 billion in 1994-1995 and up to 1.6 billion  in 1995-96.</p>

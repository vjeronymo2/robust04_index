The statistics showed that total rubber and plastics  industry  investment in Mainland China hit US$613.73 million in March,  accounting for 16 percent of the total value of all relocated  industries.    The electrical and electronic equipment industry ranked  second with US$537 million, or 14 percent, and the food and  beverage industry came in third with US$421 million, or 11  percent, the statistics showed.    The metal industry came in fourth with 9 percent, and the  chemical and textile industries tied for fifth with 6 percent  each. The wood products industry had 4 percent, the fashion and  paper industries each recorded 3 percent and machine and leather  goods each accounted for 2 percent of total investment, the  statistics showed.    The industrial value of products produced in Mainland China  by Taiwan manufacturers has posted an average 8-12 fold growth  since 1993, that statistics showed. Taiwan industries began a  mass relocation to the mainland in the same year.    Taiwan's labor-intensive industries began a relocation to  Mainland China in 1987 due to rising labor and land costs here.</p>

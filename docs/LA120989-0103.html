			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE CENTER OF THE ACTION;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: WHILE TOP PRODUCERS MARCY CARSEY AND TOM WERNER WERE DEALING WITH  CBS THIS WEEK ABOUT JOINING THE NETWORK, ROSEANNE BARR WAS PRESSURING THEM OVER  HER POPULAR SITCOM.  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr, whose first feature film, "She-Devil," opened Friday, appeared  this week to be attempting another coup to have an executive producer of her  top-rated ABC show removed, sources familiar with the situation said.  </P> <P> The internal fracas over the show's creative direction comes exactly one year  after a feud between Barr and "Roseanne" creator-executive producer Matt  Williams resulted in his departure. Williams left the show in January, after  the Christmas and New Year's production break.  </P> <P> Barr, who did not report for work on the set of "Roseanne" earlier this week,  has complained about executive producer Jeff Harris' ideas for the show and  wants him out, said an ABC source who called the situation "a mess."  </P> <P> There also were unconfirmed reports that Harris and another "Roseanne"  producer, Danny Jacobson, have tried to remove Barr's fiance, Tom Arnold, from  the writing staff, heightening tensions.  </P> <P> The apparent disarray on the show coincides with a confusing interview Barr  gave to "Today" show correspondent Jim Brown on Tuesday. Brown asked her what  she would do about her TV career if "She-Devil" becomes a hit.  </P> <P> "I'm outta there," Barr answered. "That's what happens." She also told Brown  that even if her new movie fails at the box office, "I'm going to leave TV  anyway. What the hell."  </P> <P> ABC referred calls about the matter to the show's producers, the Carsey-Werner  Co. The company's spokesman had no comment. Barr's manager and her publicist  declined to comment, and Harris did not return phone calls.  </P> <P> Barr has been known to be exceedingly concerned about creative control of the  series, which is the most popular TV program in the country. After Williams  left as executive producer of the program in January, executive producers Marcy  Carsey and Tom Werner issued a statement saying that Barr had been given  creative control over her character and that it was Barr's insight into working  women that made the show appealing.  </P></p>

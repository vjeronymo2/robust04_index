This is a  proposal worthy of our close attention. Our country started  belatedly in building the market, and yet the momentum has been  quite strong. We truly need to learn from the successful  experiences of economically developed countries and regions in  building the market and draw lessons from their failures to  avoid detours as much as possible and to bring our market  construction onto the path of healthy, regular, and orderly  [jian kang gui fan you xu di 0256 1660 6016 5400 2589 1645 4104]  development. To do this, the most important thing is to operate  the market according to economic laws. The "Shanghai Joint  Automobile Exchange Market," which was set up to meet demands,  has blazed a new trail in operating according to market laws,  and it has provided many revelations.    One of the revelations is that Shanghai should seize the  opportunity to make a head start in building a socialist market  economic structure. Statistics show that China's automobile  production and sales continued to grow in 1993, and the basic  pattern is supply exceeding demand. The total number of cars  produced in the country last year reached 1.3 million, while  demand remained at 1.25 million or so. There are currently more  than 100 automobile manufacturers, over 700 vehicle modification  and special vehicle producing enterprises, and several thousand  dealers. The automobile industry is a backbone of the nation's  industry. While we must protect the enthusiasm for developing  the automobile industry, rushing headlong into the automobile  market like a swarm of bees can hardly produce the economies of  scale of a large market and will make our efforts to build a  uniform national market go up in smoke; this is detrimental to  the interests of the producers, suppliers, and consumers.  Shanghai, on the other hand, possesses favorable conditions for  building a unified national automobile market. Its output of  Santanas reached 100,000 last year, nearly half of the nation's  total output. In addition, it has more than 300 automobile  dealers and over 20 car manufacturing and vehicle modification  plants. Because of the necessity to build a unified national  market, it will be very important for Shanghai, which occupies  an important place in China's car production and sales, to build  a specialized national automobile market ahead of other places;  this will help change the current state of affairs of China's  automobile industry, which is suffering from clogged circulation  channels of supply and demand, chaotic price signals, slow  market feedback, and sluggish structural adjustment. We should  exercise extreme care in building specialized markets and  refrain from blindly "going for it" while disregarding existing  conditions. However, we must lose no time in meticulously  preparing for building the market when we are sure it is the  correct thing to do, so as to allow the automobile, an important  material resource, to play a bigger role in the national economy.    The second revelation is that market construction must be  compatible with market economic laws. For example, it is  necessary to select different trading methods according to  characteristics of commodities, and not simply follow the market  craze. The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" is a specialized  automobile market based mainly on direct contacts and spot  trading among producers, suppliers, and consumers, and is not  prepared to introduce the futures trading mechanism. The  practice is compatible with the general laws of market economy.  There are special requirements for futures trading. For  example, product standards and varieties must be simple;  standardization of product quality must be easy; price  fluctuation range must be wide; large quantity purchases and  sales must be possible; and products must mostly be large  quantities of primary products such as grains and nonferrous  metals. Not all products, such as finished industrial goods,  are suitable for futures trading. Automobiles are finished  products, and the spot trading method is suitable as long as  buyers and sellers reach agreements. In addition, there is now  a balance of supply and demand for automobiles and prices have  stabilized over a certain period, making automobiles unsuitable  for the futures trade. In addition, the diversified range and  flexible spot trading method can meet the demands of suppliers  and consumers at different levels. It is also much better than  the futures trading mechanism. This shows that selecting a  trading method compatible with market laws is a prerequisite to  normal market development.    The third revelation is that in the process of market  construction, the government should correctly identify its role.  The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" was organized through the  leadership of the industry and commerce departments. However,  it is not aimed at profit-making and the government cannot  directly intervene in the market's economic activities. The  government has essentially avoided committing a common error  when involved in market construction, that is, extending its  power in the market. In reality, when the government extends  its power in economic activities it will definitely create chaos  in the market. The government should only play its role in  regularizing enterprise activities, safeguarding market order,  and protecting operators' interests. It should only act as a  "referee" and not an "athlete" who directly participates in the  competition. We should particularly remember the profound  lessons we have learned in the past.    Building a new socialist market economic system is linked  very closely to market construction. In the past, we committed  errors in our undertakings and understanding in the process of  market construction. By the time we realized our errors,  certain opportunities were already lost. When taking the lead  in building a new socialist market economic system, Shanghai  must not repeat the same misfortune. Shanghai should be  commended for succeeding in many of its undertakings in  establishing the automobile market. Do you agree with the  points discussed here?</p>

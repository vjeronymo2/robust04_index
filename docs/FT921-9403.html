			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Lloyd's Names win payout of Pounds 116m in Outhwaite case the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's of London - won a Pounds 116m settlement in the Outhwaite case yesterday, ending the biggest of a number of legal actions rocking the insurance market. The out-of-court settlement, which includes Pounds 2m for legal costs, will give a major psychological boost to more than 1,000 other Lloyd's Names who are also involved in legal action against either their agents or the Lloyd's corporation. The 987 Names party to the action, including Mr Edward Heath, the former prime minister, and Mr Tony Jacklin, the golfer, will recover over 90 per cent of money paid out to date in claims. The deal was described by Mr Peter Nutting, the leader of the Outhwaite 1982 Names Association, as a 'thoroughly satisfactory outcome to a long and difficult road'. The settlement is subject to ratification by all parties involved but is expected to be approved. The Names were among 1,614 members of syndicate 317/661 in 1982, which ran up total losses of more than Pounds 200m as a result of a decision by Mr Richard Outhwaite to underwrite 32 reinsurance contracts. Under the contracts he assumed the exposure of other insurers, most of them Lloyd's syndicates, to US liability business. Mr Outhwaite's agency, RHM Outhwaite Underwriting, is among the 81 Lloyd's agents named in the suit. Agents handle the affairs of Names and manage syndicates. In the mid-1980s claims from these reinsurance policies climbed at an unexpectedly rapid rate as a result of court awards to victims of asbestosis in the US, producing devastating losses for Names. Syndicate 317/661 is continuing to pay claims emerging from the business underwritten by Mr Outhwaite and has been unable to complete its accounts for the 1982 underwriting year. Future claims are not covered by the settlement, although Mr Nutting says the Names Association is negotiating an arrangement for the future which would limit Names' losses. No liability had been admitted by either party. In their action the Names alleged that the 81 agents were guilty of negligence and breach of contract. Hearings, which began in October, lasted for 49 days before Mr Justice Saville adjourned proceedings on February 3. Negotiations between the parties were stepped up last week. The bulk of the settlement will be financed by the errors and omissions insurers of the 81 agents. These insurers cover agents against legal awards for negligence. Their involvement in effect recirculates the losses among a wider group of Names in the Lloyd's market. Victory that will spark more action, Page 6</p>

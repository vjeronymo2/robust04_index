			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 24, (IRNA) -- Islamic Revolution  Guards Corps (IRGC) issuing a statement here today on the eve of  the 14th anniversary of the aborted U.S. military offensive,  recalling the memorable failure of American technology at Tabas,  as "divine assistance".    The IRGC denouncing Washington's domineering policies, said  the operation planned with "savage" precision and carried on 25  April 1980, miserably floundered in the deserts around Tabas  (over 600 kms southeast of Tehran) in Khorasan Province, burning  beyond recognition the aggressors and their aircraft.    It was a miracle for which Iran will always remain thankful  to the almighty.    The statement also condemned Washington's tacit support for  Serb aggressors and their unabated "brutal" attacks on the  defenceless Bosnian Muslims.</p>

The clarification concerns the address of Cheikh Mahfouz  Nahnah in which he announced his intention to set up the Islamic  Republican Rally, [TAJ] [crown].    The clarifying statement said that there was no link between  the Conference of Scholars and its provisional body with what is  called TAJ or with any other organization. The statement added  that the body, which the Conference of Scholars intends to set  up, has not yet been announced and is under study.    The Conference of Scholars is a body that conforms to  Islamic  law and is independent from all parties, organizations, and  official quarters.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev: "Have </F> the Contents of the Slav Safe Been Sold to the Americans?"]    [Text] If THE WASHINGTON POST is to be believed, a  delegation of representatives of the U.S. special services has  already visited Moscow, not postponing a "showdown" or waiting  for the chief of the Foreign Intelligence Service to return from  Bratislava. "The CIA team, which went to Moscow to discuss the  'Ames affair,' is returning without having managed to receive  any useful information from Russian intelligence," AP notes.  Our sources in the relevant departments did not try to dispute  the Americans' assessmment, and even confirmed that their  colleagues went away "empty-handed."    But, excuse us: We think that it would be naive to suppose  that the U.S. espionage aces visited our glorious city expecting  to find out something about the Ameses. What then? Maybe they  were trying to sort things out about "poaching"? It is, after  all, no accident that a "leak" has appeared in the U.S. press to  the effect that the FBI possesses films showing that a meeting  had been planned between Ames and a Russian intelligence agent  in Caracas. It is probably no accident either that our services  recently detained a certain high-ranking person incriminated of  spying for the United States. The Americans probably have their  "hooks" into other people with Russian passports working both in  the United States and in "third" countries. Their Russian  colleagues also have such documents. The Federal  Counterintelligence Service Public Relations Center expressed to  us the hypothesis that the representatives of U.S. special  services could be in Moscow in order to ask us not to touch any  of their intelligence agents or agencies. But none of the  foreigners have appeared in the Federal Counterintelligence  Service's lobbies in recent days, and coffee has not been  ordered in the reception rooms for the official delegations.    No, most likely this was not an exchange of mutual  grievances. Most probably, the Americans, who have involved  their President in an unprecedentedly tough and hard-hitting  role in the spy mania campaign, who themselves blew up the  "affair" to the proportions of a national tragedy, came to  Moscow to size up the prospects for the contacts which -- as is  well known -- exist between the two countries' special services.  Have they not gone too far, have they not spoiled everything  hopelessly? Of course, no official will say whether this is the  case. But experts propose that the "spylords" could have  actually taken away specific proposals with them from Moscow.  Though we think that AP is right here: They returned from the  Russian capital, to a Washington resounding from the spy  "fall-out," with nothing at all.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Overseas Development </F> Administration: "Britain Gives Further 5 Million Pounds To Help  Rwandan Refugees"]    [Text] Britain is to give 5 million pounds to provide  further support for refugees from the conflict in Rwanda,  Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Development, announced  today.    This will go towards:     -  Expanding support for  non-governmental organisations working in the area to provide  water, food and health services;    -  Helping to protect the  environment in the ecologically fragile Kagera region of  Tanzania, including research into alternative fuels to prevent  deforestation;    -  Assisting Uganda with the disposal of  corpses;    -  Improving the management of the aid operation,  including the continuation of an airbridge at Mwanza in  north-west Tanzania to ferry in supplies and the exploration of  the possible alternative uses of road, rail or water.     This brings the amount given to help Rwandan refugees to  over  11 million pounds since April, including the UK share of EC aid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has  welcomed Russia's joining of the NATO Partnership for Peace  program. He was speaking at a news conference in Kiev on  Thursday [23 June].    Concerning Ukraine's participation in the NATO program  Radetskyy said that the Ukrainian army was going to participate  in several NATO exercises within the framework of military  cooperation. For instance, one company will take part in an  exercise in the United States and one platoon will be involved  in an exercise in Belgium this autumn.    Ukraine joined NATO's program last February. Radetskyy said  that financial constraints were the sole brake on contacts under  the Partnership for Peace plan.    Radetskyy was evasive when asked about statements by the  Ukrainian parliamentary speaker that a joint command of the  Ukrainian and Russian fleets in the Black Sea was a possibility.    Radetskyy believes that the Black Sea Fleet problem is the  business of governments and parliaments while "the military must  execute decisions made."</p>

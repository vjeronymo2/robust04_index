			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> S&amp;L LOSS IS BEST SHOWING SINCE 1989  </P> <P> Private savings and loans posted a loss of $196 million in the second quarter  of the year in the best showing since a weak profit of $10 million in the first  quarter of 1989, the government said today.  </P> <P> The figures, released by the Office of Thrift Supervision, do not include the  results for institutions seized by the United States and operated by the  federal Resolution Trust Corp.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to predict that the trend of reduced losses in the  industry will continue or that the industry as a whole will become profitable  this year," said Timothy Ryan, the OTS director.  </P> <P> The second-quarter loss of $196 million follows a loss of $374 million in the  first quarter and a record $3.41-billion plunge in the final three months of  1989, the OTS reported.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F> Democratic Movement, by Eva Zelenayova; place and date not  given: "Leave Politics? No, I Do Not Think So"]    [Excerpts] [Zelenayova] It is often said, in connection  with the Slovak political scene, that the problem is not so much  the differences between the programs of the political entities  as the incompatibility between their leaders. You have managed  to overcome this obstacle with regard to Peter Weiss. Do you  think this is also possible with regard to Vladimir Meciar?    [Carnogursky] I will begin with the past. I got to know  Vladimir Meciar in 1990, when he was Slovak interior minister  and I was federal deputy prime minister. We got on quite well,  and some SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA readers may recollect that two or  three weeks before his first recall, in April 1991, Meciar said  in SMENA that, of all of the deputy prime ministers in his  government at that time, he got on best with me. When he was  recalled, I extended the benefits arising from his office  twofold. He was given a state apartment on Fr. Kral Street in  Bratislava. However, after his recall, Meciar started to call  for a general strike and, at Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] meetings, he began to say that the Carnogursky family was  enriching itself. In July 1992, Meciar sent us back into the  past, and, even before this, in the fall of 1990, despite the  coalition agreements with the then Public Against Violence [VPN]  Movement, he forced our interior minister, Anton Andras, from  the government. He persuaded the VPN to drive out the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH] from the government and tried to  govern as a minority. And so on and so on. The problem with  Meciar is that he does not stick to agreements, and, therefore,  it is impossible to reach a reliable agreement with him on  anything. That is the difference between him and Peter Weiss.  If Vladimir Meciar were capable of guaranteeing that he would  stick to the agreements he makes with other people, of course,  it would be possible, as you say, to overcome the obstacle with  regard to him, too. I am afraid that, for personal reasons,  Meciar is incapable of this.    [Zelenayova] In politics, you can never say that something  is impossible.    [Carnogursky] I am not stating this categorically, after  all; it is just highly probable.    [Zelenayova] Part of Slovak society, at home and abroad, has  grave reservations about you. You yourself, however, have been  the cause of this--for example, by the statement: "I always put  on the mask I need to put on," which can be interpreted in  various ways. Your hesitation in issues concerning the  independent Slovak state, the assessment of the recent past, and  the approach to Andrej Hlinka is known. People abroad, in  particular, or, rather, Slovaks abroad, find very hard to bear  your assessment of the effect of the 250,000 Czechs in Slovakia  after 1918 and your statement that "the fact that the Czechs had  to leave Slovakia in the years 1938-39 is a black mark on Slovak  history." They even consider this to be an indelible black mark  on your character. Have you not contemplated leaving politics?    [Carnogursky] You have taken the quotation about the masks  out of context, but let us deal with the statement about the  Czechs. I used it as a rejoinder to a televised address by  former Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart, who expressed his  regret about the Czechoslovakism that had manifested itself  during the First Republic. With regard to the evacuation of the  Czechs in the years 1938-39, it would perhaps be possible to  cite various extenuating circumstances, consisting, for example,  of the fact that, following the birth of the Czechoslovak  Republic, the Czechs filled posts in Slovakia that, in fact,  morally, politically, and socially belonged to Slovaks. The  problem is that they were evacuated at a time when their country  was under the immediate threat of occupation by the German Army,  so Slovakia should have demonstrated its solidarity with the  Czech lands. [passage omitted] Quite simply, Slovakia should  not have done this at a time when the Czech lands were being  occupied by the German Army. We have to realize that an  arrogant attitude toward our neighbors does not strengthen  Slovakia's defensive capability and does not serve its  interests; it simply harms us.    [Zelenayova] Do you not even think it is necessary to defend  ourselves against the arrogance of neighbors?    [Carnogursky] Defend ourselves yes, but expressing regret  about something that we have done, something that has caused  pain to others, is always a virtue.    [Zelenayova] I will return to my question. Have you not  ever contemplated leaving politics?    [Carnogursky] I have not.    [Zelenayova] Judging by the public opinion polls and the  envisaged preelection groupings of the left, the right, and the  parties around the HZDS, what kind of development would you  forecast after the elections?    [Carnogursky] Four months before the elections, I can only  say that an HZDS election victory, one that would bring the HZDS  to power, would place Slovakia in the kind of isolation it would  be difficult to get out of.    [Zelenayova] Why do you think this?    [Carnogursky] Because of the HZDS's incompetent past and  present policy and Meciar's tainted reputation, especially  abroad.    [Zelenayova] Some correspondents depict the HZDS victory in  1992 as an apocalypse. However, the HZDS victory in 1992  heralded the nationalist orientation and led to the creation of  the independent Slovak state. It could be said, then, that they  are accusing the HZDS of breaking up the Federation. Do you  also view the movement like this?    [Carnogursky] The HZDS victory in 1992 merely signaled a  change of course in the nationalist issue, the speeding up of  certain development in the sense that Slovak independence was  achieved outside the framework of European integration. There  is a difference.    [Zelenayova] Nevertheless, all of the European states that  felt they had to become independent were established at this  time.    [Carnogursky] Yes, you are right, but they are also  experiencing the appropriate difficulties, which would not have  happened if they had broken away within the process of European  integration. [passage omitted]    [Zelenayova] The right has not yet reached an agreement on a  joint course of action before the elections. The KDH is pushing  its proposal for an open list of candidates. The Democratic  Party [DS] and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Businessmen are,  alternatively, pushing for an open coalition. Why is it  unacceptable for the KDH to go into the elections along with the  other nonleftist parties?    [Carnogursky] You mean in the form of a coalition bloc?    [Zelenayova] Yes.    [Carnogursky] According to the election law, an election  bloc means an increase in the percentage of votes required for  entry into parliament; however, merging parties at the level of  a bloc has, until now, always meant a reduction in the  preferential percentage compared with the original situation.  For example, according to the public opinion polls, the DS had  2 percent, although each of the parties that had merged within  it had, on their own, 2 and more percent. This certainly  concerns the Democratic Union [DU] and, according to the May  public opinion polls, which were conducted by the radio and also  canvassed support for the election blocs, all of them, with the  exception of the left--that is, the so-called national bloc and  the so-called right-wing bloc--had less support than the total  support for the parties participating independently. Therefore,  I think our offer is simply better and, finally, that the issue  also involves the fact that Slovakia needs clearly crystallized  parties. At the moment, this applies to only the Party of the  Democratic Left and the KDH.    [Zelenayova] Despite the fact that you are not a party?    [Carnogursky] We call ourselves a movement, but we are in  fact a party. We cannot help it if other parties and movements  have not yet crystallized themselves into any clear, shall we  say, liberal form. [passage omitted]    [Zelenayova] A year ago, you said in reply to my question of  why the KDH was seeking allies among the representatives of the  Hungarian minority that you were holding talks with those with  whom there are the most serious problems. We know, however,  that, apart from ourselves, virtually no one in Europe admits  that he has minority problems, although the minorities in  Slovakia reap the benefit of above-standard rights. Do you not  think that we ourselves are cultivating the minority problem and  are doing so by our boundless accommodating attitude toward the  Hungarian minority's political elite?    [Carnogursky] I have already responded to the first part of  your question--we profess the values of Christianity, nation,  and Europe. Two of these fundamental values also unite us with  the Hungarians. These two values, at least, act as a bridge  between the KDH and Hungarian politicians. Minority problems in  Europe have led and are leading to tension and even wars. As I  see the situation in Slovakia, whether on the basis of studying  history or from my knowledge of the present, Slovakia need not  fear Hungarian assimilation as long as it manages to preserve  its political independence. We have the forces to do this. We  can negotiate with the Hungarians on everything else, and, of  course, we can also meet them halfway on the principle of  mutuality, with the status of the Slovak minority in Hungary.    [Zelenayova] Or on reciprocity?    [Carnogursky] We can also call it that. [passage omitted]    [Zelenayova] The Sudeten German issue is important not only  for the Czech Republic. It is an element of Europe's postwar  arrangement, and opening it up may trigger a whole avalanche of  problems. What is your view of this conflict? What do you think  of it from the point of view of Slovak interests?    [Carnogursky] Fortunately, this issue is not a serious  Slovak problem. The Germans living in Slovakia are called  Carpathian Germans, and they also have a separate association  from the Sudeten Germans in Germany. It is also fortunate for  Slovakia that, after the war, there was no violence against  Germans on its territory. This happened only during the  uprising and after the end of the war, when a group of  Carpathian Germans was returning from Germany to Slovakia and a  large number of them were murdered at the station in Prerov.  (SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA has written about this tragedy--Editor.)  This very much facilitates our current dialogue with the Germans  and, in general, seeking and maintaining our place in Europe. I  am digressing a little; for me, this is also proof of how it is  desirable not to be arrogant toward minorities. In addition,  the Germans in Slovakia have never formed a strong minority.  Slovakia should not interfere in the dispute between the Czechs  and the Sudeten Germans. I think that the Czechs are pursuing  the wrong policy in that, at the moment, they are trying to  disengage themselves from their eastern neighbors, from their  eastern connection--from the Visegrad Four.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: ISMA conference settles on three days - International While the mood at last week's annual meeting in New Orleans of the International Securities Market Association (ISMA) was slightly dampened by the continued turmoil in the world's bond markets, this year's difficult conditions had little impact on the turnout for the conference. Delegates numbered about 950, down from just over 1,000 at last year's gathering in Copenhagen. More cynical Eurobond traders commented that they had not felt it necessary to stay at their desks and nurse their books because dealing in the Eurobond market had dried up as a result of the extreme volatility in the government bond market. A new rule that delegates who fail to turn up to vote at the conference of international bond market participants will be reported to their firms also appeared to have a salutary effect on attendance in the conference hall. The conference centred around the ISMA board's decision to change from the current standard of seven-day settlement to three-day settlement for international bonds, in spite of concerns voiced by representatives from the Belgian region about the impact of this change on retail investors. Belgian retail investors have a strong preference for physical delivery of Eurobonds, largely for tax reasons. However, under the new standard, which will come into force in June 1995, a longer settlement period can still be agreed between counter-parties. Although estimates about the size of the retail market are approximate, it is believed that as much as 10 per cent to 15 per cent of primary offerings may be placed with retail investors. However, the retail component of secondary market turnover is much lower - certainly less than 1 per cent, according to Cedel, the European clearing house which clears the bulk of retail trading business. The debate raised an important disclosure issue. Mr Alain Servais, of Belgian broking firm Dewaay, Servais &amp; Cie complained that the documentation of some new issues did not clearly state that bonds would not be available in physical form, and suggested that ISMA should publicise problems with individual issues. Mr John Langton, ISMA's chief executive, said the association was looking at the legal implications of such a step. Guidance from the International Primary Market Association (IPMA) - which sets out rules for new issues, but has no regulatory authority - is expected in the next few weeks, it said. ISMA continues to monitor the dispute over whether holders of a News Corp subsidiary's issue of preference shares, convertible into Pearson shares, would also receive Royal Doulton shares, according to Mr Willy Watt, who heads ISMA's market practices committee. The conference was also enlivened by a strong panel of speakers, including veteran Wall Street trader Mr Alan 'Ace' Greenberg, president of Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities firm. According to Mr Greenberg, the firm has found a novel way of tackling the problem of losses on derivatives as a result of traders failing to report positions accurately: rewarding staff for shopping their colleagues. Mr Greenberg dispatched one of his famous memos last September. 'Investment banking firms have been plagued over the years by traders mis-marking positions and we have not been spared.' The memo set out a new policy for dealing with the problem: 'We will give 5 per cent (of its value) to anyone alerting us to a mis-mark. All suspicions will be treated confidentially.' The memo added: 'We would frown upon the tatler sharing the reward with the mis-marker.' In April, a second memo, further refining the process, appeared. It specified that 'in no case will the reward exceed Dollars 1m'. The limit is designed, according to Mr Greenberg, to discourage any delay in reporting by a trader hoping that the size of the mis-mark - and thus of the reward - will increase further. According to Mr Greenberg, in the last two months, Bear Stearns has paid two cheques to traders who reported lapses, the largest for Dollars 65,000. In both cases, traders shopped their bosses, whose jobs they have since been appointed to. Mr Greenberg described such promotions as an 'added incentive. This may seem brutal (but) we are engaged in a war'. Mr Greenberg told the conference that the new system was working, and recommended its introduction at other firms. He suggested that existing difficulties in ensuring that traders report losses have been exacerbated by the growth of the derivatives market, where the value of positions is much more difficult to calculate. Bear Stearns is well known for its aggressive stance on this issue: it has spies on every trading floor. Mr Jose Angel Gurria, head of international affairs for Mexico's Partido Revolucionario Instituciona (PRI) and well known to international bankers for leading Mexico's successful foreign debt restructuring, sought to reassure traders that, in spite of the turmoil earlier this year, Mexico is still an attractive investment. He expressed confidence that a 'squeaky clean and transparent' election was the only remaining barrier to an upgrade for Mexico's debt to investment grade. 'The fundamentals for an investment grade rating are there. Our fixed-rate bond issues now reflect interest rates lower than for a non-investment grade country - but higher than if we already had the investment grade rating,' he said. However, he added that the main incentive for gaining an investment grade rating was access to a broader investment base, including fund managers who are not allowed to buy sub-investment grade debt. 'Access is the prime consideration, not cost, although access will be translated into cost savings,' said Mr Gurria. Finally, former US president George Bush met an enthusiastic reception from an audience only slightly less welcoming than for former UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who spoke at ISMA's Munich conference two years ago.</p>

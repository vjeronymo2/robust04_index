			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: A dull day in Germany is . . . well . . . dull - The way other countries tackle boring news When the week's news consists entirely of tales of the expected and the straightforwardly boring, newspapers tackle the problem in a manner dictated by their national traditions. The British create salacious gossip to replace it. In Switzerland, you splash the story over several columns, the duller the better. Thus, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung covered its front page on Tuesday with the death of the former East German boss, Erich Honecker. If the Germans report a dull event, they make sure you know it is dull. The Russians go in for a tiny bit of grotesque exaggeration. The French wrap boring stories together and manufacture bogus coincidences and astonishing non-sequiturs. For them, the key words are: 'At the very moment when . . .' So, one provincial French paper wrote: 'Erich Honecker passed away in exile in Chile at the very moment when the old communists were poised to achieve a big victory in the Hungarian elections.' The arrest of the boss of France's Schneider engineering company by the Belgian authorities occasioned even more complex intellectual convolutions in Le Monde: 'At the very moment when, in the margin of the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, the employers' organisations of France and Germany sign a common declaration in favour of European construction, the indignant reaction of many French businessmen to the, perhaps hasty, arrest in Belgium of Didier Pineau-Valencienne seems surprising.' This is a journalistic style which has gone out of favour in Britain, and remains only in a shrunken form familiar to readers of Sunday colour supplements: 'Many, on meeting Charlie Smith, Norfolk's leading rose-grower, would be surprised to learn that he is a staunch Labour Party supporter.' For Le Monde, the wondrous discovery of its fantastic coincidence was merely a cause of wider reflections on l'Europe des affaires. It decided that the close relations between France and Belgium had led to certain tensions, particularly in the French-speaking south of Belgium where French business influence has been regarded as a form of imperialism. So, the paper warned against falling into a trap that I, for one, had never even contemplated. It said French leaders should not treat Belgium as 'some kind of banana republic where the rights of man are not respected.' A survey I have conducted shows that this view is not remarkably widespread - largely, perhaps, because Belgium is a kingdom. Nevertheless, the arrest of Pineau-Valencienne does lead to consideration of another astounding coincidence. Schneider also is the name of the boss of the eponymous German company who, in March, allegedly ran off with millions of his creditors' Deutschemarks. Since companies called Schneider have now got into the news this year in both France and Germany, why have there been no editorials on this? As Schneider means 'tailor', perhaps one should watch out for firms of that name - which would be Sastre in Spain or Portnoy in Russia. This reflection leads naturally to the Russian approach on how news and indignation can be manufactured from inadequate material. Now the Russians have a unique ability to confront the sensational and be defeated by the commonplace. That quality has been of immense use to chaps like Chekhov, who could produce fascinating tales of characters unmoved by disaster and overwhelmed by trivia. Thus, Sovetskaya Rossiya has been much exercised by President Yeltsin's decree abolishing export quotas and export licensing. This, said the paper, 'plunges the country into a new phase of a so-called democratic revolution.' Meanwhile, the other conservative daily, Pravda, celebrated the 95th birthday of writer Leonid Leonov by noting that it coincided with the publication of his new novel which, allegedly, 'sums up the philosophical and ethical results of a whole stage of world civilisation.' And never before had someone of 95 been able to achieve that. If there is a particular German gift in this area of stylistic endeavour, it is to render the banal banal. This week, there have been allegations of a scandal involving over-charging for cardiac valve implants in certain clinics. The Allgemeine Zeiting of Mainz commented: 'If this should prove to be so, it would not be only a case for the public prosecutor. It could also affect the smooth functioning of social insurance societies such as Sickness Funds.' And so on. The trouble is that real news is scarce but comment is abundant. 'No news, no comment' could, perhaps, provide the basis for a succesful newspaper commercial. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

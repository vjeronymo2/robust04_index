			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JONES FINDS THE FAST LANE;  </P> <P> TRACK: SPEEDY FRESHMAN SPRINTER TRANSFERS TO RIO MESA HIGH TO BECOME ANGELA  BURNHAM'S HEIR APPARENT.  </P> <P> When Angela Burnham graduated last June and took her talents to UCLA, Rio Mesa  High track Coach Brian FitzGerald figured that another athlete of her caliber  would not come along soon.  </P> <P> After all, Burnham had won five state titles in her four years at Rio Mesa,  including 100- and 200-meter titles in her junior and senior years.  </P> <P> She had also run in the Olympic Trials and twice was honored as Track &amp;  Field News magazine's female high school athlete of the year.  </P> <P> No, Burnham was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of talent for a high  school coach.  </P> <P> But a telephone call FitzGerald received only eight weeks later caused him to  reevaluate his thinking.  </P> <P> On the phone was Marion Jones, who informed FitzGerald that her daughter, also  Marion, would be moving to Camarillo from Sherman Oaks to attend Rio Mesa in  the fall.  </P> <P> This was the same Marion Jones who had smashed Burnham's national age-13 record  in the 200 meters (24.90 seconds) with a 24.30 clocking during the summer -- a  time which would have placed second behind only Burnham in the Southern Section  3-A Division finals last season.  </P> <P> This was the same Marion Jones who had run personal bests of 12.01 in the 100  and 56.98 at 400 meters as an eighth grader.  </P> <P> "I had read about her and I knew who she was," FitzGerald said. "I said to  myself, 'Boy, it would sure be great to have her,' and the next thing I knew  she was coming here."  </P> <P> Comparisons with Burnham are likely to arise as the season progresses, but  Jones, 14, would prefer to focus on herself.  </P> <P> "(The state meet) is a long way off," she said. "I just want to try my best and  see what happens. Angela is a very fast runner and her records will be tough to  beat."  </P> <P> While the two are certain to be compared by their performances on the track,  they are very different off it.  </P> <P> "Angela is Angela, and Marion is Marion," FitzGerald said. "The only similarity  is that they run very fast. Their personalities are complete opposites. Marion  is a real aggressive and gregarious kid. Angela was very shy and quiet as a  freshman."  </P> <P> Burnham's younger sister, Alycia, a junior at Rio Mesa who also competes on the  track team, also notices a difference.  </P> <P> "Marion is real outgoing and likes to joke around," Alycia said. "She's real  nice, but if she doesn't like something, she's not afraid to let people know.  </P> <P> "Angela is real quiet and likes to keep things to herself even when she's happy  or does well."  </P> <P> Jones would have originally attended either Montclair Prep or Notre Dame, but a  neighbor, whom Jones calls a "a great track fan," suggested that she should  attend Rio Mesa.  </P> <P> "People will talk about recruiting," FitzGerald said, "but the fact is I think  her mom was just shopping around to find the best place for her daughter to  develop. I'm not trying toot my own horn, but I think our results speak for  themselves."  </P> <P> Rio Mesa has has won seven league titles in the past eight years, tied for the  state title in the girls' division in 1988 and finished second last year.  </P> <P> The outdoor season has yet to begin, but Jones put herself into the record  books indoors at last month's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Running on the boards for the first time, Jones won the girls' 50-yard dash  (6.53), ran the opening leg on the Spartans' winning 640-yard relay team and  anchored Rio Mesa's winning mile relay team with a 57.7-second split.  </P> <P> Her time in the 50 was the fastest ever by a ninth grader and ranks sixth on  the all-time high school performance list.  </P> <P> FitzGerald was especially impressed with Jones' 440-yard leg in the mile relay.  </P> <P> "She's a big girl to be running on such a small track . . . and hasn't really  been training for the quarter," FitzGerald said of Jones, who stands 5 foot 9  and weighs 130 pounds.  </P> <P> In fact, Jones hasn't had much time to train for track at all: She has been  playing on Rio Mesa's basketball team.  </P> <P> Jones led the team in scoring (21.2) and rebounding (14.4) and helped Rio Mesa  (9-15) win a Southern Section playoffs.  </P> <P> "She jumps so quickly and explosively it's hard to describe," said Rio Mesa  girls' basketball Coach Al Walker of Jones, who is able to touch a 10-foot rim.  "She's very confident and just dominates the defensive backboard and  offensively at the post. She's very competitive and aggressive."  </P> <P> That competitiveness was apparent even during the first week of track practice  in the fall.  </P> <P> "We were just doing some repeats up a hill with the cross-country team," Alycia  said. "Nothing fast, just trying to get into shape and on the first one, Marion  took off and just starts to run full speed up the hill. We just said 'Marion,  Marion, relax! We have to do more.' She just looked at Fitz and gave him the  strangest look and said 'What? Aw man.' ".  </P> <P> But Jones speaks in a very serious tone when she discusses another sport she  would like to play.  </P> <P> "I'd like to give football a try, just on the high school level, not in  college," Jones said. "It's been done before. Hueneme had one girl and Channel  Islands had two girls that have played.  </P> <P> "I think I can play wide receiver, just like Jerry Rice (of the San Francisco  49ers). I can catch the ball and I'm fast enough to run with it. "  </P> <P> Worried about injury?  </P> <P> "It's just like any sport," Jones said. "You don't go looking to get hurt. It  it does, it's just an accident. It's a risk you have to take."  </P> <P> FitzGerald, apparently unaware of Jones' ambitions, shook his head in disbelief  to a reporter.  </P> <P> "She actually told you that?" he said. "She's really talented, but that idea is  really kind of far-fetched."  </P> <P> Yes, Marion is Marion and Angela is Angela.  </P> <P> They both run fast.  </P> <P> That's where the similarity ends.  </P></p>

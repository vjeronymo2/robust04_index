			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Airways BA's 39 per cent increase in third quarter operating profits on turnover just 12 per cent higher demonstrates the magical effect of operational gearing in the airline world. But considering BA's shares have outperformed the market by 43 per cent over the past year, investors clearly expect nothing less. Rather less impressive is the progress further down the profit and loss account, where BA's earnings rose by just 6 per cent largely as a result of its dilutive rights issue. BA's long-term strategic investments are being bought at a short-term cost. Qantas's seasonal strength resulted in a positive contribution from BA's collected trade investments. TAT still appears to be suffering dreadfully in the French market although Deutsche BA is cutting its losses. Still, such concerns will pale if the strong growth in BA's premium traffic continues. This resurgence has helped dispel the worst fears that high-spending passengers would not return after recession. But BA's rather disappointing yield figures suggest such traffic still has to be bought with discounts. Although BA's shares appear temporarily to have flown ahead of reality, they must have further to travel as recovery strengthens in the UK and US. The longer term issue is what rating BA should attract as it approaches its next earnings peak. Its current premium rating should then subside to a discount given the inherent volatility of its earnings stream.</p>

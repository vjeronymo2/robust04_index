That is by 521.6 thousand less than in 1992. Among the five  kinds of animals there is observed an increase in the number  only for goats. As is shown by the preliminary data there are  some 367.4 thousand camels, 2,189.8 thousand horses, 2,730.4  thousand bovine, 13,778 thousand sheep and 6,106.9 thousand  goats in the country.    In 13 out of 18 aymags of the country the total number of  cattle has recorded to be reduced. Among the consequences of  the natural calamity occurred in the three western aymags of  Mongolia, the growth of cattle number has been affected by an  uncontrolled slaughter of meat and a remarkable weakening of  maintenance and care of animals provided in many cattlebreeding  units. [sentence as received] This might be seen from the fact  that the six aymags with the most favourable weather conditions  for the last winter-spring period failed to increase the number  of cattle, specialists of the statistical board points out.</p>

And shoppers  do not always come back loaded with the foods they wanted.    Whether asked for pasteurized milk packets, coffee, oil,  household soap, pasta, sugar, or any other basic consumable, the  shopkeeper's answer is always the same sharp "oulech,"  accompanied by a pathetic "aouli" ("my dear") as if to apologize  for the answer. The truth is that Bejaia has seldom experienced  such a scarcity of such a broad range of products. Usually, even  when other governorates report tensions, Bejaia barely shudders,  and that is mostly due to the fear of being affected by  shortages, which translates into a veiled [sic] sudden increase  in consumption. The self-defense reflex then works to its full  extent. The reasons that the governorate is somehow "sheltered"  are many. The nearby port, the existence of large local  production units (ENCG, ENAJUC [expansions not given], flour  mills, etc.), added to a smaller population, estimated to at  most 1 million, made it possible each time to cope stoically  with market perturbations. This time, however, things look  different and are affected by the prevalent feeling of malaise,  not to say depression, that prevails in the economy as a whole.  "Lacking raw materials, production units slowed down."    "Add to that import reductions, and we had to reach a dead  end," Mr. Nait-Slimane, general manager of EPIDAL [expansion not  given], explained, pointing out that his company just marked  time during the past year.    "Partly because of a lack of aggressiveness on the part of  the EPIDAL GEIC [expansion not given], partly because of import  restrictions imposed, among others, by the ad hoc committee, and  mostly because of declining production at national enterprises,  which are themselves hampered by inadequate import quotas. All  this brought us this deplorable situation," he commented. It so  happened, he said, that even traditional safety stocks were  depleted and are no longer available "to relieve the demand, and  therefore the pressure on the market. We are forced to sell on a  day-to-day basis. And seldom does a delivery last more than one  week," Mr. Zaidi, a sales manager, commented, adding that his  own company is experiencing the worst problems in getting  supplies. "It has become a complex exercise, and often we must  call on our own personal relations; otherwise, we couldn't do  it," he concluded. Paradoxical as it may seem, however,  speculation--the consequence of any shortage--has not yet  appeared, except that a few grocers conspicuously increased  their prices, asking, for instance, 150 Algerian dinars for  coffee, 22 for sugar, or 190 for butter; the rest maintained an  honorable position. It is true also that the workers'  consumption cooperative system works fully to appease tensions.  No matter how small the quantities offered for sale, they have  the merit of being distributed equitably and benefit first those  who need them. As a result, opportunists fail to attract many  people if all they have to offer is basic consumables.    At any rate, you hardly see any street vendors peddling that  kind of goods, contrary to what is the case elsewhere, in large  Algerian urban centers. However, should the tension persist,  there would be a potential risk threatening the "cooperative  system" that constitutes a patent factor of equilibrium in  distribution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Helena Tachinardi from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The Senate Economic Affairs Committee yesterday held  a public hearing to discuss the draft bill regulating  intellectual property rights (trade marks and patents).  Entities opposed to intellectual property rights on  pharmaceutical products and biotechnology objected to the text  recently approved by the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.    GATT's "TRIPS" ("Trade Related Intellectual Property  Rights")  agreement, which in the next few days will be sent to Congress  for ratification, was defended by Ambassador Roberto Abdenur,  Foreign Ministry secretary general; by Interfarma, the  association representing 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories;  and by Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, president of the  National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI).    Senator Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party, Parana], Economic Affairs Committee project coordinator,  invited entities interested in the subject to present their  objections. He said he wants to improve the version of the bill  produced by the Chamber of Deputies, and confessed that the  project is causing him more difficulties than any other in his  28 years of public life.    Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party, Paraiba State], rapporteur for the Constitution  and Justice Committee, has not yet submitted his report.  According to his advisers, the tendency is to leave the bill's  discussion until after the evaluation of the GATT agreement on  intellectual property has been approved. Meanwhile, this  position is not defended by the government. Guzmao has said  that "Brazil needs a law that is independent from the GATT  agreement."    The national pharmaceutical laboratories, represented by  Alanae [expansion unknown] and the Brazilian Association of  Refined Chemistry [Abifina], want a 10-year grace period for the  law's implementation in accordance with the GATT guarantee. The  bill, which was approved in 1993 by the Chamber of Deputies,  limits the grace period to one year, which is to begin once the  new legislation is approved.    Abdenur said that "TRIPS is an unavoidable handicap" and "we  cannot give ourselves the luxury of ignoring it." He also  stressed that it was the result of an international consensus of  125 countries. Congress cannot amend the GATT treaty; it can  only approve or reject it.    Nelson Brasil, Abifina president, and Marcus Vinicius  Pratini  de Moraes, president of the Brazilian Trade Association (AEB),  supported by other organizations, have indicated that it is not  the concession of patents that will bring foreign investment to  the country, and that only economic stability can do that.    Pratini favors the approval of a law that would contain  GATT's ideas, and expressed his concern regarding greater U.S.  retaliation, which has cost the paper and pulp industry some  $300 million over the past few years. If the United States  excludes Brazil from the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP]  because of the patent problem, Brazil could lose $75 million, he  warned. Pratini has called for the approval by Congress of a new  trade defense law. On 23 June he submitted a draft bill in this  respect to senators and to the ministers for foreign affairs,  industry, commerce and tourism, and finance.    Francisco Teixeira, Interfarma's representative, who spoke  in  the name of the 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories that are  installed in the country, defended the modifications that had  been made in the draft bill, such as: clear and ample protection  for biotechnology; patent exploitation for locally manufactures  and for imports; compulsory licenses only as an exception  (calamities, abuse of economic power); banning of parallel  imports; and protection for the products that are not introduced  into the Brazilian market ("pipeline"). [preceding word in  English]    The government has already submitted its suggestions for  amendments to rapporteurs Mariz and Richa, who have not yet  submitted their opinions to their respective committees. The  amendments have taken into account the GATT's TRIPS agreement.  The Senate's Economic Affairs Committee has received numerous  letters from organizations criticizing the patenting of new  sectors such as pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and  chemistry.</p>

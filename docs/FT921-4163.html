			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sunrise Television spurns critics' forecasts SUNRISE TELEVISION yesterday attacked forecasts by Mr Bruce Gyngell, chairman of TV-am, that the new commercial breakfast television company could be out of business within 18 months. Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of Sunrise, which will take over from TV-am on January 1, described Mr Gyngell's figures as 'highly misleading' and insisted that the new broadcasting group would make a modest profit in its first year on air. The TV-am chairman said last week that Sunrise was expecting revenues of Pounds 117m in 1995, compared with TV-am's forecast of Pounds 82m, and that the new company had underestimated the growing impact of satellite television on the breakfast audience. Mr Stoddart said yesterday his revenue forecasts for 1995 were 'in the Pounds 80 millions' and the Sunrise prediction on satellite television was at the top end of most forecasts - just under 50 per cent of homes in the last years of the century. Sunrise, which won the breakfast franchise with a bid of Pounds 36.4m a year compared with TV-am's Pounds 14.125m, is backed by the Guardian and Manchester Evening News, London Weekend Television, Scottish Television, Disney and Carlton Communications. Mr Stoddart said yesterday that at least Pounds 10m of the difference between the Sunrise and TV-am bid would be accounted for by lower costs. The second Pounds 10m could be accounted for by accepting lower profit levels than TV-am. Last year the breakfast company had pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m. The whole basis of payments is also different with the ending of subscription payments to fund Channel 4 and the fact that bids are tax deductible. 'Our shareholders view is that this basis (of a lower profit level) is absolutely satisfactory,' Mr Stoddart said. The Sunrise managing director believes that he can extend TV-am's dominant share of the breakfast television audience although he has budgeted for a small decline just in case. The plans now being drawn up by Sunrise reveal a very cost-effective and flexible operation which will spend some Pounds 30m a year on programmes and employ only 115 people. Ms Lis Howell, director of programmes and a former senior executive at Sky News, has decided to abandon formal news bulletins and instead produce a rolling magazine programme. There will be headlines every 15 minutes but apart from that the 'news' items will simply be imbedded in in the programme's running order. 'It will be a Good Morning magazine with something for all the family,' says Ms Howell. 'Everything will have a topical base but we will not be a slave to a false news agenda,' she adds. If it is a dull news day Sunrise will say so, and there will be less news on that edition. Sunrise says it will also save money by buying in its news service from Visnews, the international news agency. Under the deal Sunrise will have dedicated Visnews camera crews, including eight crews in London and three dedicated news bureaux in Moscow, Washington and Brussels. Sunrise expects to spend about Pounds 10m a year on news, not including deals with most of the ITV companies, to inject three-minute bursts of local news, weather and traffic for the various regions. Sunrise will broadcast its entire programme, lasting almost three-and-a-half hours, from a single studio at LWT's London Television Centre on the South Bank, which will be like the open plan downstairs of a house. The 'hosts' in the American television sense will preside from a round table. In other parts of the domestic setting there will be a sofa for softer interviews, a kitchen and a childrens' area. Mr Gyngell's insistence on cheerful pink shirts will not survive the loss of franchise but Ms Howell will adopt some of the hallmarks of her predecessor. 'We will have light relaxing colours because they work,' says Ms Howell, who believes that breakfast television should be reassuring and designed to convey the message that 'God's in her heaven and all's right with the world.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Posturing, Hypocrisy and MFN"] </F>   [Text] Of all the stupid and ill-informed comments made in  the course of the debate over the renewal of China's Most  Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, the most stupid has now  been made by George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic  majority caucus in the United States Senate. On Sunday [15  May], Mitchell solemnly told the American public China needed to  improve its human rights in the next two weeks.    Yes, two weeks is left for the Chinese government to change  its human rights policy.    What is so daft and so objectionable about Mitchell's  pronouncement is that, on the one hand, it is a totally  unreasonable demand and on the other, he does not mean it.  Mitchell, however, accurately reflects the dilemma of the  Clinton administration, which has talked big about human rights  in China and is looking for a way to act small so that MFN can  be renewed with some kind of face-saving formula.    Now, we learn Wei Jingsheng, China's most famous dissident,  only recently released from jail, is about to be charged with  the capital crime of treason. His apparent offence? Urging the  U.S. to withhold China's MFN status unless Beijing genuinely  improves its human rights policy. China clearly had no  intention of publicising the charges against Wei until after  Washington had issued its expected decision to renew -- at least  in substance -- China's MFN status.    The United States, prone to posturing, has its hands firmly  tied by linking its avowed commitment to human rights with trade  policy. Withholding MFN, as we have argued before, is a crude  and inappropriate instrument for the purpose at hand.    But, having publicly adopted this stance, the U.S. should at  least be seen to follow through on these principles. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher should at the very least press  Beijing for an immediate clarification of Wei's status. If  Clinton truly intends to make China's trade status conditional  upon its human rights performance, then the prospect that  China's most famous dissident may be charged with treason for  remarks he made to the State Department's top human rights  official is surely relevant.    China's policy makers have correctly sensed the uncertainty  and lack of commitment in Washington and exploited it to the  full. The traditional offerings of nominal dissident prison  releases have been made, a few Christians here, the more  prominent Chen Ziming there and, no doubt, a couple more  releases to come as the June 3 deadline for an MFN decision  draws close.    However, by word and by deed, the Chinese government has  made  it crystal clear it has no intention of making any fundamental  changes to its human rights policy. The point was underscored  when John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for  Human Rights, visited China, and a number of human rights  activists were rounded up under his very nose.    The interests of human rights in China are not advanced by  mixing this issue with the recidivist protectionism of many  vested interests in the United States. The annual sham of  trading a few political prisoners for Chinese footware, etc. is  neither dignified nor a suitable method of securing more  far-reaching changes in the human rights situation.    We are sick and tired of the way in which the U.S. pursues  its human rights policy. We should add that China is not a  special case; the Clinton administration's bungling and  ineptitude is equally evident in the tragedies that have  befallen Haiti and Rwanda. However, we are based in Hong Kong,  so we have parochial interests in the affairs of our big  neighbour and the repercussions of these affairs on our  circumstances.    We suspect the government has overstated the impact of  losing  MFN status for the Hong Kong economy. We are also suspicious  about other figures being pumped out, purporting to demonstrate  the impact of losing MFN. None of this really matters, however,  because the MFN charade is likely to run for a little while yet,  without anyone seriously losing or gaining trading advantages as  a result.    What matters is the situation of human rights, an issue  somewhat sidetracked in the MFN debate. So let us state clearly  what we fear. We fear that the human rights situation is  deteriorating. We fear, but cannot quantify the extent of the  deterioration, because controls on the media are being stepped  up.    When President Jiang Zemin chooses to tell the world that  the  Tiananmen massacre was worthwhile, when even the most famous  dissidents cannot be protected by their international fame and  when the international community chooses to acknowledge its  impotence with a collective shrug of the shoulders at events in  China, then things are serious.    The time will come when recognition of this serious matter  will not be obscured by the MFN debate. It cannot come too soon.</p>

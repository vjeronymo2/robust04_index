			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Dick Liu, president  of the Du Pont China Company, will no longer have to worry about  China's dual-track foreign exchange rates, because China unified  them at the very beginning of the year.    The unification has provided a warranty for overseas  businesses in China such as Du Pont, according to Liu.    Last year, the rising market foreign exchange rate left the  prices of his company's raw material imports increasing greatly  and production costs going up apace, which affected the firm's  profits.    Now, he said, the unified exchange rate assured the normal  production and import and export business of the foreign-funded  companies in China.    The reform of the management system of foreign exchange is  one aspect of China's reform package this year. Since the  reforms, covering the fields of foreign exchange, taxation,  finance, state planning, investment and foreign trade, will have  a great impact on foreign-funded companies and banks in China,  all foreign entrepreneurs and bankers attach great importance to  their implementation.    With this in mind, XINHUA reporters arranged interviews with  chief representatives of the Beijing offices of 20 foreign  companies and banks, as well as foreign managers of  foreign-funded enterprises.    During the interviews, they all agreed that the reform is  one  of the most decisive steps China has taken in adjusting its  economy to conform to international economic norms. The reform  will attract more foreign capital into China, they say.    Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief representative of Germany's BASF  Chemical Corporation's Beijing office, said that in order to  develop a market economy connected with the world economy as a  whole, China must establish economic structures similar to  well-accepted models in most parts of the world.    The success of the reform will give China more opportunities  to conduct economic cooperation with foreign countries, he said.    Sander Tideman, chief representative of the Netherlands'  Abn-Amro Bank Beijing office, said that the reforms, especially  those on the management system of foreign exchange and taxation  system, were "far-reaching" in importance.    "Although some foreigners will adopt a `wait and see'  attitude toward the complicated reforms, the majority of  investors felt encouraged and more confident in investing in  China," he added.    Touching on the reform of China's foreign exchange system,  the chief representative of the Beijing office of the Mitsubishi  Trust and Banking Corporation, Takeshi Kagami, said that it is  more convenient for his business after the unification of  China's dual-track foreign exchange rates.    "It is very difficult to explain the dual-track exchange  rates to our associates, while things have become easy and clear  now," said the banker.    The overseas businessmen all believed that dual-track  exchange rates were confusing and imposed disadvantages on their  interests in China.    When talking about reform of the taxation system, U.  Buchmann, chief representative of the Beijing office of the  Swiss Credit Bank, said that a healthy taxation system can  ensure a country's revenue and the smooth development of the  country's economy. For instance, China needs a huge amount of  capital to develop its infrastructure and social insurance  system.    Since the beginning of this year, China started to levy  value-added tax, consumption tax and business tax from overseas  businesses in China, instead of the former consolidated  industrial and commercial tax, and this will create a fair  taxation environment for overseas business people.    Evan Papadopoulos, general manager of the Beijing Concord  Store, expressed his satisfaction with the tax reform, noting  that the reform enables China's taxation system to come nearer  to international practice, without putting much burden on retail  companies.    These business people stated their understanding of some  problems in the process of such reforms, saying that the reforms  will be successful as long as the Chinese Government pays  attention to the problems and resolves them well.</p>

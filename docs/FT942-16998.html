			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Observer: Paying the piper More from the 'do what I say, not what I do' school of financial scrupulousness. The Accounting Standards Board, which preaches the need for upstanding financial reporting from companies, has been a bit sparing with the concept of full and frank disclosure in its own annual accounts. For a start, no indication of the remuneration of David Tweedie, its chairman. Ringing silence also on the dosh dished out to remaining board members, who determine new guidelines - including an imminent one on executive share options. The reason is a little piece of cunning accounting suggested by the board's advisers. The only true legal director is a corporate entity, the Financial Reporting Council. Thus none of the board members is a member of the board at all.</p>

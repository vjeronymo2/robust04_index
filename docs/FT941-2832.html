			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chile reviews telephone tariff proposals Telephone tariff proposals that have indirectly caused the suspension of shares in Chilean telecommunications group CTC have been sent back to regulatory authorities for possible revision. The sub-secretary of telecommunications, Mr Jorge Rosenblut, said he did not believe the review would 'lead to any significant changes' in the tariff structure which, as stands, is expected to have a negative impact on CTC profits. CTC, 43 per cent owned by Telefonica of Spain, is Chile's biggest company with a market capitalisation of over Dollars 4bn. The company trades one quarter of its shares in New York through American depository receipts. Banco de Chile, the country's largest private bank, yesterday became the second company within a week to have its shares suspended in Santiago. A government watchdog cited a 'legal ruling' that had prevented Banco de Chile from 'pronouncing over an essential matter at a shareholders' meeting' that was to have taken place yesterday.</p>

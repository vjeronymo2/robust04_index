			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale boosts Hunting - Fall in aviation profits to Pounds 2.63m prompts review of approach HUNTING, the aviation, defence and oil services company, reported interim profits up 32 per cent, helped by the sale of businesses, but was downbeat about prospects in aviation. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 17.7m on sales from continuing operations up 44 per cent at Pounds 508m as a result of three months' contribution from its new contract to manage the government's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston. The profit figure was struck after a Pounds 2m charge to cover relocation of a business from Sussex and a Pounds 5.82m exceptional profit from the sale of its coatings division to Williams Holdings in February. Operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 17.3m. The contribution from the aviation division fell Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.63m. Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said the group had not been able to escape the realities in the aviation market that has seen a further slackening of demand in the last few months. The recently awarded Ministry of Defence contract covering Rolls-Royce Conway engines had also led to lower than anticipated demand and the level of overhauls was half anticipated volumes. Mr Miller said the group would be reviewing whether there was a need to alter the way it approached the aviation market. 'It is going to be three years before aviation starts to grow as an industry,' he said. By contrast, the defence and oil services divisions held up well. Operating profit from the oil business jumped from Pounds 7.41m to Pounds 9.4m as more oil was traded and pumped through its pipelines and terminals. Mr Miller said there was more activity in the Canadian oil industry which should mean more is discovered and pumped through the group's pipelines. The defence division saw an increase in operating profit from Pounds 3.53m to Pounds 5.24m, helped by Hunting-BRAE, its 51 per cent subsidiary that has the AWE contract. Without this contract, the defence business would have been flat or slightly down. Mr Miller said that even though there was unlikely to be much relief from delayed contracts in the latest government spending round, Hunting's defence business would be 'basically stable for a year or two'. With the AWE contract, however, and a recently won parachute contract, the division should move 'nicely in the right direction'. Gearing ended the period at 36 per cent, lower than the group had anticipated. Mr Miller said that even with a build-up in working capital for the AWE contract, gearing would end the year at a maximum of 40-60 per cent, depending on the timing of MoD payments. Earnings per share rose from 7.1p to 8.3p; the interim dividend is maintained at 4p.</p>

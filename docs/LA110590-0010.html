			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT: CLIPPERS STORM BACK  </P> <P> Showing no sign of regret, the Clippers went from a bad scene to a difficult  situation within a couple of quarters Sunday night.  </P> <P> Bad scene: Getting blitzed at the start against Golden State to fall behind by  19 points in the first quarter, 28-9, and 20 in the second, 36-16. Then putting  together a 42-point third quarter, tying the score, 82-82, late that period and  winning, 109-107, on Ken Norman's jumper from the top of the key as the game  ended.  </P> <P> Difficult situation: Topping this in the next 80 games for a more emotional  victory.  </P> <P> "I've never been as proud of a group than this team," Coach Mike Schuler said.  "What this team did tonight, please don't minimalize it."  </P> <P> Minimize a furious comeback with a makeshift lineup, Danny Manning and Benoit  Benjamin in street clothes and Charles Smith sidelined for the entire second  half because of a foot injury? Against a quality team capable of scoring in  bunches, as it proved early?  </P> <P> Not in five years.  </P> <P> That's how long it has been since the Clippers opened 2-0, and in 1985-86,  their second season in Los Angeles, the streak stretched to 5-0. Consider this  a good start.  </P> <P> They trailed, 63-47, at halftime and showed only minimal signs of life, the  best part of the first two quarters for the 11,173 fans having been the Warrior  lead being cut from 20 to 11 points moments earlier. Smith had played 15  minutes on his badly sprained left foot, and Schuler pulled him during  intermission to avoid further injury.  </P> <P> No reason to be concerned?  </P> <P> "No," Schuler said without hesitation when asked if he considered the outlook  bleak. "Because we were only down eight baskets. Twenty-four minutes and eight  baskets. We got four quick baskets at the start of the second half. I didn't go  to the University of Cal, but I know that's eight points. You're in the  ballgame."  </P> <P> The Clippers continued to bear down. With 2:29 to play in the third, Golden  State's advantage was two, and when Norman scored 19 seconds later, the game  was tied. Fouled, he made the free throw for their first lead of the game.  </P> <P> The Warriors briefly regained the lead but the Clippers, who play their next  game Tuesday at Oakland, were ahead, 89-86, going into the final 12 minutes.  The highlights in the third quarter included eight consecutive baskets, 71.4%  shooting and a 26-10 run over the final 5:40.  </P> <P> The Clippers pushed the advantage to 97-92 when Winston Garland made two free  throws against his former teammates with 8:28 left. Schuler was already going  heavy on guards, and with 2:20 left he had four matched with Norman, the big  man at 6-feet-9. The coach substituted, but he did not deviate from the quick  lineup.  </P> <P> With 4.7 seconds left, Schuler called a timeout with the score 107-107. The  Clippers had another chance to win, thanks to Jeff Martin grabbing the rebound  as Tom Garrick's shot went long with about 22 seconds left.  </P> <P> Schuler sent out Garland, Garrick, Bo Kimble, Gary Grant and Norman, still the  center by default. He didn't shoot outside like one, however.  </P> <P> Garland got the ball to Norman, was was guarded closely by Warrior Tom Tolbert  at the top of the key. Norman pivoted a few times to try to shake the defender,  but that didn't work. So he went up as the clock wound down.  </P> <P> The shot swished as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> "I wanted to try to get to the basket," said Norman, who had 26 points and 13  rebounds, both team highs. "But they sent the guy (Tolbert) over, so obviously  I had to pick up my dribble. I tried to pump fake once to get him up in the  air, but he didn't go for it. So I just rose above him.  </P> <P> "I had a good view of the basket. I saw the basket all the way and never lost  sight of it. It looked good from the time it left my hand."  </P> <P> Never a doubt.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> With the Clippers showing interest in being picked to play overseas, NBA  Commissioner David Stern said the league will return to Japan for  regular-season games, although he cautioned no timetable has been set. "It's a  certainty we'll go back on a periodic basis in light of the success of the  games," Stern said of the two-game Utah-Phoenix matchup Saturday and Sunday in  Tokyo. "But I don't know whether it'll be an annual event."  </P> <P> Charles Smith, Benoit Benjamin (separated shoulder) and Danny Manning  (tendinitis of the knee) will be examined today. X-rays and a bone scan on the  outside of Smith's left foot and ankle showed no break, but it has been  bothering him for about about seven days. "It could be a week, it could be a  day," team physician Dr. Tony Daly said. . . . Smith and Ron Harper have been  elected team captains for the season.  </P> <P> Greg Butler, a Rolling Hills native, has supporters here. But more than in New  York, a city he had no connection with until two seasons ago? "No way," said  Butler, a free-agent signee before training camp. "There is no possible way to  be as popular as I was there." With the Knicks, Butler was the guy at the end  of the bench who got the biggest cheer when checking in, usually late in the  game. Butler played only 46 games and 173 minutes in two seasons, but few home  appearances came without the appreciation of a star. "That happened once and it  could never happen again," he said, smiling. "I was the rookie second-rounder  who beat the odds."  </P></p>

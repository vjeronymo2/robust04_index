			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Ala' al-Mashahrawi] </F>   [Text] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi yesterday strongly  condemned excesses, actions which undermine the internal  Palestinian rank, reckless use of firearms, and acts that  subject the residents' lives to danger and death.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that violating the rights of others,  resorting to violence, and undermining the principle of  cooperation and assistance are grave indications that harm the  Palestinian people's unity and cohesion.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held the Israeli authorities responsible  for the disorder and chaos among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,  especially the spread of weapons in the streets, which reach the  hands of adolescents and irresponsible individuals. He added  that in accordance with international law, Israel, as an  occupying country, is obligated to protect Palestinian residents  and care for their safety.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: In light of this situation, for  which everyone knows Israel is responsible, the Palestinians  should rally around their unity and avoid infighting, which does  not serve the Palestinian people.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi appealed to the Palestinian leadership to  work tirelessly and adopt a unified Palestinian position on a  democratic basis in order to avoid all the dangers that threaten  the Palestinian people, their militant heritage, and honorable  history of struggle against the occupation.</p>

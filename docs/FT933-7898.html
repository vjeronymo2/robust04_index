			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Steering system problem in jet crash A PRELIMINARY report on the crash of Sweden's fly-by-wire Gripen jet fighter in central Stockholm earlier this month has blamed a combination of the aircraft's steering system and the pilot's joystick movements. The findings of the official inquiry will be crucial to the future of the SKr60bn (Pounds 5bn) project because of the jet's importance for Sweden's military aerospace programme. The JAS 39 Gripen is a single-engine, multi-role fighter being developed by a consortium led by Saab-Scania and including Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson Radar Electronics and FFV Aerotech (part of the Celsius defence group which is currently being privatised). The project is already over budget and behind schedule, leading some commentators to question whether Sweden can maintain a viable military aerospace industry on its own. A prototype of the aircraft crashed during the development phase in 1989. Yesterday's report said the sensitivity of the steering system needed to be corrected, but it otherwise found no technical faults. It did not blame the pilot, Lars Radestrom, directly, despite saying his 'large and rapid joystick movements' contributed to the accident. The high-profile crash took place during an air display in front of thousands of spectators on August 8. However, there were no casualties. The Swedish air force has ordered 140 aircraft but consortium members have been relying on export orders to make the project a commercial success. They are looking to sell 500 aircraft in the next 10-20 years. Although they have never identified potential export markets, countries in South-East Asia, Latin America, and central and eastern Europe have all been mentioned. There was bitter disappointment last year when the Finnish government opted to buy 57 new F18s from the US group McDonnell Douglas. Mr Anders Bjorck, Sweden's defence minister, said yesterday: 'There is nothing in the report to indicate the JAS project should be interrupted. I hope that the fault can be corrected as quickly as possible so the aircraft will be able to fly again soon.'</p>

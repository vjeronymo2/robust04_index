			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Court guidance sought on BCCI TOUCHE ROSS, the liquidator of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is seeking directions from the High Court on whether it should hold a meeting of creditors to elect a liquidation committee as provided for in the 1986 Insolvency Act. A hearing has been fixed for Tuesday to consider an application in respect of BCCI SA, one of the two main banking arms of BCCI. It was not clear last night what had prompted the approach to the court. The Insolvency Act of 1986 allows a liquidator to summon meetings of creditors at any time to decide whether a committee should be established. It appears, however, that the liquidator wants a court to set the parameters of any meeting. In the Court of Appeal last October Lord Justice Dillon said it was 'wholly impracticable' to hold a creditors' meeting of BCCI SA, which includes the UK arm of the bank. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said: 'We have been campaigning for 16 months for a general meeting of creditors. The liquidators have told the court, the DTI and creditors that such a meeting was impractical. This decision represents a considerable U-turn but we welcome it. 'It is time a properly elected creditors' committee took this liquidation by the scruff of its neck and asked crucial questions about the recovery of assets and the cost of liquidation.' The timing of the move suggests it may have been the result of a rethink following the appeal filed by three individual creditors against the Luxembourg court approval of the Pounds 1.7bn compensation package agreed between the liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. When Touche Ross took a sounding of BCCI creditors last year, 94 per cent of those that replied were in favour of the agreement. A meeting of creditors that reflected those findings might be expected to elect a liquidation committee that was favourable to the deal. The present UK creditors' committee consists of some members opposed to the deal. Mr Vaz is suggesting the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham or the Wembley conference centre in London as possible venues for a meeting which several thousand creditors might be expected to attend. Touche Ross could not be contacted last night.</p>

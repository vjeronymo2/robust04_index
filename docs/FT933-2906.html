			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Improving trend at Storehouse MR KEITH Edelman, new chief executive of the Storehouse retailing group, said yesterday that sales were ahead of last year. He also announced that the group was setting aside an extra Pounds 6m to cover the cost of business disposals. The Pounds 6m provision is thought to relate to loan notes connected with the sale of Mothercare Stores, the US arm of Mothercare, in 1991. It will be taken as an exceptional charge against current-year profits. Mr Edelman, who succeeded Mr David Dworkin as chief executive, said sales at BhS, Mothercare and Blazer were all ahead of last year in spite of 'intensely competitive trading conditions'. Trading in the 'back-to-school' period had been encouraging. He added that Storehouse was still in line for the 'significant improvement' in trading profits for the full year, which Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, forecast at the annual meeting in July. Sales at BhS were up 5 per cent, with increases spread evenly across all divisions. Mr Edelman added that operating profits were also on target. He said margins had been maintained and cost increases had been rigorously controlled. Sales at Mothercare were up 4 per cent, but Mr Edelman said margins had been squeezed by cutting some prices, especially in children's clothing. Some of the lost margin is expected to be recovered by improvements in the supply chain over the full year. At Blazer, the upmarket mens' wear chain, sales were said to be ahead of last year and in line with budget.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) has invited UN nuclear inspectors to be  present at the refueling of its main nuclear reactor, an IAEA  spokesman said here today.    David Kyd, a spokesman of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), said the inspection this time would be "very  important" for the UN agency to clear up allegations that the  DPRK was developing nuclear weapons.    The IAEA has accepted DPRK's invitation, he added.    Kyd had said earlier today that the IAEA responded  positively  to DPRK's new offer and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA  inspection could be agreed upon, a new expert mission would  leave for DPRK "before the end of this month."    It was reported that the fresh inspection would focus on  DPRK's Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986.</p>

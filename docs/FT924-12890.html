			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Majority of Danes would vote for Maastricht treaty A majority of Danes would vote for the Maastricht treaty in a second referendum if Denmark obtained the supplements to, and exemptions from, the treaty which the government is seeking, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. An opinion poll published at the weekend found that 55 per cent would vote for the treaty on these conditions, with 20 per cent against. Fifteen per cent would be undecided and 10 per cent would not vote. Respondents were asked how they would vote if the other 11 EC governments conceded Danish demands for more democratic decision-making, less bureaucracy, and Danish exemption from participation in a common defence policy and currency.</p>

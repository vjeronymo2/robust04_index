			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Scholl rise 13% SCHOLL, the supplier of foot and personal healthcare products, climbed 13 per cent to Pounds 16.1m at the pre-tax level last year on the back of sharply lower interest rates. The fall in interest charges, from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.1m, had offset the 4 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 15.7m. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said interest charges had benefited from the Pounds 24.5m rights issue in May. Excluding the rights, the company had moved from debt of Pounds 12m at the end of 1990 to net cash of Pounds 2m. With the proceeds, Scholl - formerly European Home Products - had net cash of Pounds 26m, he said. This had been achieved by cost-cutting, including the reduction of the workforce by 4 per cent to 1,700. Stock levels had also been decreased by 18 per cent to Pounds 21.3m. Turnover suffered from similar stock-cutting exercises by retailers in northern Europe and adverse exchange rates. Sales fell by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 144.4m. Margins were slightly higher during the year, said Mr Franchino, although this was the result of depressed sales of Scholl footwear. Bad weather between March and May had resulted in a 3.5 per cent decline in shoe sales to Pounds 49.4m. The higher margin corn and bunion plaster business had boosted sales by 5 per cent to Pounds 68m, while personal and healthcare sales fell from Pounds 30m to Pounds 27.3m. Mr Franchino said the group aimed to expand in the therapeutic healthcare sector, with products such as herbal remedies and over the counter pharmacy products. Spending on research and development would continue to rise, he said. New products introduced last year, such as the insole deodorant, Odour Attacker, had proved particularly successful in the UK and Italian markets. Mr Gordon Stevens, chairman, warned that 1992 would continue to be difficult, but said he expected further benefits from cost-cutting. Earnings per share rose from 10.5p to 13.1p, amply covering the maintained final dividend of 3.5p, which makes an unchanged total of 6p.</p>

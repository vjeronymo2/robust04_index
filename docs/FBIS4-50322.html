			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Passport Chaos Must Be Solved"] </F>   [Text] There are some aspects of the 1997 issue which  require unique responses from the two sides. The passport  muddle, for example, cries out for cooperation, rather than  sticking dogmatically to entrenched attitudes. This is a  problem that must be dealt with expeditiously. Unfortunately,  however, it has become another casualty of the Sino-British  impasse.    Local holders of British National Overseas (BNO) passports  now have the same rights as British citizens when it comes to  such matters as visa-free entry to certain third countries.  Britain is pushing for the same system to continue after 1997  for BNO passport- holders. Hence the need for cooperation  between Beijing and London.    Noting that this is a matter for the post-1997 Special  Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, China says: "This is  a question of our sovereignty, we don't have to talk to Britain  about it." So what we are probably going to see is two separate  campaigns for Hong Kong passports. China will launch its own  promotion for the SAR passport and Britain will try to push the  BNO passport.    Commonsense indicates that it would be a lot simpler and a  lot more effective if the two sides just joined forces to get  the best possible deal from third countries as far as visas are  concerned. But this is shaping up as another case where Hong  Kong residents may suffer because both countries appear to be  more concerned about their own national pride than with the  welfare of the people of this territory. No one disputes that  this problem must be sorted out as quickly as possible. Failure  to do so will result in a bureaucratic nightmare after 1997.  The SAR will have to issue millions of passports in a very  short period of time. The earlier the relevant authorities get  started on this process the better.    This, we submit, is where the Preliminary Working Committee  (PWC) has a vital role to play. The PWC was set up by China  last year to advise on transitional issues. This is a classic  transitional issue. The mandate of reason and emergency is that  PWC members should intercede. They must use their influence  with China in an effort to persuade Beijing to talk to London.  They would probably be effective because China should listen to  its own advisory body. It would also be a test of whether the  PWC is just a rubber stamp for Chinese decisions or whether it  really does have some clout in advising Beijing.</p>

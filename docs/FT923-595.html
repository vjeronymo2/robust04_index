			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: William Jacks back in black FURTHER REDUCTIONS in operating costs and the benefits of the convertible preference rights issue a year ago enabled William Jacks, the motor dealer, to make a small profit in the half year ended July 31 1992. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1,000, compared with losses of Pounds 601,000 for the corresponding half year and with Pounds 850,000 for the full year. The overall car market had not yet shown signs of real recovery, but the corporate sector had been 'quite resilient' and certain franchises were benefiting from excellent new models, the company said. First half turnover was held at Pounds 21.2m. Operating surplus rose from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 443,000, and interest charges were cut to Pounds 442,000 (Pounds 704,000). Losses per share, after preference dividend, were 0.96p (5.56p).</p>

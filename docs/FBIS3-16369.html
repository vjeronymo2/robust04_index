			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Baberdin and Aleksandr Yegorov report under </F> "Postscriptum: Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Requiem for  Defense Industry"]    [Text] A gathering of leaders of defense enterprises,  economists, trade union figures, and representatives of labor  collective councils took place in Moscow last Saturday. They  discussed the seriousness of the situation which has taken shape  in the defense industry and adopted an appeal to the government  in connection with the draft state budget for 1994. The tangle  of problems here seems already to have exceeded its critical  mass.    As is known, the first state budget drafting stage ended  with  the government adopting a "compromise" version. It is already  clear, however, that this "compromise" will not bring  appeasement but will merely increase the intensity of the  struggle in parliament.    Many specialists doubt the possibility of keeping the budget  deficit below 10 percent (61.5 trillion rubles [R]) and reducing  the average monthly rate of inflation to 5-7 percent by the end  of 1994. The reluctance to improve the tax system and the  exhaustion of other sources of budget revenues are just a few of  the reasons for this. This is why the drastic cutting of the  expenditure part from R237 trillion to R182 trillion only  appears to confirm the resoluteness of the government's  aspirations but does not actually do so. Such a budget will  hardly be implemented.    What, then, will happen? Sectors and regions that have  adapted to the market will find nonbudgetary money and will  extricate themselves from the 1994 noose by redistributing  financial resources. Only budget-funded organizations will be  unable to do this -- i.e., the defense enterprises again, for  which the draft budget has prepared "tertiary conversion," which  is certainly the last conversion and which they will not  withstand.    It will clearly be impossible to fit the defense industry  into "Trishka's coat," even if we were to call on the assistance  of the most skilled masters. For it is impossible to finance  the 5,000 research and development tasks currently under way  with the present R3.5 trillion. Even if we cut all the  longer-term tasks, leaving specific ones relating to new models  of weapons (there are approximately 600 of these), this sum will  suffice only for about 10 particularly important ones on whose  completion the country's strategic security depends.    Together with the sum allocated to purchasing VVT [expansion  unknown], the planned budget appropriations can provide  approximately 300,000 people with work. (In the United States  the military sector of the economy has 3 million employees.)  This is tantamount to the defense industry's final degradation.  As a result, the capacities left unloaded will, at best, be  gradually "assimilated" into civilian industry or, most likely,  will come to a halt altogether, and specialists estimate that  approximately 15 million people will move from the sphere of  physical production to the position of unemployed or partially  unemployed people.    On behalf of the military-industrial complex enterprise  leaders and the chairmen of trade unions and labor collective  councils, A. Shulunov, president of the Defense Enterprises  Assistance League, and A. Breusov, chairman of the Association  of Trade Unions of Defense Sectors of Industry, put a proposal  to the government to take immediate measures to ensure the  efficiency of the credit-financial system, and to take control  of structural transformations in industry by amending the  present statute with the formation of financial-industrial  groups. Within the very near future, the appeal states, it is  necessary to approve Russia's defense program and adopt the  Russian Federation Law "On Military Production," as well as a  new version of the Law "On Conversion."</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> POLICE TEAM UP TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach police departments have joined forces  to cut down on traffic accidents along roads on which drivers tend to speed.  </P> <P> The Case Team program was started last year in Huntington Beach, and Fountain  Valley recently joined the effort.  </P> <P> Officers from both cities often patrol problem streets and set up large orange  signs warning drivers that traffic enforcement is ahead. The Case Team chooses  a particular route based on its high accident rate and maintains a presence for  up to 10 hours at different times.  </P> <P> "We're not hiding behind a billboard," Fountain Valley Police Officer David  Kanbara said. "We actually tell the public we're out there."  </P> <P> Though they stop many vehicles for even minor violations, Kanbara said that few  tickets are written. The program was designed to encourage voluntary compliance  with traffic laws and good driving habits. "Our major concern is that people  wear seat belts," he said.  </P> <P> When drivers are stopped for violations, officers tell them why and hand out  flyers listing the most frequent violations that result in fatalities or major  injuries. "It's a 30-second contact to let them know to drive carefully,"  Kanbara said.  </P> <P> Officers also talk to pedestrians and bicyclists as part of the traffic safety  and enforcement program.

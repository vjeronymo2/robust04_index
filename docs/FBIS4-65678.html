			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- The Federal Executive Committee  has removed its own chairman, Bernd Schuenemann, from office and  simultaneously initiated proceedings on his expulsion from the  party. The majority in the executive committee accuses the  Munich lawyer of having violated the statutes, resolutions of  the Federal Executive Committee, and principles of the party.    "On his own authority," Schuenemann pursued the founding of  an Instead Party in Saarland and did not check the infiltration  of former Republikaner into the organization, Deputy Chairman  Mike Bashford stated in Hamburg on Wednesday [18 May]. The  decision to take such massive action against the chairman, who  was only elected at the end of March, was made by six of the 11  executive committee members on Tuesday evening.

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Bridging the Nile RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON has won an inspection and assessment contract for a railway bridge over the River Nile in Uganda, which it designed more than 60 years ago and which is still a strategic rail link to the coast. RPT, a subsidiary the High-Point group, will also make recommendations to the Uganda Railways Corporation for any remedial or upgrading measures required to extend the life of the bridge and to accommodate heavier trains. The Jinja Bridge, across the Nile on the north shore of Lake Victoria, where the river drains out of the lake over the Ripon Falls, was built as a two-tier bridge in 1930. It originally carried a single-line 3ft 6in gauge railway on the top deck and a 20ft roadway beneath. RPT were the consultants for the substantial modification of the bridge carried out in the 1950s when the Owen Falls dam was built nearby. This raised the river level at the bridge by about 26ft. The roadway was diverted across the dam.</p>

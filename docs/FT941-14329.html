			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (24): Mergers help give a lift to the Dutch - While most Belgian companies have slipped this year, corporate life in the Netherlands has improved / Country Analyses - Benelux Countries The diverging fortunes of Belgian and Dutch corporate life are obvious from the FT500. Of the 18 Belgian companies in the 500, only two - Bekaert, the steel and wire cord group, and Kredietbank, one of the big three Belgian banks - have improved their ranking since last year, and that only marginally. Three Belgian companies are among the 25 companies to fall the furthest, and two more have left the list altogether. By contrast, leaving aside the largest Anglo-Dutch companies, the Dutch list includes two new entries and three more companies which have shown strong improvements in their position. That partly reflects the influence of recent mergers on the Dutch business world. The two new entries, Bols Wessanen, the food-to-beverages group ranked 298th, and KNP BT, the paper and packaging company which is listed in 365th place, are the products of far-reaching domestic tie-ups concluded in the course of 1993. These latest mergers confirm a trend that has been apparent since the early 1990s. For all the excitement about the single market and the need for cross-border expansion, Dutch companies have tended to look for merger partners in their own backyard first, partly as a means of defence and partly as a way of increasing their scope for international acquisitions. The two highest-ranked Dutch companies in the FT 500 listing - Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING), the financial services group, and ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank - did not even exist before 1990. Both were created in that year as part of the swiftest consolidation to sweep Dutch finance since the 1960s. Having secured their domestic base, both ING and ABN Amro are looking intently for acquisitions in Europe. So far, however, their European ambitions have been hampered by the high price commanded by the region's banks and insurers. ING's climb to 49th place from 60th in 1992 is a reflection of the re-rating of the company's shares. When it was first created in 1990, Europe's first full-fledged 'bancassurance' company, spanning both insurance and banking, caused confusion among investors who did not know whether to value the group as a bank or an insurance company. As a result, ING's shares tended to underperform the Netherlands' financial sector. In 1993, however, ING's shares put in a strong performance, rising from around Fl 52 (Dollars 27) in mid-December 1992 to around Fl 90 in December 1993. Another big beneficiary of share-price gains is Philips, the electronics group, which rose to 86th from 101th place, due mainly to a doubling in its share price over the 12 months to December. This, in turn, was caused by enthusiasm for the company's renewed efforts to sell off unprofitable assets rather than any significant recovery in its underlying business, which remains hampered by the worldwide malaise in consumer electronics. The Belgian stock market has reached record levels in 1993, but the problem is that it has still underperformed most other European exchanges. As a result, most Belgian stocks have slipped down the list. Ironically, they include companies in the banking and retailing sector which seemed to represent particularly strong defensive investments a year ago. With the exception of Kredietbank, Belgium's big banks - Generale de Banque and Banque Bruxelles Lambert - have both lost ground. BBL, in particular, has had to work hard in 1993 to recover from provisions against bad loans, recorded in 1992's profits, and the break-up of 1992 talks with ING, the Dutch financial services group, over a possible merger. Indeed, over the past two years, there has been a dearth of large takeovers in Belgium. As a result, the stock market has been prey to unsustained speculative surges, based on rumours of restructuring by the country's main holding companies. During 1993, perhaps the most exciting deal was the September sale of a 43 per cent stake in CBR, the cement company ranked 361st in the FT500, by Societe Generale de Belgique, the holding company ranked 127th, to Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials. Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group (ranked 116), also completed an important deal when it bought 50 per cent of CGER-ASLK, a network of Belgian savings banks, in the first stage of the Belgian government's privatisation programme. In retailing, the change against 1992 has been even more dramatic than in the banking sector. GIB Group slipped from 300th to 437th, while Delhaize - which was one of the top 200 in 1992 - declined from 176th to 327th. Along with Cobepa, the small Belgian holding company, both companies make the list of the 25 European companies to fall furthest during 1993. Delhaize has had a particularly tough year. In the first half, its consolidated net profits fell by more than 70 per cent. It has been hit by recession, falling food prices and industrial disputes in Belgium; and by a wave of bad publicity in the US, which caused a drop in business and a slump in the share price. Delhaize has blamed a concerted smear campaign by disgruntled US unions. If there is one success story in the Belgian list, it is probably Bekaert. The wire and steel cord manufacturer edged up from 435th to 432nd in the FT500, which does not seem spectacular. However, Bekaert also achieved the third largest profit increase among European companies. That represented a recovery from losses in 1991, and the just reward for some sensible restructuring, achieved in spite of the recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading Benelux companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        FT500    Company                         Cntry  Dollars m     Rank   Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Royal Dutch Petroleum Co*       Net      54910.7        1      212  2 Unilever NV*                    Net      17390.0        5      451  3 Internationale Nederlanden Gp   Net      10591.0       49      121  4 ABN Amro Holding                Net       9706.7       57      112  5 Electrabel                      Bel       9154.8       60      221  6 Philips Electronics             Net       6429.8       86      541  7 Petrofina                       Bel       6077.4       91      212  8 Elsevier*                       Net       5456.4       41      472  9 Aegon                           Net       4780.7      120      151 10 Societe Generale de Belgique    Bel       4572.4      127      171 11 Akzo                            Net       4329.7      133      622 12 Rodamco                         Net       4213.0      135      161 13 Heineken                        Net       3983.4      143      421 14 Generale de Banque              Bel       3513.7      158      112 15 Tractebel                       Bel       3507.3      159      221 16 Wolters Kluwer                  Net       3403.5      167      472 17 Minorco                         Lux       3180.2      179      641 18 Kredietbank                     Bel       3098.6      185      112 19 Solvay                          Bel       2910.1      197      622 20 Amev*                           Net       2849.6      116      151  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Market capitalisation on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange only  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

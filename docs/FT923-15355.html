			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Technology: Japanese electronics forced to clip its research wings - The metamorphosis caused by a collapse of demand Western perceptions of Japanese electronics companies' approach to product development tend to be heavily influenced by the success story of the Sony Walkman, and the claims of Akio Morita, Sony chairman, that 'any amount of market research' could not have measured the worth of his winning ideas. Tales of product-driven successes were all the more convincing when Japanese developers appeared to churn out an endless array of winning products. Now the downturn in the international electronics market and the increasing cost of capital in Japan have forced companies to reassess the importance of market research in focusing their R&amp;D. A sobering trend has been the collapse of domestic demand for audio-visual equipment; a market which had been a prime target for researchers competing to develop 'new' products that were actually minor variations on an older theme, whether it be large-screen televisions or a video-cassette recorder with an extra knob or two. Japanese consumers' apparent willingness to toss out hardly-used items and embrace these 'new products' helped to convince companies that the market would do them no wrong. Unfortunately, products have continued to surface, while audio-visual sales have been in decline for two years, leaving electronics companies with painful bruises. Matsushita Electric Industrial's pre-tax profits were down 39 per cent in the year to end March and Sony's were 44 per cent lower. Companies have reviewed the development process and concluded that life-cycles are too short and product ranges too wide, as even the domestic market is reluctant to absorb new products. At the same time, R&amp;D budgets are under pressure from the turbulence in Japanese financial markets, which is also encouraging companies to be more focused about research. Investment in R&amp;D is an important source of corporate pride in Japan, as it is generally taken as a measure of long-term strength. This year, however, budgets are generally flat or falling, while some image-conscious companies which claim to be increasing R&amp;D are simply shifting other business expenses into that budget. At Hitachi, which makes consumer, office and industrial electrical goods, R&amp;D spending is forecast to fall by 4 per cent this year, after a 6 per cent increase last year, and rises of 14 per cent, 15 per cent and 13 per cent in the three previous years. The sharp increases coincided with the surge of the Tokyo stock market in the late 1980s, when new funds were easily raised. The company said that the role of market research differs depending on product type. For heavy machinery under development, perhaps in co-operation with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and other equipment makers, the lead time may be ten years or more and the company may agree to participate in a project on the understanding that there will be public sector demand. 'For consumer products, our lead time can be almost nothing. We would like to increase the life cycle of products because we can see that there has been some change in consumer demand and that would reduce our R&amp;D costs,' the company said. Instead of wasting development funds on a minor upgrading of an existing model in an already overcrowded market, Hitachi and others are trying to find better uses for their money. One change at Hitachi is that control over R&amp;D is shifting from individual facilities, which had been seen as 'profit centres', to administrative divisions with broader access to market research: 'These divisions are closer to the market and our company is moving closer to the market,' the company said. Last year, NEC, the electronics maker, introduced changes in its R&amp;D policies based on what it calls the 'Customer Satisfaction Concept'. Mr Hiroshi Okazaki, manager of the engineering control division, points out that 'the most important thing is that every R&amp;D person has a marketing mind'. R&amp;D, he says, is kept relevant to the market by regularly bringing together researchers on a particular project and representatives from divisions that would have responsibility for handling the finished product. Meanwhile, the group business planning division prepares market studies which are circulated among the R&amp;D workers. As for the common belief that Japanese companies have research programmes that churn out dozens of completely new products, only a few of which are relevant enough to be marketed, Mr Okazaki said that this approach was discarded at NEC more than 20 years ago. 'It was once believed that the central research laboratories should be 'black-boxed', and not controlled by outsiders. But, more than 20 years ago, NEC introduced a modern research management system, including research evaluation before the project start, and meetings between the central researchers and operational divisions,' Mr Okazaki said. Making minor changes to existing models, and then releasing 'new' models in rapid succession on the domestic market, is a more recent trend, quite distinct from the researching of genuinely new products. Companies have had to release slightly improved models less frequently, and they have simultaneously had to pay more attention to the selection of new development projects. Fujitsu, the computer company, aims to spend the equivalent of about 10 per cent of total sales on R&amp;D, but admits that its manufacture of semiconductors and various other high-tech products requiring huge investments during development has put the R&amp;D budget under pressure. 'As technology further advances and information and communication systems spread into more versatile areas , R&amp;D activities to realise these technologies require more and more investment. Therefore we have to be more selective and set priorities,' Fujitsu said. Fujitsu is not the only Japanese electronics company forced to be more selective. Proud as they are of big R&amp;D budgets, the Japanese makers are under extreme pressure to get value for money by choosing winning research and by curbing an enthusiasm for 'developing' products that the market does not want.  ------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE ELECTRONICS COMPANIES' SPENDING ON R&amp;D  -------------------------------------------------------               1988    1989    1990    1991    1992                                             forecast  ------------------------------------------------------- NEC            4.0     7.7     7.1     6.7     3.1 Hitachi       13.0    15.0    14.0     6.0    -4.0 Fujitsu       28.9    15.1     6.8     8.9     8.2 Matsushita    17.7     8.5    11.0     9.1     2.9 Sony          10.4    16.3    19.7    16.6     2.1  ------------------------------------------------------- Percenatage increase over previous year Source: company reports  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

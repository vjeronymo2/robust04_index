			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom by </F> announcer Freek Robinson; place not given; on the "Agenda"  program; italicized passages in Afrikaans--live]    [Text] [Robinson] As I understand it, as it has been  reported, you are basically at loggerheads with your own deputy  minister on this particular case, but the principle underlying  is market value for farms. What is the position?    [Hanekom] No, it's not really true that I have been at  loggerheads with our deputy minister. There is a clear  provision in the constitution for compensation, and we would of  course adhere to the constitutional provisions, but it requires  a lot more thought. The constitutional provisions say that there  will be just compensation, fair and equitable, in fact. What it  means, and what it also says is that various factors will be  taken into account -- the historical terms of acquisition. So  what we are saying is that if in the event of farmers having  obtained the land under favorable conditions, in fact conditions  of less than market value, then we could certainly not justify a  case of farmers profiteering out of forced removals, in other  words getting market value in compensation when they paid less  than market value originally. If that is the case....    [Robinson, interrupting] But at the same time they, having  lived on the farm for a number of years they had made some  improvements, and that certainly must also be taken into account.    [Hanekom] Absolutely. I don't see any difference between  myself and Mr. Meyer, unless he has made certain public  statements which I'm not aware of. In my discussions with him,  we recognized that where improvements have been made on the land  full compensation would only be fair if people had erected  fences and built dams, and put up structures. They would have  to get paid at full market value for those improvements on the  land.    [Robinson] Let's just get down to basics now. As I  understand it, the date stipulated in the constitution is the  19th of June 1913 -- no claims can be made further back than  that, and as from now, whenever this new process starts, and  that must be some time in August I believe, when this law comes  into effect through Parliament, the new Parliament, then within  three years the claims must be put to the new commission. So  when is that new commission going to start operating?    [Hanekom] Well, as soon as possible. We would see that as  being one of our priority policy moves, if you like. We have to  pass the necessary legislation in order to set up the land  claims court. We would like to see absolutely minimum delay in  getting the land claims court fully functional. The minimum  delay probably means not before October this year. It's an act  required to be passed by Parliament, and then a certain minimum  time delay to set up the necessary structures which means the  court on the one hand, and commissions based on all of the  provinces on the other hand.    [Robinson] And that can take until the end of this year to  get that all practically implemented?    [Hanekom] Realistically, it could well take until the end of  the year. In the mean time, the present government appointed  with its tasks, albeit of a very limited nature.    [Robinson] But that has no real standing in law because all  of those things must go through the to-be-appointed commission,  and then going to the land claims court.    [Hanekom] Correct. But in the meantime the commission on  land allocations is a legitimate body. It has limited terms of  reference, it has to deal with those cases in front of it as  effectively as possible, and then as soon as possible we get the  land claims court operational with the accompanying new  commission.    [Robinson] Obviously, the immediate thought is that most of  those people who will go to the commission and to the land  claims court will be black people, people who have been driven  off their land. But at the same time white farmers have also  been forced, so to speak, from their land because the state  needed their land to consolidate it into homelands. Will they  on the same basis equally be able to go to the land claims court?    [Hanekom] Your first mistake, Freek, is that the state did  not need their land to consolidate homelands. They should never  have embarked on a homeland consolidation program in the first  place. But never mind...    [Robinson] That's not my mistake, of course. That policy was  in place as you know.    [Hanekom] If they wanted to implement such policies then in  theory they needed that land, yes, correct. But be it as it  may, white farmers were expropriated, and certain white farmers  may indeed go to the land claims court to go back to the land  from which they were also forcibly removed in a sense.  Circumstances were different. They were different in a sense  that white farmers were compensated at full market value, and of  course had the opportunity to buy land of equal value elsewhere  in the country. Black people were paid far less than market  value, if they got any compensation at all, and had very little  opportunities to resettle themselves elsewhere.    [Robinson] How many claims have you received so far? All in  all?    [Hanekom] We haven't received any claims insofar as the  claims are still going to the commission on land allocations.  They received something in the order of 1,300 claims. Many of  them would be claims that would not fall under the jurisdiction  of the land claims court we are talking about. We have in our  department approximately 90 rural claims which would certainly  fall within the definitions of the land claims court, within the  constitutional provisions of the land claims court.    [Robinson] Now I would like to continue with this  discussion, and later we will come to the practical side of how  to help people who are on the land. But can we just try to  clarify a few things? If you have so many claims, it's doubtful  that you will be able to process all of those claims within  three years. As I understand it, those complaints must be  lodged within three years, but actually getting to the practical  implementation of settling their claims will take a lot longer.    [Hanekom] Yes, firstly we would like those historical claims  not to drag on forever. It is an ugly part of our history, and  a shameful part of our history which we want to deal with as  quickly as possible, and as fairly as possible. So we are  saying that we can't go on forever. People can't rediscover  claims forever and forever, therefore, we say there should be a  three-year period during which people can lodge their claims.  Clearly there will be a delay. We are hoping that the whole  process will be completed within a five-year period.    [Robinson] And how much will it cost?    [Hanekom] It is quite difficult to say because it is not  like  housing where you can say we are going to build x-number of  houses over the next five years. Because we don't at this point  know exactly how many claims will come forward, but we're  looking at a possible cost of the entire land reform program of  something in the order of two and a half billion per year,  something of that nature, which would include the broader  redistribution program as well as the restitution program.    [Robinson] There's a perception that you will institute a  special land tax to pay for it.    [Hanekom] It certainly is a matter under consideration, not  alone tax to pay for the restitution program, but a land tax as  part of a land reform program. A land tax is not really  intended for central government revenue at all. The cost of the  restitution program has to be paid for out of government coffers  in the same way that housing is paid for out of central  government coffers, and education, and health services and so  forth. So we don't see the land tax as a source of revenue to  cover a land reform program, but it could have other desirable  effects in the interests of land reform. [passage omitted]    [Robinson] Let us just talk about the criteria of  people who have to return to their land. Are there any criteria  -- just the fact that they lived there before, or do you also  look at whether they will be able to use that land  productively?    [Hanekom] Freek, may I just say something before I  return to your question. It was indeed an inspiration for me to  see just now what happened in Riemvasmaak. I was there  personally. It was the most fantastic experience of my life,  and I must say it in Afrikaans, because although I am mainly  English speaking, I was there and we spoke Afrikaans to each  other, and it was just fantastic. It was also the first  real public event in my new responsibility in my  office, and it has been such an inspiration. I must say it  tells us what it's all about. It is about justice, about  creating opportunities, and so on. Now to come back to your  question.    Yes, in the first place there are many people who have  the right to return to their own land, and for that provision  has been made in court, irrespective of how they want to use  that land, or whatever their plans are. Of course, we very much  want them to use that land well, and they must get the necessary  support for that, but that is their own land, and they have the  right to return to their land. There are of course many other  cases where there is a need for land. There too state  assistance is needed. But those are different cases, they will  not go through the courts.    [Robinson] But if these people end up on their land  then that land should at least be used productively. To what  extent will you help the people to do that?    [Hanekom] In the first place, it is the  responsibility of the state, because the people were forcibly  removed from their land, and in many respects people lost  their skills, and are not in an immediate position to make full  use of the land which they have now got back, and we must take  into account those factors. People, white farmers enjoyed a lot  of support. We are not saying that we want to go through the  same subsidy systems and get people indebted on the land, but we  are saying that white farmers enjoyed a certain amount of  support which got them going. And we are saying that these  people who are going back to their land, they do have skills,  they have energy, they would like to work their land, but they  will be in a much better position to do so if they are given  some support by the state.    However we don't believe it's state responsibility alone,  and  that was the nice thing about your footage. Where we have  situations where the farmers assist, where local or adjacent  farmers assist the people returning to their land, that is  really a win-win situation. That's the most desirable  situation, because those farmers next door to the land, they  know the conditions better than anyone else and they are right  there to give support. So we really do like to see situations  of full cooperation between those going back to their land and  the farmers who are there.    [Robinson] But I imagine there must be some kind of formal  structure to give training to those people, apart from the  training that they can get from farmers next door? And whose  responsibility is that? Is it yours, or with the minister of  agriculture, or the minister of provincial affairs, or who?    [Hanekom] There is a whole package of support which would  have to go along with the return to land. On the one hand it is  agricultural training to help people to make better decisions --  in other words, good extension work which would be provided by  the Department of Agriculture. But there is a whole planning  process which goes into the return of land. People have to make  decisions -- where are we going to build our houses, how are we  going to get water? Water affairs would most certainly be  involved, because we have to see it in the context of the whole  Reconstruction and Development Program. It is one component of  a much bigger program of rural development and the improvement  of people's quality of lives.    [Robinson] Who will coordinate that process? Mr. Jay Naidoo  or you, will have a lot of work to do, that's for sure!    [Hanekom] No, no, Mr. J. Naidoo would give us as much  support  as possible, and would certainly see himself as assisting when  it comes to coordinated activities between the relevant  departments. For example, housing, water affairs, and the parks  board could be involved in certain cases....    [Robinson, interrupting] But the principle....    [Hanekom, continuing] The main responsibility would lie in  my  department. We are responsible for land reform and ensuring  that people who go back to their land are given the necessary  support that they can take full advantage of the new  opportunities opening up for them.    [Robinson] And just one last one -- the matter of communal  farming. Is that something that you will leave up to the people  to decide for themselves, or will you encourage them to be  individual productive farmers?    [Hanekom] In certain cases people would choose to be  individual productive farmers, in other cases people will farm  under the traditional system, and they do it well. They  understand the system, and if that is what they choose, we would  certainly not wish to impose anything else on people.    [Robinson] Mr. Hanekom, thank you very much for your  participation here tonight, and I'm sure we will hear more in  the future on this very sensitive matter, but anyway we now have  a few guidelines. Thank you very much.    [Hanekom] Thank you very much, Freek.</p>

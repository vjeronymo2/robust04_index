			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Cabinet rift emerges on spending and tax policies CABINET rifts over government spending and tax policies opened yesterday as Mr Michael Heseltine raised the spectre of Tory manifesto promises becoming casualties of the battle to control public borrowing. As senior Tories sought to brush off further falls in opinion polls, the trade and industry secretary's comments contrasted with those of rightwing cabinet ministers who made clear their opposition to reneging on the Conservative's 1992 election pledge not to increase income tax. The row precedes Thursday's cabinet meeting on public spending when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will tell his colleagues that public spending cannot breach the Pounds 253.6bn ceiling set for the 1994-95 financial year. Mr Clarke will tomorrow break with recent tradition and use the annual Mansion House speech in the City - his detailed policy address as chancellor  -for a wide-ranging review of economic issues. A damaging split over tax and spending priorities, likely to continue over the summer as the Treasury struggles to curb departmental budgets, will add to the difficulties Mr John Major faces in restoring confidence in his leadership. In an interview yesterday, the prime minister said he was 'philosophically attracted to the lowest possible level of taxation'. But he was not prepared to pre-judge November's Budget. Mr Major faces the ignominy today of a review by the rightwing 92 group of Tory backbenchers of Conservative party prospects. Their message, although coated in language supportive of the prime minister, is expected to make plain that, in their eyes, he is on probation. Senior figures on the Tory right confirmed yesterday that Mr Clarke, although pro-European, could win their support in a future Conservative leadership election if he successfully cuts state spending rather than increasing taxes. Most Tory MPs consider a leadership challenge unlikely this year. Few - including Mr Major in his Mail on Sunday interview - rule out a contest before the general election. Speaking on BBC television, Mr Heseltine said he expected 'turbulence ahead' for the government and predicted the economy, schools testing and policy on Europe 'are going to cause us considerable difficulties'. Asked about income tax rises, Mr Heseltine said the chancellor had to 're-visit' all options for tackling the deficit. But he added: 'You will find in practically every case that there is a manifesto commitment which blocks off the options, and if you then say 'fine, we've made a manifesto commitment, all the options are blocked off', well, I tell you, it won't be a Pounds 50bn deficit we're dealing with next year, it will be a bigger one.' His comments contrasted with those of Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who said on BBC radio that the Conservatives' opposition to tax rises meant 'we have to put the spotlight on public expenditure'. He said stories about breaking manifesto pledges 'are simply false'. An NOP opinion poll in the Independent on Sunday put Conservative support at a 12-year low of 27 per cent. A Mori poll for The Sunday Times showed only 16 per cent satisfied with Mr Major's performance, a postwar low for a British prime minister. Spending cuts opposed, Page 6</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- No radioactive waste will be  stored at Morsleben (Saxony-Anhalt), the only nuclear waste  storage site in Germany, before the end of January. Radioactive  materials will definitely not be disposed of in Morsleben over  the next few days, [Saxony-Anhalt] Environment Ministry  spokeswoman Lydia Hueskens said in Magdeburg today.    The first shipment would probably not come from western  Germany but from Greifswald. It is not yet known when the  nuclear waste will arrive. The earliest possible date is 20  January since the ministry must be notified four weeks before  disposal.    Last week the Magdeburg Higher Administrative Court ruled  that west German nuclear waste could be stored in Morsleben too,  since there are no indications of ``manifest safety  shortcomings'' at the underground storage site. The Greenpeace  environmental organization expressed fears at the weekend that  western nuclear waste might be taken to Morsleben in the next  few days.    Greenpeace members have already occupied the Morsleben site  twice. They criticize the fact that there is no provision for  monitoring procedures or any study on the long-term safety of  the dump, which operated in GDR times.</p>

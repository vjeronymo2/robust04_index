			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Nordic No camp on defensive: Strength of Austrian vote to join EU takes 'antis' by surprise The strong anti-European Union campaigns in Finland, Norway and Sweden have been put on the defensive by the decisive vote in Austria on Sunday in favour of EU membership. 'The result took them by surprise,' said Mr Arve Thorvik, leader of a group of former prominent anti-EU campaigners in Norway who now support entry. 'A No vote in Austria would definitely have had an impact, strengthening the No campaign here. But the two-thirds majority for the Yes side is a vitamin shot for us. It shows opinion can be turned around.' Although the No side trails in Finland, where a referendum will be held in October, in Sweden and Norway the Yes campaign has a long way to go to overturn EU opponents before both countries vote in November. By then, the Austrian result will be little more than a distant memory. But since Sunday night, No campaigners have found themselves in the unaccustomed position of having to explain a defeat, rather than pursuing their hitherto vigorous attacks on the EU and the threats they say it poses to national independence and democracy. Mr Kristen Nygaard, leader of Norway's 'No to the EU' organisation, admitted the Austrian result deprived his campaign of a boost. But he insisted: 'I don't believe that the referendum in Austria will have any effect on the Norwegian EU debate.' Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, co-leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU' campaign, said that in Austria the No side lacked a strong organisation, unlike in Sweden where her organisation acts as a national umbrella for a broad range of political opinion united by hostility to the EU. She also claimed that extreme right-wing attempts to scare voters in Austria into voting against membership had alienated many people. 'Here in Sweden we will drive the debate in a different way, with factual arguments,' she said. 'Every country makes its own choice.' In Iceland, meanwhile, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, foreign minister and Social Democratic party leader, said Reykjavik might apply for EU membership by the end of the year. Such a move would likely be determined by whether Finland, Sweden and Norway  -with Austria, fellow members of the European Free Trade Association - decided to join. Iceland, also part of the European Economic Area open markets agreement with the EU, has hitherto declined to seek membership because of reluctance to open its fishing grounds to Union fishermen.</p>

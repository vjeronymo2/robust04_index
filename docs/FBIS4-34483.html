			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patricia Grogg] </F>   [Text] Havana, 16 Jun (PL) -- Cuba gave full guarantees to  the Chilean authorities that no reprisals will be taken against  the eight persons who illegally occupied the Chilean Consulate  General in this capital yesterday.    According to Chilean Mission sources, the condition is for  them to peacefully abandon the building that they trespassed on  Wednesday morning by jumping the fence that surrounds the  two-story building located in the elegant neighborhood of  Miramar, in western Havana.    Chilean diplomatic officials told PRENSA LATINA that they  would even be willing to escort them to their residences if they  decide to leave. The Chilean officials said they decided to  take in the occupiers strictly for humanitarian reasons. The  group consists of six men and a woman, whose ages range between  20 and 30 years, and a 12-year old boy.    "We hope that time will help us to convince them that as a  consulate we cannot give them asylum and that their only option  is to abandon the mission," sources close to the mission said.    According to international conventions and norms, a consular  mission cannot grant political asylum. "We have explained it to  them on several occasions, but they insist they want to leave  the country," the source added.    Following a 17-year break in diplomatic relations, the two  countries have maintained consular relations since 1991 as a  result of an agreement reached between former President Patricio  Aylwin and Cuban leader Fidel Castro in Guadalajara, Mexico,  during the First Ibero-American Summit.    The officials have emphatically ruled out the use of force  to  compel the group to abandon the mission's grounds.    "The orders are not to use force at any time, the only road  available is to convince them to leave," they said.    The occupiers remain in the building's back porch, and the  consular authorities are guaranteeing them food, including milk  for the boy.    They sleep outdoors on improvised mattresses, which is not  that bad thanks to the high temperatures common to the Cuban  summer season.    Even though they have not specifically shown an interest in  traveling to the United States as their final destination, some  of them said they have money to leave the country and that they  have relatives in Miami, the U.S. city where most Cuban  immigrants live.    Consul Patricio Pozo held an intense round of interviews  this  morning, apparently with Foreign Ministry officials, the  contents and results of which are not yet known.    Meanwhile, the Cuban authorities reiterated yesterday to the  diplomatic corps accredited here its decision to help resolve  the situation created in the last two weeks following the  illegal occupation of the Belgian ambassador's residence by 128  persons, the German Embassy by 21 persons, and the Chilean  Consulate.    Likewise, the authorities reiterated Cuba's official  position  not to accept illegal entry into diplomatic installations as a  pressure mechanism for leaving the country.    The incident at the Chilean Consulate took place the day  before the meeting between Fidel Castro and Chilean President  Eduardo Frei in the framework of the bilateral meetings held by  both presidents in Cartagena de Indias, site of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit.    Last Monday, coinciding with Mexican President Carlos  Salinas  de Gortari's visit to Havana, 21 Cuban citizens violently  penetrated the German Embassy in a truck.    "My personal impression is that there is something in these  coincidences," a Latin American diplomat, who preferred not to  be identified, said.</p>

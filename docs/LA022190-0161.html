			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NIKKEI STOCKS TAKE 3RD-BIGGEST SINGLE-DAY DIVE: MORE THAN 3%  </P> <P> The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell more than 3% today in its  third-biggest single-day dive ever and worst since the worldwide stock market  crash in October, 1987.  </P> <P> Traders blamed heavy computer-guided selling by foreign brokerage firms for the  decline and said there was no panic selling.  </P> <P> Amid concerns about possible interest rate increases, the index had already  fallen nearly 565 points in the previous two trading days.  </P> <P> The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely followed index  on the exchange, fell 1,161.19 points, or 3.15%, closing at 35,734.33.  </P> <P> It was the index's sharpest decline since a plunge of 1,203.23 on Oct. 23,  1987, after a round-the-world stock market crash. The largest single-day plunge  in Tokyo was 3,836.48 points Oct. 20, 1987.  </P> <P> With most investors on the sidelines today, the analysts said, a lack of buy  orders allowed the index to fall sharply. They said market sentiment was not  necessarily as pessimistic as the plunge indicated.  </P></p>

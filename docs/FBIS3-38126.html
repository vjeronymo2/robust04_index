			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- There are 42,400 right-wing  extremists in Germany. This is stated in a confidential  analysis compiled by the Federal Office for the Protection of  the Constitution. The Cologne newspaper SONNTAGS-EXPRESS  reports that according to the analysis there are "5,600 militant  right-wingers among them." The German People's Union (DVU) with  "some 26,000 members" is "the largest right-wing extremist  organization."    The report leaves open the politically very controversial  question of whether the "Republicans" are an unconstitutional  party. Staff of the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution working at federal and state level were able to  determine that the Republicans, whose declared membership of  23,000 is questioned, show "in fact indications of right-wing  extremist tendencies." It is uncertain, however, whether these  will intensify or whether the party will succeed in "pushing  back the right-wing extremist tendencies in its ranks," the  newspaper reports.</p>

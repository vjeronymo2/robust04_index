			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Drama over Europe AT GLASGOW'S Tramway Theatre, the Wrestling School, a company dedicated to Howard Barker's work, has this week been giving the world premiere performances of his The Europeans. The play is in every way a paradox, and means to be. It is a tragicomedy; a history play with blatant anachronisms; brutal and intellectual; vulgar and formal. It is often poetic, bad, provocative, obscure, humane, frustrating, exciting. And it is about paradox - in particular, the paradox of modern Europe. It is set in 1683. The Poles have just lifted the Turkish siege of Vienna. Starhemberg, the victorious general, is modest, inquiring, compassionate - and curious about the plight of those who have suffered worst. Katrin, a pregnant and mutilated victim of a Turkish gang-rape, is a glutton for martyrdom; she gives birth in a city square. He and she fall in love. They are located amid a panoply of striking characters - the Emperor Leopold and his Empress; the painter who is to immortalise both ruler and war-victims; Starhemberg's old mother; beggars; soldiers; and a priest, who not only takes Katrin's sister as his mistress (without any consummation) but also becomes hero and confessor to Starhemberg. What all of this achieves is a fascinatingly ironic picture of Europe: Europe for ever fragmented (rather than saved), and culturally, sexually and theologically perplexed. Love and hate; lust and abstinence; belief and heresy; misogyny and lechery . . the oxymora are piled up before us. The play, however, consists of more paradoxes than it needs. Why the quasi-erotic scene in which Starhemberg obliges another officer to fabricate a story about his childhood? At one point, apropos of nothing (Katrin had been talking of 'the criminality of motherhood'), the painter says 'on a clear day, you can see to Transylvania.' Yes, well. The Europeans is exasperating, but exciting too. Its view of history reminds you of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, and Brecht. And it lives infinitely better in live performance than on the printed page. The nine Wrestling School performers do marvels with animating Barker's language, so difficult because of its switches between four-letter words and poetic formality ('Her pain she needs, her suffering she requires'). Two small flaws: Bill Stewart (Leopold) pronounces 'laugh' like 'love', and Benny Young (the painter) mispronounces 'Giovanni'. But all nine create a world on stage - thanks to skilful direction by Kenny Ireland: a good omen for his regime at Edinburgh's Lyceum. Nicholas Le Prevost and Judith Scott perform Starhemberg and Katrin with the authority and integrity of true artists. Congratulations to the Tramway, that bold and admirable venue, for presenting this premiere. 'The Europeans' now tours to the Leicester Haymarket and Greenwich Theatres</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a well has been cored, natural fracture permeability can only be analyzed if the core has intersected a fracture, and the well operator requests that vertical permeability be measured. Of the three core analyses in the record, only one (the Shackelford No. 138&hyph;A well) shows both horizontal (matrix) and vertical (fracture) permeability values. However, only the horizontal permeability was used by the applicant. Although the reported vertical permeabilities in the well are lower than the horizontal permeabilities in the majority of the core, the vertical permeability is listed as 55.27 md from one zone and as ``TBFA'' (too broken for analysis) in another zone. In addition, the record contains no evidence showing that the cored intervals in the three wells are pay zones that were completed for production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the record includes one data well ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3414&hyph;A) where pressure buildup calculations found that each of the three producing intervals' permeability was less than 0.1 md. We acknowledge that pressure buildup test analyses usually reflect total (i.e., matrix and fracture) permeability found in a well's drainage area, and that, despite its 1992 drilling date, initial reservoir pressures in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3414&hyph;A well appear to be as high as those found in the Spraberry Formation at original conditions. However, the record also shows that the Upper and Lower Spraberry intervals produced high volumes of water during the tests, and the record contains no evidence that any of the tested intervals was actually completed for production. Therefore, we conclude that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3414&hyph;A well's high initial pressures and low permeability values may be the result of its location in an area of lower reservoir quality, and that the well's permeability does not reflect the formation's original permeability throughout the recommended area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the above, the Commission is issuing this preliminary finding since the record:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Contains only gas permeability and hydrocarbon flow rate data that do not represent initial conditions found in the reservoir prior to sustained production, pressure decline, and water injection; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Does not reflect natural fracture permeability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;275.202 (a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Based on the foregoing facts, the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that Texas' determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record upon which it was made. Texas or the applicant may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request an informal conference with the Commission pursuant to &sect;275.202 (f) of the regulations. A final Commission order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary finding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By direction of the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linwood A.

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Sizzler in the concert hall Paul Driver reviews John Adams' new concerto conducted by Ken Nagano The London Symphony Orchestra's concert under Kent Nagano at Barbican Hall on Thursday was designed to be sizzling and balletic: Ravel's La Valse, Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballet suite and the European premiere of the Violin Concerto by the American John Adams (born 1947), a composer renowned for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. Nagano is a leading exponent of Adams's work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of Klinghoffer and performed many of his other pieces. He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall. His account of Ravel's bewitching yet brutally vivid 'choreographic poem', that strangely extrovert threnody for the old Europe, which begins in the ballroom to end on the battlefield, made one feel the truth of all those epithets and brought home the sheer sonorous power of the LSO, especially in the lower and darkly rumbling registers. No matter how dark and rumbling the sounds, they were always precisely focussed: little curling counterpoints took on chilling force. Adams's concerto, written in 1993 and premiered in Minneapolis in January (with soloist Jorja Fleezanis) is also a kind of choreographic poem, having been jointly commissioned not only by two orchestras (Minnesota Orchestra; LSO) but by the New York City Ballet. Adams's strict, often motoric rhythmic manner and colourful (but often inwardly complex) imagery lend themselves readily to dance. His 1988 score Fearful Symmetries has been choreographed no less than six times, most recently by Ashley Page, whose Royal Ballet version opened at Covent Garden last week. But it was out of the experience of opera composing, Adams writes, that the present concerto sprang. To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of his earlier work but called for by The Death of Klinghoffer and now the basis of what he calls a 'post-Klinghoffer', or post-minimalist, language. Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if the part-writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes. The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds. When the latter are not spending time perversely imitating the harp, they contribute some novel, ethereal effects. There are the three movements, fast-slow-fast, traditional to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell. The solo part, brilliantly despatched by Gidon Kremer, is full of traditional figurations and devices. With likeable impunity and verve, Adams has produced a virtuoso vehicle in something like the grand romantic manner.</p>

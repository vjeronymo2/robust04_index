			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> TRENARY GETS BIG LEAD IN COMPULSORY FIGURES; ITO DROPS TO 10TH  </P> <P> The Midori Ito dynasty that was predicted for women's figure skating might have  come to an inglorious end Wednesday only one year after it started.  </P> <P> Japan's Ito, who won the 1989 World championship as a 19-year-old, had one of  the worst experiences with ice since the Titanic, finishing 10th in the  compulsory figures at the Dartmouth Sportsplex.  </P> <P> Three-time U.S. champion Jill Trenary, who seemed resigned earlier in the week  to placing second behind Ito, won the figures, which count toward 20% of the  final score, and emerged as the clear favorite to win the championship.  </P> <P> Even if Ito's technically superior freestyle skating earns her first places in  the final two phases of the competition, she cannot win unless Trenary falls  below third place in both. Considering the lack of depth in women's skating,  and the composure the 21-year-old Trenary displayed last month in winning the  U.S. championship, that is unlikely.  </P> <P> It was the last stand for compulsory figures, which have been eliminated from  future competitions, and they went out dramatically. If they did not absolutely  determine which skater will win, then they might at least have determined which  one will not.  </P> <P> Yugoslavia's Zeljka Cizmesija skated the final figure, for which she was  honored with a bouquet of roses, a box of chocolates and a standing ovation  from a crowd of about 400.  </P> <P> It was difficult to determine whether to interpret the cheers as tribute to  figures, which have been an important part of the sport since the beginning, or  as good riddance. Johnny Esaw, the figure skating commentator for the Canadian  Broadcasting Co., said he has three descriptions of figures: "Dull, dull and  dull."  </P> <P> But Ito threatened to make them exciting, almost stumbling on the second of two  figures. One of the nine judges gave her 25th place, out of 29, for that one.  Ito finished sixth on the first figure and 14th on the second figure for 10th  place overall. She was sixth in figures last year, when she won the  championship.  </P> <P> "Midori was out of control out there," said Carlo Fassi, who coaches Trenary in  Colorado Springs, Colo. "I don't know why. She can do figures. I think she was  nervous. Last year, everything she did was wonderful. This year, there was more  pressure on her."  </P> <P> Trenary, from Minnetonka, Minn., finished first on the first figure and second  on the second to Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah. Cook is fourth overall. Natalia  Lebedeva of the Soviet Union is second, and Patricia Neske, who is from  Hawthorne but represents West Germany because both of her parents are from that  country, is third. Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., is ninth.  </P> <P> Fassi said the challenge facing Trenary is to maintain her concentration. He  spoke as if the only one who can beat Trenary is Trenary.  </P> <P> "I'm a little concerned," he said. "She likes to be the underdog, the one who  fights for the title. She has to go out and attack. If she sits back, she could  be in trouble."  </P> <P> Trenary, third in the World Championships last year, said she will not alter  her freestyle programs to protect her lead.  </P> <P> "It would be deadly for me to start focusing on how big a lead I have," she  said. "I came in here being the underdog. Everything I've heard is that (Ito)  is totally superior to everybody else, which is easier for me to handle. I  don't want to be the total favorite."  </P> <P> Fassi said he and his wife, Christa, will do nothing to disturb Trenary's  emotional balance.  </P> <P> "We do nothing," he said. "We only stay away. We make no arguments. We'll tell  her she looks wonderful, she has a nice dress."  </P> <P> In the men's competition, the Soviet Union's Viktor Petrenko moved into first  place, but it took an exceptional original program, after judges gave defending  champion Kurt Browning of Canada generous scores at the Halifax Metro Centre.  </P> <P> Browning left out one required element and had a poor landing on a double axel,  but he received high marks, including one perfect 6.0 for artistic impression.  </P> <P> Petrenko then landed two triple axels and skated flawlessly. He received two  6.0s for artistic impression.  </P> <P> U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, who trains in San Diego, moved into third place  overall, barely ahead of West Germany's Richard Zander, who grew up in  Huntington Beach. Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys is fifth.  </P> <P> Either Petrenko or Browning probably will become the champion after tonight's  freestyle program.  </P></p>

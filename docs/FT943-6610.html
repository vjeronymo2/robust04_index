			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Mixed emotions of youth and age - Australian Wines / Jancis Robinson is impressed by some vintages from Down Under There seems to be some sort of tax on showing emotion in Australia. Certainly Australian winemakers are the most phlegmatic in the world, and Philip Shaw of Rosemount is a prime example. Earlier this summer, in his usual, heavy-lidded monotone, he presented the first 11 vintages of his pride and joy, Roxburgh Chardonnay, in a suite as opulent as the wine itself at the Ritz Hotel in London. 'Quite a nice wine,' was about as close as he got to enthusiasm, even about the intense and unashamedly Hunter Roxburgh Chardonnay 1993 (usually about Pounds 15). The wines took us on a textbook trip through the recent history of the world's favourite grape variety in Australia, with the younger vintages substantially outshining those made before 1987. This was back in the Dark Chardonnay Ages when winemakers thought that lots of new oak and deliberate avoidance of oxidation during winemaking was the answer. All that happened was that the deep golden wine all too often turned brown and flat in bottle at about three years old. From 1987 Shaw, arguably Australia's most influential arbiter of Chardonnay winemaking fashion, used ambient rather than commercial yeasts, cut down on the sulphur dioxide and acid additions, and began to decrease the proportion of new oak. Although the quality of Australian Chardonnay has increased almost immeasurably since the late 1980s, relatively few of them (Petaluma and Leeuwin perhaps) have demonstrated the ability to age. Most are made, perhaps more sensibly, in the full knowledge that almost all Australian wine is drunk within a few hours of being bought. The Cowra region in New South Wales has long provided some of the best fruit for this exuberantly fruity style of Chardonnay and The Rothbury Estate Cowra Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 5.95 at 100 Sainsbury stores, is a particularly fine example. Grapes other than Chardonnay are a better bet for those with serious cellaring intentions. The best of the bevy of Australian Rieslings available in Britain will age well, and Hunter Valley Semillon is a prime example of wine which actually needs years in bottle to show its best. Sainsbury's has the probably underpriced McWilliam's Mount Pleasant Elizabeth Semillon 1988 for Pounds 6.25 in their top 50 stores; it is not nearly ready to drink. By historical fluke (ships refuelling at Madeira perhaps), Australia grows quite a bit of the long-lived, tangy white grape Verdelho, and producers are beginning to see its potential. Richmond Grove Verdelho 1993 is another exciting product of Cowra, from a Jacob's Creek affiliate, and costs about Pounds 6 from stockists which include Sainsbury's. More handcrafted and subtle is David Traeger's Nagambie Verdelho 1993, Pounds 6.99, from the state of Victoria via the Australian Wine Centre of London WC1 (071-925 0751). It has serious substance, no obvious added acid, slight nuttiness and a slight fizz. It would make a great aperitif. Australian reds have in general shown much better ageing potential than whites. A few days before the decade of Roxburgh was displayed, Australia's wine giant Penfolds showed off, inasmuch as Australians allow themselves to show off, historical ranges of some of their most popular red wines back to the prehistory of the 1970s, and even a slightly decrepit bottle of Bin 60A 1962. Every Grange back to 1976 was a turn-on in some respect; but it was the obvious age-ability of their high volume lines such as Koonunga Hill and Bin 128 that was most impressive. Koonunga Hill 1982 was an absolute delight at 12 years old - just the thing for the Bordelais who cannot believe that subtlety is ever to be found Down Under. In fact although the wine contains more Shiraz grapes than Cabernet (especially so in 1982 when Cabernet was all the rage and Shiraz an as yet uncelebrated resource), the wine had an uncannily Bordeaux-like balance and bouquet. The 1982 was a museum bottle, but Koonunga Hill Shiraz-Cabernet 1992, widely distributed at Pounds 5-something, is very easy to drink now and should keep well. In contrast, Penfolds Bin 128 Coonawarra Shiraz seemed a less successful candidate for the cellar. The 1991 is still quite hard work because of the acid that manages to dominate its big, fat fruit, while the 1986 was still chewy but a bit simple, and the 1980 was old rather than mature. The Wine Society of Stevenage has an Australian red that is at a delightful stage of well-mannered, drinkable middle age: Houghton Gold Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 1988 is Pounds 5.95 and comes from the cool southern tip of Western Australia. Its maker would probably describe it as 'not a bad drink'. I would call it gorgeous.</p>

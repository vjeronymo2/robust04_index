			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Review promises boost for business: White paper aims to make Britain more competitive; Pounds 300m extra for training The UK government launched its long-awaited white paper on boosting Britain's competitiveness yesterday with a promise to raise standards of vocational education and training and provide a better climate in which business can operate. The 163-page document, presented with much razzmatazz by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, contained a multitude of initiatives and suggestions covering such diverse areas as employment, management, communications and infrastructure, innovation, export promotion and proposals to secure more prompt payment of bills for small companies. But many of the measures in the paper were existing ideas repackaged and brought together to constitute a strategy. The white paper itself admitted it was 'in effect a snapshot of work in hand across the government'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told a press conference, however, that it was 'rubbish' to suggest there was nothing new in the document. 'There are no short-term fixes in the white paper but a long-term look at the country's competitiveness into the next century,' he said. Mr Heseltine said his paper contained 61 new proposals. In a rowdy House of Commons, Mr Heseltine said the white paper - 'an agenda for change and improvement across the public and private sectors' - would not lead to any overall increase in planned public expenditure. This was in spite of the government's intention to provide an extra Pounds 300m over the three financial years to 1997-98 for education and training. Shortly after Mr Heseltine sat down, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, announced that the government was considering how to put into effect recommendations from the Health and Safety Commission that would remove 40 per cent of regulations affecting most businesses 'without adversely affecting health and safety conditions'. For his part, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced a consultation paper on privatising the UK's air traffic control system. National Air Traffic Services may be floated on the stock exchange, becoming a private sector contractor to the Civil Aviation Authority. The white paper was given a scornful reception by Labour. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, congratulated Mr Heseltine on his 'glitzy' presentation 'which puts it in the coffee table class of white papers'. But he said 'the gloss rubs off very easily'. The white paper, Mr Cook said, was an admission of Britain's competitiveness problem, adding: 'This is a bankrupt statement from a government on the verge of liquidation.' The paper itself said Britain has 'an enormous task' correcting more than 100 years of relative economic decline. It said that improvements in the 1980s meant that the country was 'now back in touch with the leaders, but there is a lot of ground to make up'. A cabinet committee, comprising Mr Heseltine and other senior ministers responsible for the report, will continue to monitor competitiveness and the effects of the white paper. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the committee would 'move on to things which still need to be done'. He made clear he would be looking at how far UK companies had achieved the right balance in paying out a greater proportion of profits in dividends than continental companies. The broad coverage of the white paper reflects the view of the Department of Trade and Industry that there is no single cause or no small number of causes for the UK's competitiveness problems. In focusing on many facets of the economy, the white paper is intended to provide ministers with a check list to judge future progress towards making government policy more friendly to business in an increasingly competitive world economy. The check list aspect of the white paper was applauded by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'The real value of the white paper will depend on how it influences government policy in the future. We shall use the analysis to argue our case for a tax regime which favours industrial investment, and to press the case for public spending on training programmes,' he said. The paper was given a generally warm welcome by industry and commerce. Mr Graham MacKenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was the nearest to an industrial strategy that he had seen from this government. 'We are especially pleased with the education and training measures to strengthen school qualifications and career guidance,' he said. To raise educational standards, the government plans to introduce a new general diploma in England and Wales to provide a 'quality check' that school pupils have good general certificate of secondary education results, 'more and better' vocational courses for 14- to 16-year-olds and a review of vocational training standards by the end of 1996. It plans to provide more help for the transition from school to work and strengthen work-based training. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said that 'by 2000 the 16-year-old school-leaver will be as dead as the dodo'. Mr Hunt said the Employment Department plans wide-ranging consultations on the introduction of a voucher system for 16- to 19-year-olds to buy their own education and training. The white paper also underlined the government's intention to increase help for companies, and especially small companies, so that they can improve their management skills and be given better access to innovation and export promotion. In answer to long standing complaints from small companies, the government will introduce a range of measures to encourage companies to pay bills promptly. Lord Strathclyde, small companies minister, threatened that the government would review the case for legislation to improve payment discipline in two years unless 'significant improvement' has taken place.

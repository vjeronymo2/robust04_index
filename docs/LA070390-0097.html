			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Digital Sound Stock Plummets: The Santa Barbara maker of voice-mail equipment  for businesses lost 46% of its stock market value after disclosing that it  probably will record a second-quarter loss.  </P> <P> The stock plunged $4.25 to $5 on volume of 490,900 shares. The company said the  expected loss will stem from slower than anticipated orders from some major  customers. Digital has been wracked with problems since its initial public  stock offering on Feb. 26, at $8.50 a share. Digital said its second-quarter  order problems were compounded by grass fires last week in Santa Barbara  because many employees were unable to get to work.  </P></p>

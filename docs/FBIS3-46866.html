			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon has reshuffled  his duties and those of his deputies taking personal charge of  the Business Economics and Foreign Trade departments and the  Public Warehouse Organisation.    Previously, the Business Economics Department -- which  handles trade negotiations, research and data compilation-- was  the responsibility of Deputy Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai.    Mr Chaloemphon, who was appointed when Phaithun Kaeothong  moved to become deputy labour minister, made no secret of the  fact that he was not interested in the Business Economics  Department, prefering an agency that has practical activities  inside Thailand.    Mr Uthai has given him responsibility for the Insurance  Department in a direct swap, dropping the Export Promotion  Department and adding the Commercial Registration Department.    Deputy Minister Churin Laksanawisit is taking responsibility  for the Export Promotion Department, relinquishing the  Commercial Registration Department, while also retaining  responsibility for the Intellectual Property Department.    Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap will take charge  of  the Internal Trade Department.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPLOITED UNDERCLASS OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS IS FERTILE GROUND FOR UNION  ORGANIZING  </P> <P> James Flanigan, in his Aug. 23 column ("Why Cheers for a Polish Union, Scorn  for Ours?"), claims that today's unions are becoming a victim of their own  success. The relatively high wages and good benefits unionization has brought  make it tougher to organize new workers, he argues; employees don't believe  unions can produce anything for them today.  </P> <P> Most of my union's 32,000 members are employed in the Los Angeles food  industry. They offered views contrary to Flanigan's in recent confidential  in-depth surveys conducted by the respected Washington, D.C.-based Wilson  Center for Public Research. By roughly a 15-to-1 ratio, food workers indicated  they would be worse off without union representation.  </P> <P> Behind this union loyalty were insights not covered in the column. Fear of  arbitrary treatment by management and lack of job security without union  protections were only two of the points workers cited.  </P> <P> Flanigan argues that union-won reforms since the 1930s and a work force  shifting from an industrial to a service economy have diminished labor's clout.  But he ignores the impact of an underclass of immigrant laborers who dominate  key sectors of the work force in many parts of Los Angeles. They still  experience the exploitation and poverty that plagued Depression-era workers.  And they are fertile ground for unionization. My union has scored gains in  organizing and winning contract gains for mostly Hispanic workers in area  meatpacking plants. Other unions are also targeting companies made up of  low-paid Spanish-speaking employees.  </P> <P> Labor does face severe challenges. A critical problem -- one ignored entirely  by Flanigan -- is the utter failure of the nation's labor laws to protect  workers from illegal union-busting tactics. But the labor movement has a future  so long as it protects union members -- as only it can -- from the caprice of  management, and embraces workers who are still disadvantaged.  </P> <P> RICK ICAZA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> The writer is president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and of  the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 770  </P></p>

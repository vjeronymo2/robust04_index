			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Citicorp creates post of head of credit cards Citicorp, the US's biggest credit card issuer, has handed responsibility for its US and European cards business to a new executive, marking the latest senior-level reshuffle in the international credit card industry. Both Visa and MasterCard have recently replaced long-serving chairmen. The moves signal growing competition between banks and other issuers in the credit card industry, as well as a shift in focus away from the mature US market. Citicorp said it had created a new position of head of credit cards for the US and Europe. Previously, responsibility for credit cards had rested with regional managers, who had responsibility for all retail banking products. The bank named Ms Roberta Arena as the first head of the cards business, catapulting her into one of the most prominent positions in the industry. She is now general manager of the US cards business, and was previously in charge of European credit cards. The bank has been largely successful in defending its market position in the US against new entrants in recent months. The reshuffle in part indicates an intention to shift emphasis to other markets with better growth prospects. Citicorp has 29m cardholders in the US, compared with 600,000 in Europe. Mr James Bailey, who had run all of the bank's US consumer banking businesses since the beginning of 1992, has been named head of global transaction services.</p>

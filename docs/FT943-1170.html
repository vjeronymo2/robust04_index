			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (28): Surprises are inevitable - Good project management still relies on tried and tested principles Building software applications is a little like carpentry, writes Philip Manchester. Although the principles of shaping wood are universal, every piece of wood is unique and the craft is in learning how to cope with the unexpected. Software development follows the same process and no matter how concise the development method is, there are bound to be surprises. Modern project management techniques aim to keep surprises to the minimum and be ready with contingency plans if something goes wrong. Over the past 30 years, software developers have found a variety of ways to manage the construction of software. From the rigorous 'methodologies' and computer-aided design tools to management and project reporting systems, there is no shortage of tools for the job. But despite the availability of the tools, good project management still relies on tried and tested principles: 'There are plenty of tools around but it is hard to stop people being a slave to them. We use the tools to gather information and see what works and what doesn't. But there is no substitute for experience and skills,' says Mr John Millar, technical director of Logica UK. 'The key to successful project engineering is to improve the literacy of our staff and instil discipline.' Logica's approach to managing large-scale projects aims to take the best management practice and combine it with good automated tools: 'We focus on what we call micro methods. We have a framework which covers the life-cycle of the project and make use of tools where necessary,' Mr Millar explains. However, he is, like many others, sceptical about an overly formal approach to managing software development projects: 'At the end of the 1980s there was a lot of talk about methodologies solving development problems. I think of them as the 'Lose fat while sleeping' approach and I don't believe that it works. Some parts of the methodology can be useful  - but I think it naive to see a simple way to solve the problem,' Mr Millar says. He goes on to say that Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), one of the more successful methodologies, at least brought the users of the system into the design approach. 'SSADM showed how important it was to get users involved and it has turned out to be a useful way to describe systems.' Other software developers are also finding user input during the project design phase to be a significant step forward. Mr Keith Turner, a divisional director software developer for Hoskyns Group, sees this as an inevitable result of a change in the way software is built: 'Software development is more iterative now. Users have to be involved because you need some form of open relationship with the customer. The more you can work as a team, the more likely you are to be successful,' says Mr Turner. 'Tools and methods can help but they cannot compensate for incompetence. You must get the people right and the balance of team skills.'</p>

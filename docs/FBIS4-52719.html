			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  recently at a party in "Chongwadae" [presidential offices]  contended that the reunification of the country is "fantasy" and  "unification concept must be discarded."    Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this as an  unpardonable separatist remark against reunification.    The news analyst says:    To reunify the divided country is the supreme desire and the  most urgent task of the nation.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks denying reunification  itself are an intolerable insult and challenge to the 70 million  Koreans who crave for national reunification and fight for its  realisation.    He not only utters words against reunification but also  works  hard to block the peaceful reunification of the country.    It is none other than the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique that  categorically opposed the ten-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation, a common reunification charter of the  nation, turned down the North-proposed convocation of a national  conference for national reconciliation, unity and reunification,  frustrated the exchange of special envoys between North and  South, totally blocked North-South dialogue and drove the  North-South relations to confrontation and the brink of war.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly see the trend of the  times, refrain from separatist acts against reunification and  step down as demanded by the people.</p>

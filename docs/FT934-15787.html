			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: United Biscuits firm A bright start from United Biscuits (UB) saw the shares open at 10p higher, prompting speculation that one of the market's favourite bid candidates was back in play. Unilever was yesterday's choice as the most likely predator, although analysts pointed out that any such move could trigger a monopolies inquiry over their frozen foods businesses. Identifying several other problem areas, Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull said: 'A Unilever bid for United Biscuits is one of the least likely situations.' Dealers said that UB shares had been squeezed up because of a buy order being split between two brokers. UB shares closed 16 ahead at 368p in average volume of 2m, while Unilever lost 5 to 1052p. Leading property shares surged forward after dealers said James Capel was renewing its bullish stance. Brixton Estate gained 7 to 232p, Frogmore Estates 15 to 455p, Land Securities 9 to 703p and Slough Estates 5 to 269p. British Land, up 15 at 413p, was being mentioned as a possible bidder for Greycoat following the latter's failure to gain approval for its financial restructuring via Postel. Despite the Greycoat board's protestations before yesterday's egm that the company would go into receivership if the vote was lost, property analysts specluated that British Land was only one of several potential predators. The appeal of Glaxo's high yield continued to lure investors faced with the probability of lower interest rates, and the stock moved up 12 to 666p. Zeneca also went ahead strongly with a rise of 10 to 755p. An upbeat presentation to analysts and institutions by Reuters bolstered its share price with a rise of 27 to 1518p. The London meeting was a follow-on from similar exercises in New York and Los Angeles. ADT slipped back 44 to 579p, on speculation that 24 per cent stake holder Laidlaw, the waste services group, might be considering selling its stake after the departure of Laidlaw's chief executive. Among aviation stocks, British Airways' were in demand and put on 7 1/2 to 375 1/2 p, with SG Warburg, which has been recommending the stock, said to have been among the day's leading buyers. Container leasing and transport rental group Tiphook remained friendless following Thursday's profits warning and negative statement. The shares tumbled another 46 to 123p. Hopes that the proposed Pounds 250m joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation will still go ahead brought a turnaround in the shares. Further suggestions that the deal was close to collapse saw the shares decline 6 to 387p at first, before renewed hopes fuelled a bounce which saw the shares finally a net 11 ahead at 304p. Profit-taking together with a touch of nervous trading saw Lucas Industries shed 2 to 155p, ahead of next week's figures. Market watchers expect Mr George Simpson, currently deputy chairman at BAe, to be confirmed as the new chief executive at Lucas. A doubled blow hit shares in Automated Security which sent them falling sharply. BZW, joint broker to the company, resigned after the company issued a profits warning. In a busy telecoms sector, profit-taking set Cable and Wireless back, the shares losing 14 to 899p. Vodafone was said to have weakened as BZW downgraded the stock, the shares falling 6 to 526p. Micro Focus, meeting analysts this week, retreated 160 to 1450p. GKN fell 5 to 462p as investors took aboard the downturn in European car sales. Construction shares continued their good run. Tarmac bounced 4 to 143p and Havelock Europa 19 to 96p.</p>

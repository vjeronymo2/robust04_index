			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Martin Leka report: "Safet Zhulali Orders the Mass </F> Disarmament of the Albanian Army"]    [Text] [Page one carries two facsimile passages with the  subhead "Extract from the order of Defense Minister Safet  Zhulali":    [The first facsimile passage reads: "I order: 1. Personal  weapons such as knives, pistols, guns, or automatic rifles given  to officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians employed by  the army will be deposited in the armories of bases, units, or  the relevant institutions by 15 January 1994."    [The second facsimile passage carries the signature "Defense  Minister Safet Zhulali"]  <H5>  Mass Disarmament of the Albanian Army </H5>   This, then, is the order of Defense Minister Safet Zhulali  issued on 8 January this year, to be carried out by 15 January.  One would perhaps envy the "haste" of such an order if it were  to arm rather than to disarm officers, noncommissioned officers,  and civilians employed by the army. Now all officers, except  for those not covered by Zhulali's order to "lose weight," will  be without their personal weapons, whether knives, pistols,  guns, or automatic rifles. According to the above-mentioned  order, this is in order to regulate the administration of  personal weapons and to prevent unusual events (!)...    The reasoning behind the disarmament of officers described  in  the order lies open to many doubts. First, we do not think the  regular administration of personal weapons means their removal.  I think that there are plenty of other measures that might  enforce discipline in this area. In this specific case, the  word "regulate" has assumed an absolute meaning, excluding all  other forms of "regulation." Second, even though there have  been cases in which unusual events have taken place, those  involving officers seem to us to have been minimal and  insignificant compared with those today involving individuals  carrying weapons whether with or without licences. Such an  explanation holds good least of all for officers, who are among  the people most trusted by those who turn their eyes to every  citizens whenever the words "enemy" or "war" are uttered.    For reasons of this kind, there has been a great deal of  speculation about the disarmament of these servicemen, as many  servicemen affected by the order have recently told us.    This speculation includes a possible drastic reduction in  the  staff of military units, starting from the ministry itself, with  the aim of preventing any incident caused by jittery servicemen  who do not properly understand the reform in the army. Others  explain the order with reference to the new generals' "fear" of  the "old soldiers" (!). Others ironically explain that Albania  has now run out of enemies, etc., etc....    Only the officers, noncommissioned officers, radio  operators,  and drivers attached to the main army chiefs are excluded from  this order, and have the right to carry weapons.    Now the officers' weapons have been taken away. In short, a  person can now seize an officer's cap at whim and run off with  it, and the officre will pursue him on foot?! Before seizing  the cap, you must only put your trust in the officer's running  ability or the Lord Almightly. How far can one trifle with our  respected officers today?    At a time when such a thing is happening, something which to  our minds is entirely unacceptable, the fact is that a "mafia"  that principally uses weapons to achieve its dark aims is ever  more clearly emerging. These mafiosi will now be further  emboldened. One weapon less in the hands of officers means one  more for criminals, because from now on the latter will now be  able to step out in front of the finest officer, say "Hands up,"  search him, and rob him, taking even his briefcase of documents,  and finally ordering the officer to stand "to attention" until  the armed criminal has quietly departed toward an "unknown  destination".</p>

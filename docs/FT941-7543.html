			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Post-communism: the rival models Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries are to seek assurances this weekend that Russia is taking action to avoid hyperinflation and control budget deficits. They have already been given their answer by the head of the Russian central bank, Victor Gerashchenko (who is a one-man refutation of the more simple-minded case for central bank independence). Gerashchenko has said that the Russian government would have difficulty in keeping its 1994 deficit below two or three times the 1993 level, when inflation was 900 per cent. If you think that these rates of credit creation and inflation bought any growth, take a look at the table showing real gross domestic product falling by double-digit percentages in each of the past three years. It is hardly surprising that the extreme nationalists and renamed communists did so well in the recent Russian parliamentary elections. At this point the whole sad story becomes ammunition for another ideological debate in the west. One school of thought would use these estimates rather bitterly to count the cost of western-sponsored reform. Another would use them to underline the costs of avoiding real reform. A spirited exposition of the first point of view is provided by the Oxford political philosopher, John Gray, in a booklet entitled Post Communist Society in Transition*. Gray, who was once the authorised expositor of Hayek, now attacks western governments for 'a species of free-market fundamentalism' in their approach to former communist countries. He calls the prevailing attitude 'not only intellectually indefensible; it is politically frivolous, and dangerous in the highest degree'. One of Gray's strongest points is that by far the most powerful forces in the former communist countries have been nationalism and religion, which none of the schools of reformers foresaw or took into account. His avowed purpose is to go through all the models that have been proposed for the former communist countries and say that none of them is adequate to the historical singularities of countries such as Russia. But since even political theorists cannot just dwell on the uniqueness of each society, he comes quite near to recommending the Japanese example. His most telling dictum, however, is that the success of post-communist governments depends on their ability 'to secure national security, to protect their citizens from foreign attack, civil strife and organised criminality'. Gray singles out Harvard's Professor Jeffrey Sachs as a villain of the piece. The latter has played an effective role in the highly successful Polish reforms, which are being maintained by a new government containing many former communists. He has also been an adviser to the reformers in the Soviet Union and Russia and is more than capable of taking care of himself. Sachs avoids getting into a debate on whether the new kinds of capitalism will be based on western ideas of individualism or Confucian ideas of the supremacy of the family or society. He simply points out that the countries with which he has been concerned have been faced with a hyperinflation, which would break down any structure of society unless shock therapy is undertaken. As he remarks, Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Hungary and Poland did try gradualist strategies in the 1980s, which ended up in macro-economic disaster. In a co-authored article in the November issue of International Economy, he confronts head-on the frequent references to the Chinese model. China, in fact, did have a big bang in its rural sector, which accounted for more than 70 per cent of employment in 1978. Within a few years China's leaders allowed peasant families to move out of agricultural communes and to control their own farming plots, and also to move to new non-state industries in rural and coastal areas. China's problem was to generate basic economic development, starting with a huge surplus agricultural population. Russia's problem has been that of economic restructuring in a country where more than 85 per cent of the population is in industry and services; but too many of them are locked into obsolete military-industrial structures. As for Japan, Sachs reminds us that in 1949 the US imposed a rigorous IMF-style stabilisation plan. This remark appears in a book on The Political Economy of Policy Reform, edited by John Williamson, just published by the Washington Institute for International Economics. Williamson himself goes some way to meet the Gray-type ideological attack by distinguishing between what he calls the Washington programme of market-based reform and Thatcher-Reagan neo-conservative ideology. Williamson's three slogans are stability, market oriented and outward-directed reform. His more specific list starts with fiscal discipline and goes on to public expenditure and tax reform, financial liberalisation, realistic exchange rates, trade liberalisation, freedom for inward investment, privatisation and deregulation. This is not altogether convincing. Even 10 years ago, items such as privatisation, deregulation or financial liberalisation would not have appeared on the list; and it is only thanks to the efforts of those who have been prepared to be tarred with the neo-conservative brush that they have now become orthodox. Hard science is not to be sought in this area; and the awful name 'technopols', which Williamson gives to politically powerful economists, should be dropped like red hot coal. A perfectly good alternative term is 'political economist'. The book considers 11 countries that are regarded as successful examples of reform and two which have failed. The countries covered range from New Zealand via Poland to Mexico; but neither the Group of Seven main industrial countries nor Russia and China are covered. The purpose is to establish the conditions required for successful reform. But most of the candidates - ranging from social consensus to strong dictatorship, and surprise treatment to gradualism - appear neither necessary nor sufficient. The nearest to a common thread is political leadership. But, looked at in detail, it is a subtle commodity. The leadership that the reforming New Zealand Labour prime minister, Mr David Lange, gave was for a nuclear-free South Pacific; this gave his finance minister Roger Douglas a chance to get his act together. In Poland, the motivation of the leadership, which gave economic reform its chance, was the urge to rejoin Europe. Somewhat similar factors were at work in Mediterranean countries where leftwing leaders could get away with market policies by asserting they were necessary to become full members of the EU. But I have run out of space without having had a chance to discuss an issue that causes acute divisions among political economists of the Washington consensus. Sachs passionately believes that lack of adequate western aid at make-or-break moments has much to do with the fall of Yegor Gaidar and other Russian reformers. The IMF view is that these reformers never had the power for a credible programme. Sachs exaggerates the role of overseas help in economic take-off. England, which first experienced industrial revolution, could not by definition draw on the resources of earlier pioneers. Where he may be right is that overseas help can be crucial to the political survival of reform-market governments hanging on by a thread. If opportunities have been missed, the IMF is, however, only a minor culprit. A decision to use economic aid to sustain particular governments in Russia or elsewhere is a summit one to be made by presidents and prime ministers and they abandon their duty if they delegate it to 'experts'. *Social Market Foundation, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Russian reform: non-meeting of minds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP % change over previous year                                  Forecasts                       1990    1991   1992   1993         1994     1995  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Czech Republic*       -1.6   -14.7   -7.1      0          2.0      5.0 Hungary               -3.3   -10.0   -5.0   -1.0          2.0      1.0 Poland               -11.6    -9.0    1.0    3.0          4.0      3.0 Russia**              -4.0   -17.0  -19.0  -11.0         -9.0      1.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *CSFR before 1992    **USSR before 1992                   Source: OECD  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation % change in average level of consumer prices over            Forecasts previous year                       1990    1991   1992   1993         1994     1995  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Czech Republic*         10      58     11     21           11       10 Hungary                 28      35     23     23           20       20 Poland                 585      70     43     40           35       30 Russia**                 5      91  1,500    900         na     na  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *CSFR before 1992    **USSR before 1992                   Source: OECD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Arthur Lee slices into borrowings with Pounds 7.5m disposals ARTHUR LEE, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic products, is selling its loss-making bright bar division and a related steel stock holding company for Pounds 7.5m, which will enable it to repay nearly all group borrowings. The company is selling Lee Bright Bars, which makes bright engineering steels, and Bell &amp; Harwood, a specialist stockholder, to United Engineering Steels, the joint venture between British Steel and GKN. United Engineering has its own, much larger, bright bar division and will also supply raw steel to Lee Bright Bars. The transaction is subject to the Office of Fair Trading indicating there will be no Monopolies and Mergers Commission referral. The two companies accounted for just under 25 per cent of Arthur Lee's sales last year. In the six months to March 31 they incurred combined losses of Pounds 702,000, which reduced group profits to Pounds 604,000. Mr Grahame Holland, financial director, said following the sale Arthur Lee will concentrate on alloy and stainless steel manufacturing, plastics and wire and plastic ropes. He said the company had invested nearly Pounds 3m in the bright bar division in recent years. Margins, however, were disappointing and the company would now focus on higher value added activities. The purchase price included Pounds 1.5m of borrowings which would be transferred to United Engineering. Arthur Lee's net borrowings would fall from Pounds 8m to less than Pounds 1m. Mr Peter Lee, 57, chairman and managing director, also announced that his roles would be split. He would continue as chairman but Mr Jim Henderson, managing director of the steel division, would take over as group managing director. Mr David Lee, 59, another member of the Lee family, was also reducing his involvement in the company. Lee Bright Bars' site in Sheffield and Bell &amp; Harwood's site in West Bromwich are being retained by Arthur Lee and rented back to the former subsidiaries. The rental income charged, which was not disclosed, would be a similar size to management charges paid to Arthur Lee.</p>

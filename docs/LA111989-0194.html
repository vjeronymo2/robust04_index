			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL WATER POLO;  </P> <P> CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CORONADO GOALIE SURFACES TO DEFEAT POWAY FOR TITLE  </P> <P> Coronado High water polo coach Randy Burgess said he'd been waiting for his  junior goalie, Jack Bowen, to have a game of the spectacular variety for two  years.  </P> <P> Burgess' wait ended Saturday night as Bowen put on a rejection show Mark Eaton  would have proud of in Coronado's 13-8 victory over Poway in the San Diego  Section title game at the Jewish Community Center.  </P> <P> Bowen personally turned back any hopes Poway had of dethroning the two-time  champs by holding the Titans scoreless with four fourth-quarter saves.  </P> <P> "He's just an incredible player," said Bowen's teammate Pat Mitchell, who  scored three third-period goals. "What you saw in the second half was the Jack  Bowen show."  </P> <P> The show's highlight came with three minutes remaining in the game and Coronado  ahead, 12-8. With Bowen one-one with Poway junior Chad Aronen at point-blank  range, Bowen leaped up out of the water and swatted away Aronen's rifle shot.  </P> <P> "That was leg strength," Bowen said. "That's what lifting in the summer is all  about. I visualized those kind of blocks in my room last night when I was  listening to music."  </P> <P> The music stopped for Poway (22-3) after they grabbed a 7-5 lead early in the  third period. After the Titans led, they continually self-destructed with  turnovers and missed opportunities.  </P> <P> And while Poway was self-destructing, Coronado (23-3) was taking advantage of  nearly every scoring opportunity it had. After trailing 7-5, Poway scored four  consecutive goals, including long-range bullets from Mitchell and Chris Cote.  </P> <P> "I was not concerned when we fell behind," Burgess said. "Everybody was in good  condition and we stayed with our game plan."  </P></p>

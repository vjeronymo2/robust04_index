			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / French bank proposal challenged FRANCE'S constitutional council has challenged government legislation to make the Bank of France independent, ruling that important parts of the law cannot be enforced until the Maastricht treaty on European union comes into effect. However, the government yesterday played down the ruling, saying that the treaty should be ratified by all 12 European Community members by the end of the autumn. It would reintroduce the legislation then. 'We will introduce the law in identical form to the initial text,' said an official at the economy ministry. He added that the council ruling would not affect the timing of the implementation of the law because certain administrative procedures, in particular the formation of the central bank's governing committee, had still to be completed. The council decided that since the French constitution granted the government responsibilities for deciding the nation's policies, parliament could not grant the Bank of France the power to determine important areas of economic policy. It further said that parliament could not forbid the central bank to receive instructions from the government. The French government is seeking to create an independent central bank to increase the credibility of the country's commitment to price stability. Independence for the French bank is also an important step towards the creation a European central bank as part of the process of European monetary union. This process has suffered a setback following the widening of exchange rate bands within which currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism can fluctuate. Wider bands were agreed last weekend in Brussels following sustained attacks on the French franc and other ERM currencies. The constitutional council's ruling is the second time in a month that it has clashed with the government. At the end of July, it ruled against a law on the reform of university education.</p>

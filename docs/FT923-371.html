			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Angola's time has come to vote for lasting peace: Today's elections can only be a success if the loser accepts defeat gracefully ANGOLANS go to the polls today to elect the first democratic government in the country's blighted history. The elections offer Angola's 10.5m people their first opportunity for lasting peace and democracy in 500 years scarred by the slave trade, Portuguese colonialism and three decades of civil war. The war, fuelled by the US, Soviet Union, South Africa and Cuba, cost Angola an estimated Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.5bn) in lost economic output and left an impoverished country with 500,000 people dead, 60,000 amputees mutilated by land mine explosions, and the roads, railways and communications in tatters. If the polls go smoothly Angola will also be able to start seriously on economic reform which could tap the country's mineral and agricultural resources and turn it into an economic powerhouse of southern Africa. Success will depend particularly on whether the loser will accept defeat gracefully or re-ignite the violent tensions between the ruling, former Marxist, MPLA government and the US- and South African-backed right-wing Unita. Already western diplomats in Luanda are talking about the 'Ghost of 1975' - the year when violent conflict erupted on the once graceful streets of Luanda before independence from Portugal, and the 350,000 mostly Portuguese white community evacuated the city and left the country bereft of skilled personnel. Elections for the presidency and the 223-member national assembly have come down to a two-horse race between President Eduardo Dos Santos' MPLA and Unita, lead by Mr Jonas Savimbi. Political observers in Luanda say the critical factor to Angola's future is 'The Savimbi question'. If Mr Savimbi, who has spent nearly three decades fighting a guerrilla offensive in the bush, wins the presidency, will he be able to change his political personality and rise to the challenge of national reconciliation? If he is defeated, a scenario he seems unwilling to countenance, will he claim the elections were rigged and plunge the country back into violence? Despite considerable efforts to demobilise the 200,000 soldiers before election day, both sides have kept back armed forces and secret arms caches as an insurance policy. Mr Savimbi in his harsh campaign style has emerged as an aggressive authoritarian. Widespread human rights allegations made by top-ranking Unita defectors that Mr Savimbi personally oversaw burnings, killings and torture of internal dissidents are impossible to verify but have permanently tarnished his image. Mr Savimbi's inflammatory campaign rhetoric, his claim that he can lose the elections only if they are rigged, and his veiled threats against 'half-castes', whites and foreigners, have only served to increase fears about his post-electoral behaviour, particularly among Angolan intellectuals and the 40 per cent of the population living in the cities who were under MPLA control throughout the war. In private, and among western diplomats, however, Mr Savimbi has shown a more conciliatory image, and has said he is prepared to accept defeat if the elections are free and fair and if most of the 4.86m registered voters are allowed to get to the polling stations. Both sides are confident of victory, but there are a number of imponderables. If the voting goes along tribal lines, as in many other African countries, Mr Savimbi is likely to win. He would draw support from his Ovimbundu tribe, which makes up 35 to 45 per cent of the country, and from other smaller tribes like the Cokwe and Ociwambo. The Mbundu tribe, which solidly supports the MPLA, makes up only a quarter of the population. But this tribal cleavage could be complicated by the urban-rural divide, particularly in the heavily populated towns in the central region like Huambo, Benguela, Lobito and Cuito. If tribal loyalties are not as strong as expected, many urban people including the Ovimbundu, who have lived under the MPLA throughout the war, could vote for the MPLA despite its poor record. The war fatigue of the population and the positive role in the transition of the United Nations and international donors have brought Angola through 16 difficult months to today's vote. Western diplomats point out that if the elections are free and fair, a defeated party which is inclined not to accept the result should know that in the post-cold war era, the international community will no longer fund a civil war, and that without foreign donors rehabilitation of the economy will be impossible.</p>

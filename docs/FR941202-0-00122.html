			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> About two-thirds of the commenters favored a random testing rate of 25 percent or less. These commenters argued that the drug problem is not as widespread as originally believed, and that a 25 percent rate would provide substantial savings while maintaining a serious deterrent effect. Many focused on the cost of the current program and argued that the savings from reducing the incremental number of tests and associated non-productive time would be significant. Others took a broader view and noted that other types of tests, training and education were also deterrents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over a dozen commenters supported the current minimum 50 percent random testing rate. They argued that a decrease in the testing rate would increase recreational drug use and undermine the deterrent purpose of the program. Several stated that the data were inadequate to justify a reduction and that costs would not drop because the lower volume would result in higher per test costs. Others took an ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it'' attitude. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters argued that the rate should be increased. These commenters stated that a greater perception of getting caught would result in less drug use. One noted that at a 50 percent testing rate, some employees are never tested while others are tested two or more times per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In terms of a triggering group, most favored an industry-wide approach. There was some support for setting the rate by job categories tempered by the concern that such differentiation not be arbitrary. A few commenters suggested that employers should have flexibility to set the rate at whatever level they thought best, based on their own past experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department held a public meeting on technical issues related to workplace random testing in Washington, DC, on February 1 and 2, 1993. The meeting, which included presentations by experts from federal agencies, the military, academia, and private industry, was attended by over 200 people. Transcripts of the meeting are included in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on February 15, 1994, (59 FR 7614). The NPRM proposed that the random testing rate could be lowered to 25 percent by an operating administration if the industry-wide random positive rate were less than 1.0 percent for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. The rate would increase back to 50 percent if the industry random positive rate were 1.0 percent or higher for any entire subsequent calendar year. Under the proposal, it was possible that different industries would be subject to different rates in a given calendar year. The NPRM asked for comment on a variety of ways to fine tune this basic approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM also proposed that each year each Administrator (or Commandant of the Coast Guard) would publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the minimum required percentage for random testing of covered employees during the calendar year following publication. Any random testing rate change indicated by industry performance would then occur at the beginning of that calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, the Administrator's decision to authorize a decrease (or to require a return to the 50 percent rate) would be based on the overall positive rate in the industry. The primary source of data would be the Management Information System (MIS) reports from covered employers submitted to the individual operating administrations. For the aviation and rail industries, for years prior to the MIS reports, we proposed initially to rely on the data submitted under reporting requirements that have been in place since FAA's and FRA's random drug testing rules were originally issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM proposed that, if a given covered employee were subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee would be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's safety-sensitive functions. Similarly, the NPRM provided that if an employer were required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer could either establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing covered employees subject to testing at the same required rate, or establish one pool for testing all covered employees at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal included several provisions to provide employers greater flexibility or to provide greater clarity. In addition, RSPA and USCG proposed minor amendments to conform their rule to the Departmental system and eliminate unnecessary provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments to the NPRM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were approximately 70 comments filed. (Some commenters filed identical, or very similar, comments in different dockets or several times during the rulemaking.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

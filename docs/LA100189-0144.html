			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO RECALL  </P> <P> We hold no brief for City Councilman (Robert A.) Curtis of Mission Viejo, but  we do resent the fact that the Mission Viejo Co., William Lyon Co. and Baldwin  Co. are trying to buy his recall with money and a paid political consultant.  All these companies are interested in is profit, and they'll let no one stand  in their way.  </P> <P> It's bad enough that every hill and gully in Mission Viejo is covered with  their ticky-tacky houses; they only want to make it worse!  </P> <P> RAY KOVITZ  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

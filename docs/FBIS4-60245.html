			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is demanding that  Yasir 'Arafat again pledge, in writing, to keep the agreement  the parties signed in Cairo and meet all the undertakings he  assumed in the Declaration of Principles and the agreement  between Israel and the PLO on their mutual recognition .    Rabin instructed Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq to  contact Nabil Sha'th in Cairo and ask that 'Arafat clarify the  remarks he made in Johannesburg several days ago. 'Arafat had  said that he does not intend to honor the agreement, following  the example of Prophet Muhammad in the agreement he made with  the Quiraish Tribe.    'Arafat's remarks were aired on Qol Yisra'el yesterday and  caused great anger at the prime minister's bureau. [passage  omitted]    Coming out of yesterday's cabinet session, Israeli ministers  expressed concern over the situation in the Palestinian  self-administration.    Minister Amnon Rubinstein expressed the hope that the PLO  leader will find the time to deal with the important issues and  will stop his globe-trotting in order to deal with the self-rule.    Minister Yosi Sarid spoke in the Palestinians' behalf,  saying  that one cannot expect them to seize control of the security  situation in the Gaza Strip, especially in view of the fact that  Israel did not manage to control the events there in its 27  years of rule.    [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 23 May carries a report on  page 2 by Hemi Shalev and Shefi Gabay, adding: "Israel has  decided to freeze the next stage of the peace talks with the  Palestinians until the situation in the Gaza Strip stabilizes  and until there is proof that the Palestinians are able to  handle security matters in the areas under their control. This  was reported by senior political sources in Jerusalem last  night." The report adds, however, that government officials  "are impressed by the Palestinian commanders' seriousness and by  what appears to be an attempt on their part to deal with the  centers of terror."]    After the session, cabinet ministers added that Prime  Minister Rabin's remark that the murder of Israelis in the  territories is the result of the Israeli occupation is a very  extreme utterance and has never been said before by any Israeli  prime minister.    In other words, the ministers were amazed by the remark and  said they would never even consider making such a sweeping  statement.    Minister Shim'on Shetrit said that the Israelis who are  still  being hurt by Palestinians are neither the victims of peace nor  the victims of Israel's rule over a foreign nation; rather, they  are the victims of the PLO's and 'Arafat's failure to fulfill  their commitments and the agreement they had signed.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A SWORD HELPED PROTECT FAMED MUSICAL BOND;  </P> <P> O.C. MUSIC: THE GILBERT AND SULLIVAN RELATIONSHIP SEEMED NEAR AN END WHEN FATE  INTERVENED AS A JAPANESE BLADE FELL.  </P> <P> By one of those ironies that would fit right into their own comic operas,  Gilbert and Sullivan wrote what would become their most popular work -- "The  Mikado" -- just when their famous partnership seemed on the verge of breaking  up.  </P> <P> After the uncharacteristically modest success of their "Princess Ida," Sullivan  had become ill. Also, prompted in part by well-intentioned friends who urged  him to write oratorios and operas, he declared that he didn't want to write  another comic work.  </P> <P> Gilbert, for his part, didn't have any new ideas and suggested another version  of a plot that Sullivan had long rejected -- in which one person would become  another character by means of a charm or "lozenge." Sullivan wrote in his  letters that he felt the idea was an impossibly "unreal and artificial  concept." The two men exchanged what seemed to be parting shots in letters on  May 3 and 4, 1884.  </P> <P> Still, they both faced contractual obligations to produce something for  impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, who had created the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company  to stage their works. Then, the story goes, fate intervened. A Japanese sword  hanging in Gilbert's study fell off the wall and conjured up a whole  topsy-turvy world in his mind. Within four days, he sketched out a summary of a  new "Japanese" opera and sent it to Sullivan, who replied immediately with his  "inexpressible relief" at "a plot without the supernatural and improbable."  </P> <P> The partnership was on course again.  </P> <P> First produced in 1885, "The Mikado, Or the Town of Titipu" ran for nearly two  years -- 672 performances -- the longest run of any of the Savoy operas.  </P> <P> Although Gilbert credited inspiration to the sword (which was used as a stage  prop in the first production), the crusty librettist, as usual, enjoyed the  opportunity to parody yet another extravagant social vogue in Britain, this one  for japonaiserie. Japanese fans, wickerwork and knickknacks could be seen in  every fashionable drawing room.  </P> <P> Gilbert took advantage of the Japanese Exhibition in London in 1884, where he  found a geisha girl ("her English was limited to 'sixpence, please,' " he  remarked) to take along to the Savoy rehearsals to teach the cast Japanese  "deportment." She taught the women how to dress, make up and move with the  quick, shuffling steps appropriate to ladies in kimonos. She instructed both  the men and women in manipulating the large, ornate fans that became a feature  of the opera, adding flair to every mood and gesture.  </P> <P> In summary, the plot of "The Mikado" may sound more grim and bloodthirsty than  it actually is.  </P> <P> Nanki-Poo, the son of the Mikado, or Emperor of Japan, has disguised himself as  a wandering minstrel to escape the attentions of Katisha, an elderly lady  determined to marry him. He is in love with Yum-Yum, a beautiful schoolgirl,  but she is engaged to her ward, Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner of the town of  Titipu.  </P> <P> Because there has not been a recent execution in Titipu, the Mikado threatens  to demote the city to the status of a village unless an execution is carried  out forthwith. The love-thwarted Nanki-Poo volunteers to be the victim --  provided he can marry Yum-Yum first and spend a month with her. Ko-Ko agrees.  But before the plan can be carried out, the Mikado arrives, with Katisha. . . .  Naturally, all the muddles and puzzles are worked out and the two young lovers  are united. At the end, in fact, everyone is more or less happy with his or her  lot.  </P> <P> Gilbert rewrote the plot 11 times. Sullivan began composing the music shortly  before Christmas, 1884. The first thing he wrote -- in one day -- was "Three  Little Maids From School." He composed "The Flowers That Bloom in the Spring"  one evening between tea and dinner. His diary also recounts: "March 3rd: Worked  all night at Finale, 1st Act. Finished at 5 a.m. 63 pages of score at one  sitting."  </P> <P> The popularity of the piece led other people to attempt their own productions.  To forestall one such production in New York, Carte secretly sent a small cast  to open "The Mikado" at the Fifth Avenue Theater on Broadway a week before his  American competition mounted a production in August, 1885.  </P> <P> The case went to court, where a Tammany Hall judge decided against the D'Oyly  Carte. Judge Justice Divver of New York City ruled: "Copyright or no copyright,  commercial honesty or commercial buccaneering, no Englishman possesses any  rights which a true-born American is bound to respect."  </P> <P> Sullivan, who was in the United States at the time, replied to the judge with  an impassioned speech from his box at the end of a gala performance. The speech  later was published throughout the United States and is credited for bringing  about revision of the copyright laws of America.  </P> <P> The American run, incidentally, lasted 430 performances.  </P> <P> So how Japanese is it?  </P> <P> "The March of the Mikado's Troops" is the only truly Japanese music in the  whole piece. It is the march to which the imperial army reputedly marched to  battle in 1868.  </P> <P> But otherwise, not much at all.  </P> <P> As the English author G. K. Chesterton wrote: "Gilbert pursued and persecuted  the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on,  exactly as Swift did under the allegory of 'Gulliver's Travels.' I doubt if  there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the  jokes in the play fit the English."  </P> <P> Still, the Japanese were worried enough to protest, albeit briefly, during the  opera's first run. And 20 years later, in 1907, the Lord Chamberlain withdrew  "The Mikado's" license during a state visit by a Japanese prince. For six  weeks, the play was officially banned. Even concert performances of the music  were banned. Helen D'Oyly Carte, wife of impresario Richard, went ahead with  her touring performances all the same.  </P> <P> Later productions were decidedly unauthorized. A Berlin version in the decadent  '20s featured Katisha arriving in an automobile, the schoolgirls in short  skirts, a Charleston in the first-act finale and Yum-Yum bathing nude at the  beginning of the second. There have been two "swing" versions, both on Broadway  in 1939 (one starred legendary tapper Bill (Bojangles) Robinson). In a '60s  television abridgement, Groucho Marx played Ko-Ko. In the '70s in London, a  "Black Mikado" introduced West Indian touches.  </P> <P> Would Gilbert have approved?  </P> <P> We know that the librettist was renowned for his strictness with the cast and  his close attention to detail. He once reprimanded George Grossmith, who was  playing Ko-Ko, for adding some "comic" stage business -- rolling over  completely on the floor when kneeling before the Mikado. Gilbert asked  Grossmith to omit the roll in the future.  </P> <P> "Certainly, if you wish, but I got a big laugh by it," Grossmith said.  </P> <P> "So you would if you sat on a pork pie," Gilbert answered.  </P> <P>  The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain will present "The Mikado"  tonight through Thursday at 8 p.m. and "The Pirates of Penzance" Friday and  Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $12 to $38.  Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

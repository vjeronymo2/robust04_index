			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ASH sharply lower at Pounds 6.55m as reconstruction gathers pace AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the electronic security company which is on the verge of selling its loss prevention side for Pounds 150m, yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than halved from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 6.55m in the six months to May 31. Mr Tom Buffett, chairman, stressed that the imminent sale to Sensormatic of the US - to be closed between Monday and Wednesday next week - was only part of the significant refocusing the company has undertaken. There was the sale of the 26.4 per cent stake in Scantronic, the security alarms maker, in April and the rationalisation and reorganisation of the core Security Systems in the UK, which was started in February. The latter was represented in exceptional charges of Pounds 4m, which accounted for a substantial portion of the decline in profits, along with a Pounds 1.1m rise in interest payable to Pounds 8.93m. The loss prevention sale kills several birds with one stone. ASH had considered a flotation 'a la Vodafone' to stymie potential bidders - its rival ADT had taken a 3 per cent stake in spring 1990 - but this came to nothing and a sale was sought. Aside from this 'defensive' function, Mr Buffett said the sale should change the market's perception of ASH as a highly indebted company liable to go the way of 'Maxwell, Polly Peck or Brent Walker'. All sterling bank borrowings would be eliminated, though dollar borrowings would remain against dollar assets, he added. The sale would realise an extraordinary profit in the second half of about Pounds 80m, give an increase of 70p in assets per share and remove 'misunderstood' finance leases from the balance sheet, another City bugbear. Mr Buffett said that also within two years, Sensormatic and ASH would be 'eating each other in Europe'; both companies would have expanded considerably and a later sale would have foundered on competition rocks. Group turnover in the half slipped to Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 97.3m), though the latter figure included Pounds 2.2m from discontinued businesses. Trading profits fell to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 21.1m) and earnings tumbled to 1.9p (7.8p) per share or 4.9p before the exceptional. Had the sale to Sensormatic gone through within the six months, ASH's half-year figures would have looked better. It has produced pro forma figures to reflect its post-sale position. These showed a sharp decline in turnover to Pounds 65.3m and, after a Pounds 7.5m adjustment reducing interest payable to Pounds 1.4m, pre-tax profits would have emerged at Pounds 8.7m. Pro forma earnings would have worked through at 3.5p, or 6.5p before the exceptional costs. Because of the Sensormatic sale and the pro forma profits, the interim dividend is lifted to 2.25p (2.07p).</p>

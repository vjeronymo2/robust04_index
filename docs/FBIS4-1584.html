			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 1 (AFP)--China has signalled that  it is ready to make concessions to sustain its  most-favored-nation (MFN) trading privileges with the United  States, a US business leader in Hong Kong said Friday. Gerald  Murdock, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong  Kong, who returned from two days of meetings in Beijing, said  the Chinese officials he met did not specify what precise steps  they might take. But he said the officials--including Li  Lanqing, vice premier in charge of foreign trade--indicated they  were "willing to be helpful," so long as the steps taken fell in  line with Chinese law.    "I don't think they'd describe it as concessions, but they  did give us the impression that they're willing to be helpful to  the (MFN renewal) process within the framework of Chinese law,"  Murdock told AFP. "I interpret that as meaning there would be  some action on the Chinese part that would make (President Bill  Clinton's) decision to renew easier," he said. Asked when China  might act, Murdock replied: "It's got to be soon. They don't  have much time left."    Clinton is to decide by June whether to maintain MFN for  China, after declaring a year ago that renewal would depend on  "overall, significant progress" in human rights. While the  United States extends MFN status to nearly all its trading  partners, many US congressmen are still in favor of revoking it  in China's case, five years after the Beijing massacre of  pro-democracy activists. Earlier this week, the US Assistant  Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific affairs, Winston  Lord, suggested that MFN might be revoked on a limited basis,  with state-owned exporters targeted.    But Murdock said: "There is a better understanding by the  Chinese side of how the US side feels about this issue, how it  should approach it and what (Washington) is looking for."    The American Chamber, with about 325 corporate members, is  in  favor of China keeping its MFN status, saying the continued  presence of US business in the country can help guarantee human  rights in the long run. Murdock and other chamber members are  to be in Washington on May 2-5 to urge legislators to support  MFN renewal, in a mission that will dovetail with a similar  lobbying effort by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy,  Chief Secretary Anson Chan.</p>

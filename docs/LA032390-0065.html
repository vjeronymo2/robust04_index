			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO AZERBAIJANIS, A TANK BY ANY NAME IS STILL A THREAT;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: ARMENIANS IN TROUBLED NAGORNO-KARABAKH HAVE PURCHASED 14 WITHOUT  GUNS AND TURRETS AS 'AGRICULTURAL TOWING VEHICLES.'  </P> <P> With their heavy armored plating and tractor treads, they may look like tanks.  With the full-throated roar of their engines, they sound like tanks. And, as  they speed cross-country at 20 m.p.h., virtually unhindered by the hilly  terrain, they certainly move like tanks.  </P> <P> But, in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern Soviet  Union, these tank look-alikes are officially designated "agricultural towing  vehicles."  </P> <P> Anticipating further troubles with their Azerbaijani neighbors, Armenians in  Nagorno-Karabakh have purchased 14 surplus T-54 main battle tanks from the  Soviet Defense Ministry and deployed at least half of them last month, the  newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya reported Thursday.  </P> <P> Although their guns and turrets had been duly removed by military workshops  before delivery to Nagorno-Karabakh, the tanks remain very formidable fighting  vehicles, able to withstand automatic weapons and even artillery fire, to crash  through walls and other obstacles and to travel easily across the territory's  difficult terrain, according to the newspaper.  </P> <P> Moreover, despite their official designation as agricultural vehicles, the  tanks have been specially equipped at the Armenians' request with reinforced  armored plating, high-power military radios and night-vision devices,  Sovetskaya Rossiya reported.  </P> <P> And, although the order was placed by the chief engineer of the agricultural  department of Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region in the southern Soviet  republic of Azerbaijan, it appears to have been approved, financed and overseen  by the road transport ministry of the neighboring republic of Armenia.  </P> <P> Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in virtual conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh for  two years, and the centuries-old enmity between their peoples has led to direct  hostilities, involving armed militias on both sides, along their common border  and in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in January. The contract for the  decommissioned tanks, originally signed in December, 1989, led to a larger  contract signed in February, but only seven of the tanks were actually  delivered before higher authorities intervened.  </P> <P> Recalling "how much concern and how much effort" went into the recovery of four  tanks that were hijacked by militiamen while being delivered to soldiers at one  Azerbaijani town in January, Sovetskaya Rossiya commented, "Even without their  guns and ammunition, these tanks could do a lot of damage to the other side."  </P> <P> In January, Armenian militias methodically attacked ordnance depots, emptying  them of everything from pistols and rifles to mortars, howitzers, anti-aircraft  artillery and armored vehicles. Azerbaijanis similarly built up large arsenals  of weapons.  </P> <P> "Both sides would clearly love to have tanks and armored vehicles," Sovetskaya  Rossiya continued, "and they are ready to go to any lengths to obtain them. . .  . The question is how they managed to do so."  </P> <P> That answer is long, involved and, as Sovetskaya Rossiya's team of three  correspondents found, often hard to believe.  </P> <P> As told by army officers assigned to sell off the Defense Ministry's surplus  equipment and material, Nagorno-Karabakh sent the chief engineer of its  agricultural department to a sales fair in December and later signed a contract  to buy 14 decommissioned T-54 and T-55 tanks, which it said were to be used to  tow agricultural equipment once their turrets and guns were removed.  </P> <P> That such tanks cost four times as much as a heavy-duty tractor, required  special fuel and lubricants obtainable only through military channels and would  still last only a few years, not a decade, was of little consequence, the paper  said.  </P> <P> "Economically, this vehicle is hopeless as agricultural equipment," an army  colonel said. "The tank consumes far more fuel than any tractor, and its 500  horsepower just does not have near the pull of a tractor with only 106  horsepower."  </P> <P> Another scam, uncovered only at the last minute, involved the shipment of a  dozen of the Soviet Union's newest tanks to a Middle East purchaser, which  would pay for them with shipments of computers and condoms. That already had  imperiled the government's military conversion program.  </P> <P> But the Nagorno-Karabakh chief engineer, R. Ayriyan, signed a $1.7-million  contract in December to buy 14 tanks and asked that they be fitted with  additional armor plating and other equipment. He later pledged to buy a total  of 40 this year.  </P> <P> The military, under heavy political pressure to convert as much of its  equipment as possible to civilian use, should not be blamed for signing such a  contract, Sovetskaya Rossiya said, noting that its original intention had been  to write an article about "how tanks are changing their profession" in a time  of peace.  </P> <P> But the intended use in Nagorno-Karabakh -- namely, the apparent development of  a local armored corps which could be used against Soviet security forces as  well as neighboring Azerbaijanis -- showed the dangers of unsupervised sale of  weapons, the paper commented.  </P> <P> "If that is conversion, what are we going to tell the Americans?" the  correspondents ask, recalling that the Soviet Union has made a major issue out  of its reduction of tank forces. "But then, what are we going to tell our own  countrymen down in the Caucasus?"  </P></p>

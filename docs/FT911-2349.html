			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Cominco faces big write-down COMINCO, the mining and metals group, continues to encounter problems with its zinc-lead smelting operations at Trail, British Columbia, and may write down one-third of the CDollars 145m (USDollars 125m) value of its new lead processing unit, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The German-designed lead smelter, an important environmental advance, was started-up at the end of 1989 but rapidly ran into operating problems. The old lead smelter was brought back into production after extensive repairs but the new unit then had to be shut down completely for major modification. In the first quarter, Cominco posted a net loss of CDollars 10.2m, or 14 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 17.1m, or 20 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 275m, against CDollars 309m. The first two quarters are normally weakest for the group since it ships concentrates from its two Arctic mines only in the second half. Teck, the Vancouver-based mining group which effectively controls Cominco, reported first-quarter profits of CDollars 11m, or 14 cents a share, down 54 per cent from a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 104m, down nearly 14 per cent.</p>

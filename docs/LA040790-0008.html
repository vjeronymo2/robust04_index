			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CONTEST TO STRESS WATER CONSERVATION  </P> <P> Ventura County is holding its first water-efficient landscaping contest to  publicize the need for water conservation.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Water Conservation Program will accept landscape entries  that are compatible with the semiarid climate and are water-efficient, said  Deborah Weinstock, water conservation assistant.  </P> <P> The judging categories will be irrigation practice, water management, plant  selection and culture, lawn type and size, overall water efficiency and  landscape design and aesthetics.  </P> <P> "If the whole thing is lawn, that wouldn't be considered water-efficient,"  Weinstock said. "But if there's a small portion of lawn with other plants that  are water-efficient, that would be eligible.  </P> <P> "The contest is an educational program to show that water-efficient landscapes  can be very, very beautiful, and we'd just like to recognize those people who  have already put them in," Weinstock said.  </P> <P> The deadline is April 27. For entry forms, call 805-654-2466 or 805-654-2440.  PEGGY Y. LEE  </P></p>

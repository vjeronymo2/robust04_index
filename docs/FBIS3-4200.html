Much of this drain of state property has taken place as  government-owned firms are partially privatised through being  converted into shareholding companies.    State Council cadres have warned that in their eagerness to  attract foreign capital to take over unprofitable state  enterprises, regional officials have undervalued state assets.    Informed sources said the teams were also investigating  allegations of corruption in the many instances in which state  assets had been transformed into the personal holdings of the  owners of newly formed shareholding companies.    The sources said a team of 30 officials was recently  dispatched to Guangzhou and Shenzhen to find out why some of the  most efficient state factories in the two southern cities had  been sold to private-sector entrepreneurs or converted into  shareholding units where Hong Kong and overseas companies held  large stakes.    The officials came from central Government units including  the National Administrative Bureau of State-Owned Property, the  State Planning Commission and the auditing authorities. In  Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the investigators said the more robust  units should stay with the state and not be privatised.    Economic sources in Shenzhen said central officials were  also  concerned about the flow of capital much of it state assets, out  of the Special Economic Zone into other provinces.    Publicly, the Shenzhen leadership has admitted that four  billion yuan worth of capital had left the zone since 1991. The  sources said, however, that internal estimates put the drain at  more than 20 billion yuan. "Much of the funds that have left  Shenzhen have been invested in new enterprises in inland  provinces," a source said.    "The authorities are worried that in setting up the new  companies, state asset have been transformed into private  holdings." [passage omitted]</p>

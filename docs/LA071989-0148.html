			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP ASKS GILLESPIE TO DENY EXEMPTIONS TO INSURANCE RATE CUTS  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp filed objections with the state insurance  commissioner today to deny any exemptions to insurance companies who have filed  for protection from price rollbacks mandated by Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp charged that insurance companies "are now trying to bury the  initiative under literally tons of paper." About 6,000 applications have been  filed by insurance companies seeking exemptions from the 20% rate rollbacks  called for by the ballot initiative approved by voters in November.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp was joined by California Common Cause, Voter Revolt, Prop. 103  Intervention Team, Consumers Union and the Center for Public Interest Law.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp also called upon Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to adopt  regulations that would eliminate "unreasonably high" overhead charges from  consumer insurance rates, throw out "self-serving" projections on future  payouts expected by insurance companies and deny insurers a profit on assets  not being used to provide insurance.  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Indonesian banks in merger discussions TWO of Indonesia's largest banks are discussing a merger in what, bankers believe, may be the first step in the restructuring of PT Astra International, Indonesia's second largest public company. The banks, Bank Danamon and Bank Summa, are the country's second and 11th largest respectively, excluding the five state-owned commercial banks. Bank Summa is part of the Summa Group which, bankers say, is controlled by the Soeryadjaya family. The family owns about 75 per cent of Astra, which is responsible for over half of Indonesia's total vehicle sales, in addition to interests in financial services, timber and agribusiness. Brokers estimate, however, that vehicle sales have declined more than 40 per cent since 1990. Last month Astra, which has a market capitalisation of Rp3,025bn (Dollars 1.5bn), announced 1991 net profits of Rp210bn, down 11 per cent on 1990. Brokers are forecasting a further 15 to 20 per cent fall in profits this year. Astra had total borrowing of Rp2,247bn (over 50 per cent short-term) at the end of 1991. 'The merger itself has not been discussed by the board (of Bank Summa). It is up to the shareholders,' Bank Summa said yesterday. It would not confirm local press reports that Summa has received a Rp100bn loan from Danamon. Bankers say a merger may be tripartite and include Universal Bank, Indonesia's 14th largest private bank and one 51 per cent-owned by Astra International. Bank Danamon's total assets are estimated at about Rp3,700bn. It had a pre-tax profit in 1991 of Rp75bn. Bank Summa, with current assets of Rp1,700bn, recorded pre-tax profits last year of just Rp3bn, brokers say. Bankers believe Summa has been hit by clients defaulting on car purchase loans and a sharp fall in the property development market. Shareholders recently injected Rp300bn into the bank to enable it to meet a capital adequacy requirement of 4.75 per cent of total assets.</p>

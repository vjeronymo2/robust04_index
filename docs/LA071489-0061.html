			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN WHO ROBBED FOR DRUG MONEY GETS 7-YEAR TERM  </P> <P> Despite his emotional pleas for mercy, a Reseda man who was charged with  robbing seven San Fernando Valley convenience stores to support his drug habit  was sentenced Thursday to seven years in state prison by a San Fernando  Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Gabor Frank Magyari, 30, stole more than $1,600  from seven small convenience stores between October, 1988, and this January.  </P> <P> Under an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to five counts of  robbery. Two other counts were dismissed, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Judge John A. Major rejected pleas by Magyari, his mother and stepfather and  his lawyer, who asked "in the name of mercy" that Major "punish the sin and not  the sinner" by placing Magyari in a long-term drug rehabilitation program  instead of prison.  </P> <P> Magyari told the judge he began smoking marijuana at age 13 and was hooked on  drugs by 20. Choking on tears, Magyari said he now wants to get a fresh start  on life by kicking the habit.  </P> <P> But Major said Magyari had exercised his "free will" in using drugs and robbing  stores. "You have to be punished. You have to learn that you cannot go through  life sticking a gun in someone's face, robbing them of their hard-earned  money," Major said.  </P> <P> Magyari probably will be paroled in about three years, Major said.  </P></p>

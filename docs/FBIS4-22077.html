			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by JORDAN TIMES Staff Reporters P.V. Vivekanand in </F> Amman and Wafa' 'Amr in Jerusalem]    [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday  denied that it was signalling a shift in its fundamental  approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict by offering to recognise  Israel in its 1967 borders and negotiate a peace agreement with  the Jewish state.    The group, in a statement issued by its Damascus-based  political office, sought to reestablish that its objective was  the creation of an Islamic state "from the (Mediterranean) Sea  to the (Jordan) River," and that recent comments made by one of  its senior leaders were misinterpreted by the media to imply  that it was willing to abandon its call for the elimination of  the state of Israel.    It appeared that the "clarification" owed its origins to  differences from within the group's ranks in the occupied West  Bank and Gaza Strip.    Islamist activists and political analysts in the occupied  territories said Hamas' leaders, fearing political exclusion at  a time when the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) are  moving towards Palestinian self-rule in parts of the occupied  lands, had rushed into making conciliatory statements in a bid  to ensure their survival.    As such, Friday's statement was interpreted as a move to  reassure those in the occupied territories who in principle  reject any recognition of Israel, whether 1948 or 1967, by  reaffirminig that there was no shift at all in the group's  standing.    Several Hamas leaders said although the conciliatory stand  was aimed at preempting isolation, it was also meant to show the  Palestinian people that Hamas was capable of achieving better  negotiating terms and a peace accord more responsive to the  Palestinians' aspirations that the Israel-PLO autonomy agreement.    At the same time, the group's leaders have to take into  consideration the opposition such a stand sparked among the  young generation of Palestinians.    "Hamas' grassroots, like all the young Palestinian  generation, are desperate for independence," a leading Hamas  figure told the JORDAN TIMES in occupied Jerusalem. "Therefore  any peace proposal suggested by Hamas' high echelon will have to  take this into consideration."    Fatah leaders who have maintained a secret dialogue with  Hamas affirmed that they were aware of a "change" in the  Islamist group's stand and welcmed it because it gave an added  momentum to demands for an independent Palestinian state in the  territories Israel seized in the 1967 war.    Shaykh Ahmad Bahar, an Islamic leader in Gaza, said the  group  was "willing to negotiate with Israel to achieve Israeli  withdrawal from the Palestinian lands it occupied in 1967 on the  basis of U.N. resolutions. But this does not mean that Hamas  has departed from its strategic goal of liberating all of  Palestine."    Friday's statement, a copy of which was made available to  the  JORDAN TIMES, echoed the same sentiment. It said Hamas was  committed to "escalating popular resistance and continuing holy  war as long as the Zionist occupation forces remain in our  blessed Palestinian land and until the liberation of all the  occupied land from the sea to the river."    It said comments made by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the  group's  politcal bureau, that a peace treaty was possible with Israel if  it withdrew from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem did  not imply any "concession to or acceptance of the Zionist enemy."    Explaining that the statement was issued to clarify the  group's stand "in view of the popular and official reactions" to  Mr. Abu- Marzuq's comments, "Which were not seen in their full  context or misinterpreted," the group said its "political  programme" called for:    -- Total and complete unconditional Israeli withdrawal from  the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem;    -- The elimination of all settlements and removal of  settlers  from these areas; (The statement did not refer to Mr.  Abu-Marzuq's call for Israeli compensation for the losses  Palestinians suffered as a result of occupation.    -- Fair, full and free elections among the Palestinian  people  living inside and outside the occupied territories to elect a  leadership which will be the sole authority to speak and take  decisions on behalf of the Palestinian people and represent  their goals and aspirations.    Here was the key departure of the group from what Mr.  Abu-Marzuq had said.    The statement said: "If Hamas manages to win the confidence  of the Palestinians, it will express and reflect the will of our  people and mobilize popular forces to achieve the full  liberation of our land."    (Mr. Abu-Marzuq had referred to the possibility of a "peace  treaty" although he did not say between whom).    According to Hamas leaders in the occupied territories, the  strategy as outlined in Friday's statement helps Hamas secure a  role in the present political process. Without such a strategy,  they said, Hamas would be left alone unable to influence the  course of political developments.    Shaykh Bahar said the political leadership of the group  outside the occupied territories has also taken a decision to  participate in elections to the self-rule institutions envisaged  under the Israel- PLO accord, but no decision has been taken on  how Hamas should tackle the PLO's domination of the autonomy  arrangements.    Shaykh Jamil Hamami, another Islamic leader in the occupied  territories, said the decision was not acceptable since  "participation in elections will give legitimacy to the  self-rule authority."    The immediate objective of the group, he reaffirmed, is to  "foil the self-rule deal itself."    Palestinian peace negotiator Frayh Abu-Middayn said Hamas  had  demonstrated political flexibility and pragmatism following the  expulsion of more than 300 of its members in December 1992.    He said Hamas' peace overtures were a message directed at  the  PLO and not at Israel.    "They are telling the PLO we will not sit at the negotiating  table with Israel. But we will have a share in the cake by  being accepted as partners by the PLO," Mr. Abu-Middayn said.    Political analyst Mahdi 'Abd-al-Hadi argued that reasons  behind Hamas' new stance were:    --If Hamas continued resisting Israeli occupation through  rejectionist stances, it will be labelled the number one enemy  to Israel and the U.S., and thus will have to pay a price it  could not afford.    -- If it drew closer to the PLO's political position and  participated in self-rule institutions, it would facilitate  implementation of the PLO-Israel accord but without granting it  legitimacy, and it would isolate the opposition inside the PLO  against participation in the Palestinian authority.</p>

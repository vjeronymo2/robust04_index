			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No electronic submissions (including fax) of preapplications or formal applications under this Program Notice will be accepted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice requests further that the ``Detailed Description of Research Work Proposed'' component of a complete grant application as established by 10 CFR Part 605 should not exceed 15 double-spaced, typed pages. This project description should include: Conceptual design and how that design relates to the program objectives; description of how the impact of the project will be maximized (dissemination); identification of the target audience(s) the project will serve and efforts planned to serve that audience; identification of the mechanisms to be used to organize and manage the project, including the rules and responsibilities, financial and otherwise, of any partnerships; clarification of the monitoring and evaluation plan, including how those plans can be used for possible project modification; delineation of the planned outcomes and how these outcomes will be assessed and reported; and discussion of the anticipated significance of the project and how this will be confirmed. In addition, formal applications need to include information that will provide the expected impact in terms of populations served and any evaluation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluations and selection processes, and other policies and procedures are contained in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605. Multiple applications are permissible; however, each application must be limited to a single project. The DOE expects to make several grants in Fiscal Year 1996 to meet the objectives of this program. It is anticipated that $1 million will be the total funds available in Fiscal Year 1996 subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Awards are expected to range from $10,000 to $200,000, with the number of awards determined by the number of fundable applications and the total amount of funds available for this program. The application guide is available from Billie L. Stooksbury and/or Marie Kitts, Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Science/Engineering Education Division/CP, P.O. Box 117, Oak Ridge, TN 37831&hyph;0117.

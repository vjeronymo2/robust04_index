			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan bids farewell to a trading house with a long tradition - Itoman was faced with a difficult choice when bankruptcy or merger loomed THE Itoman sign outside the Japanese trading house will be unceremoniously hauled away and the bubble era's best-known victim formally bid farewell tonight at a 'Sayonara Itoman' party, when the company lapel badge will be worn for the last time. At the stroke of midnight, Itoman will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, a metals trader and member of the Sumitomo group, which has rescued the trading house, once famed for opening Asian textile markets and now better known for dire speculation in stocks and French Impressionist paintings. Itoman had the choice of bankruptcy or a humbling takeover by Sumikin, which is half its size. The collapse of Itoman, which had Y1,300bn (Dollars 11.12bn) in outstanding debt, would have undermined confidence in the Japanese financial system. But the rescue meant that the scandal-tainted Itoman name would be buried, alongside the reputations of recently-departed executives. 'We either kept the name and lost the business or lost the business and kept the name,' explained Mr Shigetaka Fujii, head of textile operations and a director of Itoman. 'Of course, a lot of people felt very strongly about the change of name, but I was in favour. I still think we have a bright future.' Founded in 1883 as a fabric dealer by Mansuke Ito, whose descendants still have links with the company, Itoman began importing cloth from Britain in 1891 and opened businesses in occupied China during the early 1940s. Diversification into foods and industrial machinery were a success, but more recent excursions into golf courses and finance were a disaster. The demise of Itoman is blamed on Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, dismissed as president in 1991 and awaiting trial on charges of breach of trust, which he denies. Impatient with the slow growth of textile and foodstuff sales, Mr Kawamura turned Itoman into a property developer and art collector, paying inflated, bubble-era prices in 1989 for assets still an embarrassment to the group. Unwise investment was bad enough, but the 1,340 employees were more distressed by reports that the company had cultivated links with underworld figures. At the height of the scandal, a director committed suicide, and Mr Kawamura held out for two months against calls for his resignation. He then became the first president of a listed company to be sacked since 1982. The company's name was so stained that Sumitomo Bank was forced to mount a very public support campaign to ensure that other lenders would not call in their loans and force Itoman's collapse. A new management launched a restructuring. Sumitomo Bank had come to the rescue for the second time. It supported the trader in the mid-1970s, when the textiles business turned sour, and the relationship indicated to clients that Itoman was Sumitomo-backed. Some misguided clients even regarded the company as an investment arm of the bank. The bank says it was nothing more than a typical Japanese bank, providing some but not all needed funds and maintaining a small stake in the trader, 3.2 per cent at the close of the last financial year. However, 13 of Itoman's 47 executives in 1990 had transferred from the bank, including Mr Kawamura, who had been a managing director. Mr Fujii, 55, was not one of the Sumitomo old-boy set. He has been in the textiles trade for 30 years, and will remain head of the trading house's textile business. He is confident the grafting of Itoman on to Sumikin Bussan will make for a more interesting, if less risky business. But Japanese mergers can be messy. The strict hierarchy of the promotion system is often not flexible enough to cope with a sudden rush of fresh employees. Managers are wary of each other, jealously guarding old territory and concerned by the disruption to a carefully-planned career path. Mr Fujii says the lack of overlap between textiles and metals will be an advantage: 'We are lucky that our businesses are different, and we will be able to help each other.' At that moment, a message was broadcast over the Itoman intercom system, asking employees to go to the information office to collect a fresh brochure about their new company. The introduction makes no mention of Itoman, and the textiles businesses are described as if they have always been run by Sumikin Bussan. A time-chart, at the back of the brochure and in small print, hardly does justice to tradition of the trading house that is twice Sumikin's age. It says no more than '1993 - merger with Itoman'.</p>

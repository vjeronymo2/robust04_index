			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Fina plans Dollars 1bn joint venture with Saudi group FINA, the US subsidiary of Petrofina, the Belgian oil company, is negotiating the formation of a joint venture with the private Saudi Arabian company, Arabian Petroleum. The deal could be worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). The venture would enable Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group, to sell part of a unit which has shown disappointing profits in recent years, and secure a long-term supply contract for crude oil from Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's national oil company. However, Fina said yesterday it had been in negotiations with APC for more than two years. The group said Delta International, a Saudi-registered company, would own Fina's downstream assets under the venture, but Fina would be the operator. Fina, based in Dallas, owns two refineries in Texas - at Port Arthur and Big Spring - with capacity of 210,000 barrels a day. It also owns around 3,000 service stations in the US, as well as pipelines, storage facilities and marketing operations. Last year, Fina profits tumbled to Dollars 42m from the Dollars 125m recorded in 1990. Its turnover slipped 16 per cent to Dollars 3.3bn. For 1991 the full Petrofina group had sales of Dollars 16.6bn. The Middle East Economic Survey, an oil industry newsletter, said APC was poised to spend more than Dollars 500m for its unquantified share in the joint venture. The newsletter said the term contract with Saudi Aramco would give Fina a secure supply of 75,000 barrels a day of crude. Fina produces only a 10th of the oil it puts through its refineries, shopping around for the rest from around six sources. Petrofina shares rose BFr175 to BFr10,500 yesterday.</p>

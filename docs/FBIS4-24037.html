[passage  omitted]    As for the Rwandan interim government, which was set up at  the beginning of the wave of violence in Rwanda, it has just  taken sides. As was expected, this government has expressed  support for the French initiative through the Rwandan ambassador  in Brussels. However, Rwandan Ambassador Francois  Ngarukiyintwali, first clearly denied that there were French  troops in the government zone:    [Begin Ngarukiyintwali recording] First, I would like to  recall the allegations made by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  about the alleged presence of French troops in Rwanda.

The Rwandan Government believes that  this humanitarian and [word indistinct] action should cover both  the zone controlled by the government and that occupied by the  RPF. [end recording]</p>

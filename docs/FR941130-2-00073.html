			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to assure compliance with statutory provisions binding USAID, USAID reserves the right to accelerate the Loan only in the extraordinary event of a material breach by Nedcor of its obligations with regard to the use of the proceeds of the Loan. It should be noted that since the inception of the Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID has not exercised its right of acceleration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Objectives of the Proposed Financing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The objectives of Nedcor with respect to the proposed financing are to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Minimize the cost of financing the Loan to Nedcor, and thereby minimize its debt payments, consistent with the other objectives stated herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Minimize the ongoing administrative costs of financing the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.

Diversity of Investors and Financial Services Firms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nedcor desires to encourage the participation of minority- and women-owned and controlled investors and financial services providers to the maximum extent practicable in the financing of the Loan. To this end, Nedcor strongly encourages such firms to respond to this notice, either directly or through a consortium or some other joint venture arrangement. Nedcor also strongly encourages that all firms proposing to provide financial services make efforts to offer the investment opportunity to such minority- and women-owned and controlled investors, and to other investors who have a long-term commitment to supporting South Africa's democratic transition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Scope of Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to accomplish Nedcor's objectives, the provider of financial services will need to offer the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Market the Loan to Eligible U.S. investors and, in the event the promissory notes evidencing the Loan are denominated in Rand, market the Loan to accredited eligible U.S. investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Provide a mechanism for notification to USAID in the case of any default on the part of Nedcor, in the event the promissory notes evidencing the Loan are denominated in Rand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Advise and assist in obtaining any necessary exemptions or approvals from securities exchanges, governmental securities regulators or other institutions, and any necessary legal opinions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Provide a detailed listing and full disclosure of all fees and costs for the transaction, which must be inclusive of all legal, consulting, and management fees, and costed into the final rate/result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He  also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup  measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary  adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African  States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response  to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and  monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president  stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps  to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted]    Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the  balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative  effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction  accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa,  President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African  counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly  because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has  worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the  fragile economies of two states in the subregion.    [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that  Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by  each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated  nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far  behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not  realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson  to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the  report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the  Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on  Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we  can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned  there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the  Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the  essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end  recording]    The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville  include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in  the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the  IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central  Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the  subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state  made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads  of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be  submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place  the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to  be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen  to the president again:    [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our  problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time,  and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist  stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is  how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our  meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in  the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of  our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and  the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems,  but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way  that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I  am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which  constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Shiite terrorist who came to our country  intended not only to attack Israeli diplomatic headquarters  here, but also to poison Israelis in the Middle East as well.  To achieve this, he planned to gain access to large shipments  of beef earmarked for Israel in order to poison them with a  powerful toxic substance.    This warning was announced by the Israeli intelligence  service soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police  that Ahmad al-Maqdaf, a fundamentalist Shiite, had arrived here  a month ago.    Police Superintendent Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, director  of the National Police Intelligence Department, confirmed this  report and noted that the information was provided by the  Israeli secret service.    The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export  meat to Israel, find a way to gain access to the products, and  then poison them with a deadly toxic substance.    The consequences would have been devastating. The objective  was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their  country.    The name of the meat-packing plants are "Frigobeef," located  in Capitan Lombardo close to Artigas, and "San Antonio" in the  city of the same name.    Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing  plants and warned the managers to take the necessary precautions  by not allowing strangers on their premises, thereby foiling any  sabotage attempts.    Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private --  not government-owned -- Israeli meat-packing plant.    He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and are now  conducting inquiries. We have been informed that this Shiite,  Ahmad al-Maqdaf, intended to poison a large shipment of beef  that was going to Israel. We have apparently foiled this  attempt with the help of the Israelis. Al-Maqdaf has been  already seen in Lebanon." [passage omitted]</p>

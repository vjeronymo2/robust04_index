			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua  this afternoon made an inspection of the Beijing International  Telecommunications Center and an experimental base of the  Ministry of Railways.    Zou, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited some parts of  the telecommunications center, including a wireless and digital  optic-fiber, high-frequency system and an international  telephone exchange center.    The center, set up in 1987, is an important link in China's  national telecommunications network which transmits  international telephone, telegraph and electronic data into or  out of China.    Zou asked about the center's operation and encouraged staff  to keep China in the sector's forefront.    On his tour of the base in the Science Research Institute  under the Ministry of Railways, Zou boarded an in-trial  para-high-speed train, which will run from Guangzhou, capital of  south China's Guangdong Province, to Shenzhen, China's boomtown  in the reform drive.    The passenger train, made entirely in China, is designed to  run 180 kilometers per hour and is equipped with air  conditioning in every car.    Zou discussed technological and management issues with  engineers at the base.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ptp)": "Confusion About the Reinforcements for </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] New York/Prague--According to a senior UN official,  the Czech Republic has promised to provide a United Nations  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] contingent of 500 men for Bosnia.  However, in accordance with the government's decision, the Czech  reinforcements should comprise only 120 troops. Domestic  sources are denying the promise of greater reinforcements for  Bosnia.    UN Deputy Secretary General Kofi Annan said, according to  CTK, that 500 Czech troops should form part of the firmly  promised reinforcements for Bosnia, which will number some 4,500  men. He said this following a meeting with representatives from  the states that have troops in UNPROFOR forces.    "This information is inaccurate," said Miroslav Tuma, a  member of the Czech Republic's permanent mission to the United  Nations in New York, who took part in the talks with Annan. "We  talked about supplementing our battalion in the sector south of  Croatian Krajina and not in Bosnia," he said.    Karel Kovanda, ambassador to the United Nations, said that  the Czech Republic is indeed dispatching only 120 troops--that  is, a company--to Bosnia.    Pavel Kracmar, the head of the liaison officers attached to  the UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb, confirmed, nevertheless,  that a report about 500 Czech reinforcements had been broadcast  last week on CNN. However, Kracmar also thinks this is a  mistake. "The Czech Republic has neither the potential nor the  resources to do such a thing," he said.    According to reports from the Defense Ministry in Prague, no  such reinforcement of the Czech UNPROFOR units is Bosnia is  being taken into consideration. Such a high number could only  be anticipated in a future objective by the UN command.    The government and parliament would have to make a decision  on the possible deployment of another 500 troops in the former  Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium transforms the fortunes of a city - Kenneth Gooding looks at a smelter which may become one of the world's biggest Mr Jean-Marc Dion, mayor of Sept-Iles, remembers when his city, on the far north shore of the St Lawrence River, was dying. Once simply a trading outpost of the Hudson Bay Company, Sept-Iles boomed in the 1950s when the Iron Ore Company of Canada started mining and processing in the region. But in the 1980s its fortunes faded as the Iron Ore Company cut back. 'People were coming into my office and saying they were desperate. They had to leave because there were no jobs,' recalls Mr Dion, an energetic 69-year-old. He and the city's Industrial Commissioner, Mr Giles Dechamplain, set off to Europe to drum up new business to keep their city alive. Those European visits paid handsome returns. Today, Sept-Iles is the location of the Alouette aluminium smelter, which produced its first metal in June and is destined to become one of the world's biggest. Many other towns in Quebec, seemingly better-placed on the map because they were closer to Quebec City or Montreal, were also desperate for new industrial investment. The CDollars 1.4bn (Pounds 645m) project's construction - at the peak 2,800 were employed - has helped Sept-Iles (population 27,000) to come virtually unscathed through the recession so far. For much of the time, Mr Dion worked in concert with Quebec officials, particularly those from the Societe Generale de Financement (SGF), the province's industrial agency. Quebec has an abundance of low-cost hydro-electric power which can be distributed only relatively short distances. However, it can be exported if 'stored' in aluminium. Producing this metal consumes huge amounts of electricity - today's average-sized aluminium smelter requires as much energy as a town with 500,000 inhabitants  -so SGF has been encouraging more aluminium production to come to Quebec. Nine European and US companies made their way to Sept-Iles to investigate. Five formed a consortium to build the smelter. At that point, Mr Dion went to his friend Mr Brian Mulroney, once president of the Iron Ore Company, but now Canada's prime minister. He reminded Mr Mulroney of his promise to help, as did SGF and the Quebec-owned power company, Hydro Quebec. The Canadian government promised CDollars 90m to improve Sept-Iles harbour, the second largest in Canada in terms of tonnages handled, and another CDollars 14m for a car ferry to link the city with others on the St Lawrence north shore. The consortium got off to a bad start when Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group which was to have managed the project, dropped out. In spring 1989, VAW Aluminium of Germany took Reynolds' place. Although questions were raised about the group's lack of experience in managing big international projects, the go-ahead for the smelter was given in September 1989. The consortium's other members were SGF; Hoogovens of the Netherlands; Austria Metall and a Japanese joint-venture between Kobe Steel and Marubeni. The project did indeed seem ill-fated because at the start of 1990 a big pocket of clay was discovered on the 115-hectare site which which previously was thought to be solid rock. Faced with extra expenditure, the consortium made cuts to bring costs back within the previous budget. Positions of some buildings were changed so that the car park now sits on the clay pocket but the most important changes involved the cast house, which was simplified, and the baking furnace, where a change was made to the technology from Pechiney of France. This had a lower capital cost but cost more to operate. Mr Otto Niederhofer, president of VAW Aluminium Canada, says some important decisions had already been made when his company moved in to the consortium. The smelter would use Pechiney's AP-30 technology (the same as the state-owned group is using at its own new Dunkirk smelter in France) and that Bechtel-SNC-Lavelin would do the construction work. Eventually the smelter will employ 531. More than 10,000 people applied for these relatively few jobs - an indication of the recession gripping Canada. Most employees, who will earn about CDollars 40,000 a year, live in Sept-Iles or the local region. Mr Niederhofer points out that winters in the area are severe and living conditions are not easy, 'so it was important to hire local people who are used to this'. The consortium benefited from the recession by getting low prices on some equipment and a trouble-free construction job when the St Lawrence north shore previously had a reputation for labour disputes. There have been no attempts to unionise the smelter. The Alouette consortium is unusual because for tax reasons each of the five partners owns 20 per cent of the smelter directly. They pay equal fees to the smelter's management company, and to VAW, as the technical co-ordinator and manager of the project, and to Pechiney for its technology. Each must find buyers for its share of the aluminium produced and provide its share of the alumina, the essential raw material. The partners can buy alumina from whatever source suits them but they must swap it for material from Gove in New South Wales, Australia, which is the only alumina used by Alouette. There was an extensive training programme from early on in the project to ensure a smooth start-up - 127,000 man hours so far - which included sending about 50 people for two to eight weeks' training at VAW's smelters in Germany or to Pechiney's in France. This effort seems to have paid off. Start-up was on schedule on June 1 and has been uneventful. Mr Niederhofer says this is 'amazing' given the size of the project, the number of people involved and the remoteness of the region. Alouette will produce about 70,000 tonnes of aluminium this year and by the end of December be running at its annual capacity rate of 215,000 tonnes. The budget included most of the preparation work for a second phase to double capacity. Mr Niederhofer says the partners are 'broadly in favour' of the expansion but present low aluminium prices and uncertainties about aluminium exports from Russia are holding up this decision. Most of Alouette's metal will be absorbed by the partners' downstream activities, mostly in Europe as it is cheaper to ship aluminium from the smelter than to truck it to the US. However, SGF will retain some metal in Quebec where it wants to encourage some aluminium fabricating businesses to be set up. The partners are silent on the key question of costs. About half the smelter's costs are accounted for by electricity but they have signed a confidentiality agreement which prevents them giving details of the 25-year risk-and-profit-sharing contract with Hydro Quebec. This is linked to the market price of aluminium but with a floor and ceiling. The electricity contract also covers the second phase of the project and Mr Niederhofer says the partners are under no immediate pressure because they have until the end of 1994 to tell the power company whether they will go ahead. Of course, Mr Dion wants the the smelter to double capacity as quickly as possible. Even in its first phase, Alouette will rank as the second-largest contributor to his city's CDollars 31m annual budget. Mr Dion, a Liberal Party member, is celebrating 20 years as mayor and the success of the smelter project has reinforced his popularity. He comes up for re-election in November next year and if he stands again the people of Sept-Iles will almost certainly vote him back into office.</p>

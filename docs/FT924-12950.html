			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Sport: Heavyweight selling of a title contender - Boxing HEAVYWEIGHT boxers are 'exorbitantly overpaid.' That's what Frank Maloney says and he should know: he is promoting the Lennox Lewis / Razor Ruddock fight in London two weeks from tonight and faces having to sell 12,000 tickets at an average of Pounds 86 just to break even. 'It's the richest boxing event ever staged in Britain,' claims Maloney, who says the fight has cost Pounds 4m to stage. While that might be a lot of money for 12 rounds on an autumn night in Earl's Court, the real prize comes next spring when the winner fights the world champion. The reigning champion Evander Holyfield fights Riddick Bowe on November 13. According to many knowledgeable boxing people, Lewis is the real McCoy. 'I'm a damned sight more confident about him than any British heavyweight in my lifetime,' says Harry Mullan, editor of the trade paper Boxing News. 'Without any reservation, he's the best fighter I've seen in 20-odd years in the game.' Lewis, 27, grew up in the East End of London, the child of Jamaican immigrants. When he was 12, he moved with his mother to Ontario, Canada. 'My earliest memory of Lennox is of him being a rogue,' recalls brother Dennis, now part of his management team. 'He was always a rogue. My mother took him to Canada basically to keep him calm, because if he'd stayed in London he would have been in trouble.' Lewis won the super-heavyweight gold medal for Canada at the 1988 Olympics and turned professional almost immediately. He then decided to return to Britain rather than be lost among the heavyweight pack in north America. 'Lennox has an identity and a following in Britain that mean a lot to any boxer, particularly one with any sensitivity,' explains John Hornewer, a Chicago-based lawyer who has guided the fighter's career. As a British heavyweight Lewis, inevitably, has lived under the clowning shadow of Frank Bruno who has grabbed the tabloid boxing headlines for nearly a decade - whether losing to Mike Tyson, opening supermarkets or waving a fairy wand in a pantomime - and fights white South African Pierre Coetzer at London's Wembley Arena tonight. Lewis is quite different. For one thing, he has a penchant for 12 hours of chess as the prelude to a fight. For another, he is a 'black' black man, with a considerable following in the Afro-Caribbean community. Sensing his unusual commercial potential, his management team have appointed the RTG Partnership, as marketing consultant to the would-be champion. Clients such as the Law Society and Marriott Hotels are more usual at RTG; boxing is a whole new game. 'The first image is of an ugly street sport, with brutal men in the ring and crooks outside it manipulating them,' says Mark Thomas, who is handling the account. 'Someone like Lewis could start to change that. He's an intelligent athlete and his operation is clearly above board. He could be boxing's answer to Gary Lineker.' Not the least of Thomas's strategies is to develop the appeal of Lewis to women. The fighter's pre-fight interviews have been going to magazines such as Chat and newspapers such as Today, which have large female readerships. 'Compared with Bruno, Lewis has started from a low awareness base,' says Thomas. 'He's known to the cognoscenti but, when you have 17,000 tickets to sell, you have to go outside that audience.' No one in the camp is quite sure whether tonight's fight between Bruno and Coetzer is a plus or a minus in the strategy. What is certain is that the attempt by Bruno and veteran promoter Mickey Duff to interpose themselves between Lewis and a world title bid has backfired; Holyfield has signed an agreement to meet the winner of the Earl's Court fight at Las Vegas in April. Even the offer of a Pounds 5m package from Duff could not shake the pot. 'I'm not fighting Bruno. There's no chance. He hasn't fought anybody,' said Holyfield last week. 'I have to meet either Lewis or Ruddock. It is that simple.' Underlying the champion's 'Honest Joe' approach - bizarre behaviour in professional boxing - is the knowledge that the World Boxing Council would strip him of the title if he failed to meet a contractual defence. Lewis arrived in London from his Pennsylvania training camp yesterday out of curiousity to see the Bruno fight. He left behind an America waking up to the possibility that there might just be a British heavyweight who won't end up horizontal within a few rounds. Home Box Office, the cable TV station that will show the fight, has been promoting it as part of a trio of autumn highlights; the others are the Addams Family movie and a Michael Jackson concert. In practical boxing terms, the fight between Lewis and Ruddock could be the world championship: Mullan, for one, thinks either man can beat the lacklustre Holyfield (or Bowe, should he down the champion). Maloney admits that Lewis's early fights were matches designed to shield him from defeat, but claims that his recent contests have been against 'reasonable opponents.' Mullan puts it differently. 'Lewis looks good so far, but we haven't seen him against a really top opponent. That uncertainty is his only weakness. If Ruddock hits him full tilt and Lewis stays up, he's the business.' Lewis's handlers have spent more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 23,000) on sparring partners in the past month, bringing in former champions such as Tony Tubbs and Mike Weaver. But the stakes are enormous: a British world heavyweight champion would be a multi-million pound export industry in himself.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Hong Kong The Hong Kong stock market was bracing itself last week for a dose of bad news from today's release of interim results at HSBC Holdings, the biggest constituent stock in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. HSBC itself fell 4.4 per cent over the full week , writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. Analysts are looking at pre-tax profit rises of anywhere between 10 per cent and 20 per cent for the banking group, but there are fears that even the lowest projections may not be met following the lower than expected earnings reported by Standard Asia's Hong Kong operations last Wednesday.</p>

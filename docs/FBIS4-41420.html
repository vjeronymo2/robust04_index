			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran, 23 Jun -- The discussion of individual  points of the cease-fire agreement is proceeding extremely  slowly. The draft of the agreement was proposed by Romero  Piriz-Ballon, special envoy of the UN secretary general in  Tajikistan during the second round of the Tajik talks in the  Iranian capital. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this  from well-informed sources.    One of the leaders of the Tajik Islamic opposition, Haji  Akbar Turajonzoda --who is in Tehran at present but is not  directly involved in the talks -- explained the views of the  government opposition in an interview with ABRAR newspaper. The  opposition believes, he said, that the cease-fire must be  temporary and limited and must last just for the duration of the  talks, that is, until 27 June. Dushanbe does want a prolonged  cease-fire, because this would be in the interests of the  government. The fact is that, during the summer season the  units of the opposition forces want to bring their forces into  action.    Taking this into account the cease-fire would cause great  damage to a number of the opposition's demands: The liberation  of the arrested opposition activists, the removal of the ban on  activities of the political parties, and the closure of criminal  proceedings instituted against their representatives. In  addition, the cease-fire must be abided by not only on the  Tajik-afghan border but also on the whole of the territory of  the republic. The government and Russian troops must renounce  warfare methods with the opposition under the pretext of its  desire to combat crime. It is also necessary that these troops  should not leave their bases.    Despite all the obstacles, the opposition leader stressed,  we  want the talks to be successful. Because that is in the  interests of the Tajik people.</p>

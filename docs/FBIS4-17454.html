			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hanover (DDP/ADN) -- Uzbekistan is to open up to  the market in a bigger way. The movement toward a market  economy is to be speeded up by privatizing trade, opening up  joint-stock companies to outsiders, and granting hard currency  loans to private importers, Uzbekistan's Deputy Prime Minister  Utkur T. Sultanov said at the Hanover trade fair today.    At the first German-Uzbek economic convention he explained  further aspects of his government's reform package. Trading and  service companies will in the future be sold at a new stock  exchange which is to be established. Foreigners who acquire  more than 50 percent of a company and manufacture consumer goods  will be exempt from taxes for five years. The planned  Uzbekinvest insurance company is to insure foreign investment in  the future. There are also plans to abolish import duties from  July 1995.    The economic convention was organized by the German Business  East-West Trade Committee together with German industry's  cooperation office. The convention's central topic was barter  trade.

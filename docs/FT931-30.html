			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (17:) Castles, bunkers and carvings - Guernsey has some rich legacies. Richard Digard takes a look at two of the island's more unusual collections / History BECAUSE of its closeness to mainland Europe, the Bailiwick of Guernsey has occupied a position of strategic, commercial, naval and military importance for almost 2,000 years. Guernsey and the other islands played a leading role during that time and have been left with a legacy of earthworks, castles, forts, towers, batteries, arsenals and watch houses which underscores the intense periods of military activity lasting from the late Neolithic period to the Second World War. One of the earliest defensive sites is at Jerbourg, where a promontory fort was created in Neolithic times and later reformed during the Bronze Age. The site, one of only three similar works in western Europe, survived into the turbulent medieval period as a place of refuge for islanders and 14th century records show it still to have been important when Castle Cornet, an imposing structure guarding the capital, St Peter Port, was occupied by the French for seven years. Guernsey's Tourist Board and Ancient Monuments Committee have adopted a 'Fortress Guernsey' approach to telling the island's story and this is centred on Castle Cornet which contains five separate museums, including the award-winning Maritime Museum opened in 1991. The Channel islands were the only British territory to be occupied by the Germans in the Second World War and Guernsey is still littered with the concrete remains of the invasion. It lasted from June 1940 until May 1945 and during that time thousands of slave workers were forced to build massive defensive bunkers, gun emplacements and underground shelters. Recording that part of the Bailiwick's history has been an obsession for Mr Richard Heaume since he was a schoolboy. After the war, he rummaged for bullets and shells in the sand pits of the abandoned Luftwaffe firing range near his parents farm, which the family have owned since the 16th century. The results are the German Occupation Museum, housed in old farm cottages and visited by about 25,000 people a year. 'The museum could not be started now,' says Mr Heaume. 'The items simply are no longer in existence. I suppose I happened to be in the right place at the right time.' Islanders originally opposed his interest in what had been a bleak period. 'After the occupation, people just wanted to forget and to get rid of the remnants of occupation. I can remember entire German uniforms being used to dress Guy Fawkes guys,' he says. 'Now, however, people know that what I've done was right.' The bulk of the museum, valued by Mr Heaume at more than Pounds 2m, was salvaged from various German tunnels that had not been fully cleared after the war. He opened the museum in May 1966 when he was aged 22 and he is still adding to it - although the scarcity of items makes that difficult. Obsession of another kind is preserved at Hauteville House, the cliffside St Peter Port home where the exiled French author Victor Hugo spent 14 years writing and decorating the interior of the house with wooden panelling, carvings and wall hangings. The house, originally built in 1800 by an islander grown rich on privateering, was given to the French by Hugo's family in 1927 and continues to be administered from Paris. It remains as it was when Hugo left on November 9, 1878 and is as much one of his creations as his writings are. 'I missed my vocation, I was born to be an interior decorator,' he said after buying the property on the proceeds of Les Contemplations, a volume of poetry. Helped by local artisans, he scoured the island and beyond for antique chests, Delft tiles, silks, oriental carpets and tapestries, including four Gobelins bought in 1856. All were dismantled and then rebuilt according to Hugo's sketched designs. The result is breathtaking. 'There is not a spare centimetre of wall or ceiling which is not adorned by wood-carvings, tiles, tapestries or fabric,' says the curator, Mme Marie-Christine Lorang, who is also the French consular agent in Guernsey. One of her tasks is to co-ordinate the constant repair and renovation of the house and its unique furnishings. 'We have to limit visitors to 15 at a time and are only open for six months of the year,' she says. 'We need the other six months to carry out the restoration work.' An average of 25,000 visitors a year are wearing away what they come to see. 'Maintaining the furniture is no problem but the materials are more difficult,' she says. Some rooms have been closed because of the erosion.</p>

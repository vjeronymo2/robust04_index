			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Suharto has stressed that technology will  not yield benefits if it is only directed for scientific  purposes and not widely used for general benefit. As such,  cooperation between scientific researchers and consumers of  technology is important and an early establishment of  cooperation between the two is quite necessary. The consumers  will be able to evaluate personally the benefits derived from  the acquisition of new technology.    This was stated by Suharto in Jakarta today at the  simultaneous inauguration of a new gas-powered electron ray  machine and the exhibition on National Atomic Energy Agency  [BATAN] achievements during the Fifth Development Program.    Taking the opportunity, President Suharto urged industry to  take advantage of technological progress to increase production.    [Begin Suharto recording] The community in general, and the  industrial sector in particular, need to assimilate and utilize  new technology so that quality can be improved further and  production costs reduced. This is important in the effort to  increase the value of industrial products and creating a more  competitive atmosphere for medium-scale industries. People  should also realize that nuclear energy is another important  potential source of energy. Numerous developed nations have  benefited from the utilization of nuclear energy. We now need to  embark on the utilization of nuclear energy because our main  energy sources are only derived from natural resources, which  are not unlimited. The natural resources, which are  irreplaceable, will be depleted soon if we do not utilize them  sparingly. We should continuously strive to conserve our  natural resources. Therefore, we should acquire nuclear  technology because we need to consider the utilization of  nuclear energy. [end recording]    Minister of State for Research and Technology B Habibie  reported that the establishment of the electron ray machine,  which will begin operations soon, is for BATAN scientific  research purposes. The installation of the machine is among  numerous technologies using radiation. At the beginning, it  will be used for the production of power cable. The  U.S.$2-million machine uses technology from China.</p>

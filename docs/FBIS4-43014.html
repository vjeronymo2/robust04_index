			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given: "Bossi: Two-Year  Armed Truce With Berlusconi"]    [Text] Milan -- "[Former League ideologue] Miglio and  Castellazzi? No, they are not the problems. The last thing we  need is for someone engaged in politics to have to worry about  Miglio. The problem is [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, who is now  returning to his job selling detergent. It is he who is behind  it all. It is he who, lacking any ideals, is trying to acquire  other people's." This was the old [League Secretary] Umberto  Bossi talking, with great frankness when necessary. But this  time, after his usual "appeals against Berlusconism," he was  cautious and reasonable too, at a time when it is necessary to  define the Northern League's course for the coming months.    [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, you talk about a situation in flux.  When will a balance be reached?    [Bossi] In two years, at the next general election.    [Da Rold] What? Another general election?    [Bossi] No, take this down carefully: A balance will be  reached in two years, or at the next general election. I will  not jeopardize the country's governability. At present  governability is a common asset, an asset demanded by the  people. In connection with certain legislation, certain issues,  we will play our part to the full; we are not accustomed to  betraying the voters. But we will not jeopardize the country's  governability. [Bossi ends]    Bossi did not say so explicitly, but he made it very clear:  a two-year truce for the Berlusconi government, partly an  "armed" truce, with sharp distinctions between the League and  the other government forces, and the possibility that other  majorities could take shape in Parliament over certain  legislation.    [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi, you emphasize governability,  but at the same time you are not avoiding causes of conflict. A  "Tiziana Parenti case" is emerging over the Mafia Committee, and  you are recommending Pino Arlacchi, that is, the opposition  candidate. The other day in Da Rold Parenti called you dishonest  and a destabilizer.    [Bossi] She talks virtually like Miglio. She is like Miglio.  I am mistrustful of magistrates who engage in politics; I have a  preconceived suspicion in their regard. Be that as it may, let  us not turn this into a personal issue. I am simply saying that  it is right that the minority be granted the chairmanships of  some of the committees. Yes, of course, we have a  first-past-the-post system. Some people say that we should take  everything. But it is wrong to believe that everything in this  country can change all at once. And just consider what the  opposition is doing. It is just as well that we have the  Interior Ministry.    [Da Rold] Is it not the case, rather, that you are trying to  flirt with [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto and  the Left?    [Bossi] No, there is absolutely no flirting. What I am  saying is that we must beware of the problems that could emerge  in the streets. In other words, if anyone wants to be stubborn  about that committee, then let them. We will play our part,  then we shall see, and the country will judge who is more  democratic or not.    [Da Rold] But all this means that in certain instances --  such as this business of the Mafia Committee -- different  majorities could take shape.    [Bossi] Other majorities. In connection with certain bills,  I will defer to nobody. In other words, there are some things  that are part of the country's assets. For instance,  privatization, antitrust legislation, federalism, and  institutional reforms. I repeat: We are not accustomed to  betraying people. We conducted our election campaign on those  points, and we will play our part on those points. This,  without jeopardizing the country's governability, but saying  what we believe. Then the country will judge. [Bossi ends]    This seems like Bossi's old "stop-go" policy. He is obliged  to govern with Berlusconi, but at the same time to distinguish  himself from the great television charmer.    [Da Rold] Pardon me, Mr. Bossi. Now President Scalfaro is  challenging anyone to prove that the Sisde funds were misspent.  But those funds did exist....    [Bossi] I do not want to talk about this business. Why  should I too start demolishing everything? In these two years  there will be some major reforms to carry out. And maybe it  will occur to some people to set presidentialism against  federalism. Maybe some people want to change the electoral law.  Everyone knows on which side I will fight.    [Da Rold] But is there not an immediate issue concerning Mr.  Scalfaro?    [Bossi] Why should I demolish everything? It is possible to  talk to Scalfaro. In the meantime let him remain there,  irrespective of what emerges in his regard.    [Da Rold] These two years will be truly decisive.    [Bossi] The transition from the First Republic to the Second  has not taken place yet. It will take place when the  Constitution is changed. The reforms must be carried out in  these two years. Now the League has established itself and will  fight for the new; the battle starts now. Previously we avoided  this battle; we were in difficulties, on steep paths. Now we  are on flat ground.    [Da Rold] The League too has its problems. Let me remind you  again of Miglio and Castellazzi.    [Bossi] They are like the blind leading the blind. And, like  in the parable, they will both fall down -- on the Right.    [Da Rold] How would you describe the League at present?    [Bossi] As a force of struggle and government. Not as  Berlinguer did with the PCI [Italian Communist Party], because  he was not part of the government, but only of the patronage  system.    [Da Rold] What about the Berlusconi government hitherto?    [Bossi] A few things, some of them good, albeit obviously  only aspirins. I protest only at the fact that there was no  support for Slovenia's entry into Europe.</p>

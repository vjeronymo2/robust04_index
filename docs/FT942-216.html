			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Fairytale for Saudis as Belgium falter Presumably it is all to be found somewhere in A Thousand and One Nights. But Saudi Arabia, a team which by its own reckoning pulled off a minor miracle merely in qualifying for the World Cup, performed an even greater one here one yesterday by beating Belgium 1-0 and thus moving on to the next round against Sweden. The Saudi victory was no fluke. It was won by virtue of stout defence, fine goalkeeping and the sort of goal that comes strictly from the realms of fantasy. In the fifth minute, Owairan moved forward from the centre circle. Before him were deployed the Belgian back four and Michel Preud'homme in goal, previously impregnable in the tournament. You could have got long odds against him even reaching the penalty area. In the sort of dribble that combined much skill and balance, plus a couple of lucky bounces, he took on all four one at a time and left them for dead. The coup de grace was perfect, a delicate chip over the head of the advancing Preud'homme. And then his teammates made it hold up, unlike last week when a similar early lead against Holland was lost. The heads and legs of the back four - Al-Jawad, Al-Khlaiwi, Zebermawi and, above all, Madani - frustrated attack after attack. Even so, a more imaginative team than plodding Belgium, with so much possession, should surely have at least made it even. But Enzo Scifo, the alleged mastermind, seemed to be under the impression that all his forwards were eight feet tall, so often did he punt it high into the Saudi goalmouth. Sure, chances were missed. Josip Weber, a half-time substitute, was the prime culpit, high on two close headers and a volley all in the last 15 minutes. But Al-Deayea, now surely to be ranked alongside Preud'homme as the best goalkeeper in the Cup, was not forced into a serious save after the 64th minute when he twisted to clutch a deflected shot from Philippe Albert. When it was done, the paper confetti showered down from the upper seats and thin Arabian horns punctuated the din. And here's the interesting thing; Saudi Arabia did it without their best player, Fuad Amin, suspended after picking up two earlier yellow cards.</p>

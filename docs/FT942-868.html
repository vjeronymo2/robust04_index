			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Falling dollar offers perfect excuse to sell  -New York The bearish reaction on Wall Street to Friday's multinational effort to prop up the dollar suggests stocks could take a hammering again this week. In the hours after the intervention, the Dow tumbled 62 points to end a five-day stretch which wiped a net 105 points off the bellwether index. It was a fitting climax to a trading week dogged by concern over the dollar. The sliding US currency could make foreign investment in US-denominated securities less attractive, cutting off an important source of cash from the equity markets. It could also make imports more expensive, raising the threat of higher inflation. Most importantly, it could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates again, which would threaten economic growth and corporate earnings. The currency markets will remain the main focus for investors this morning. Analysts say the futile rescue mission only served to underscore the dollar's vulnerability. 'We need a stable dollar to hold the market together,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany in New York.

'The market right now is moving from a weak technical standpoint, not on the basis of any fundamental changes,' says Mr Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments in New York. 'In the dollar, we have found a perfect excuse to sell off.'

A wave of computer program-guided selling commenced with the opening bell and drove the Dow down 52 points within two hours. Mr Cardillo believes the programs had been set up in response to the previous session's close below the key technical support level of 3,700. To him, that suggests the market is destined to test its April lows of just below 3,600. The broad-based retreat by technology stocks last week adds credence to such a scenario. On Thursday, the decision by Mr Michael Karfopoulous, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group, to lower his short-term rating on Cisco Systems set off a chain reaction which battered the technology-laden Nasdaq composite. Even Mr Karfopoulous expressed surprise at the impact of his rather tame comments about the computer networking company. 'When one stock can cause a whole sector to move so sharply,' observes Mr Cardillo, 'it shows there are a lot of nervous investors out there willing to dump anything because of the technical erosion.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F>   [Text] China is a very important client for sales of  Orimulsion (R) and negotiations with Bitumenes del Orinoco  (Bitor), PDVSA's [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] marketing  subsidiary for the fuel, have been concluded with agreement on  the export to China of 5 million tons a year over the next five  years, according to Carlos Borregales, the company's director.  Beginning in 1995, the thermoelectric plant at Daga will use 1.2  million tons of the fuel.    Borregales, together with the president of Intevep  [Institute  of Venezuelan Petroleum Technology], Gustavo Inciarte, and the  manufacturing director of Venezuelan Petroleum, Otto Martinez,  explained to the Finance Commission of the Senate, chaired by  Virgilio Avila Vivas, measures taken by Venezuela to prevent  protectionist treatment against Orimulsion (the United Kingdom)  and reformulated gasolines (the United States). The Bitor  executive was optimistic that the fuel's classification as a  natural bitumen would prevail at the Council on Customs Matters  that will meet for four weeks beginning 4 April.    The classification of Orimulsion (R) as a natural bitumen  has  an excellent chance of being approved by the Council on Customs  Matters, especially as the organization approved the technical  report last week. The thermoelectric generating fuel, a product  of Venezuelan technology by Intevep, would thus not be subject  to taxes.    About 100 countries will participate in the meeting, of  which  74 have the right to a voice and a vote, Venezuela being one of  those with the right only to a voice. According to Borregales,  the report with the technical data to support Orimulsion's  classification as a natural bitumen is being sent to embassies  for transmittal to their governments, so that they may have  advance knowledge of the material prior to the April meeting.    Venezuela will request that Orimulsion be addressed during  the second week of the council's meeting. Classification as a  natural bitumen has an excellent probability of being approved  by the 74 members of the council, among them the United States,  Japan, Korea, and several European countries that gave their  approval during the technical-scientific phase last week.  Classification of Orimulsion as a natural bitumen (code 2714) is  an important step in marketing the fuel in the old continent  without facing protectionist barriers, halting the United  Kingdom's offensive.    On 31 January 1994, the United Kingdom announced the  application of a $10 per ton tax on the fuel next June, if the  council decided to classify Orimulsion as a refined petroleum  product (code 2715). Great Britain had pressed for the fuel to  be classified a refined product during 1993, and that position  halted negotiations for the sale of 3 million additional tons to  major British electric companies.    Pressure from the United Kingdom resulted in Orimulsion's  production at less than installed capacity (5 million tons) in  Morichal. This caused losses to Bitor, said Borregales, although  the firm's cash flow last year closed in balance.    Despite British pressure, the natural bitumen classification  has majority support in the European Community because, of the  76 votes that the 12 member countries possess, 43 are favorable  to Venezuela and 33 are opposed. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal,  Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with five,  10, eight, five, five, two, five, and three votes, respectively,  support Venezuela, while Great Britain, Germany, France (10  votes each), and Ireland (three votes) are opposed.    Orimulsion exports have been growing, and while sales  reached  721,000 tons in 1992, last year they totalled 2.79 million tons  with a value of $65,676,600 at a promotional price of $23.54 per  ton. PDVSA's Business Plan 1993-2002 provides for the export of  24 million tons of the fuel during the final year, with  investments of $1.3 billion.</p>

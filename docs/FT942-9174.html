			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: La Redoute holders lose appeal over Pinault bid Minority shareholders in La Redoute, the French mail order group, yesterday suffered a setback when an appeal court ruled against them in their attempt to oppose the company's takeover by the Pinault-Printemps, retail group. The shareholders, represented by ADAM, a French minority investors' pressure group, have been lobbying against the bid, unveiled this year by Pinault-Printemps. Pinault, which is one of France's largest retail concerns, has owned a controlling holding in La Redoute with 54 per cent of the equity and 68 per cent of the voting rights, since its acquisition two years ago of the Au Printemps department store chain. However, Pinault, which came under fire from minority investors over the terms of the Au Printemps deal, recently revealed plans to buy the remaining shares. Last month it received a 'warning' from the stock market authorities over the valuation of its offer, which was otherwise considered to be fair. La Redoute's minority investors pressed ahead with their lobby against the bid, claiming that the terms were unfair only to be told yesterday by the appeal court judge that there were no grounds on which to pursue a case.</p>

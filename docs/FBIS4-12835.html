			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 14, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN  INTERNATIONAL' here Thursday commented on Iran-Pakistan ties and  said that all the official and flowery expressions of 'concrete  fraternal relations' were rich in rhetoric but poor in action.  The daily wrote in its editorial that though the two leaderships  thought alike in almost all areas, regional and international,  they moved with delay when it came to reinforcing their  economic, social, scientific and cultural ties.    The level of economic and cultural exchanges between  Pakistan  and Iran in the two years had been far from satisfactory, it  added.    Referring to Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri's visit to  Pakistan and the agreements reached between officials of the two  countries, the article hoped that the follow-up work would be  coordinated and implemented professionally as planned and the  senior officials would not get so pre-occupied with 'priority  issues' on their return home that they would forget what was  agreed upon and signed during the visit.    The paper concluded by saying that "the existing situation  is  disturbing and may damage the excellent political ties Tehran  and Islamabad enjoy. Our president and the leadership in  Islamabad should identify and address issues to promote  relations beneficial to the two Muslim peoples."</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan hopeful on Blair House Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, raised hopes yesterday that the US would agree to revisions in the Blair House farm accord to unblock progress toward an agreement in the Gatt world trade talks. After two days of meetings in Washington with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Sir Leon said the US and Europe were discussing differences over agriculture 'in a positive manner'. He declined to go into detail. Top trade negotiators from the US and EU will resume their Gatt talks in Brussels next Wednesday after their meeting in Washington this week 'defined the issues' and 'discussed viable alternatives'. Although little concrete progress was evident after Tuesday's meeting, Sir Leon said the simple fact that his US counterpart was travelling to Europe next week indicated that the talks were still alive. 'He's a busy man and wouldn't come if there wasn't something worthwhile to discuss,' Sir Leon said in Paris. France has threatened to veto a Gatt deal unless it obtains satisfaction through changes in the 1992 Blair House agreement. An EU official portrayed the high-level talks in Washington positively, but emphasised that 'considerable obstacles remain' ahead of the mutually agreed December 15 deadline for a deal among the 111 governments that are party to the talks. For his part, Sir Leon had made clear that the EU would insist on specific demands being met in the area of agriculture, the audiovisual industry and aeronautics - a reference to US objections to European subsidies for Airbus Industrie. He repeated the message in a brief meeting at the White House with President Bill Clinton. The Brussels official said both sides had instructed their senior negotiators in Geneva to seek a preliminary agreement on all dossiers in time for Mr Kantor's next visit to Brussels, probably on December 1. That would let a draft EU-US agreement be submitted to a meeting of European foreign ministers on December 2. 'Sir Leon made clear that it (Gatt) should not be a last-minute deal,' the official said. The Washington talks covered all main sectors, including a broad market access package, the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation to replace Gatt, and agriculture.

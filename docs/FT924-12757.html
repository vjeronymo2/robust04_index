			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Rebellion in S Korea's ruling party falters A REBELLION in South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) appears to be faltering after a key political figure refused to support party dissidents. Mr Park Tae-joon, the former head of the DLP's main faction, said at the weekend he would not join a new conservative political party being formed by the DLP rebels. Mr Park ignited the DLP's internal crisis a week ago when he resigned as the party's co-chairman. His resignation reflected growing dissatisfaction among the main faction supporters of President Roh Tae-woo about Mr Kim Young-sam, the party's new leader and candidate in the December presidential election. Mr Park's departure from the DLP precipitated the resignation of two dozen other senior party officials and MPs. They said they would form a new party to oppose Mr Kim, who is now the leading candidate in the presidential election.</p>

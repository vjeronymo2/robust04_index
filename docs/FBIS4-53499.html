			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Choe Won-ki] </F>   [Text] Hans Meyer, spokesman of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], said that the IAEA inspection team has  begun inspecting Yongbyon nuclear facilities and that there has  been no particular disturbance to speak of by North Korean  authorities.    In a telephone interview with CHUNGANG ILBO on the early  morning of 19 May, Spokesman Meyer said: "The three-member  inspection team is communicating normally with the IAEA  headquarters in Vienna, Austria." He said the inspection team,  which arrived in Pyongyang on 17 May and moved on to Yongbyon by  automobile, is regularly reporting to the IAEA headquarters  every afternoon about its inspection activities.    Asked about whether North Korea had begun the replacement of  fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor in question, he said:  "The IAEA's official position is that, until inspections are  completed, we would not know which is the truth as Pyongyang  asserted that it began the replacement of fuel rods while North  Korean officials in Vienna are denying this." He said no comment  could be given on the scope and schedule of inspections  "according to IAEA regulations."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bombay, Jan. 29 (PTI)--The Singapore Prime Minister,  Mr Goh Chok Tong, today described India's economic policies as  "a giant, which had remained within India" and during the last  two years has been "allowed to roam freely in the world."    This move by the Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, would  fetch India many friends, he said, adding that the "re-awakening  and embarking on a new course" was a welcome move and had  "stricken many Singapore businessmen with India fever."    Speaking at the India-Singapore Association luncheon meeting  held in his honour, Mr Goh said his country also saw the need to  invest outside.    "We looked towards opportunities emerging in Asia. While  India looked towards west, we looked towards east to forge  in-depth and lasting relationships."    He said relations between the two countries were never bad  but they lacked warmth. This visit, he hoped, would now develop  into an eternal friendship rather than in terms of dollars and  cents."    Mr Goh, thanking the Indian Government for inviting him for  the Republic Day celebrations, said his visit should augur well  for both the countries and the setting up of an information  technology park at Bangalore was an indication of his country's  participation in India's growth.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Contract ban on Samsung Construction SAMSUNG Construction, South Korea's fourth-largest construction company, has been banned from bidding on domestic construction projects for six months for its role in the nation's worst train accident in March. Samsung Construction, part of the Samsung group, is being blamed for the accident, in which 78 people died. The unusually tough penalty is a severe blow to Samsung Construction, which is heavily dependent on domestic orders. Samsung officials estimate that the construction company could lose between Won700bn and Won1,000bn (Dollars 880m to Dollars 1.25bn) in orders this year. The company last year received total orders of Won1.6bn, of which only 12.5 per cent came from overseas. Samsung Electronics has acquired Harris Microwave Semiconductor, a US specialist in chemical compound computer chips. The deal is expected to help Samsung expand its cordless telecommunications business.</p>

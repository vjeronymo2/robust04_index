			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FORSYTH, SAYLES, REYNOLDS TEAM IN 'BREAKING IN'  </P> <P> The pairing of director Bill Forsyth and John Sayles, this time as a  screenwriter, to create the delightful "Breaking In" (opening Friday at  selected theaters) seems so felicitous you wonder that it didn't happen sooner.  These are both men who know when to leave well-enough alone and when the  smallest grace note will set a scene tingling.  </P> <P> The same might be said for Burt Reynolds and Casey Siemaszko, whose pairing as  the steady old hand and the decidedly shaky new one sets the precise tone for  this smart, affectionate comedy about chemistry and larceny.  </P> <P> Dapper Ernie (Reynolds), a man for whom the action-back golf shirt was  invented, is careful about his appearance, his habits and the impression he  leaves behind. With his very slight limp and his handsome silver hair and  mustache, he might be a Portland high school principal, although his business  card says "Ernest Mullins, Sculptor." What's it supposed to say: "Ernest  Mullins, Safecracker"?  </P> <P> Ringleted Mike (Siemaszko), the goof-off at Bob's Tire and Body Shop, is half  bouncing ball, half Labrador puppy. You'd swear his tongue was hanging out as  he panted; the only thing Mike is likely to leave behind is a banana peel, with  predictable results. Ernie calls him a wacko and Ernie is rarely ever wrong.  </P> <P> They are both set to become partners in the serious business of safecracking.  With the care that he would use to case a job, Ernie sizes up the goofy Mike  and thinks just maybe there's the making of a working relationship there, since  he has recently lost his longtime partner, Red. For his part, once he really  believes that Ernie's true calling is as a master of "grease" (i.e.,  nitroglycerin), Mike is giddy with the prospect. You half expect him to get  cards printed too, but you shudder to think what they'd say.  </P> <P> "Breaking In" is decidedly minor-key, done on the notes between the solid,  expected chords. Like everything Forsyth has put his hand to, but especially  "Local Hero" and "Comfort and Joy," the humor as well as the character  development is cumulative. Forsyth is in no hurry to crank up the voltage; he's  assured enough to let the observations pile up until the audience does his work  for him, chortling when they can foresee a reaction because they understand the  characters so well.  </P> <P> And Sayles has given him gorgeous characters. Ernie's two poker cronies, for  example: Shoes (Harry Carey, who has at last abandoned the Jr. at the end of  his name) and Johnny Scat (Albert Salmi), who set their considerable experience  to coming up with the right moniker for Mike. The Artichoke Kid would be a  natural, given Mike's home town of Castroville, but there was an Artichoke Kid,  so of course that would be disrespectful. The Tire and Body Shop does it: Mike  is hereafter the Firestone Kid, and he's as pleased as a general who's gotten  his fourth star to be so called. (The payoff on this little gag is delayed and  de-lovely.)  </P> <P> There are also the ladies whom Ernie brings into their relatively sedate lives.  You and I and your smart 10-year-old know these are ladies of the evening. Mike  thinks that big-eyed Carrie (Sheila Kelley) has a thing for him. What he makes  of Delphine (Lorraine Toussaint), Ernie's statuesque regular, the good Lord  alone can fathom.  </P> <P> But even after Mike learns the truth, that Carrie is neither an actress nor a  musician -- the impression he got when she explained gravely that her acting is  "Not at performance level yet -- I'm still developing my instrument" -- he  finds her irresistible. That's pretty much our reaction too, since Kelley (seen  so far as the artistic one of the three beautiful young sisters in "Some  Girls") seems not to be troubled that the warmhearted hooker is the oldest role  playable, and chooses to make it divinely hers. As Carrie, Kelley is earnest,  impulsive, dizzyingly eager to please and deliriously funny. And she may  certainly be in demand for poetry readings, if her delivery of Carrie's ode  "What Would I Do?" is any indication. (It and other language and mores are the  reason for the film's R rating.)  </P> <P> Forsyth must have finished the film with callouses from reining Reynolds in  instead of pushing him down the path of broad reactions and least resistance  that far too many directors have encouraged in recent years. And both actor and  director should be elated at the result. It is a superb job, the equal to  Ernie's deftness with the "grease," not an ounce wasted, not an excess motion,  with the most satisfying pop to cap things off. To hear Reynolds' comic timing  when it's being calibrated to a minisecond is an absolute joy, and there are  more than one of those moments lurking here.  </P> <P> Siemaszko, whose forte is unpredictability and a certain irrepressible energy  (and whose name is pronounced Sheh-mash-ko), gives absolutely full measure as  Reynold's sparring partner. Besides, there's always the danger that Mike will  be a little more of the wacko than even Ernie expects. It gives this  luxuriously civilized movie its edge.  </P> <P> 'BREAKING IN'  </P> <P> A Samuel Goldwyn Co. release. Producer Harry Gittes. Executive producers Andrew  Meyer, Sarah Ryan Black.

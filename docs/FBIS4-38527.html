			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 25, RIA -- Today, our choice and revel  factions of the Tallinn City Assembly met with Konstantin  Zatulin, chairman of Russia's State Duma Committee on  Commonwealth Affairs and Liaison with fellow-citizens, and  Vladislav Tumanov, deputy of the Council of the Federation.    Speaking of the problem of Russians in Estonia, Zatulin said  that "it is very important to us to see that human rights are  observed not only in South Africa but in Estonia as well."    Tumanov said it was wrong of Estonia to allege that 7,000  Estonian citizens reside in Russia's Pechora district.  According to him, it has been established that there is one  hundred Estonians residing there. Tumanov believes that the  Pechora district with a population of 30,000 is Russian from  time immemorial and must remain part of Russia, no matter how  the government of Estonia may treat this. In his view, the  conclusion of an Estonian-Russian Treaty on Contiguous Areas is  the first step towards resolving controversies.</p>

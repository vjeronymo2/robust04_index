			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Indonesian military continues operation against separatists POLITICIANS, soldiers and villagers in Indonesia's western-most province of Aceh, on the island of Sumatra, say a big army operation against separatist rebels in the area is still underway, despite claims by the Indonesian authorities that the province's problems are over. Earlier this year, Mr Ibrahim Hasan, the governor of Aceh, said that the military operation against the rebels had ended and that security had been restored in the province. In March, the regional military commander said that the 18-month-old rebellion had been crushed. Officials in Jakarta have spoken recently of the area being calm. However, according to local people, including politicians and human rights workers, bodies are still being found dumped on the sides of eastern Aceh's main roads every day. It is believed that more than 2,000 people have died in the continuing violence and that most of them are civilians killed by the Indonesian military. It is unclear exactly who the rebels are or what they want, but they are understood to include a handful of former soldiers, some common criminals and a few separatists who have reawakened old independence sentiments among the Acehnese people. At least 14 people, including a university professor and a member of the local parliament, are on trial accused of subversion and plotting to set up an independent state. Aceh is Indonesia's most strongly Islamic province and it has a history of separatist movements. With huge natural gas reserves, coal and extensive forests, it is also one of Indonesia's richest province's. The rebellion has played on Acehnese resentment over the amount of the province's wealth that goes to the central government in Jakarta, and the number of jobs in Aceh that go to people from the central island of Java. Last month more than 100 Acehnese arrived by boat in neighbouring Malaysia. According to rebel sources there, they were fleeing army persecution and seeking political asylum. The Indonesian government said the boat people were just economic migrants and Malaysia, which is already host to thousands of Indonesian illegal imigrant workers said last week that it would send the refugees back home. People in Aceh say that if that happens the deportees may join the lists of dead.</p>

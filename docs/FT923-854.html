			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (12): Cost-efficiency of the corporate card - Companies can save 10 per cent of their travel and entertainment spending, it is claimed WITH THE recession biting deep into UK corporate budgets, the main players in the corporate cards market believe that their hour has come round at last. The logic is simple. For years American Express and Diners have been arguing that a corporate card is not a licence for employees to spend money but a cost-efficient way of enabling the accounts department to monitor travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) spending, detect possible delinquencies and, above all, to identify areas where savings can be obtained by negotiating bulk purchase deals with airlines and hotels. Now they believe that many companies are beginning to listen more attentively. T&amp;E is the second largest expense for many corporations after the salary bill. The sums involved are formidable. In Japan, annual T&amp;E spending is around Dollars 35bn (Pounds 17.7bn) a year, and in Britain it will be around Pounds 18bn this year. The 1991 figure reflects the impact of the recession. Budgets are shrinking. Last year the UK total expenditure for T&amp;E was Pounds 20bn. Corporate eagerness to cut spending has enhanced potential appeal of the information management functions of business card schemes. 'More and more corporations are looking closely at their expense base and trying to cut back, perhaps by booking economy tickets instead of business class or business class instead of first class. That means they want good quality information to enable them to make their purchases better,' says Mr Jim Jamison, vice-president of travel management services at American Express. Amex claims that its corporate card services, linked to its other travel facilities including its travel agency operation, can enable companies to shave between 10 and 30 per cent off hotel bills and air tickets. By itself, the corporate card scheme should be able to save companies at least 10 per cent on their T&amp;E spending. 'That implies that there is a potential Pounds 1.8bn saving in the British market alone,' says Mr Jamison. 'The link between travel services and the payment instrument is going to become more and more critical for many companies.' A separate trend in the market is that more companies these days want their on-line information, so that it can be easily integrated with other computerised cost-control operations, and fewer prefer data on paper. A related development is the steady growth of lodge card services in which a corporate charge card issuer, Diners Club or American Express, links up with a travel agency to provide an integrated service to a corporate client. Gray Dawes, a London travel agent, says that about 53 per cent of all the air tickets it sells to companies are now issued on the lodge card system. All the tickets issued are charged to a lodge card held by the travel agent on behalf of the company. 'The benefit to the client is that the lodge account improves his or her cash flow. We would normally be able to offer only 10 days' credit by ourselves. But with billing from Diners, companies can get up to 54 days' credit on average,' says Mr Ray Hopkins, Gray Dawes managing director. The client can also benefit from Diners' ability to offer worldwide facilities such as airport lounges and to supply detailed management information reports splitting up T&amp;E expenditure into cost centres and enabling companies to track the way that their staff use money and to negotiate concessions. Why use Diners rather than Amex for the lodge card? One reason could be that travel agents do not easily forget that Amex itself is the largest travel agent in the world. Amex lodge card facilities are available when customers want them. Diners Club has also made impressive progress in the co-branded card, a route which American Express (apart from cards which share branding with a bank) has so far refused to go down. By combining the Diners card with a British Airways affinity branding, clients have been provided with some impressive additional benefits which Diners Club could not have offered alone: priority wait-listing on British Airways flights, upgrades at British Airways partnership hotels and car rental discounts. 'Our aim has been to generate high volume accounts and offer multi-user card products,' says Mr Tony Stuart, general manager of the British Airways Diners Corporate card scheme. More than 500 companies, with annual T&amp;E budgets of more than Pounds 500,000, now use the card. Plans to develop it further over the next 12 months focus mainly on helping companies improve their administrative control over their T&amp;E budgets. In the longer run the British Airways Diners Club Corporate Card will be integrated into the British Airways Executive Club, offering an even greater range of enhancements. In terms of numbers of cards issued, the corporate card business is still overwhelmingly dominated by American Express, with Diners Club recovering some ground through its lucrative niche in the co-branded airline cards. In the UK, Amex's market share appears to be around 50 per cent of the total, though the company declines to give a figure for 1992, saying merely that corporate cards make up a large chunk of the 1.1m UK American Express cardholders and that even many of the personal cards are mostly used for business spending on T&amp;E. Visa business cards are making strong inroads at the lower end of the market. Company Barclaycard has been growing steadily since its launch two years ago. There are now 216,000 Company Barclaycards in circulation and Pounds 670m worth of goods and services was purchased with them last year. One advantage a Visa corporate cardholder has over those using Amex and Diners is the much greater range of outlets - 360,000 in the UK and 8.2m worldwide. By contrast Diners has 120,000 UK retail outlets and Barclaycard can streess that its use is not just confined to T&amp;E purposes: the company is pushing it for the purchase of office supplies and equipment in place of traditional petty cash advances. For Amex, charges begin at Pounds 37.50 for a personal card but drop sharply per card if a company issues a large number of cards to its employees. For a company with more than 1,000 cards issued, Amex would charge Pounds 9 per card. Larger than that and the company would probably negotiate a flat management fee.</p>

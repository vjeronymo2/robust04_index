			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Belgian action on company head upsets France A Brussels court yesterday ordered Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe Schneider, to remain in prison following a decision to confirm charges of fraud and swindling relating to two Belgian subsidiaries of the electrical engineering group. The continued detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne is expected to exacerbate strains between France and Belgium over the affair. French business leaders were shocked by the detention of the Schneider chairman, a prominent industrialist, while politicians have expressed concern about the case. Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who has been detained in Brussels' Forest prison since last Friday, faces up to a month of detention while the investigation continues. He has 24 hours to appeal against yesterday's ruling. Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman who faces the same charges as the Schneider chairman, has also been further detained. Belgian prosecutors clarified their charges against Schneider yesterday. They claim that offshore companies and assets worth about BFr4.8bn (Pounds 93m) had been concealed from regulators and shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, the two Schneider subsidiaries at the centre of the investigation. The prosecutors also charge that dividends from offshore companies belonging to the subsidiaries were not distributed to all shareholders. In all, prosecutors alleged that Schneider had received about BFr3bn at the expense of its Belgian subsidiaries. Minority shareholders in the two subsidiaries had claimed that their companies had been undervalued when Schneider launched its 1992 offer to buy them out. Schneider reached agreement with minority shareholders earlier this year, but previous legal complaints by the minority shareholders triggered the investigation by Belgian judicial authorities. Schneider said it deplored the decision to detain Mr Pineau-Valencienne, adding that it was convinced the accusations are groundless. Schneider shares, which were suspended yesterday pending the ruling, are due to resume trading today. It denies harming minority shareholders and claims that, although nominally chairman of Cofibel and Cofimines, Mr Pineau-Valencienne played no part in the management of the subsidiaries. The case has prompted concern from French politicians. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the French justice minister, described Mr Pineau-Valencienne's detention as exceptional.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Aid agencies try to make sense of refugee politics POLITICAL confusion over the future of Iraqi refugees stranded in inaccessible places along Turkey's south-east border has compounded difficulties faced by humanitarian agencies in forging a common relief policy. In the hours before the UN's announcement last night of protective zones for the Kurds in northern Iraq, Mrs Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, got her first glimpse of problems faced in the camps. Meanwhile aid officials in Diyarbakir argued over the role of the US airdrop launched last week to help an estimated 300,000 Iraqi Kurds who have fled to Turkey. The aid agencies have been told they have 30 days before the US hands over responsibility to the United Nations. Politically, the issue is complicated by Turkey's reluctance to give the refugees permanent sanctuary, and the concern of the UN High Commission for Refugees to accord the fleeing Kurds their rights under the convention on the treatment of refugees. Turkey, which is a signatory to the convention, has a so-called geographic limitation which means it does not recognise non-European refugees and is confining refugees to border areas. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday the local governor's decision to move some 20,000 to Silopi on Monday, was taken on humanitarian grounds and did not constitute a change in policy. 'These people are not refugees. The do not have refugee status. A permanent settlement should be found inside Iraq,' said the official. 'We don't care which way they go. As relief workers we want to get the refugees into places where we can realistically take over from the Americans,' said Mr Hugo Slim of the Save the Children Fund, the UK charity. The US has been emphasising that the airdrop has been a temporary operation 'while international organisations continue their preparations to assume responsibility for assistance to the refugees'. But, in advance of the expanded aid effort announced last night, many charities in the region had been concerned that Washington was ignoring the longer term relief strategy, in the rush to ferry emergency relief to the areas. The need for a longer term strategy - the object of Mr Bush's initiative last night - was underlined yesterday when the relief shuttles taking supplies from Diyarbakir to the camps had to be postponed because of bad weather and mechanical problems with some of the Chinook helicopters. US officials have made clear that the helicopter drops would not be made inside Iraq, leaving that to the Hercules C-130 flying out of Incirlik 300 miles from the Iraqi border. US civil affairs officers were yesterday in the camps trying to establish distribution networks among the refugees in a bid to avoid the chaos that has followed earlier airdrops when a number of refugees have been killed. The US is dropping 'ready to eat' meals, baby food purees and packaged water. However, once the aid agencies take over, the refugees will receive simpler fare - beans and lentils. These supplies would normally be trucked in. Yet many of the sites are at present inaccessible by road. The danger has been that the US airdrop might consolidate the existing refugee sites which relief officials believe would be all but impossible to sustain on a more permanent basis. One official said the camps would then become 'permanently inappropriate'.</p>

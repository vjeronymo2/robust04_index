			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Unpopular Measures on the Horizon"] </F>   [Text] Washington -- "The International Monetary Fund  (IMF) should establish close contacts with the emerging World  Trade Organization (WTO). We support the view that industrially  advanced countries should limit trade barriers and, from the  very beginning of this new trade era, open their economies more  to states undergoing transformation," Deputy Prime Minister  Brigita Schmognerova said at the annual IMF meeting in  Washington yesterday. Her speech was the first by a  representative of independent Slovakia at this forum. Together  with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, she  represented the group of IMF states that are undergoing  transformation.    Brigita Schmognerova said that latest experience testifies  to  the IMF's greater flexibility in relation to the need for the  social acceptability of the transformation strategy. In this  process, the IMF almost unilaterally emphasizes the formation of  a social net, however, which places great demands on budget  expenditures. These expenditures among the main causes of  budget deficits, according to Schmognerova, rather than the  subsidizing of state-owned companies. Vice President of the  European Union (EU) Danny Christophersen explained the EU  program to assist transforming states and the loan in support of  macroeconomic stabilization. According to Deputy Prime Minister  Brigita Schmognerova, Slovakia, too, will seek to obtain this  credit from the EU.    "We assume that some consumer taxes will be changed and that  the value-added tax for some products will be raised, which will  be reflected in prices. The government would have to take these  measures in the interest of eliminating the risks of the budget  management, even if it did not strive to obtain the stand-by  loan from the IMF," Brigita Schmognerova said after her talks  with IMF Executive Director William Kiekens and head of the IMF  mission to Slovakia Emmanuel Zervoudakis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has condemned the  Gaza-Jericho agreement and the Taba-Davos negotiations. He  said: They contradict the resolutions of international  legitimacy and the principles of peace based on the exchange of  land for peace, which were reaffirmed at the Syrian-U.S. summit  in Geneva.    Addressing a crowded ceremony in al-Yarmuk camp in Damascus  yesterday on the DFLP's 25th anniversary, Hawatimah added that  the Oslo-Davos agreement [as heard] is a partial and separate  agreement that gives nothing in return. He noted that this  agreement was concluded behind the backs of the Palestinian  people and their intifadah and that it is bound to fail.    'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], also delivered a  speech on behalf of the joint PFLP-DFLP command and the alliance  of Palestinian forces. Sayf Bin-'Ali also delivered a speech on  behalf of the Arab liberation parties and movements, and 'Ammar  al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau,  delivered a speech on behalf of the Lebanese national and  Islamic resistance.    The speakers condemned the Oslo and Davos negotiations and  the Gaza-Jericho agreement--which disavow the Palestinian  people's rights--and called for dropping these agreements. They  also praised the brave intifadah in the occupied Arab  territories and the steadfastness of our kinsfolk in the  occupied Golan and southern Lebanon.    The rally was attended by a number of secretary generals,  members of political bureaus and central committees of  Palestinian factions, a number of representatives of the  Lebanese national and Islamic movement and Arab liberation  movements, some members of the diplomatic corps accredited to  Damascus, and a crowd of citizens.</p>

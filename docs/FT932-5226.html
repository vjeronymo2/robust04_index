			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Increase in sugar quota helped US budget pass THE CLINTON administration agreed to an expansion of US sugar and peanut quotas in a deal to get the support of Democratic congressmen for the president's budget package. The economic package only barely passed, squeaking by with a 219-213 vote. As a result of the deal, the US will reclassify products made mostly of sugar, imported from Canada under the bilateral free trade agreement and included in the quota for sugar-containing products. A similar process will apply to peanut paste. Mr Don Parrish, an American Farm Bureau official, said the farm lobby has urged the 'reclassification' because Canadian companies were circumventing rules of origin as well as the established quota on sugar-containing products. The value of the sugar in the reclassified products could be as much as USDollars 84m. US farm groups say the expansion of the quota to other products will help stabilise US sugar prices, which are maintained by a tariff rate quota. They say the peanut paste exported by Canada is mostly made from imported peanuts through a process that does not transform the product enough for it to count as Canadian.</p>

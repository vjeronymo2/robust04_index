			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Ireland Bulls of the Irish equity market are proclaiming that the latest rise in share prices has little to do with the IRA ceasefire. The economic implications of peace - if it lasts - would be complex. A recovery in Northern Ireland asset values and increased tourism in the Republic are among the possible outcomes. While there has been no rush to upgrade earnings forecasts, though, the ceasefire has certainly been good for sentiment and helped focus the attention of international investors on favourable fundamentals. While the Irish economy was stronger than most of its European peers through the recession, growth was driven by multinationals using Ireland as a base for exports. Yesterday's results from CRH, the building materials company, show that domestic demand is now starting to take over. Against that background the market looks cheap on a multiple of around 12 times this year's forecast earnings - even allowing for the large proportion of lowly-rated financial stocks in the market's capitalisation. The lingering doubt is that a market driven higher by international capital flows must also be vulnerable to a sudden change of sentiment. A further appreciation of the Irish punt - perhaps beyond parity with sterling - would raise fears about competitiveness. Still, if peace in Northern Ireland gives international investors one less reason to take fright, the market's latest gains should be sustainable.</p>

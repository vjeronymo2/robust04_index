			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / City prosperity boosts pay in finance sector Managerial pay increases in the finance sector averaged 3.7 per cent in the first quarter compared with 2.9 per cent in the final three months of last year, says the latest survey of managerial pay published today by Incomes Data Services, the independent research body. The return of economic prosperity in the City of London was one of the factors explaining the upturn, IDS said. Of the top five managerial pay awards in the first quarter of the year in the sector, three were paid by City institutions. However, increases were mainly based on merit and performance payments. 'The basic salary budget increases for these employers ranged from 5.9 per cent to 7 per cent,' the report said. It added: 'Because these pay-bill figures include support staff, they tend to understate the actual salary rises paid to 'front office' professionals such as dealers.' IDS added that the high City pay rises were 'not simply driven by an upturn in economic activity' but also reflected 'the re-emergence of recruitment and retention problems'. Overall, private-sector managerial pay awards averaged 3.1 per cent over the first quarter. Manufacturing averaged 2.8 per cent. In a separate report on overall pay trends, IDS says there is a 'gentle upswing' in the level of pay settlements with nearly half the 129 wage settlements reported to it in April running at 3 per cent and above. But the survey suggests there are 'few signs of an inflationary spiral developing'. However, Industrial Relations Services, another independent research organisation, suggests there has been 'no further pick-up in the level of pay settlements since annual pay awards moved upward' at the start of 1994. In its latest pay survey, IRS suggests basic wage increases in the private sector were 'holding steady at 2.5 per cent' in the three months to the end of April. Management Pay Review 160.

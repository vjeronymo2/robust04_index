			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi has denied any secret talks with United  States on disarmament issue. An official spokesman in a  statement in New Delhi said that the talks between the two sides  on the issue have been open and well-known. He said London has  been chosen as the venue only for logistical reasons as it is  convenient to both the sides. He said the Indian team of  experts is led by the former Indian ambassador, Mr. N. Krishnan,  as he has wide experience of multilateral diplomacy.    Meanwhile, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has asked the  government to explain reported Indo-U.S. talks in London. The  party spokesman, Mr. K.L. Sharma, said in New Delhi today that  his party is of the view that a resolution should be passed by  Parliament on NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], stating  that the country will not compromise on the issue.</p>

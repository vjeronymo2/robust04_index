			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: McCarthy loss grows to Pounds 19m SHARES IN McCarthy &amp; Stone fell 21 per cent yesterday from 28p to 22p as the retirement home builder announced its third year of deepening losses and warned that it would be unable to pay a dividend for at least two years. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 19m, against Pounds 16.9m last time, was aggravated by exceptional charges of Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 5m). This included a Pounds 5.4m write-down on properties and Pounds 4.9m rationalisation costs. These charges offset lower interest payments of Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 13.9m). Sales for the year to August 31 were down from Pounds 73.1m to Pounds 71.4m. At the operating level, profits fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.1m. Mr John Gray, joint managing director, denied that the group was in critical condition. He pointed to the announcement that McCarthy had just completed a refinancing for a credit facility of Pounds 83m. Group debt at the year-end was Pounds 60.6m (Pounds 58.1m). During the year, McCarthy sold 938 homes, just one more than in 1991. The average selling price fell from Pounds 69,100 to Pounds 67,000. About 37 per cent of sales were at a discount to the listing price. McCarthy took a Pounds 1.2m extraordinary charge for the phased closure of its Quadrant second homes business in France. Net operating assets overseas stood at Pounds 14.1m. The intention was to reduce this and no further investment would be made overseas. Losses per share deepened to 29.3p (21.9p), while net asset value fell by 28 per cent to 81p. The absence of a final dividend leaves the total at 0.5p (1p).</p>

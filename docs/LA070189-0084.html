			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE CAN'T WAIT FOR POLANSKI, RETIRES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles judge who once vowed to remain on the bench until Roman  Polanski returned for sentencing retired Friday, saying, "I can't wait that  long," and turned in his gavel.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, the 83-year-old "judge of the  stars" whose legal career spanned 60 years, presided over Elvis Presley's  divorce, Marlon Brando's child custody battle, a paternity suit against Cary  Grant and the "Billionaire Boys Club" murder trial of Joe Hunt.  </P> <P> Rittenband, with his colorful vocabulary and outspoken style, said because of  his age it was time to "let someone else do it."  </P> <P> He has fond memories of Elvis and Priscilla Presley who came to his court for a  divorce in 1973.  </P> <P> "Elvis was a nice man," he said.  </P> <P> His memories of Polanski are not as fond, he said.  </P> <P> Rittenband issued an arrest warrant for Polanski in 1978 when the director fled  to France rather than appear for sentencing after he had been convicted of  having unlawful intercourse with a 13-year-old girl.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL GLUT AND OIL CRISIS  </P> <P> Times staff writer Donald Woutat's recent articles on the current world oil  glut and the future oil crisis were excellent (Part I, Dec. 25-27). They  accurately describe the turmoil in the oil and gas industry as well as the  problems that consumers will face in years to come.  </P> <P> The major integrated companies are taking advantage of low crude oil prices to  maximize their downstream refining and marketing profits. Although average oil  prices in 1988 were lower than they were in 1986 following the collapse of  world oil prices, average gasoline prices were higher. This helps explain the  record profits being posted by the larger companies!  </P> <P> In sharp contrast, the thousands of independent producers who produce one-third  of the United State's domestic oil and gas are struggling to survive. This is  especially critical in California where a typical heavy oil crude sells for  only $9 per barrel, below the average $9.50 per barrel it takes to produce it!  </P> <P> The severe depression in oil patch foretells of continued steep declines in  U.S. production, increased imports from unstable areas of the world, and the  future world oil crisis.  </P> <P> The petroleum industry, the state and federal governments, and energy-thirsty  consumers need to take a critical look at where we are headed. Cyclical low and  high energy prices will continue to send shock waves through our economy until  a responsible long-range national energy policy is adopted. From our  perspective, what is needed most are more stabilized oil prices that will  restore the balance of profit centers for the entire oil and gas industry. The  consumer should not be affected since as the end user he determines the true  fair market price.  </P> <P> JAMES C. (CHRIS) HALL  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Calif.

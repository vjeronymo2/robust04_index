			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Waiting for G7 The foreign exchange market will focus on the outcome of weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrial countries. In particular, there is speculation that the meeting could herald a period of co-ordinated exchange rate policy in pursuit of broader economic objectives. This would entail a committment to concerted intervention as and when required. The most likely target for intervention is the yen, which many governments would like to see strengthen as a means of capping the huge Japanese trade surplus - up 50 per cent to Dollars 78.2bn last year. The US and Japanese authorities have already co-operated in this regard, selling dollars for yen on January 17 in a surprise bout of intervention. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, added to speculation that a broader exchange rate policy may be agreed by commenting last week that a gradual appreciation of the yen was desirable. Yet the dollar, in particular, does not seem keen to obey the wishes of its would-be political masters. Intervention by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan pushed the US currency down to below Y123 for a time last week, but by Friday the dollar bulls were pushing back up to Y125. Analysts question how long even a concerted exchange rate policy by the G7 countries can cap the dollar and support the yen. Many are predicting a dollar/yen rate of Y140 by the year end, irrespective of intervention. The reasoning is that Japanese interest rates will have to come down as the economy slows, while US rates may have bottomed. The volatility of the stock market last week was clearly of concern, leading the Japanese authorities allowed money market rates to slide.</p>

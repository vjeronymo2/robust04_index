			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR-SHARON FEUD FLARES IN ANGRY EXCHANGE  </P> <P> A feud between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and hard-liner Ariel Sharon burst  into the open Thursday, and newspapers said Shamir might fire the former  defense minister from the Cabinet.  </P> <P> Sharon, now trade minister, has been challenging Shamir's leadership of the  right-wing Likud Party. He renewed attacks Thursday on the prime minister's  peace plan for the occupied territories, demanding that the Cabinet focus on  crushing the 19-month-old Palestinian rebellion rather than debating the  language of peace proposals.  </P> <P> The former general said on Army Radio: "No personal attacks or threats to fire  me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder of Jews in the land of  Israel."  </P> <P> Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Shamir, would not comment on reports in two major  newspapers, the liberal Haaretz and the independent Yediot Aharonot, that  Shamir is considering dismissing Sharon.  </P> <P> Shamir's anger erupted in a closed meeting Wednesday of Likud ministers, where  Sharon criticized the prime minister for not disclosing details of his talks  with Palestinians about election arrangements.  </P> <P> Newspapers quoted this exchange:  </P> <P> "I cannot tell you anything; you leak everything you get your hands on," Shamir  responded. He accused Sharon of "sowing bad blood and hatred among us."  </P> <P> Sharon said: "I can only laugh at your words. I have contempt for what you  say."  </P> <P> Shamir replied: "He who laughs last laughs best, and I don't want to speak to  you."  </P> <P> Several newspapers interpreted Shamir's words as a threat to fire Sharon.  Yediot Aharonot said the prime minister's allies in Likud are urging him to do  so.  </P> <P> Ahimeir suggested, however, that Shamir wants to avoid a split.  </P> <P> "The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the Likud," the spokesman  said. "He has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their  broadest sense."  </P></p>

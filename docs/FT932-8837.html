			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Swan song THE APPOINTMENT of receivers at Swan Hunter is not only a cruel blow to the warship builder's 2,200 workforce. The downfall of such a proud company and, despite last night's announcement of short-term arrangements for work on three frigates to continue, the probable end of shipbuilding on Tyneside is a sad event in the annals of British industry. Swan's demise was unavoidable. The unpalatable truth is that Britain has too many naval shipyards chasing too few orders. There is not enough Royal Navy business to keep VSEL, Yarrow, Vosper Thornycroft and Swan Hunter working. For some time, Swan has looked the weakest. What was true before the end of the Cold War - although somewhat masked by the flood of orders after the Falklands conflict - is doubly so since its passing. The UK no longer needs a vast warship industry. It is theoretically possible that these shipyards could have found more orders overseas or diversified into commercial shipbuilding. But in what are anyway extremely competitive markets - there is excess capacity throughout the world - the British have done poorly, as the industry was nationalised and denationalised within the space of two decades. While government thus bears some responsibility for Swan's plight, it was right not to ply the company with subsidies or waive commercial considerations in the award of contracts as some suggest. The Ministry of Defence had no option but to choose a Pounds 160m tender for a helicopter carrier from VSEL over a bid from Swan said to have been Pounds 50m higher. The government's error was not to have faced up to reality earlier. Its failure to do so results from allowing political considerations to influence the handing out of contracts. Fearful of the fall-out if a yard closed, it has in the past often divided work up so that all get a share. This policy has been reinforced by the mistaken belief that keeping all the yards in work and playing one off against the other would provide greater value for money. The result is that margins have been pared to a bare minimum, while the industry has lost out on any economies of scale available from concentrating production in fewer yards. Such a policy has not only prolonged the agony of a necessary slimming down of the industry, but may in the process have enfeebled the whole industry financially. Moreover, the industry's excess dependence on meeting the Royal Navy's exacting specifications may have counted against its chances of succeeding in export markets, where demand is for the cheaper, less sophisticated warships which the Germans and others have been better at supplying. May-have-beens, though, will be little comfort to Swan's workers who now face the probable loss of their jobs. The least the government can now do is to support a determined effort to help them find new ones.</p>

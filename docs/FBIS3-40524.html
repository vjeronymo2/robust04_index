			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Conversation between Taizou Terashima, President, Fujitsu </F> System Integration Laboratories and Touru Yamashita, Chairman,  Defense Technology Foundation]    [Text]Yamashita: First, congratulations on  assuming your position as president. I've heard that Fujitsu  System Integration Laboratories has very close ties to the  Self-Defense Force. When I worked at the Technical Research and  Development Institute of the Defense Agency, I met a member of  the Ground Self Defense Force who had excellent technical  knowledge. So after you retired, I was interested upon hearing  of your returning to work at this company. Beginning with the  unique technologies from Fujitsu, new civilian technologies are  introduced in rapid succession and future contributions are  anticipated in the modernization of defense systems. I look  forward to hearing your thoughts on future trends in today's  theme of ``Defense Technology After the Cold War.''    First, this is the end of the Cold War, The Defense of  Japan (1992 edition) begins by noting that ``the East-West  confrontation spanned over 40 years.'' Looking at the defense  chronology at the end of the book, we see Churchill's ``Iron  Curtain'' speech in 1946, the North Atlantic Treaty taking  effect in August 1948, the signing of the Warsaw Pact in 1955,  the unification of Germany in October 1990, and the dissolution  of the Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) in March 1991. What in  fact was the East-West confrontation? The country as individuals  or as a human society must revise its idea about what is the  ideology. This is the same as the path taken by Japan since the  Meiji Era. We are probably at the point of awaiting the  decisions of future historians and cannot ignore this as has  been done in the past. Contemporary problems also exist on the  periphery.    Terashima: Since World War II, the world has not  only advanced militarily, but political, social, economic,  cultural, scientific, and technical advances are also evident.  In addition, I believe various other elements are apparent. As  for the military in the East-West confrontation, a mutual  endless expansion of military strength continued and competition  ensued. This brought about a nuclear stalemate. Moreover, on the  Soviet side that was challenged by the Strategic Defense  Initiative of the United States, Gorbachev, who recognized the  link to collapse if the ruined domestic economy were neglected,  advocated a new way of diplomatic thought called perestroika.  This drastically altered East-West relationships. The situation  at that time was to dismantle WPO and for each NATO country to  seriously examine arms reduction. Then, the collapse of the  previous world order of two superpowers has immediately lead to  the problems of outbreaks of regional low-intensity strife  rooted in ethnic and religious problems, refugee and displaced  persons problems, United Nations Peace Keeping Operation  activities, economic stagnation in other countries, growing  unemployment, strong variety of military weapons exports to  protect defense industries, anxiety about the outward flow of  nuclear technology from the former Soviet Union, North- South  problems, and worldwide economic blocs, like GATT. This  resembles various illnesses arising when the physical strength  of the human body weakens. However, there is no cure, so won't  this unstable situation continue for now?    Yamashita: It will probably be that way as we  enter the 21st century.    Terashima: As you have stated, although each  country is groping for a new order, a rather long period is  needed until this will be established.    Yamashita: What are the spin offs, the fruits of  the Cold War era, that contributed socially and economically to  humanity? Well, first, there are the peaceful uses of nuclear  power, communications by artificial satellites, investigations  of resources, atmospheric observations, astronomical  observations, computer developments, simulators, trainers,  lightweight structure materials, large-scale high-speed  transport means (large-scale jets), lasers, milliwaves, system  engineering techniques come to mind, but interest probably arose  unexpectedly. We will probably thoroughly investigate this in  the future.    Terashima: With different objectives for military  affairs, the uses of nuclear energy and space are advances of  the science and technology in the 20th century and are  considered to be miraculous in the course of human history.  However, will the future development of epoch-making science and  technology be likely? Or instead, will current technology  advance along the lines of becoming faster, smaller, or bigger?  Essentially, there are no national borders for technology, but  this was not so during the traditional East-West confrontation.  Since the speed of the change in the era became the quickness of  sharing technology, a variety of technologies in new fields of  the future will probably appear.  <H5>  Arms Reduction That Questions the Modernization of Quality </H5>   Yamashita: Next, I would like to discuss military  affairs. First, would you explain the arms reduction plans of  the advanced western European countries?    Terashima: Every year the Defense Agency releases  a defense white paper called Japan's Defense; it has  already been published this year. By the time this conversation  appears, I believe it will be available at ordinary bookstores.  So I urge the readers to purchase and read it. I'll briefly  discuss what the white paper describes in detail.    As seen in the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation  Talks  II (SALT II) treaty by the United States and the Soviet Union  and the taking effect of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces  in Europe (CFE), the control of armaments and arms reduction is  progressing worldwide; this trend will probably continue in the  future. The United States is moving towards the total  elimination of peacetime nuclear war arms, except for the  portion loaded on airplanes, and will reduce strategic nuclear  forces to one-third in the next 10 years. The plan is to reduce  the Army which currently numbers 1.77 million people to 1.4  million, the Navy to 413 ships and 12 aircraft carriers, the Air  Force to 13.3 combat air corps. However, in this case,  maintaining adaptability, maintaining highly skilled soldiers,  and supplying and developing technologically superior equipment  are important. Attention should be paid to preserving the  attitude of not slowing the speed of modernization.    In contrast, reflecting the changing domestic situation in  Russia, the security guarantee policy is not clear. Although  long-term trends in arms reduction and arms preparation are not  clear, it's apparent that efforts are being made to curtail the  total military force of the Russian army by enacting a law to  keep it within 1% of the population (1.5 million people).  But a  note of caution is a huge Far East Russian Army exists.  Certainly, there is a substantive decreasing trend, but  qualitative strengthening and modernization trends in the army,  navy, and air force are remarkable. Based on the New War  Strategic Concept at NATO, a 20% reduction in the military  force is expected. With this as the basis, various plans are  being designed in each country. China can reduce the military  force of its army, however, every year national defense spending  is increasing significantly. This current situation is a great  deal of effort is being put into the navy and air force in  particular.    This trend in arms reduction progresses in response to the  state of affairs in the national power of each nation. Attention  must be paid so that the reduction is not haphazard. Also, the  fact that modernization will proceed steadily without lowering  quality during the reduction will not be overlooked.    Yamashita: Next, will you speak on Japan's defense  policy that is affected by new changes in the international  situation. If this addressed in the white paper, could you give  us an overview?    Terashima: Until now, Japan has maintained  suitable defensive strength as well as firmly maintaining the  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the  United States of America and a defense system to respond to  aggression in any situation. As a result, preventing aggression  beforehand is the basis of the defense policy. When defensive  strength is thought of as fundamental defensive strength,  mid-term prevention measures are decided on and the preparations  continue each year. With the world having undergone major  changes, I feel we should seriously examine whether following  the same line of thinking as before is appropriate. The Defense  Agency is probably examining the defensive military preparations  and national defense for beyond 1996. When I look at the  conditions surrounding Japan, I believe we must maintain the  concept of ``providing the required minimum defensive force and  firmly maintaining the Japan-United States security system.''  Furthermore, policies on international contributions to improve  Japan's status should be considered more. Also, even with tight  budgets, improving technology to support modernization and  providing equipment should not be taken lightly.    Yamashita: We well understand that Japan's  security system will be maintained in the future and given this  base, Japan's defense will provide and maintain equipment.  Whether you like it or not, this kind of misleading statement  probably exists. Since the arrival of Commodore Perry's ships in  1853, the occupation of the Philippines and Guam by the United  States in 1898, and the open door policy towards China in 1899,  increased concern about the Pacific Ocean regions of the United  States collided with Japan as a rising power that advanced  behind the great powers of Western Europe, then came war between  Japan and the United States followed by Japan's defeat. After  that time, the security of Japan depended on the United States.  Undivided attention given to economic recovery and today Japan  has reached the position of the second nation behind the United  States in GNP. During the Cold War, Japan supported the global  war strategy of the United States as one member on Western  Europe's side and functioned as a good partner. While spiteful  comments like Japan is a country dependent on the United States,  the mutually close relationship for over 40 years does not stop  at the governmental level. There are close ties in social,  economic, and cultural fields. However, the current situation  presents an agenda of making adjustments between governments and  conditions related to the cultural and social systems of the  whole country like the structural barriers capable of developing  interference in the internal politics of other countries and  major problems.    Although it is criticized by western European countries of  placing too much emphasis on Asia in the ODA, Japan will  continue to work earnestly as a partner of the Western Europe of  freedom and capitalism. Caution and skepticism has already  arisen in other Asian countries. So without the participation of  the United States, Japan cannot establish prospects for security  in the Pacific region. Consequently, from the perspective of  history, economics, society, politics, and diplomacy, Japan's  global partnership with the United States must be preserved. But  one point of concern is ``The Strategic Framework for Asia and  the Pacific Region'' in the white paper (1991 and 1992  editions). This is in the report presented by the U.S.  Department of Defense (DOD) to Congress in April 1990. The fifth  item describes the relationship to Japan and the importance of  supporting interoperability is extolled in the fourth item. In  terms of time, this is just after you assumed the position of  chairman of the Joint Staff Council.    According to the translation of the fourth item, ``By  encouraging maximum procurement from the United States,  increasing the back flow of technology, and avoiding as much as  possible developing systems that are not supplemented, emphasis  is placed on the importance of maintaining the interoperability  of weapons.'' People involved in research and development on  equipment for the Self Defense Force, planning for modernization  and providing higher level operation, the members of this  foundation, and readers of this magazine are probably concerned.  Therefore, the third topic will move to technology. The problem  of equipment is the problem of procurement. This is a major  concern of each company that is a corporate member. The Defense  Equipment Procurement Meeting and the Defense Production  Technology Meeting held by the Equipment Director are in the  process of examining this issue. In addition, because the Japan  Defense Equipment Industry is enthusiastically performing  research, let's skip this. I would like to hear about what would  be good to accept concerning the interoperability mentioned  earlier.  <H5>  Broad Interoperability Expected </H5>   Terashima: When Japan and the United States  collaborate on strategy, the problem of interoperability is not  important from the perspective of the rationalization of the  maintenance and operation of a defense system. So all of the  equipment should not be the same as that of the US military nor  should domestic development and domestic procurement be stopped.  The state of affairs in the Japan and the United States differ  and the doctrines on warfare differ. The physiques of the troops  also differ. As a result, our troops must be provided with  equipment suited to them. If products made in the United States  serve this need, I believe they can be used.    There is the phrase ``technology check'' should be thought  of  as being linked to checking the promotion of the development of  technology and the maintenance of technology that can be boasted  about in the world. Strength in technology is useful as  bargaining power in negotiations with foreign countries.  Interoperability is a widely known concept. The plan for the  integration related to interoperation not simply for equipment  but for doctrine, education, and training. The one-sided plan  for only using equipment from the United States is not possible.    Yamashita: Yes, that's true. I agree  wholeheartedly, but my concerns or misgivings are not completely  dispelled. Hypothetically, agreement is possible, but  specifically how is this accomplished. If I don't hear them, I  cannot be reassured.    Terashima: How will interoperability proceed  between Japan and the United States? Well, the next mid-term  defense that begins in 1996 will probably take this up. However,  this problem is not simply defense, it is closely related to  economic problems in Japan and the United States. Moreover, this  is a serious problem because the aggressiveness of the United  States may be strong. I would like a policy to be decided that  stands at the source of defense.    Yamashita: This is long in coming. Scholars,  critics, and the mass media are busy exchanging a profusion of  critiques and editorials that exchange speculations.  Unfortunately, for some reason public opinion is formed based on  this. Therefore, given the principle of democracy, public  opinion influences the government. The Defense Agency is  actively performing recent public relations activities.  Securitarian, the PR bulletin, has been well  received. The amount of information related to national defense  is minute compared to the flow through the mass media.    Returning to the discussion on technology, Mr. H. F., a  military critic, who often criticizes the Self Defense Force,  has recently written ``America's technical strategy was embossed  in FS-X negotiations. In order to continue to maintain their  country's monopolistic position, it must hold down Japan. At the  same time, high tech in Japan is integrated into the US's  advanced military system production and used as subcontracts.  Don't release our country's technology, but take what can be  taken. This is America's strategy.'' In the RIPS letter  (published 10/15/91 by the Peace and Security Laboratory),  presenting the source code of the FS-X continues to be refused.  It has also been pointed out that while the United States  regulates the outflow of military technology to Japan,  technology transfer from Japan is planned. The article  Foreign Policy (Spring 1989) from the same journal  introduced the following some time ago in a book. It stated,  ``The increase in the degree of dependence on the United States  for Japan's military technology cannot be avoided in the long  term. Nevertheless, I hope Japan's technology can be controlled  as much as possible for the security of the United States. In  contrast, major restrictions must be added when American  military technology is transferred to Japan...Strategic  bargaining with Japan will become a major external problem in  the future.'' This was an observation of Mr. Ferguson, Science  and Technology Adviser during the Bush administration. Even  though he does not belong to the current Clinton administration,  until this administration's point of view is made public, we can  only contemplate what the understanding may be.    Although I forgot the source, I saw an article that  presented  the American view that the FS-X and joint research between Japan  and the United States is not essential to the United States, but  they have meaning as symbols of future technological cooperation  between Japan and the United States. Also in decisions between  the governments related to national security, the circumstances  that led to joint development of the FS-X and details on the  decision are still not clear and are probably matters for 30  years in the future. While people in the government can find out  what they need to know, this is not the case for businessman.  Major risks are assumed with each strategic business decision.  The reason is Japan Inc. (the term used overseas to criticize  private and public Japanese organizations) must be in good  shape. Although the Hosokawa administration will severe the  union between private and public by abolishing various  regulations and plan to actively expand domestic demand, and  lower the black-ink balance, various problems remain. What do  you think will happen in technical cooperation or joint research  between Japan and the United States?  <H5>  Efforts to Check the Proliferation of Weapons </H5>   Terashima: As you stated earlier, from the  perspective of checking technology or the effectiveness of  technological power as bargaining power, the development Japan's  own technology must be continually planned. When you consider  that the Japan-United States security system will be closer and  the huge expenses in weapons development are accumulating, more  importance must be placed in the future on technological  cooperation and joint research. However, this does not mean  proceeding haphazardly. Japan's stance should be to make a  comprehensive decision on independent technological strength and  select a theme. The action program of the global partnership at  the summit between the heads of Japan and the United States  presents specific items for joint research, including the ducted  rocket engine. We should see this advance further in the future.    Yamashita: The road has opened for providing  military technology to the United States because of ``the  critical importance of maintaining effective operation of the  Japan-U.S. security system in plans for mutual technology  exchange with the United States in the defense area,'' ``the  adherence to the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,''  and ``the instrumental position in peace and security in Japan  and the Far East.'' The Diet resolution on upholding the Three  Principles on Military Weapons Export will probably be strictly  observed in the future, but today after the end of the East-West  confrontation, various countries in Western Europe have worked  diligently to export weapons without concern about its  appearance and are planning to maintain and preserve the defense  industry. This stirs up intense strife in underdeveloped  countries. The activity of the United Nations' Peacekeeping  Operation is to squelch this.    Terashima: The proliferation of weapons throughout  the world is a very dangerous problem and must be seriously  addressed. Shouldn't our country aggressively appeal to the  world and not take the passive position because it does not  export weapons? Concerning the future of Japan's equipment and  technology, I heard that serious discussions took place at two  recent meetings proposed by the Equipment Bureau director and I  expect them to be reflected in the next term defense.    Yamashita: As you stated, nothing else is so  anticipated. The North Korean missile that has a range of 1,000  km also camouflages nuclear capabilities and presents a major  threat to Japan. According to the newspapers, measures to  address this were influenced by the United States. I remember  seeing an article where the research results of Japanese  industry in early SDI research received high marks in the United  States. Indeed, what will it be in the future? Of course, joint  research not only produces joint reform and conflicts with the  Three Principles of Weapons Export, it is capable of advancing  the discussion on the principle of collective self defense.  Fundamentally, this is probably a constitutional question. I  would like the Constitution to take up expressions whose  interpretations are not understood. We have passed scheduled  time, so I would like to thank you for taking the time to talk  to us.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "U.S. Aid to the CIS To Be </F> Reduced"]    [Text] The U.S. Congress House of Representatives has  appropriated $875 million for programs to assist reforms in  Russia and other countries of the former Union in the 1995  fiscal year, which begins 1 October of this year.    This is $25 million less than planned by President Clinton's  administration. According to the administration's proposals,  Russia will receive a little less than one-half of the allocated  sum. This is Washington's new policy; in previous years it has,  on the contrary, alloted Russia first place in determining the  proportion of aid to be assigned.</p>

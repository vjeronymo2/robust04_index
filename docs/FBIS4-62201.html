			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Ambassador to Lithuania Jan Widacki </F> by Gintaras Vinickas in Vilnius on 2 May: "Jan Widacki: `One  Must Look to the Future'"]    [Excerpts] [Vinickas] There is a hope that the visit of  Polish President Lech Walesa to Lithuania and the signing of the  Lithuanian-Polish bilateral treaty will be a new beginning in  relations between our two countries. What is your view on the  prospects for such an opening?    [Widacki] The signing of the bilateral treaty was an  important moment in the relations between our two countries.  However, this was not some unexpected event, but the result of  extensive preparatory work. I suppose that the signing of this  treaty will be followed by a more rapid and broader development  of ties. The treaty ends period and begins a qualitatively new  one in our relations. It raises our ties to the European and  world levels.    In view of the new relations, one should not think about the  past -- mutual injustice and postwar grudges. Neither France  nor England, or Germany think about them. Otherwise today we  would not have either the European Union or other structures of  this continent. I repeat once again that the treaty must close  the past. One must look to the future.    By signing this document, both parties demonstrated their  maturity to join the Union. I believe that West Europe has  realized this.    [Vinickas] Signed agreements are normally subject to  ratification. What procedure does Poland have in this respect?    [Widacki] If we seek to sign an agreement, we also want to  ratify it. Each government wants this to occur as soon as  possible. According to the Small Constitution in Poland,  bilateral treaties are ratified by the president, and the fact  is publicized.    The Polish Sejm ratifies those agreements, which require  amendments in the law, or which entail financial changes.  [passage omitted]    Poland does not see any obstacles, and if it becomes clear  that Lithuania is ready to ratify the treaty, this will be  promptly accomplished in Poland. There is no threat that the  president will not ratify a treaty, which he himself has signed.    [Vinickas] Both Poland and Lithuania have people who opposed  the treaty before the signing without knowing its contents.  What would you tell those people now?    [Widacki] I think that these people speak the same language  on both sides, and they need one another. Since they criticized  the treaty without reading it, I propose that they read it very  attentively. I am convinced that people who opposed this treaty  will change their mind after reading it. I also believe,  however, that someone will try to discern things that are not  there. We already know the interpretation of one Lithuanian  politician [reference to Center Movement leader R. Ozolas] that  the treaty empowers us to return the former property of Polish  social organizations. However, the treaty does say a word about  this. He read what was not written.... I think that this is a  psychological phenomenon.    [Vinickas] The situation at the Polish-Lithuanian border is  like laughter through tears. So much has been written and said  about it.... Do you expect the situation to improve anytime  soon?    [Widacki] [passage omitted] It is difficult to say today  whether it will be easier to cross the border, let us say,  beginning in September. I think that the large flow of people  is linked with a difference in prices between our countries. A  few years ago, people would bring various goods from Lithuania  to Poland, sell them there, and return with dollars in their  pockets. The situation seems to have changed today: They are  going to Poland with dollars for shopping. I suppose that when  prices become equal, there will be fewer traders, who currently  constitute the majority of people crossing the border. The  crossing points may even be overly large in the future.    There are two border check points for cars and one for  trains  on our 100-km-long border -- such is its approximate length. No  other border of this length has so many crossings. This  situation is unnatural from the economic viewpoint.    [Vinickas] While on a visit to Lithuania, President L.  Walesa  evaded any comments on the current situation in Poland. A  general strike was announced immediately after his return home.  Even today (the interview was conducted on 2 May -- G.V.), the  situations seems to remain serious. Could you comment on this?    [Widacki] Reform and all changes demand that society express  its wishes and attitudes. Society must pay some price for the  introduction of market relations and changes.    How can one introduce market relations and protect the  community against their painful effects at the same time? One  must find the golden mean between economic requirements and  social needs. From the economic point of view, it is clear that  a mine or, let us say, a foundry must be closed down. However,  what do thousands of workers have to do? One must find the  golden mean. While searching for it, one commits many mistakes  and applies improper methods which lead to strikes. [passage  omitted]</p>

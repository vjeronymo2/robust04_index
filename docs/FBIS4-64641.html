			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joseph Mace-Scaron: "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Last Saturday [29 April],  Francois Mitterrand gathered his Elysee [office of the  president] aides apparently to reprimand those who had clumsily  suggested that the president favored the prospect of the Tapie  list confronting the Rocard [Socialist Party first secretary]  list [in the European elections]. It had to be made known that  this was all just press gossip and that it was unseemly to try  to link him to petty political operations.    What we heard, therefore, were contradicting presidential  statements. On 14 July last year, the head of state was fulsome  in his praise for Tapie, the former minister of urban affairs,  officially launching his campaign for the European elections.  Today, he scarcely admits to knowing him. So by what miracle  was Jean-Francois Hory, president of the MRG [Left Radical  Movement], received several times at the Elysee while Michel  Rocard was still awaiting an audience?    Indeed, by trying to turn the anniversary of Pierre  Beregovoy's death into an anti-Rocard and anti-PS [Socialist  Party] operation, by inviting Bernard Tapie to that ceremony,  the Elysee strategists went too far too quickly. Especially in  view of the fact that those close to the deputy for les  Bouches-du-Rhone [Tapie] did not hesitate to fully exploit this  move to the maximum extent.    And this is the rub: Francois Mitterrand has found people  who are even better gamblers than he is. He thought he could  use Tapie, but it is Tapie who has used the Elysee.  <H5>  Obliged To Be a Rocard Supporter </H5>   This is a loss of control, a badly controlled political  operation which has a high price for Francois Mitterrand: He is  obliged to say nothing until 12 June when or, if he speaks, it  will be to express solidarity with the PS and its first  secretary.    By pushing Tapie, the president of the Republic wanted to  reopen the game on the Left and give himself the means of  influencing the choice of the Socialist candidate for the  presidential election. His blunder strips him of any room to  maneuver, and he is obliged to support Rocard. From this we can  gauge the extent of his anger.</p>

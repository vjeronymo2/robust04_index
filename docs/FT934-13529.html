			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: EC research leads to practical spin-offs Sir, I would like to agree with Professor Whitty's letter (October 20) and point out that not only have the Alvey, Esprit, Race and other programmes had valuable results, they have been of benefit to at least a part of the FT's constituency: the financial community. Many in the community are becoming aware of the implications for the markets of parallel processing (much technology for which was generated through the above programmes) and are investigating it. Indeed, almost three years ago the FT carried a piece on the application of parallel computing in the financial markets: a system installed at J P Morgan in London (Technology, November 2 1990). The computer system underlying it was a commercially available product derived from the Esprit programme. Since the time of that article, parallel processing has developed somewhat, not least with the entry of leading players such as ICL, Digital, IBM and Tandem. The areas of application have also become more diverse, with a growing number in general commerce. This centre is an example of that. While it devotes a large part of its effort towards the problems of the financial community, it is also working in areas as various as planning and scheduling, marketing, management information systems, architecture and engineering. These projects, which are being carried out in close co-operation with industry, have practical, business-oriented goals. Nonetheless, many may ultimately rely for their technological underpinnings, whether hardware or software, on products derived, directly or indirectly, from the results of the above programmes.

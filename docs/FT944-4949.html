			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: National Home Loans in the black at Pounds 11.4m National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday confirmed the continuing stability in the housing market as it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.4m for the year ended September 30, against losses of Pounds 36.6m last time. It was the group's first profitable year since 1990. Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said the healthier property market was allowing the group to return to focusing on its core business of mortgage lending. NHL had relaunched its residential mortgage business in June and had already signed up 1,000 intermediaries to sell its products. Mr Perry added that the group's aim was to quadruple this figure in an attempt to re-establish its position in the mortgage market. 'There is still room in the market for a quality mortgage provider,' he said. However, NHL still faces a financial restructuring with negative shareholders' funds standing at Pounds 24.8m against Pounds 36.1m last year, in addition to Pounds 24m outstanding in preference share dividends. Mr Perry said he expected to announce details of the restructuring, which would involve a rights issue, early in the New Year. 'I think our shareholders expect us to come back for funds for this purpose at some time,' he said. Net interest income slipped from Pounds 48.1m to Pounds 45.6m. The group's mortgage assets fell 17 per cent to Pounds 1.67bn (Pounds 2.04bn). However, operating costs slid by the same percentage to Pounds 17m (Pounds 20.6m). Provisions for bad debt fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 23.8m, while the number of accounts more than three months in arrears dropped from 1,726 to 1,266. Repossessions showed a sharp decline, falling from 2,548 to 837. Earnings per share were 3.7p against losses of 43.1p last year. The final dividend, which was last paid in 1991, was again passed.</p>

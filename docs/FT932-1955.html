			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / British Steel condemns state support for European rivals THE WAR of words over the future of Europe's steel industry intensified yesterday when British Steel attacked state subsidies for its Spanish and Italian rivals and urged the European Commission to press ahead with restructuring plans. As British Steel reported its worst annual results since its 1988 privatisation - a pre-tax loss of Pounds 149m for the year to April 3 - Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the balance sheets of many continental European steelmakers were 'in ruins'. He singled out the Spanish and Italian industries as 'the worst offenders' on subsidies and said British Steel and the UK government were both 'utterly against' further job cuts in the UK. Mr Moffat's outspoken comments come a year after British Steel closed its Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland. The company said no large rationalisations were planned this year. Mr Moffat warned, however, that if state subsidies continued elsewhere in Europe, British Steel did not have unlimited funds. 'At the extremity this could bring about further job losses,' he said. The loss announced yesterday was expected by analysts. It compares with a Pounds 55m deficit in 1991-92 and profits of Pounds 733m in 1989-90 when the steel industry was booming. British Steel's shares were privatised at 125p, and have traded as low as 54p this year. But they have recently recovered, helped by US buying, and closed  1/4 p up yesterday at 98 3/4 p. The company, which has already passed its interim dividend for 1992-93, cut its final dividend from 1.5p to 1p a share. Mr Moffat warned that reinstating payouts to more normal levels would require 'a sustained recovery in profitability'. He stressed that the key to this was increased prices, which in turn depended on the EC restructuring plans. British Steel has already raised prices twice this year and Mr Moffat said: 'We will put up prices again at the first commercially available opportunity.' The main plank of the EC restructuring is a partly self-financed scheme under which companies remaining in the industry would pay rivals to cut capacity or leave the business. The EC has identified about 30m tonnes of surplus hot-rolling capacity in the Community. British Steel supports the plan, but is worried that unless subsidies are eliminated by the Commission and member states, efficient private sector producers will be forced to cut capacity further, while weaker but state-supported enterprises are sustained. Mr Moffat said the industry's problems could be resolved if significant cuts in capacity were achieved. British Steel, which had the lowest costs and the strongest balance sheet among west European steelmakers, was 'in a good position to benefit from a successful outcome'.

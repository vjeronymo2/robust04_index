			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3): The race hots up - Super carriers IN AUGUST, leaked internal documents disclosed the scope of BT's ambition to become one of the two or three 'super carriers' projected by some analysts to dominate the global telecommunications market by the end of the decade. The documents revealed the existence of a secret plan to spend around Dollars 1bn on the construction of a worldwide business telecommunications network by the year 2002. Dubbed 'Cyclone,' the planned BT network will offer leading international corporate customers voice, text, data and video services as part of a 'virtual' private network. Virtual private networking exploits special computer software to share common transmission and switching facilities between different customers. This arrangement gives each customer the considerable advantages of using a private network at a much lower cost than actually owning such a facility. Cyclone will kick off next year with the installation of large telecommunications switching centres in London, New York, Frankfurt and Sydney. BT will spend around Dollars 86m in the first year of building Cyclone. In subsequent phases, an additional 28 network hubs will be added in the biggest business centres across the globe, starting with Paris and Tokyo in 1994. A main plank in BT's super carrier strategy is the capture of a large share in the growing market for 'outsourcing' - in other words, provisioning and managing the private networks of the world's leading international corporations. Such enterprises are presently spending around Dollars 3bn to communicate with their overseas offices and subsidiaries, and the market is growing at a rate between 15 per cent and 20 cent annually. Handing over control of a company's communications function to an outside contractor is prompted by two main considerations: First, outsourcing can slash up to 20 per cent off the corporate telecommunications bill. Second, subcontracting the telecommunications function allows companies to concentrate on those activities which are, in the first instance, their raison d'etre. The notion of the super carrier, offering worldwide networked services to leading corporate users, has inhabited the pages of analysts' reports for some time now. Last year, BT attempted to kick-start the market with formation of its Syncordia global managed network and outsourcing enterprise. With headquarters in the US, Syncordia was originally intended to marry the talents of BT with those of its German and Japanese counterparts, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBT) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). The plan was that this alliance would divide up the key US, European and Asia Pacific markets between its members, offering service packages for the management of existing private networks, and the construction and operation of new ones. As well as end-to-end management and round-the-clock, multi-lingual customer 'help desks' in a number of centres around the world, Syncordia's repertoire was to be extended to include international cashless calling, worldwide private numbering and mobile services for corporate users. 'We have great ambitions for Syncordia,' said BT chairman Iain Vallance at the company's launch. 'We intend to be the leading providers of outsourced networking services and we intend to set the industry standard for those services.' The ambitions remain but the effort to expand Syncordia's ownership has not panned out as BT originally intended. Negotiations with NTT are understood to have ceased, and the likelihood is that the Japanese carrier will now only function as a distributor of Syncordia products in Japan. Talk in BT is now about winning more customers for Syncordia, rather than signing up more partners. Meanwhile, having collectively failed to agree terms for Syncordia membership, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and France Telecom have formed their own outsourcing venture, Eunetcom. According to a recent issue of Telecomeuropa's regional newsletter, the odds are that Spain's national operator Telefonica will also join Eunetcom. Italy's telephone company SIP is also a possible partner. Additional competition has appeared in the form of Unisource, an enterprise formed in October 1991 to combine the international businesses of the Dutch and Swedish PTTs. In June 1992, the Unisource partnership announced a major agreement to interconnect its facilities to those of US carrier Sprint. Last month it sold a third of the shareholding in one of its two operating companies to the Swiss national telecommunications carrier. Discussions are continuing to find additional European participants, and the hunt is on for a partner in the Asia Pacific region. US carriers will play a critical role in shaping the overall super carrier sector. Aside from the Sprint deal with Unisource, and a recent tie-up between MCI and Canada's Stentor, all the US candidates for the super carrier slot have so far kept their cards pretty close to their corporate chests. In this increasingly confrontational environment, there is some scepticism about BT's ability to go it alone. 'Companies who try to 'go it alone' will find it very cold out there, very expensive in terms of capital outlay, and high risk,' says John Buckley, director of telecommunications at the PA Consulting Group. 'Strategic alliances, whether you like it or not, are probably the way to go.' Peter Wilkinson, a director of the UK's Quotient Communications consultancy, notes that the earlier Syncordia initiative did not win any friends for BT in Europe and sparked defensive European alliances which are likely to recruit more members in future. The Cyclone initiative, he says, will provoke a similar response worldwide. While acknowledging that globalisation and outsourcing is potentially the biggest and most lucrative market for internationally-oriented carriers in the 1990s and into the next century, PA Consulting says that there are many issues as yet unresolved. On the regulatory front, it is unclear what will, and what will not, be sanctioned from country to country. Many would-be corporate customers are chary of handing over the operation of so vital a part of their activity as telecommunications to the former monopolies whose inadequacies led to the boom in private networks in the first place. There is also a question mark over the present-day competence of PTT-like organisations in the highly complex business of sophisticated private networking. According to Mr Buckley, one way to overcome lack of expertise is to buy into, or form partnerships with, existing private network operators, either in-house or those set up to serve particular interest groups such as banking and transport. Here, with its recent purchase of the Nedlloyd transportation group's telecommunications network, the Unisource partners may have stolen a march on their larger competitors.

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (8): Cashing in on a greener image - Profile of Gateway Foodstores GATEWAY Foodstores, with 1,100 cars in the fleet, is contributing to a steady rise in the popularity of diesels. It started buying diesels in earnest in August last year, and now has 200. The retailer was already considering a move to diesels, especially in the mid-range of its fleet, to reduce costs and improve reliability, when a corporate commitment to environmental improvement swung the balance in favour of switching to an all-diesel policy, across the fleet. The 'green' benefit will come from reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Brian Tomlin, commercial manager, sees diesels giving clear advantages over petrol in other areas. Reliability emerged as a key issue. Niggling faults, especially on electricals, start to creep in on petrol cars after about 60,000 miles, and garages do not seem to know enough about the vehicles to cope with them efficiently and the risk of unit failure increases significantly after 80,000 miles, he says. The company had extended petrol car mileages from a maximum of 75,000 to 85,000. Mr Tomlin says that while that is uncomfortably high for petrol cars, 'we don't feel at all at risk, operationally, taking diesels up to 3.5 years or 85,000 miles'. Once the firm has more experience of the cars, these limits could be extended to 100,000 or more. Mr Tomlin feels much safer on residual values with diesels: 'You can get the fright of your life from Glass's Guide, looking at what happens to trade prices for petrol cars between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.' Diesels, on the other hand, remain popular and retain strong residuals, right up to 100,000 miles. The classic means of retaining high residuals is to replace cars at least as frequently as every 40,000 miles. 'However, this leaves you exposed to heavy capital demands, if you want to extend vehicle life temporarily, then go back to frequent changes,' Mr Tomlin says. Overall, he expects maintenance costs to be around 5 per cent lower using diesels, in spite of slightly more frequent oil and filter changes. Costs are about the same up to 40,000 miles, but start to creep up on petrol cars after that. The biggest cost savings are on fuel, and come at the heart of the fleet market, the medium-sized saloons. Gateway was running 400 Sierra 1.6 petrol-engined cars - admittedly not the most frugal in its class - returning an average fuel consumption of 30 miles per gallon (mpg). The Sierra replacements, the Peugeot 405 and BX 19 diesels, both with the increasingly popular PSA XUD turbo and naturally aspirated engines, are giving around 45 mpg. Not only are these cars using less fuel, but diesel can be substantially cheaper than petrol - typically three pence a gallon in winter, and up to 16 pence a gallon the rest of the year. (Diesel prices are more subject to seasonal fluctuations because of strong demand for fuel oil in winter.) Overall, Mr Tomlin believes that company car fuel bills would fall by 40 per cent across the fleet, given an instant change from all-petrol to all-diesel. This substantial saving derives partly from the concentration of middle-sized cars. At the top and bottom end, percentage fuel savings are more marginal. Many diesel models continue to be priced higher than petrol equivalents, and it can take 25-30,000 miles to recoup the extra with savings on fuel. The differences in price exist for marketing, rather than engineering reasons, and the gaps will close, Mr Tomlin predicts. He sees other drawbacks with diesels. They are noisier, especially when cold and at low revs, and this irritates some drivers. 'The gap between diesel and petrol has narrowed, but I don't see that anyone will ever mistake the two types of engine.' In making the switch, Gateway has sweetened the pill by widening the choice of marques available to its drivers. As the company gains experience of diesels, the range will probably be narrowed to three or four makes for most employees, to concentrate purchasing power. There is still not nearly enough choice at the top end of the market, Mr Tomlin says. The Mercedes-Benz 300D is offered to executives who previously had larger Mercs, Jaguars and the BMW 7-series, but it is considered by some to have too small a cabin. The BMW 525 diesel turbo, due by September, will make a welcome addition to the available options. Diesel poses problems, at present, to employees at the lowest tax bracket. The Citroen AX with the 1360 engine is offered to drivers who previously had Escort 1300s. Mr Tomlin is concerned, too, at the lack of automatic options. for the time being, the only option for many drivers is the Citroen BX. Gateway buys its cars and services a third of them at its own workshop in Bristol, which trades as Hartcliffe Motors. Already, the diesels are proving simpler and cheaper to service, Mr Tomlin enthuses. Elsewhere, and especially in London, the company is having a proportion of servicing done by independent, rather than franchised, workshops. Diesels have, until now, been sold short in Britain by market leaders Ford and Vauxhall, which have treated them as second-division products, Mr Tomlin believes. Peugeot and Citroen, with their XUD engines, found themselves holding the key to a niche market, and the rest of the market is only now responding. 'The diesel market is set to take off, for sound engineering, cost and environmental reasons,' he says.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Ireland turns to thoughts of Spring: Tim Coone reports on why the Labour party leader is riding high in the opinion polls A LANKY, bespectacled figure, with a neatly clipped moustache, a firm handshake, and an air of gravitas, swept through north Dublin's street markets and shopping malls this week . . . with a promise of change. Mr Dick Spring, the leader of the Irish Labour party, has serious ambitions of becoming the country's next prime minister. Riding high in the opinion polls, he has signalled to other party leaders that any discussions on coalition government after next week's general election will have to include the possibility of shared leadership if Labour is to join in. On current poll projections, it is likely that neither Prime Minister Albert Reynolds' Fianna Fail nor Fine Gael, the two main parties, will win enough seats to form a government in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) on its own, nor with any of the smaller parties that have indicated a willingness to join a coalition. Barring a last-minute blunder, it is probable that Labour will hold the balance of power with 20-25 seats, against 70-75 for Fianna Fail and maybe 50-55 for Fine Gael. Polling only 6.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent in the 1987 and 1989 parliamentary elections respectively, Labour had its big breakthrough in the 1990 presidential election, when Mrs Mary Robinson, the Labour-backed candidate, won with 53 per cent of the vote. Although her victory is accepted as a one-off result, the positive image she has projected as president and her well-known liberal stance on women's and civil rights are generally acknowledged as factors behind Labour's current good standing at 19 per cent in the polls. Mr Spring's own high parliamentary profile, as a latter-day Don Quixote tilting at the windmills of corruption in high places, and the champion of the unemployed, has given him a personal popularity rating of almost 70 per cent, more than 30 points ahead any other party leader, and at least 42 points ahead of Mr Reynolds. Mr Spring says: 'I now have the confidence to say that Labour will make the most important breakthrough it has ever made, which will break the mould of traditional concepts of Irish politics which are still rooted in the civil war (of the 1920s).' One of the key battlegrounds will be Dublin, where Labour has almost caught up with Fianna Fail in the opinion polls, and where it hopes to pick up seven new seats. The Dublin Central constituency, a poor working-class district, is a key marginal where Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, is defending his Dail seat. It is a Fianna Fail heartland, but boundary changes since the last election have given Labour a strong chance of winning one of two seats held by Fianna Fail. Mr Spring's name is not exactly a household one. 'Who's that?' asked a group of grimy-faced children who beg for money from the photographers who swarm around Mr Spring. He is also less than universally popular. 'He only comes down here when he wants our votes]' a man shouts out. However, his reception is usually overwhelmingly welcoming. People approach him to wish him well. 'I'll take two-to-one-on for 30 seats,' grins an elderly man coming out of a betting shop. Another elderly man who complains of the health service says: 'I usually vote Fine Gael but I think I'll give yer man a try this time.' A pensioner and life-long Fianna Fail supporter says she will be voting Labour: 'It's the unemployment, the jobs. This lot haven't done anything, so it's time to give the others a chance. They can't do any worse.' Mr Spring presses on with his message that his party will bring probity to government, tackle unemployment and improve housing, health and the schools. At a primary school housed in 20-year-old prefabricated buildings on the grounds of the Education Ministry, he surveys the peeling paintwork, missing gutterwork and rotting windowframes. He promises the teachers and parents who have gathered to meet him that a government in which he participated would rebuild the school. Presenting him proudly to her class, a teacher asks: 'Does anyone know who this man is?' After a moment's silence, one small child ventures 'John Major?'</p>

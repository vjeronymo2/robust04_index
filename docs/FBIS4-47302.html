The essential requirements are: field of view ranging  from tenths of angular minutes to several angular degrees,  angular resolution ranging from fractions of a minute to tenths  of minutes, spectral range from 2 m to beyond 100 m and  thus beyond the window in the earth's atmosphere, diameter of  lens or mirror ranging from 100 mm to 1000 mm, photosensitivity  within the 10-0.1 aW/cm[.sup]2[/] range, number of objects  detectable during one observation ranging from a hundred to a  million, usability for an observation time ranging from tens of  a minute to one year, and 10-90 width of Sun, Earth, Moon  containing sectors. As far as photodetectors for such infrared  telescopes are concerned, the design problems have already been  thoroughly analyzed and completely solved. One of them is  selection of semiconductor materials for the photoresistors  which will ensure minimum generation-recombination noise at  specific wavelengths of incident radiation: Ge:Hg for 13 m,  Si:Ga for 16 m, Si:As or Ge:Cd for 22 m, Si:B for 30  m.  The topology of such low-noise photodetectors and the dimension  of their ``elongated'' elements contribute to high accuracy of  angle and radiation measurements. The optoelectronic devices for  infrared telescopes must be cooled to various appropriate  temperature levels within the 4-77 K range, so as to minimize  the heat load at those levels. The cryogenic IKON infrared  telescope for the ``IK-Obzor'' (IR Field of View) experiment  operates with its objective at  30 K and its radiation  receivers at  16 K. The objective, 150 mm in diameter, has  a 5  foot field of view and a 2 inch or 3 inch angular resolution.  The telescope has 128 sensitive elements, all 150 m large,  for operation within three respectively 7 m, 11 m, 14  m  wide spectral bands. The storage time is 0.1 and the mean-square  error of angle measurements is 20 inches. One problem not yet  solved is adequate protection against contaminants such as  condensates of surrounding gases. Figures 2; tables 2;  references 12.</p>

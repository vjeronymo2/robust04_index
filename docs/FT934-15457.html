			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Coal pledges still not implemented MORE THAN six months after publishing a white paper on the future of coal, the government has still to implement the document's most significant proposals. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the announcement of pit closures by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, which caused an outcry and the apparent change in policy outlined in the white paper. However, with the 12 pits reprieved in the white paper under renewed threat of closure the government has yet to fulfil white paper promises to: Take forward as a 'matter of urgency' its consultations with electricity generators about strategic coal stocks. Provide subsidies for British Coal and private operators to sell additional coal to the generators. Ministers say the money is available but the industry believes the generators are unlikely to buy more this year. Set up an energy advisory panel of independent experts to help draw up an annual energy report. Potential members say they have not been contacted but the DTI says it still plans to set up the panel. Launch a review of the nuclear industry. At least three government departments are disputing the review's terms of reference. Announce the outcome of a review of guidance to planning authorities on opencast coal. The guidance will considerably affect the market for deep-mine coal, which is more expensive to extract than opencast. The delays can be explained in part by Mr Heseltine's absence for much of the summer after his heart attack. At least half the 30 remaining pits are likely to go in the next year or so, but the government is nervous of a reaction similar to last October.</p>

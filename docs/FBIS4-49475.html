			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] It is difficult to escape the conclusion that a  major reason for the display of military prowess in Guangzhou  last weekend was to strike fear into the hearts of "anti-Chinese  elements" in Hong Kong. The demonstration of daredevil combat  skills by the crack Red One Brigade before a select Hong Kong  audience was a show of force by the sovereign power just a  little shy of three years before takeover.    Xinhua and the pro-Beijing press claimed the parade would  enable Hong Kong citizens to know more about the People's  Liberation Army (PLA). As the propagandists put it: "It was  the first time since nation building that Hong Kong compatriots  took a close look at PLA troops in an organised and large-scale  fashion."    Not highlighted was the fact that the exhibition was open to  only 216 of the faithful: Beijing-appointed legislators and  advisers as well as members of the "shadow Government". The  press were barred, as were Hong Kong's elected legislators.    More important, however, is the fact that Hong Kong has  prospered precisely because its residents have not needed to be  anywhere near the PLA. At the height of the 1967  "disturbances", the Hong Kong Government kept a fleet of  airplanes at Kai Tak on a 24-hour standby basis. An emergency  airlift would take place the moment the PLA crossed the border.    Even for moderate cadres of the Chinese Communist Party  (CCP), however, the stationing of the PLA in Hong Kong -- not to  mention holding periodic war games to scare "domestic and  foreign hostile elements" in the territory -- makes little  sense. The Special Administrative Region (SAR) is exposed to no  danger of foreign invasion.    The late premier Zhou Enlai and politburo member Liao  Chengzhi who held the Hong Kong portfolio in the 60s and 70s --  did not favour posting troops to Hong Kong. Messrs Zhou and  Liao's idea about the change of sovereignty was as minimalist as  it was liberal: Just change the governor and the flag.    Former defence minister Geng Biao and former foreign  minister  Huang Hua also opposed billeting soldiers here. After they told  the press about it, however, the two were in 1983 given a public  scolding by patriarch Deng Xiaoping for "mouthing nonsense".    Yet even Mr. Deng envisaged no more than a token PLA  presence.    With the onset of the moral equivalent of war between  Beijing  and Governor Chris Patten and the "neo-imperialists", however,  the 8,000 to 10,000 soldiers who will call Hong Kong home after  July 1997 have much more than symbolic significance.    Top brass briefing the Hong Kong dignitaries last weekend  reiterated that the troops would not interfere with SAR affairs.  Xinhua Vice-Director Zhang Junsheng made much of the fact that  since "the PLA are the people's army, the sons and brothers of  the people, Hong Kong compatriots have nothing to fear".    Almost the same words were used to assure Beijing residents  as the CCP's Central Military Commission (CMC) moved troops into  the capital in May 1989. During last weekend's exercise, the  216 luminaries were so awestruck by the display of brawn and  electronic wizardry they did nothing other than sing praises  over "this civilised battalion, this glorious battalion."    Cooler heads, however, should ask themselves -- and the PLA  -- the following questions.    First, on the issue of loyalty. The troops to be quartered  here will be under the "absolute leadership" of the CCP and the  CMC.    There have been no fully-fledged coups d'etat in Communist-  Chinese history. But during the Cultural Revolution and the  "turmoil" in the spring of 1989, the PLA responded with alacrity  to calls by the CMC to "restore order".    It is not very likely that the SAR -- or a "destabilising"  political force within the Region -- will lock horns with the  CCP administration.    Hong Kong, however, has been characterised by Chinese cadres  as a "base of subversion". Should an ugly confrontation shape  up, Beijing would no doubt ensure that, to use PLA lingo, "the  guns of the soldiers (here) will be pointed in the right  direction".    Then there is the degree of effectiveness with which the CMC  can control troops in Guangdong and in the SAR in the post-Deng  era.    It is a reflection of Beijing's concern for "warlordism"  that, to quell the 1989 "rebellion", the CMC mobilised divisions  to the capital from all the military regions. Likewise, the  soldiers destined to "guard" Hong Kong will come from different  parts of the nation.    Should CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin fail to hold together the  army after Mr. Deng's demise, officers in the Guangzhou and the  Hong Kong command might not heed the centre's instructions about  what not to do to the SAR.    Because Hong Kong is such a fat piece of meat, ferocious  argument has also broken out within the top brass over which PLA  unit and faction should have the choicest parts of the spoils.    It is understood that the CMC had to invoke Mr. Deng's  authority to shoot down a proposal by the navy that it erect  major installations in the SAR. The leadership was worried that  the business viability of the SAR would be hurt if a chunk of it  became a naval base.    The power struggle within the CCP and the CMC, however, is a  never-ending game. The PLA faction that comes out on top two  years after Mr. Deng's death may have a radically different idea  not only on troop deployment here, but on other aspects in which  Hong Kong can serve the motherland's Great Wall of Steel.    The Basic Law notwithstanding, the SAR will not be able to  say "no" to the propositions of the single most powerful  institution in China.    Then there is the question of the PLA's mushrooming business  empire. Hong Kong has resigned itself to the fact that the PLA  will reap billions of dollars from developing the huge plots of  land which will be turned over to them by the departing British  garrison.    Much more disturbing is the phenomenon of PLA companies  using  their unbeatable clout to muscle into -- and corner parts of --  the Hong Kong market.    Quite a number of generals tipped for the Hong Kong Command,  including the Head of the Political Department of the Guangzhou  Military Region, Lei Mingqiu, are accomplished military  entrepreneurs.    On the mainland, PLA companies wheel and deal outside the  law  because, in most instances, they are outside the purview of  civilian departments in areas such as customs, auditing,  taxation and anticorruption.    There is no suggestion that army businesses operating in  Hong  Kong after 1997 will make a point of breaking SAR laws. Yet  given the feverish anxiety with which political and business  circles in Hong Kong are currying favour with power sects from  up north, it would be that much easier for errant PLA executives  to get away with shady transactions.</p>

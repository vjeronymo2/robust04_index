			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile  yesterday declared government's counterinsurgency campaign a  success based on recorded accomplishments in the first four  months of 1994.    At the same time, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Vice  Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler said all existing rebel  groups in the country are not capable of causing instability.    Mr. Enrile said the total number of armed regulars of all  threat groups dropped 30 percent last year through the  military's counterinsurgency campaign plan "Lambat Bitag  [Dragnet Snare]."    The AFP also recorded a 13 percent decline in the total  number of high-powered firearms in the hands of rebels and a 52  percent slide in the total number of insurgency-affected  barangays [villages].    Recently, National Police Commission Chairman Rafael Alunan  declared strategic victory over Muslim guerrillas, communist  rebels, and other breakaway groups, saying their strengths have  been reduced considerably through the combined efforts of the  military and police.    Likewise, Gen. Enrile said armed groups such as the New  People's Army, Abu Sayyaf, Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and  Alex Boncayao Brigade have been crippled by counterinsurgency  efforts.    However, the recently installed armed forces chief warned  against "prematurely sweeping the insurgency threat under the  rug" because "political consolidations are still going on."    Even as the first quarter of this year has shown  considerable  rewards for government, Mr. Enrile said, "The decline in the  number of major engagements only means that they have shifted  into small unit operations. But they are still there."    Mr. Filler also said threats from both the leftist and  rightist groups have been marginalized. He stressed that unlike  before, rightist groups like the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang  Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance]-Soldiers of the  Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) are no longer  considered threats to national security.    He belittled the capability of the said groups, saying they  are not capable of grabbing power from the present  administration based on the reported decrease in their manpower  and assets.    As communist factions are busy consolidating forces, Mr.  Enrile said, the country's armed forces will concentrate on  national economic development as well as the protection and  conservation of the environment and the remaining natural  resources.    He also revealed plans to engage in massive cooperative  projects nationwide.    According to Army Chief Maj. Gen Romulo Yap, government is a  month ahead of its counterinsurgency campaign scheduled before  the year. [sentence as published]</p>

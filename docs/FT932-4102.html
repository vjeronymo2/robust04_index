			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Executives eighth in earnings league TOP EXECUTIVES of small and medium-sized UK companies are only eighth in the European after-tax pay league, the 1993 survey of Top Management Compensation by Wyatt Data Services shows. A British chief executive, married with two children, took home an average Pounds 55,000 last year. Based on the head of a company with a turnover of Pounds 68m, the UK salary is Pounds 34,520 less than for a comparable position in Switzerland, which tops the league table. Adjusted for the cost of living, however, the UK jumps into fourth place, behind only Germany, Italy and France, with Switzerland sixth. Without a cost-of-living adjustment the other countries that come ahead of the UK - apart from Switzerland - are Germany, France, Austria, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain, where the salary is Pounds 2,710 more. Below the UK are Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, the Irish Republic, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Portugal and Greece. The US comes well ahead of even Switzerland, however, with a typical top manager of a small or medium-sized company earning Pounds 94,750 after tax - Pounds 38,580 more than in the UK.</p>

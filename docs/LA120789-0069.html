			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: SHAPING YEAST DOUGH IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP FOR THAT PERFECT LOAF  OF BREAD  </P> <P> Previous columns have explained how to prepare, knead and proof basic yeast  dough. The next step is to shape the dough into loaves.  </P> <P> After punching down, place the dough on a lightly floured work surface, cover  with a towel and allow it to rest about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, grease the  baking pan.  </P> <P> All-purpose loaf pans may be used for bread baking, however the material from  which they're made affects the bread's crust. For a good brown color, select  anodized aluminum or darkened metal that absorb heat.  </P> <P> Roll the dough into a 9x7-inch rectangle (Step 1). Beginning at the narrow end,  fold the bottom third up over the center third of the oblong (Step 2). Turn the  dough and fold the remaining one-third over (Step 3), pinching the dough  together along the seam and at the ends.  </P> <P> Using stiffened hands, compress the ends of the dough and fold them over (Step  4). Turn the dough and place, seam side down, in the prepared pan. Cover and  let rise in a warm (75 degrees to 85 degrees), draft-free place, until once  again doubled.  </P> <P> A final column on bread baking will be devoted to alternate methods of shaping  the dough and baking.  </P></p>

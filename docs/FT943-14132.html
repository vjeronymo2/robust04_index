			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional reports) (15): Tigers snared by Tokyo's rise and the dollar's ills Stock markets in south-east Asia suffered during the second quarter as a result of Japan's rise. Moreover, since most of the region's currencies are pegged to the dollar, the poor performances of both it and of the US stock markets also affected these markets. Hong Kong fell 6.3 per cent on the quarter, and while markets in Malaysia and Singapore have risen from the levels posted at the end of March, the FT-Actuaries indices suggest that Kuala Lumpur has declined by 24.1 per cent and Singapore by 13.9 per cent since the beginning of the year. While analysts regard the effects of the rise in US interest rates on Pacific Rim markets with caution, the recovery in the US economy offers encouragement for export-oriented countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Korea. Growth rates for the Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand economies are expected to be around 8 per cent, while Indonesia may see its economy grow by 7 per cent. Mr Nick Allan, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in Hong Kong, is also positive about India, where the economy is moving towards a free market and the middle class is expanding. Korea has emerged from a slowdown that began three years ago, and a rise in external demand is expected to support growth. The rise in foreign investment limits, from 10 per cent of a listed company to 15 per cent, may also attract further foreign funds to the country. One worry is inflation, which could prompt tightening by monetary authorities. Most analysts maintain a cautious stance on Hong Kong and Taiwan, which have been hit by the US tightening its monetary policy. These markets are also vulnerable to economic tightening in China, where government officials are becoming increasingly worried about the overheating of the economy. Taiwan, however, is still expecting firm economic growth of around 6 per cent for the year, which should provide an incentive for investors in the long run. Meanwhile, Japanese investors have woken up to the fact that politics may not affect markets. For the past six months, political instability has had little impact on the Tokyo stock market, which rose 6.9 per cent on the quarter, according to the FT-Actuaries World indices. Since the beginning of the year, Tokyo has jumped 14.7 per cent; while the increase is even more impressive in dollar terms, at 29.8 per cent. The market has benefited from increased purchases by overseas investors, largely from the US, attracted by heightened prospects of a recovery in the economy and corporate earnings this year. However, as US interest rates have gradually risen, on fears of inflation, the level of liquidity flowing into Japan from international investors has shown signs of decreasing. Investors wondering whether or not it is too late to jump in will need to give the market a second look. For those intending to move their funds in and out within a span of six months or less, Tokyo may not offer the attractive returns it did for the first half of the year. Domestic institutional investors have been slow in following foreign funds into the stock market, and although many analysts see the Nikkei's floor at around 20,000, an upward boost in the near term seems remote. Although political turmoil seems to pose little threat to share prices, domestic investors are nervous about the continued strength in the yen and potential sell-offs due to positions accumulated through technical trading. The key to investor confidence will be the previews of interim corporate earnings ahead of book-closing in September. The effects of the yen's strength can also be expected to be quantified and discounted into share prices. Over a longer term, however, the potential recovery for corporate earnings may give investors favourable returns. According to Merrill Lynch, in Tokyo, on conservative estimates corporate earnings could grow by 152 per cent in the next five years, against real economic growth of 2.7 per cent. This suggests a 42 per cent potential rise in the Nikkei, with a large part of the increase coming in the first two to three years.</p>

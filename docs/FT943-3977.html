			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / The two-tier Europe debate is refuelled: The EU's great economic divide - interest rates, deficits and inflation Different levels of budget deficit, variations in currency volatility, and member states' widely varying inflation records are the three main causes behind differences in general rises in long-term interest rates. These are the main conclusions of a report to EU finance ministers on Saturday by the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the embryo of the European Central Bank foreseen by the Maastricht programme for economic and monetary union (Emu) by the end of the century. According to Maastricht, Emu and a single currency will only come about if member states meet treaty rules on convergence of inflation and interest rates, budget deficits and government debt. Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, EMI president, told finance ministers meeting at Lake Constance in southern Germany that the markets had established three clear tiers of countries in terms of the rise of long-term interest rates between January and August 29 this year. The presentation, intended to underline the need to bear down on deficits and inflation, and to promote exchange rate stability and structural economic reform, will inevitably fuel the current debate about the EU dividing into a 'hard core' of committed and able integrationists, surrounded by outer circles of second and even third division countries. In Mr Lamfalussy's analysis, the recognised hard core - Germany, France and the Benelux countries - are all in tier one (where long-term rates have risen by less than 2 per cent) alongside the US and Japan. In tier two, where long-term rates have risen between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, are the UK, Denmark and Ireland. Taking up the rearguard, with rate increases of more than 3 per cent, are Italy, Spain and Portugal. The three 'correlations' establishing this order, Mr Lamfalussy suggested, were rates of inflation between 1984 and 1993; the highest public deficits in 1994; and market perception of currency stability. Mr Henning Christophersen, EU economic affairs commissioner, said the 'markets have a memory like elephants' about the policy mistakes of the 1980s. 'We are all agreed that we would not repeat these mistakes in the light of the recovery' in economic growth, he said. The European Commission last week revised average EU growth predictions for this year from 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product to 2 per cent, forecasting 2.5 per cent growth next year. Mr Christophersen emphasised that this depended partly on the strength of the dollar and on the need to prevent the fiscal relaxation and high wage settlements of the late 1980s. He and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister who chaired the weekend meeting, also underlined the need to keep within a 'virtuous circle' - with exports leading the recovery followed by revived investment, and only then revived domestic demand. Some EU officials said that several member states, including the UK, were over-emphasising the 'short-term' growth engine of domestic demands. One senior EU official argued that the three countries in the EMI's second tier - the UK, Denmark and Ireland - were all plausible candidates to join the 'hard core' in entering Emu. But the British and Danes were paying an interest rate premium in terms of perceived currency stability, because of their opt-outs from Emu in the Maastricht treaty. Ireland, another official said, suffered because of its high government debt, but mainly through 'guilt by association' because of its close economic ties to the UK. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, insisted that 'opt-outs did not feature in Mr Lamfalussy's analysis', and that 'our opt-out plays no part' in Britain's higher long-term interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MULTINATIONALS TAXING TO BE SETTLED  </P> <P> The Supreme Court agreed today to settle some key questions involving the  ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in federal  court.  </P> <P> What the justices decide sometime next year in a California case could have  big-money significance for most states and many big businesses.  </P> <P> The justices, granting an appeal by California officials, said they will review  a ruling that allowed two multinational corporations to challenge a state tax  in federal court.  </P> <P> In a 1984 ruling seen as a major victory for states, the justices held that  California may tax multinational corporations based on the businesses'  worldwide income.  </P> <P> But that decision applied only to multinationals whose parent company is  located in the United States.  </P> <P> The case acted on today involves multinationals whose parent company is based  in a foreign country.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by Aferdita </F> Sokoli in Tirana; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Sokoli] Mr. Minister, what did your participation  in the Geneva meeting achieve?    [Serreqi] An open discussion was held there. Every minister  presented his own options and ideas regarding the crisis. Since  this meeting coincided with the NATO meeting and the fact that  many more important decisions other than the mandate of this  conference were expected, it is understandable that the  importance of this conference was diminished and somewhat  reduced to an informal exchange of opinions.    The Albanian side, of course, presented its own opinions and  options, stressing that the choices suggested so far,  particularly the division of Bosnia, offer neither peace nor a  peaceful solution to the region. At the same time, this is a  precedence with unforeseen consequences.    The meeting discussed at length the embargo, its  application,  and the economic consequences. We were very categorical that  Albania, as one of the countries that has applied the embargo  most rigorously and as one of the countries that is most  affected by the embargo, insists that this embargo continues, as  the only possibility and the only measure that the international  community has so far implemented against Serbia. Its handling  and the opinions to facilitate or abolish it should be solved  along with other very important elements of the crisis, such as  solving the problem of Albanians in Kosova and elsewhere.    [Sokoli] Since the two meetings coincided, how did the  participating sides react?    [Serreqi] The participants did not maintain the same stance.  Of course, we favored the already known position that Albania is  deeply convinced that the international community, NATO, and the  United Nations should restore its credibility and give a clear  testimony that concrete measures should be taken against the  aggressor.    [Sokoli] What about the Greek reaction?    [Serreqi] Of course, it is already well known that the Greek  position was completely different from ours.</p>

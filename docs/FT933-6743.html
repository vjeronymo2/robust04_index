			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Visionary HK businessman: Obituary - Lord Kadoorie LORD Kadoorie, one of Hong Kong's greatest businessmen and its first British peer, died yesterday, aged 94. He leaves behind a family empire worth close to USDollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), including controlling interests in Hong Kong's largest power company and one of Asia's leading hotel groups. Lord Kadoorie was one of the colony's few tycoons to build up equally strong links with Britain and China. In 1981 he was awarded the title of Baron Kadoorie of Kowloon in Hong Kong and the City of Westminster, shortly after awarding Britain its largest ever export order - for China Light and Power's Castle Peak power station. Four years later he finalised China's first nuclear power project, in Daya Bay, near Hong Kong. The deal was signed by Chinese premier Li Peng and it earned Lord Kadoorie a dinner engagement with Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping, which was to have taken place at the opening of Daya Bay, later this year. He argued that Hong Kong should be a neutral point of contact between China and the west and pursued this goal both as businessman and conservative politician. Hong Kong's acting governor, Sir David Ford, described Lord Kadoorie as 'a businessman of extraordinary vision' and a man with 'unshakeable faith in Hong Kong's future'. Lord Kadoorie was chairman of China Light and Power from 1935 through to 1992. His father, Sir Eleazar Kadoorie, had emigrated to the colony from Baghdad in 1880, and expanded from stockbroking into electricity. His son rebuilt the business after the Japanese occupation left little more than the Peninsula Hotel. The family now controls 35 per cent of the HKDollars 68.4bn (Pounds 5.9bn) capitalised China Light and Power, 61 per cent of Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Hotels and interests in companies ranging from textiles to banking.</p>

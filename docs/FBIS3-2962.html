Peasants'  per capita net income stood at 880 yuan, increasing by 2 percent  over the previous year. The peasants' burden began to be  lightened. The sales income, net profit, and total value of  products of town and township enterprises increased by more than  60 percent. The situation in agriculture is encouraging.    We must be aware, however, that there exists quite a number  of deep-rooted contradictions in the development of agriculture  and rural economic work. The first is the low comparative  effectiveness of agricultural production, especially grain and  cotton production. The price scissors between industrial and  agricultural products keep increasing, while the income of  peasants increases at a slow pace. The second contradiction is  that there is no sign of improvement in the system to promote  agricultural technology, which has broken down, with its  personnel scattered. The phenomenon of "unhooking and weaning"  is quite common. The third controduction is that agricultural  science and technology lags behind the development of  production. It lacks fine species, as well as new, low-cost,  highly beneficial breeding and cultivation technology for the  purpose of upgrading agriculture. The rate at which current  scientific research is promoted and transformed is comparatively  low. The fourth contradiction is the increasing employment  pressure caused by the surplus labor force. The fifth is that  state agricultural regulation and control measures are  insufficient, while the agricultural foundation is weak. These  problems seem commonplace, but many new developments have taken  place in each of these areas. Our task is to analyze these new  developments, study the new problems, and be determined to solve  these deep-rooted problems in the development of our agriculture  and the rural economy.    Information from an authoritative department shows that 1994  is to be the year for major breakthroughs in our economic  restructuring. The state will adopt important measures in  finance, taxation, banking, planning, investment, foreign trade  and the reform of state-owned enterprises. Beginning this year,  the reform will shift from the surface to a deeper level, from  breakthroughs in single items to overall coordination, from  paying attention to the benefits brought about by comparatively  independent reform measures to the formation of a  comprehensively new economic relationship.    It is inevitable that this reform situation in China will  have a profound impact on rural reform bacause it is an  important part of the economic restructuring of our country. On  the one hand, it will give a vigorous boost to agriculture and  the rural economy. In the past, we used to say that it was  difficult to deepen agricultural reform. The key problem was  that the external reform was not coordinated with rural reform.  This year, now that the entire economic restructuring has come  to a crucial phase of overall advance, it will create an  excellent external environment for rural reform and development.  We should grasp this opportunity firmly. On the other hand, the  reform will readjust the present pattern of interest  distribution in a big way. It is also inevitable that it will  affect agriculture and the rural economy in a disadvantageous  way. Take the reform of the financial and taxation system for  example; the practice of the new circulating-tax system and the  unification of enterprise income tax will have a considerable  effect on the tax load of town and township enterprises.  Moreover, these enterprises also have to undertake many social  burdens and tasks to develop agriculture through industry. As a  result, their profit retention will be less, which will affect  the capacity of these enterprises for further development.  Raising prices for crude oil, refined oil, and electricity, as  well as completely deregulating prices for centrally distributed  coal and farm chemicals, will bring about price increases for  the means of agricultural production and will increase the cost  of agricultural products.    In short, the nation's in-depth reform provides a good  external environment for solving the deep-rooted contradictions  in agriculture and the rural economy. We should say that it is  high time for us to seize the opportunity to solve these  deep-rooted contradictions in agriculture and the rural economy.  In actual practice, of course, these deep-rooted contradictions  cannot be solved overnight, nor can they be solved altogether at  the same time. The competent state department should take them  into consideration as a whole and should make overall  arrangements. A locality, a department, or a system first  should solve whatever problem for which the conditions for its  solution are ripe. Now confronting us are contradictions and  difficulties, as well as potential and opportunities. However,  the opportunities we have are greater than the difficulties.  Therefore, we must take hold of the situation, grasp the  opportunities and meet the challenges so as to make our  agriculture and rural economy take off again.</p>

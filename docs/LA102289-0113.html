			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAILINGS CRITICIZED  </P> <P> The civil rights of a segment of our state's population are in jeopardy as we  watch them being sentenced to jail for their defense of life. These good  citizens of the state of California are being told by the court system in San  Diego County that believing in the right to life and defending the right to  life is wrong and punishable action.  </P> <P> Recent events within the court systems of Los Angeles, San Diego, Vista and El  Cajon make it apparent that justice has a different set of norms that are  dependent on those dispensing it. It has been judged that the descriptive  expressions used in protesting what is unquestionably killing of the unborn  (abortion) -- words like conscience, murder, killing, police brutality, etc. --  are prohibited. What has happened to the right to free speech? Are we to  believe it is for some and not for all? Who makes that choice?  </P> <P> Innocent lives are being destroyed and good people are going to jail just for  acting and speaking in the defense of the unborn child. Where is justice for  those who defend life? Who is to defend the right of the unborn?  </P> <P> 26 PRIESTS  </P> <P> of the Escondido Deanery  </P></p>

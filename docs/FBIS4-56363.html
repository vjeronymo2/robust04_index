			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armando Gruber] </F>   [Text] San Felix--Retired Lieutenant Colonel Francisco  Arias Cardenas said here during a visit to the Caroni  Municipality mayor's office that the struggles or differences  between Radical Cause [CR] and Hugo Chavez and the MBR-200  [Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement-200] only benefit directly  the traditional parties like AD [Democratic Action] and COPEI  [Social Christian Party].    Arias Cardenas does not see why these two political currents  have to oppose each other and fears that there could be persons  interested in creating frictions involved.    Flanked by CR Senator Lucas Matheus, Mayor Clemente Scotto,  and city councillors Simon Yegres (CR) and Davis Odreman (AD),  Arias Cardenas added: "There are individuals disguised as  revolutionaries who are promoting these confrontations, and I  see that they are very interested in creating conflicts."    "There should be respect, and agreement is vital. We should  remember the sixties and the fratricidal struggles within the  left in this country."    Arias Cardenas insisted on the need for President Rafael  Caldera to continue to take rapid action to complete the process  of freeing many of the officers who rebelled on 27 November  [1992] and some of those from 4 February [1992] who may still be  under arrest, and also the need to seek the reintegration of  many young officers into the ranks of the FAN [National Armed  Forces].    "Many of those who participated in those movements on 4  February and 27 November--such as Admiral Cabrera, General  Visconti, and Colonels Dominguez and Garrido--did so with the  firm desire to rebel against a corrupt government that had no  legitimacy. There are a large number of higher-ranking junior  officers, and it is vital to listen to and hear them."    [Gruber] What do you think is hindering the process?    "Good will, which is extremely important. I do not know the  details of what may be happening, so I found it necessary to  postpone until next week my meeting with Andres Caldera, the  minister secretary of the presidency. There are situations such  as, for example, officers who were discharged with questionable  procedures, from a legal point of view. This must be taken into  account."    On the possibility of being appointed director of PAMI  [Mother-Child Food Program] by the government of President  Rafael Caldera, Arias Cardenas said: "The fundamental basis for  accepting jobs or working is to feel fulfilled by what one is  doing. This government is not the same as or like the previous  one, nor is it an AD government."    "I would have to evaluate it very carefully in view of the  opportunities for contributing, for serving, and being useful to  the community. In addition, I have a responsibility toward those  officers who went along with me in rebelling, believing in my  military leadership, and now are unemployed."    "This government is different from the previous ones, and  will have its critics, its problems. I would have to evaluate it  [the appointment] also with the possibility that I would be  forbidden to speak with the freedom with which I am speaking  now."</p>

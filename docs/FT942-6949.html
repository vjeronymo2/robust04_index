			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / C&amp;W up 19% and launching push into China Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, claims to be on the verge of a breakthrough in its bid to enter the Chinese telecoms services market. At yesterday's results meeting Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said the company had been designated 'preferred partner' by China's ministry of post and telecommunications for any joint ventures with overseas companies. Lord Young said the first ventures could be agreed this year. C&amp;W is using its 57 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom, its largest operation, as a launch pad for China. The group announced a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.09bn for the year to March 31. Before an exceptional gain a year-earlier, pre-tax profits were up 32 per cent, but the weakness of sterling accounted for about Pounds 95m of the advance. Lord Young said China was C&amp;W's priority, with the company ready to increase its gearing sharply from a year-end 12 per cent - on net debt of nearly Pounds 400m - if suitable opportunities arose. China's target for the year 2000 is to increase its number of phone lines from 40m to 114m - more than four times the number of lines in the UK. The most likely openings are expected to be for city-wide or regional projects, in which C&amp;W would operate with other partners, local and international. Lord Young said: 'We believe a gradual relaxation of investment rules will soon take place.' He and Mr Linus Cheung, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, held talks in Beijing in March with telecoms officials and Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president. At Pounds 4.7bn, C&amp;W's annual turnover rose 23 per cent. Earnings per share were 23.6p, against 23.7p (19.4p before exceptionals). A final dividend of 5.65p lifts the total 11 per cent to 8.25p (7.42p). C&amp;W experienced strong growth in all its main divisions, with turnover up 26 per cent at Hongkong Telecom, to Pounds 2.08bn, up 21 per cent, to Pounds 1.47bn, at Mercury Communications in the UK - in which C&amp;W has an 80 per cent stake - and 29 per cent up in the Caribbean region, to Pounds 477m. In the UK, Mercury's traffic grew by 37 per cent on last year. The operator now has 886,000 residential lines, up from 474,000 a year ago. It claims a UK market share of nearly 14 per cent, with a 25 per cent share of the large business market. Mercury One-2-One, the UK cellular mobile joint venture with US West, now has nearly 100,000 customers - about 15 per cent of the market within the M25. C&amp;W blamed slow growth earlier in the year on handset shortages. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said Mercury was held back by regulatory inequities and the obligation to pay BT a levy for maintaining the local network. Mercury has taken Oftel, the industry regulator, to court in a bid to gain a more favourable regulatory regime. Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, stressed the group's federal strategy. Despite the poor profitability of Mercury in comparison to C&amp;W's Hong Kong and Caribbean ventures, he said Europe remained an 'important centre'. 'To be a serious international operator we must have a strong European presence.' Lex, Page 18</p>

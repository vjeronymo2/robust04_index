			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Insurance agents set for change on their doorstep: The uncertain future of 'the man from the Pru' For about 10m households the appearance each month of the insurance agent to collect premiums and perhaps have a chat about their financial needs is a regular and familiar part of life. For the life insurance sector, this business is a rare area of stability in an industry which otherwise faces big changes. New policies in the industrial branch business - as this type of life insurance is known - have been declining slowly in recent years, from 2.05m in 1990 to 1.21m last year, but the number of policies in force is still 47m. It will take a long time for this type of business to wither, and in the meantime it represents a loyal and long-term customer base. But even this area is set to be affected by the regulatory and other shifts in the life industry. First, the government is planning consultation on deregulating the arrangements for industrial branch business. Second, and particularly important, is the requirement that from the start of next year, across the life insurance sector, customers be given fuller information about costs and charges. This area of the market is not particularly price sensitive, but there is a general recognition that disclosing charges will affect sales. The relatively few companies which deal in home service and cash collection business are responding to these impending changes in sharply different ways. Pearl yesterday launched a television advertising campaign intended to emphasise that its home service provides a more personal relationship than customers are likely to find at a bank or building society branch. Its line is that this personal element is seen as especially important as many services become more automated. By contrast, Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer - which in some ways epitomises the sector through 'the man from the Pru'  - has already taken steps to reduce the amount of industrial branch business it writes, though maintaining its home service sales force. These home service sales agents will still call at customers' homes, but payments are likely to be made through bank accounts, and visits would normally be less frequent. Industrial branch business itself is subject to separate legislative rules, which include regular and frequent cash or cheque collections of premiums - usually once a month. The range of policies which can be sold is limited, and premiums are often relatively small - smaller than life companies might accept for ordinary life policies. The combination of low premiums and high collection costs can have a marked effect on the return customers are likely to see for their investments. London &amp; Manchester, the life insurance and financial services group, estimates that for a Pounds 5-a-week premium 10-year policy, on a 10 per cent return, an IB policy will yield Pounds 3,150, while an ordinary policy will yield Pounds 3,840. Prudential says comparing typical IB and ordinary business rates of expenses  -at 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively - a 10-year endowment at 10 per cent rate of return for a Pounds 20-a-month premium will give Pounds 2,400 for an IB policy, compared with Pounds 3,200 for ordinary business. Against the background of this effect on the value of the full-term policy to the customer, it is no wonder that companies emphasise the other aspects of what they do. They point out that if they did not provide a service then their customers might not have an opportunity to make provision for themselves at all. Mr George Mack, financial director of United Friendly, said: 'A lot of our clients would find it difficult to manage their bank accounts.' They also emphasise the service element in their relationship. Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive of London &amp; Manchester, said: 'There's a lot more to the business than investment returns. A lot of elderly people value the weekly call of the collector.' Prudential takes a rather bleaker line. Mr Jim Sutcliffe, managing director of Prudential's home service, said: 'If you are going to be committed to providing products that are good value for money, you can't sell industrial branch business.' He estimates that four out of five IB customers have bank accounts, and so could benefit from the lower costs that would arise from paying premiums through direct debit or standing order. 'The right advice to most of those people is to open a bank account,' he says. said. It will take the new disclosure regime next year to see whether the IB customers themselves agree with that advice.</p>

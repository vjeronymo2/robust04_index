The  establishment of a socialist market economic structure will  inevitably create more historic opportunities for Qinghai's  development. Only by seizing the opportunity and taking  advantage of the resource superiority can the people of all  nationalities in Qinghai rapidly develop Qinghai's economy. Yin  Kesheng, secretary of the Qinghai provincial CPC committee,  explained the fundamental way to develop Qinghai's economy  during an interview with reporters soon after the Chinese New  Year.    "Qinghai, with a vast area indeed, has attractive natural  resources for people to exploit." On Qinghai's resources, Yin  Kesheng, who did petroleum prospecting work in the Qaidam desert  for a long time, showed a great deal of emotion. He said:  Qinghai has such resources as lake salt, hydroelectric power,  petroleum, natural gas, non-ferrous metals and asbestos, and the  confirmed deposits of them have a potential value of 8 trillion  yuan. More than 10 of its mineral deposits, such as sodium,  potassium, lithium, iodine, bromine, boron and asbestos rank  first in quantity among all provinces in China. The upper  reaches of the Huanghe in Qinghai are rich in hydroelectric  power resources which are scarce in other parts of China.  Qinghai's petroleum gas, non-ferrous metal, and gold resources  are also abundant. The confirmed natural gas deposit is now 50  billion cubic meters, while it was less than 10 billion cubic  meters in the late 1970's.    Since the start of reform and opening up, Qinghai has made  great efforts to exploit its resources and achieve prosperity,  and it has found the road to success. Now, potash fertilizer in  Chaerhan, the lead and zinc mine at Xitieshan, and asbestos at  Mangya have become large state construction projects. In recent  years, state-run enterprises, collectives, and individuals in  various localities in the province were busily engaged in  exploitation of resources. Baima County in Golog Zang Autonomous  Prefecture used to be a "national-class" poor county. In recent  years, the county has discovered gold deposits and greatly  improved its financial situation. Qilian County in Haibei Zang  Autonomous Prefecture has rapidly achieved financial  self-sufficiency by relying on mining asbestos, coal, lead and  zinc, copper and gold. Many counties, towns, and salt  enterprises in Qaidam Basin have developed themselves by  exploitation of natural resources. Now, there are some 100  state-run mining enterprises and nearly 300 collectively- run  and private mining enterprises in the province, and the output  value of the mining industry accounts for one-sixth of the  province's total industrial output value.    On future tasks, Yin Kesheng said: The progress of the  nation's modernization and the gradual widening of the gap  between eastern and western regions have further enhanced the  sense of urgency and crisis among the cadres and people in  Qinghai. At the same time, the daily increasing demand of  coastal and interior regions for energy and raw and processed  materials has provided a huge market for Qinghai's large-scale  exploitation of resources. In order to achieve a rapid economic  development, Qinghai must continue to exploit its natural  resources. He expressed the following views: First, we should  further emancipate our mind and have new ideas. In order to  open the door of the province, we must first open the door of  our mind and must not fear that others might come to take  advantage of our resources. Second, we should have confidence  and fear no hardship. Third, we should boldly use technology,  capital, and specialized personnel from the outside world and  other parts of our country. Fourth, we should make scientific  exploitation of resources and avoid working blindly and  recklessly. Repeated feasibility appraisal should be done to  planned projects. In economic development, we should consider  economic benefit, social benefit, environmental protection, and  resource preservation simultaneously. Fifth, we should pay  attention to the timely solution of problems and difficulties  during the exploitation of resources.    Qinghai is a province where ethnic minority people live in  compact communities. The people of Tibetan, Hui, Tu, Salar,  Mongol and other minority nationalities account for 42 percent  of the total population, and most natural resources are located  in regions of ethnic minority people. Yin Kesheng said: During  the course of natural resource exploitation, we must fully  consider the interests of local ethnic minority people. All  resource exploitation projects of the state, the province,  autonomous prefectures, prefectures, and counties should help  the development of local economy of minority nationalities and  play a promoting and radiating role. We should take the road of  common prosperity for all nationalities. Of course, the ethnic  minority regions should also contribute to the overall interest  of the state. Yin Kesheng firmly believes that Qinghai will  certainly take a greater step in resource exploitation, and its  development will be full of promise if the people of all  nationalities are united, continue to display the hard-working  plateau spirit, and work under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Reporter Kwon Yong-ki] </F>   [Text] The process of "filling the Blue House Secretariat  all-out with officials from the Republican Democratic Party  [RDP]" has now been completed. If the reshuffle late last year  of Blue House senior secretaries as well as Cabinet ministers  and vice ministers and four Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]  executive officers, signified a change in the "upper strictures"  of the Blue House, the party, and the Administration, then the  15 January reshuffle of Blue House secretaries and  administrators (Grades I through III) was a change in the "lower  structure" of President Kim's governing system in person. The 15  January reshuffle signifies the consummation of President Kim  Yong-sam's direct governing system because it filled the Blue  House Secretariat--the machinery that assists the president near  at hand--with people from the RDP faction.    The latest reshuffle of the Blue House Secretariat was  carried out according to the decision on an organizational  revamping of the presidential secretariat and its personnel  management that was adopted after long deliberation. Quite a few  non-RDP people were also appointed. Nevertheless the reshuffle  of the Blue House Secretariat is out of the ordinary in the  sense that it signifies an "all-out placement of people from the  RDP faction in the state machinery."    First, Secretary Kim Mu-song (Grade 1) has been reassigned  as  second secretary for civil affairs from his former post as first  secretary for administrative oversight. Kim To (Grade I), former  secretary for personnel administration under the senior  secretary for general affairs, is now the first secretary for  political affairs in the office of the senior secretary for  political affairs. Kim Kil-hwan (Grade 1), former first  secretary for civil affairs, is the secretary for civil affairs,  whose jurisdiction encompasses the combined jurisdictions  formerly under the now defunct offices of the first and second  secretaries for civil affairs. Kim Chae-sok, former LDP General  Affairs Bureau chief, has replaced Kim To as secretary for  personnel administration. In addition, a number of secretaries  and administrators from the RDP faction have been promoted.  Overall, the ratio of secretaries and administrators with the  RDP background to the total number may not be so high. But we  should examine the importance of the posts occupied by these  people from the RDP faction beyond their seemingly inconspicuous  numerical strength.    First, let's begin with the post of the first secretary for  administrative oversight, which Kim Mu-song occupies by  succeeding Kim Hyok-kyu, who is now governor of South Kyongsang  Province. The first duty of the first secretary for  administrative oversight is to draw up plans for audit and  inspection, work out programs for oversight, and play the role  of a clearing house in inter-agency consultations and  coordination among inspection authorities. In fact, it was this  secretary who set the direction for the Administration's  oversight activities for this year. When a joint meeting of  officials of inspection agencies, such as the fourth coordinator  at the Office of the Prime Minister, public prosecutors, and  members of the Board of Audit and Inspection is planned, the  first Blue House secretary for administrative oversight makes a  necessary advance arrangement. His second duty is to check and  evaluate the performances of high-ranking government officials  with Grade I and above and executive-class officials of  government-financed organizations. Records of these evaluations  are used as a reference material in taking personnel actions  relative to Cabinet ministers and vice ministers and other  important officials.    Kim Mu-song, first secretary for administrative oversight,  who was the focus of attention in the latest reshuffle of Blue  House secretaries and administrators, is a younger member of the  DRP faction who enjoys an unswerving trust of President Kim. He,  at 43 years old, is the fifth son of Kim Yong-chu (deceased),  the founder of Chonbang Co., Ltd. His father-in-law is Choe  Chi-hwan (deceased), who served five terms in the National  Assembly as an independent and then as DRP assemblyman. When Kim  Yong-sam opened the Institute for National Affairs in 1983 after  being released from house arrest subsequent to his hunger  strike, Kim Mu-song became a managing director of and an expert  adviser to the institute, thereby joining the Sangdo-tong inner  circle for the first time [Sangdo-tong is the name of the  residential block in Seoul where President Kim's private  residence is located]. Subsequently, he became a member of the  Council for the Promotion of Democracy [CPD], chief of the RDP  financial bureau and then of the RDP general affairs bureau, and  chief of the RDP parliamentary affairs office. In 1992 he became  the chief of the overall control bureau of the Committee for  Promoting the Kim Yong-sam Candidacy and a policy affairs  adviser to candidate Kim Yong-sam. Following President Kim's  election, he was in charge of the administrative office of the  Transition Committee. With the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam  administration, Kim Mu-song entered the Blue House as second  secretary for civil affairs.    The post of the secretary for civil affairs, which combines  the duties of the abolished posts of the first and second  secretaries for civil affairs, is an important post that  directly assists President Kim in the execution of his  presidential duties. The duty of the secretary for civil affairs  is, among others, to keep tabs on the drift of public sentiment  and report public opinion to the president as it is. It is also  his duty to report to the president about public reaction to  actions taken by the president in performing his presidential  duties. Kim Kil-hwan, who holds this post, entered politics in  the 1980's as an official of the Democratic Korea Party, and  subsequently became an expert adviser to the then RDP  Parliamentary Affairs Committee. After the three-party merger,  he served as the second chief of the DLP Policy Research Office.  He is a career party bureaucrat with a DLP background.    The post of the second secretary for political affairs,  currently held by Kim To, has been newly created in connection  with the latest reshuffle. Yi Won-chong, new senior secretary  for political affairs, upon assuming his new post, strengthened  the organization of his office, with particular emphasis on its  function dealing with government-party relations. In the past  this function was handled by Yun Won-chung, secretary for  party-government relations. However, being a person with a DJP  background, Yun was not too familiar with the inner affairs of  the opposition parties. Naturally, he neglected matters  concerning party-government relations. In connection with the  latest reshuffle, the hitherto single post of the secretary for  political affairs has been split into two posts, namely the post  of the first secretary and that of the second secretary for  political affairs. Yun Won-chung is the first secretary for  political affairs, and Kim To is the second secretary. This  means that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong's range of activity has  expanded accordingly.    Secretary Kim To is an administrative type men belonging to  the RDP faction, with his secretarial background at Sangdo-tong.  He joined the Sangdo-tong secretariat during the "Seoul Spring"  in 1980, but withdrew from politics in the wake of 17 May [1980]  incident. He returned to the RDP fold following the 13th general  election in 1988.    Kim Chae-sok, 52, who joined the Blue House for the first  time by replacing Kim To as secretary for personnel  administration under the senior secretary for general affairs,  worked as a secretary when President Kim opened his first  factional office in 1971. He is among the former "veteran"  members of the Sangdo-tong secretarial staff, and may be  regarded as one of President Kim's close aides. After quitting  politics following the 17 May 1980 incident, he returned to  President Kim's side as chief of the RDP Bureau of Organization  following the 13th general election in 1988. Last year when the  LDP carried out a reduction in force for its administrative  personnel, Kim Chae-sok took command of the downsizing operation  in person under then DLP Secretary General Choe Hyong-u. Kim  Chae-sok, a native of Yonggwang, South Cholla Province, is one  of the few in the RDP faction who hail from the Honam area.    The most salient feature of the latest reshuffle of Blue  House secretaries is that "the president's people on the same  wavelength" with him were placed on key strategic positions,  such as those for handling political and civil affairs. When  President Kim organized his first Blue House secretarial staff  in last February, some senior secretaries were reluctant to have  personages from the RDP faction appointed as secretaries under  them. That is why quite a few of carryover secretaries from  President No Tae-u's secretariat survived after President Kim  took over the reins of government. But now their positions are  held by people from the RDP faction.    Reportedly, it has been decided that the newly established  position of the secretary for planning and coordination (held by  Kim Kwang-nim, junior grade II-A official dispatched from the  Planning Board) will only handle matters relating to liaison and  coordination between the offices of the senior Blue House  secretaries. The original plan was to have filled this post with  someone with Grade I from the RDP faction, but it was scrapped  because the dominant view was against it on the grounds that it  was like putting a fifth wheel to a coach.    The entry into the Blue House by Yi Won-chong as senior  secretary for political affairs late last year marked the  beginning of the process of bringing the Blue House secretariat  completely under the control of personages from the RDP faction.  Observers say that Senior Secretary Yi Won-chong, together with  Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong and Hong In-kil, senior  secretary for general affairs, is doing his best to assist the  president. In addition to those secretaries who were reassigned  to other secretarial posts in the latest reshuffle, people with  the Sangdo-tong secretarial background also occupy other  important posts in the Blue House Secretariat. They include: Kim  Ki-su, chief the presidential entourage office; Chang Hak-no,  chief of Annex I; Chong Pyong-kuk, chief of Annex II; Kim  Tae-hwan, secretary to the secretary general; and Pak Yong-hwan,  chief of the Chunchu Hall. Quite a few of former Sangdo-tong  secretaries are working as administers to assist Blue House  secretaries. Among them are Yi Song-hon and Kim Yong-chun in the  office of the senior secretary for political affairs; and Pyo  Yang-ho in the office of the senior secretary for public  information.    Said a Blue House secretary: "Secretary General Pak  Kwan-yong  can now move around pretty lightly with a heavy load removed  from his shoulders. In the past some senior secretaries  misconstrued the true intentions of the president, often causing  delays in the conduct of business. But with the appointment of  Yi Won-chong as senior secretary and the filling many of the  secretarial and administrative posts with people from the RDP  faction, this shortcoming is disappearing."</p>

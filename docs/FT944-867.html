			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: Arrest of the corporate police - Financial managers need a new outlook Financial managers should stop behaving as corporate policemen whose main role is to oversee operating managers, according to a report* by Conference Board Europe, a business membership organisation which researches management policy and practices. Instead financial managers should be increasingly prepared to serve and share control with line managers, says the research, which is based on case studies, interviews and a survey of 250 North American and European companies. 'A detached, control-laden finance function does not respond to the new imperative to execute flexible, worldwide product and customer strategies,' it says. 'The traditional finance function role as guardian of internal company resources distances staff from the marketplace.' Finance staff should offer value-added services to line managers, by participating in operating business meetings and helping line managers with competitive analysis, it argues. Finance specialists' own perception of their role often differs from that of other employees. 'Although a majority of finance managers believe that they already have a business-advocate mindset, the majority of non-finance managers express the opinion that finance personnel behave like corporate policemen,' the report says. The attempt to change the role of the finance department is often accompanied by a drive to reduce its cost, a measure that was viewed as a top priority by a third of the respondents to the survey. The cost of the finance function is particularly high in US firms, which employ three times as many finance people as Japanese firms, the report says. The explanation partly lies with the existence in US firms of elaborate accounting control systems - separate from operating systems - with large staffs that monitor line managers' performance. *The Changing Role of the Finance Function.

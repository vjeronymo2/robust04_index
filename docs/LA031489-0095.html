			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mild Recession Predicted: A slowdown in consumer spending will tip the U.S.  economy into a mild recession this year, but recovery will be swift, a leading  California economist predicted. In a speech in San Francisco, Jerry Jordan,  chief economist for First Interstate Bank, said he expects the economy to turn  down in April and pick up in October. Consumers will cut back purchases of new  cars, boats and other luxury items in the second and third quarters, Jordan  said, but stronger exports will keep the manufacturing sector from being pulled  down by the drop in consumer spending. Near the end of the summer, interest  rates will begin to come down as the Federal Reserve Board eases its  restrictions on the money supply, he said, and that will relieve some of the  pressure on consumers' wallets and push the economy up.  </P></p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt out performs easier continental trend THE WEAKER dollar was a source of concern, but one not always acted upon in bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT expressed some worries about the lower dollar and last week's money supply figures but its equities outperformed most of Europe as the DAX index closed 2.99 higher at 1,757.12 after a 1.02 rise to 696.85 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn. Mr James Cornish of County NatWest said that there was good economic news yesterday, as West German import prices for May fell by 2.5 per cent year on year and, after hours, as Bavaria became the fourth western German state to report a slight easing in inflation trends in June. County continues to see Germany on an improving economic trend in the second half of this year. Mr Cornish's colleague, Mr Adrian Hopkinson, said that disposable incomes could improve by 4 per cent in real terms in July/December after some weakness in the first six months, as the solidarity surcharge on income taxes is removed and inflation continues to fall. Meanwhile, first half problems constraints were reflected, again, in the packaging company Schmalbach-Lubeca and its parent, Viag. Destocking of beverages and conserves has been unkind to Schmalbach, and its sister Viag subsidiary, Gerresheimer Glas, said Mr Hopkinson. Schmalbach fell another DM21 to DM474 yesterday, Gerresheimer by DM14.30 to DM320, just above its low for the year and Viag by another DM14.50 to DM392.70. ZURICH's SMI index ended 11.1 higher at 1,846.6 after an early high of 1,852.5. Pharmaceuticals rose in spite of the lower dollar, which tends to hurt export earnings. Ciba-Geigy recovered from last week's pressure on potential health risks of nicotine patches, the registered shares putting on SFr60 to SFr3,310. Sandoz was supported by presentations to analysts in the US, the certificates rising SFr40 to SFr2,990. PARIS ended lower in dull trading, unsettled by news in the afternoon of the assassination of Algeria's head of state. The CAC-40 index, which had risen as high as 1,925.62, fell back to close 8.01 lower at 1,907.30, just above the day's low of 1,906.21. Turnover, at a moderate FFr2.7bn, was mainly generated by trading in Generale des Eaux, up FFr11 at FFr2,195 ahead of the expiry of its equity warrants this week, and arbitrage activity in Total, which added FFr2.70 to FFr235.5. Alcatel and Elf were also active. Paribas was one of the day's more prominent losers, falling FFr11 or 3.1 per cent to FFr346 on fears about its exposure to the real estate sector. MILAN failed to be stimulated by the long-awaited nomination of the government, or by Friday's agreement between Olivetti and Digital whereby Digital would take 10 per cent in the Italian company. Dealers feared that the failure of the four-party coalition government to get the backing of the Republican and Communist parties would lessen its chances of tackling the country's budget problems. The Comit index fell 1.56 to 460.56, its lowest close since 16 February 1988 when the index closed at 453.59. Turnover was estimated at more than Friday's L86bn. Olivetti, which had been suspended on Friday, closed L89 down from Thursday's close at L3,189 and fell to L3,120 after hours as the speculative fizz evaporated from the stock. The holding company Cir stood L52 down at L1,773. Generali, initially boosted by its own results, closed L250 higher at L28,300, but retreated to L27,875 later. MADRID ended a fraction above its 1992 low on economic pessimism, the general index closing 4.17, or 1.7 per cent down at 239.12, in turnover of Pta13bn, a little higher than in previous sessions. Construction saw the worst falls, led by Asland with a drop of Pta190, or 11.1 per cent to Pta1,525. Dragados fell by 6.6 per cent, and Uralita by 6.2 per cent. Telefonica was the most active stock, down Pta25 at Pta1,020 in volume of 2.73m shares. AMSTERDAM was weighed down by a 3.8 per cent fall in Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium manufacturer, which dropped Fl 2 to Fl 50.30 following Friday's news that it planned to make further cuts in its already reduced 1992 investment programme. BRUSSELS was narrowly mixed in thin trading as the Bel-20 index eased 1.40 to 1,165.28 in turnover of BFr569m. Petrofina bucked the trend, climbing BFr125 or 1.2 per cent to BFr10,600. STOCKHOLM fell on higher interest rates and the weaker dollar, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 11.3 lower at 909.7, a new low for the year. Ericsson B fell SKr4 to SKr137. OSLO also hit a new 1992 low. The all-share index closed 5.45 lower at 399.31, depressed by high real interest rates and widening pessimism about prospects for a quick economic upturn. TEL AVIV, meanwhile, hit a new high in very active turnover of Shk137.2m following news that Germany might grant Israel billions of marks in loan guarantees. The blue chip index rose 2.55 to 148.05.</p>

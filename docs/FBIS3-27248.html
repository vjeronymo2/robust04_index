			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, February 19 (XINHUA) -- China's first  Sino-foreign incorporated research institute, the  Tianjin-Australia Building Materials Research Institute, was set  up yesterday in Tianjin.    The pioneering institute was jointly sponsored by the  Tianjin  Building Materials Research Institute and the Building Research  Center of the University of New South Wales in Australia.    Establishment of the institute marks the beginning of the  adoption of a new way for Chinese scientific research  institutions to cooperate with foreign partners.    The institute will also adapt to international practices in  management and operation.    Instead of depending on government allocation of funds for  research as do most other Chinese research institutes, it  directly contacts relevant domestic and Australian enterprises  to define research projects and seek financial support.    The institute has already been commissioned and financed by  Australia's CSR Ltd, the Asia-Assistance Bureau of the  Australian Government and the Science and Technology Commission  of Tianjin municipal government for four research projects,  including exploration of new building materials, technology of  construction, quality management and construction costs.    According to Liang Su, chief of the Science and Technology  Commission of Tianjin municipal government, establishment of  such Sino-foreign research institutes will promote exchanges of  domestic experts and research institutions with foreign  counterparts and enable China to keep pace with foreign  countries in technology research, production and marketing.    He also said that more Sino-foreign cooperating institutes  will be set up in succession as part of the efforts to promote  the reform of the country's scientific institutions.    The newly-founded institute has also facilitated the  establishment on the same day of a Sino-Australian building  materials company -- CSR Tianjin Ready Mix Ltd.    It was jointly funded by CSR Ltd of Australia and Tianjin  Building Materials Supplies Corporation and has commissioned two  research projects at the research institute.</p>

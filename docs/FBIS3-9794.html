After the success scored in the 1992 local elections, the  Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party, which had won then 15  percent of the votes, had no similar performance in the  parliamentary elections held the same year, currently holding  representation only in the Senate.    Victor Surdu says: "We are looking for a new programme,  based on the doctrine called modern agrarianism, of neoliberal  concept, which sets property beyond everything. Starting from  Romania's ties, we consider that we must gather all our efforts  to solve the issues confronting Romania's agriculture such as  involving a major number of extremely active people in the  agriculture. If we start this important economic sector, job  opportunities will show for almost 60 percent of the population,  for which we could provide social protection and the dignity to  have a job."    On the previous contacts with the ruling party and as  regards  the Agrarian Party's position as to the Vacaroiu cabinet, the  Agrarian president said: "The dialogue with the Party of Social  Democracy has led us to the conclusion that, if we cannot come  into power, we are situated in the opposition which however  supports the Vacaroiu government, but only under the provisions  that government legislative decisions and initiatives would not  run counter our programme."    "After the dialogue with all parliamentary parties, the  ruling Party of Social Democracy should assume full  responsibility for everything that happens in Romania at  present," Victor Surdu was quoted as saying.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks may have accepted discount on Battersea debt THE SYNDICATE of banks which in effect controls the Battersea Power Station site is believed to have taken a discount on its debt of more than 90 per cent in a deal that will ultimately pass control to a Hong Kong property family. The Hwang family, who are acquiring the site, refused to disclose the price they paid for the debt in a deal completed yesterday. But it is understood that the syndicate, led by Bank of America, accepted less than Pounds 10m for signing over its claim on the 31-acre site - its collateral for a debt thought to total more than Pounds 100m, including interest and penalty fees. The deal leaves the Hwangs studing options for acquiring the site from its owner, Battersea Leisure, a company owned by Mr John Broome, whose plans to transform the site into a leisure complex ran into financial difficulties three years ago when restoration work went over budget. The Hwangs could repossess the 31-acre site and the power station building from Battersea Leisure. An alternative might be to appoint a receiver for the company, who would put the site on the open market. As owners of the debt the Hwangs would have the option to top any offer that was less than the total debt. Mr Victor Hwang, the 39-year-old chief executive of the Hong Kong Parkview Group, the Hong Kong listed company in which his family has a 75 per cent controlling stake, said that he wanted to preserve the 1930s power station building, which is listed for its architectural and historical interest. 'Certainly there is no intention to tear it down,' he said, adding that he would be looking at making a cohesive development on the surrounding site, possibly in a style to complement the building's Art Deco architecture.</p>

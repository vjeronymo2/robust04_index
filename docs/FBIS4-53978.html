			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Wake Up"] </F>   [Text] The king once said that foreign military aid might  be the only measure to end the ongoing conflict between the  Royal Government and the Khmer Rouge.    This statement triggered strong reaction from the alarmed  Thai prime minister and members of the Royal Thai Government to  the point that they called on the ASEAN countries to lobby  against military aid from Western countries to Phnom Penh.  However, many politicians condemn such a response from Thailand  and regard it as an act of interference in internal affairs of  the Kingdom of Cambodia.    Political analysts on Cambodia revealed that Thailand does  not want war in Cambodia to end because the fighting in Cambodia  has all along enabled Thailand to reap massive profits from  Cambodia's wealth, especially from the rich forests and gems  along the border.    The analysts added that no country has the right to prohibit  Cambodia from getting foreign military aid for strengthening her  army. Cambodia has the right to receive the assistance and is  able to prove to Thailand how to end the war through military  means.    Is it now not the time for all of us, Cambodians, to wake up  to face reality and stop quarrelling? Are there still Cambodian  politicians who agree with such an assumption of the Thai side?</p>

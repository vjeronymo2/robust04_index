			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 23, 1993, the Texas Food Industry Association, the National American Wholesale Grocers' Association, the International Foodservice Distributors Association, and the National Grocers Association filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (District Court) alleging that the issuance of the interim rule violated the APA and requested that the Court issue a preliminary injunction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 14, the District Court granted plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the Department from enforcing or implementing the interim or final regulations against the plaintiffs or any other affected entities or individuals. The Department filed a motion with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on October 15 to stay the preliminary injunction and allow the safe handling regulations to take effect. This motion was denied on October 19, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department believed it would prevail on the APA issue in further litigation, it recognized that a notice and comment rulemaking would take less time than further litigating the APA issue with the plaintiffs. Due to the importance of protecting public health and the related need to provide this crucial information to consumers as quickly as possible, the Department published simultaneously on November 4, 1993, a proposal to amend the regulations to require safe handling instructions on raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products, and a final rule withdrawing the provisions of the interim and final rules (58 FR 43478 and 58 FR 52856). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) direct the Secretary of Agriculture to maintain meat and poultry inspection programs designed to assure consumers that meat and poultry products distributed to them (including imports) are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

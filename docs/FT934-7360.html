			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (8): The industry looks west - Two recent surveys offer grounds for optimism / The M25 AROUND THE fringes of London is a tarmac tidemark left by the city's Big Bang. Hundreds of empty buildings litter the M25 landscape. 'It epitomises everything that went wrong during the boom,' says Stephen Mallen, head of research at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. 'Banks were throwing money at developers, who indulged in some of the worst excesses of speculation.' More than half the 14m sq ft of available office space around the motorway corridor is concentrated in a short stretch between the M4 and the A1(M), according to Mr Mallen. In some bloated centres, a fifth of space stands empty, and rent levels have halved since the boom. Many obsolete older buildings may never see another tenant, as they cannot compete with a plethora of new ones. Go east of Potters Bar or the A23, however, and such excesses disappear. Big office schemes are rare, because the money that did flow into the eastern zone went into its traditional strengths - distribution and retailing. It is no coincidence that Costco, the US warehouse club, which recently overcame blocking moves by Britain's biggest retailers, has chosen to build its first UK outlet next to the Lakeside Shopping Centre at Thurrock, where the M25 crosses the Thames. It might, therefore, seem logical to look at this under-developed area for any recovery. The government favours development along the East Thames corridor, and the Channel link will help depressed areas of south Essex and north Kent. Site preparation is already going on among big landowners like Blue Circle, but any general uplift seems unlikely to take off for several years, because of political prevarications. The Channel link is likely to be delayed yet again by spending limits in the Budget. 'And the government has yet to put its money where its mouth is over the East Thames Corridor,' says Mr Mallen. So the industry is looking westward for more immediate opportunities, and two studies provide evidence that this is not a forlorn hope. Tenants absorbed 3.7m sq ft of space in buildings greater than 5,000 sq ft in the first nine months of this year - 12 per cent more than that in the whole of 1992, according to a Richard Ellis survey. KFR, which sets a higher threshold of 10,000 sq ft for the buildings it monitors, comes to similar conclusions. The overall vacancy rate dropped to just over 13.5 per cent in the three months to September, the largest drop since it began quarterly reports 18 months ago. 'The market has definitely turned since the beginning of this year,' says Mr Mallen. Even more welcome to banks nursing burned fingers is the fact that the new space they funded is in greatest demand, accounting for 75 per cent of deals. Much of the property is going to local companies, which do not have the same problems getting rid of existing space as in central London. They are taking the chance to grab high-quality buildings at rents ranging from Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 a sq ft, compared with as much as Pounds 30 in the boom. Industry and business services accounted for more than half this year's take-up, with computing companies and the public sector absorbing around 15 per cent each, says Richard Ellis. Big names are also back in the market. Important deals in the last few months have included the 96,000 sq ft Lansdowne Building in Croydon, taken by Tarmac; Eastern Gate, Bracknell, (63.500 sq ft) let to Mortgage Services; and Athena Court, Hounslow (54,000 sq ft) to BSkyB. Chris Hiatt, of Jones Lang Wootton, which has carried out a detailed analysis of the office market west of London, points out that, while the area as a whole has up to five years' supply available, some centres are much closer to equilibrium. Vacancy rates in new buildings have fallen below 5 per cent in centres like Windsor, Maidenhead, Staines, Croydon and Woking. Others, such as Guildford, Redhill and High Wycombe, are below the psychologically important 10 per cent level. JLW forecasts stronger economic recovery in the region than in the rest of the UK, pushing tenant demand back to its long-term average, just at a time when minimal new space is coming on to the market. Shortages of high-quality buildings are already emerging, leading to the first inquiries in nearly three years from developers interested in speculative building, says Tony Fisher, of Chesterton. He picks out AXA Equity and Law, which spent Pounds 8.3m to take over Maidenhead Business Park to create up to 300,000 sq ft. 'This trend will continue on the assumption of demand outweighing supply, and land values being offered at today's prices, although whether this can be sustained for much longer remains to be seen.' Few expect a return to the lemming-like rush of the boom years, when planning changes enabled every industrial estate to magically transform overnight into an office park. Andrew Nesbitt, AXA property director, does not intend starting development for at least a year, unless he can net one of several major names currently in the market for space. But with JLW forecasting a return to rental growth from the end of next year, more investors will be scouting around the this section of the M25 in the near future. At the opposite extreme, others will be looking for industrial opportunities out in the eastern sector, where rents of Pounds 7 a sq ft and more now match former boom centres like Heathrow, but land is far cheaper and planning rules less restrictive.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / S African petrol price likely to spark unrest SOUTH AFRICA faces renewed economic conflict following the cabinet's unexpected decision to proceed with a petrol price increase in the face of widespread opposition. The country's main trade unions and commuter taxi organisations have responded by announcing a programme of mass action involving demonstrations, pickets and marches aimed at the government and oil companies. The Consumer Council, Automobile Association and the AHI, representing Afrikaner business interests, have also expressed disappointment at the cabinet's decision. The dispute disrupts recent multi-party unity on issues of economic policy such as the debt rescheduling agreement and an offer to Gatt to simplify and lower tariffs within the Uruguay round of trade talks. It will raise renewed questions among foreign investors about future economic policy in the country. There has been a considerable surge in investor interest in South Africa following the call two weeks ago by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, for the ending of economic sanctions. In an effort to defuse opposition the government agreed to refer the 4 per cent petrol price increase to the National Economic Forum (NEF), a tripartite body on which business, labour and government are represented. An NEF task-force had recommended this week that the price rise should be suspended for two months from mid-October to mid-December. President F W de Klerk said the cabinet's decision was 'economically justified' and rejected accusations he was merely trying to show that he was not a lame-duck president.</p>

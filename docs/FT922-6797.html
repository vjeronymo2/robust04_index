			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sega lifts profits and increases dividend SEGA Enterprises, the video game and toy maker, doubled profits to Y33.5bn (Dollars 251.87m) for the year to end-March. Unlike most Japanese companies, it sharply increased its dividend. Comparisons are made difficult by a change in the company's accounting year, but sales rose from Y106.6bn to Y213.3bn on strong demand for Sega games in the US. After-tax profit was dragged down to Y14bn by the settlement of a US patent dispute over image-display technology, which resulted in the company writing off Dollars 28.67m of the agreed Dollars 43m payout to a US inventor. The only other disappointment was the impact of the Tokyo share price collapse on short-term holdings of stocks, which are showing unrealised losses of Y235.8m, up from Y25.5m at the end of March last year. The increase came in spite of the company almost halving its short-term holdings to Y1.35bn. Even though Sega apparently paid the Dollars 28.67m out of its cash reserves, these rose, from Y29bn to Y72.5bn, following a surge in US sales during the Christmas period, when it took market share from the industry leader, Nintendo. Yesterday's results came as Sega of America, the US subsidiary of the parent company, and Sony Electronic Publishing announced a marketing agreement. Under the deal, Sony will produce and market Sega video games and interactive entertainment, Reuters reports. Sony Electronic will develop games for all Sega cartridge-based platforms. The deal also provides opportunities for the development of Sega titles through Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment.</p>

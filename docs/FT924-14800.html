			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Quotes of the day 'I've got a little list, Of benefit offenders who I'll soon be rooting out And who never would be missed.' Peter Lilley on social security (after WS Gilbert) 'To lose one election may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness. Three makes it a habit. But four makes opposition a profession.' Peter Lilley on the Labour party (after Oscar Wilde) 'I'm always accused of being a Euro-freak. No one who has worked in the European Community can be a Euro-freak. It is a nightmare. It is the most frustrating, pusillanimous organisation you have ever come across.' Tristan Garel-Jones Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe 'It's not an echo of the past, it's an insight into the future.' John Biffen on Maastricht 'If John Smith has lost the spirit to oppose the government, I'm glad to see comrade Tebbit hasn't' Labour party member attending Euro-sceptic fringe meeting 'There are more needy cases for taxpayers' money than financing holidays for either the rich and famous and their entourage, or New Age Travellers.' Ian Bridge Nottingham North 'I've been booed for years at party conferences.' Sir Edward Heath former prime minister 'There are no green shoots if you don't plant your bulbs.' Richard Reeves chairman, Essex SW Euro-constituency and company secretary, British Steel</p>

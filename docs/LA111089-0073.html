			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE ALLEGES FRAUD IN SUING UNITED EDUCATION;  </P> <P> CONSUMERS: THE SUIT CLAIMS THAT A UNIT OF THE COMPANY MISLED STUDENTS IN ADS  AND OFFERED SHODDY EDUCATION. THE ENCINO FIRM HAD NO COMMENT.  </P> <P> California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has slapped United Education &amp;  Software with a $24-million lawsuit that says one of the institutions run by  the Encino-based trade school operator misled its students and provided shoddy  education.  </P> <P> The consumer protection action, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court,  seeks $22 million in restitution, a $2-million fine and an injunction against  National Technical Schools, a Los Angeles computer mail-order school run by  United Education &amp; Software.  </P> <P> The complaint says National Technical Schools violated state advertising laws  by falsely claiming that graduates of its program would qualify for entry-level  computer jobs, that student loans wouldn't have to be repaid until the  graduates obtained jobs, that the school's dropout rate was far below the  actual dropout rate of up to 91% and that students would receive a free  computer. It also said students were promised prompt assistance by dialing a  toll-free number but that calls were often returned days or weeks later.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Van de Kamp blasted the school for preying on  low-income students and victimizing taxpayers who ultimately pay for  government-guaranteed student loans that go into default. "This flagrant abuse  of the government-guaranteed student loan program must end immediately, and  full restitution must be paid," he said.  </P> <P> A United Education &amp; Software spokesman said the company would not comment  on the attorney general's action until its lawyers finish studying the suit.  United Education &amp; Software's president and chief executive, Aaron Cohen,  is also named as a defendant.  </P> <P> Jerry Smilowitz, deputy attorney general, said the state would immediately seek  a temporary injunction against National Technical Schools, preventing the  school from continuing its "misrepresentative practices" until the suit goes to  trial. The $22 million in restitution sought by the state would cover all loans  taken out by the 9,800 students who enrolled in the school since August, 1987.  The money would be repaid to students, lenders and agencies that guaranteed the  loans.  </P> <P> Smilowitz declined to say whether any of United Education &amp; Software's 25  other schools were under investigation. But, he said, "We are looking at the  (United Education &amp; Software) enterprise as a whole."  </P> <P> The complaint is the latest setback for the troubled trade school operator. A  U.S. Department of Education audit released last month found that students  attending National Technical Schools from August, 1987, to November, 1988,  didn't qualify for government-guaranteed loans because the school didn't meet  minimum federal standards.  </P> <P> The audit said courses at National Technical Schools were too short, the school  didn't make proper refunds on loans after students dropped out, students who  were academically unprepared were admitted and costs were misrepresented.  </P> <P> In response to the audit, the California Student Aid Commission, the state  agency that administers the federal student loan program, banned National  Technical Schools from receiving new federal loan money. The U.S. District  Court in Los Angeles has since granted a temporary restraining order to United  Education &amp; Software, preventing the state agency from implementing the ban  until a hearing is held Nov. 13.  </P> <P> The company last week said it and a Minnesota student loan agency, the Higher  Education Assistance Foundation, agreed to suspend any legal action against  each other until the Department of Education makes a final decision about  whether National Technical Schools should continue to be eligible for the  student loan program.  </P> <P> United Education &amp; Software is also embroiled in a lawsuit stemming from  problems uncovered last year at its former student loan processing subsidiary.  </P> <P> A federal probe found widespread bungling at the loan processing unit,  including failure to notify delinquent borrowers. Bank of America said that it  and several other banks that backed the loans could lose as much as $650  million because the federal government said it would not honor the loans. The  banks have since sued Bank of America, which was the trustee for the loans, and  United Education &amp; Software was named as a third-party defendant.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAYS 'DELIGHTED' BY SHERIFF'S POLICY  </P> <P> We were delighted to see the article by John Mitchell (Times, July 19) about  the improvement of the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station's relationship with the  lesbian and gay community under Capt. Rachel Burgess. We also applaud Capt.  Burgess' efforts to meet with lesbian and gay representatives, to sensitize the  deputies under her command, and to recruit openly lesbian and gay people into  the force.  </P> <P> As Capt. Burgess noted, while there are lesbians and gay men on the force, none  of them are currently open about their orientation. We are hopeful that in the  supportive environment she is fostering they will feel more comfortable about  being more visible as lesbians and gay men.  </P> <P> JEHAN AGRAMA  </P> <P> Co-president  </P> <P> Gay and Lesbian Alliance  </P> <P> Against Defamation  </P></p>

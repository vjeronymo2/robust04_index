			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-MEXICO POLICE OFFICIAL SEIZED IN JOURNALIST'S DEATH  </P> <P> Authorities arrested the former chief of a federal police agency in the 1984  slaying of a crusading newspaper columnist. Gunshots and tear gas were fired  before he gave up, a domestic news service said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Authorities had issued a warrant Sunday for Jose Antonio Zorrilla's arrest in  the fatal shooting of Manuel Buendia, who had been a vocal critic of corruption  in government.  </P> <P> Police exchanged gunfire with Zorrilla outside his home, and one officer was  wounded, the Excelsior news service reported. Police called for reinforcements  and soon more than 70 uniformed officers and about 50 vehicles surrounded the  residence.  </P> <P> Local news reports said Dist. Atty. Ignacios Morales Lechuga arrived about half  an hour later, and the men talked inside the residence before Zorrilla  surrendered.  </P> <P> Morales Lechuga said in a statement that he met with Zorrilla and drove him to  Morales Lechuga's office, where he was arrested. He did not mention the gunfire  and confrontation at Zorrilla's home.  </P> <P> The government news agency Notimex said Juventino Prado, a commander with the  Mexico City Police Department's intelligence division and a former lieutenant  under Zorrilla, was hospitalized on Tuesday with a nervous breakdown.  </P> <P> According to investigators in the case, Prado accompanied Zorrilla when he  arrived at the scene soon after the May 30, 1984, shooting, Notimex said.  </P> <P> In an interview on television Monday night, Morales Lechuga had identified  Buendia as the "intellectual author" of the Buendia slaying. Authorities have  refused to comment on a possible motive.  </P> <P> Buendia, a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior and the author of  several books that tackled sensitive targets like official corruption, drug and  weapons trafficking and the CIA, was gunned down in a downtown parking garage.  </P> <P> Zorrilla has long been suspected of concealing evidence and intimidating  witnesses.  </P></p>

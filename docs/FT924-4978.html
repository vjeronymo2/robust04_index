			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: A 'Last Supper' to savour - Radio THE Government's green paper on the BBC was covered in this paper on Wednesday, now we wait for public reaction. Myself, I believe the BBC's local radio stations are a pointless challenge to the independent franchises; and I would not be against privatising Radio 1. Otherwise the current set-up seems to me workmanlike; the question of programme quality is the business of the various controllers. Heaven knows, they have enough criticism from the public. It may be argued that its value, as revealed in Radio 4's Feedback and the correspondence columns of the Radio Times, is pretty low, but the solution to this hardly lies in the hands of the Corporation. The fortunes of Classic FM suggest that there is a more thoughtful public as well. I heard an enjoyable recording of Bruckner's 3rd Symphony on Tuesday when I might have heard Alexander Goehr's Psalm IV on Radio 3 or Kaleidoscope on Radio 4. The nicest thing I have heard this week has been Rabbi Lionel Blue's Last Supper on Radio 3 on Sunday. His guests were presenter Leslie Forbes and a Dominican monk; his basic dish was of almonds, grated apple, red wine, cinnamon, and parsley, which he reckoned was the mortar that the Israelites used to build the Pyramids. Then eggs in salt water. The synoptic Gospels differed from St. John on the date; they said it was on the Passover, John says Jesus was crucified before the Passover. There was talk of other things too - for example, St. Paul wrote of 'women co-workers', but such references were edited out. It was a friendly meeting of beliefs, but no one answered the serious questions - who cooked the Last Supper? who washed up? In this case it was Rabbi Blue; he gave us a commentary. Radio 3's Sunday Play, The Pool at Bethseda by Allan Cubitt, was not a biblical piece, but about death from cancer. Dr Daniel Pearce, very ill, sees visions, and finds himself at Bart's in 1735, where Hogarth, painting the eponymous picture, casts him as Christ. There is much correspondence between the 18th-century figures and the folk that surround him in his own day. The scheme is clever, though not ideally worked out; the doctor's ultimate death, for instance, is too prolonged, and there are some rather self-conscious soliloquies. But I thought it a moving play, the author's first for radio, and well directed by Susan Hogg, with Mick Ford as Dr Pearce and Danny Webb as Hogarth and his 20th-century version. Two new series on Radio 4 seem unpromising to me. The Locker Room on Saturdays is like a man's Woman's Hour, presided over by Tom Robinson, only the talk is less intelligent, just changing-room chat. The Friend in the Corner, on Wednesdays, is a wireless set, and gives a taste of broadcasts in past years, the first being 1936. What did we have? A lot of religion. Who were our heroes? Gipsy Petulengro, Malcolm Campbell, CB Fry. The Crystal Palace burnt down, there was a bus-strike, the abdication speech of King Edward VIII was read by the Speaker. The news was copyright by Reuter, the Press Association, Exchange Telegraph and Central News. Next week we have 1943. I try to warm to the young people's serials on Radio 5, but it is not easy. Guards] Guards] is adapted by Michael Butt from Terry Pratchett, a well-liked comic writer; but the first instalment on Monday was hard to follow, despite having a narrator among its starry cast. Carrot (Robert Gwylim), a young volunteer in the Guards, is built up as the hero, but players like John Wood (Guards captain) and Melvyn Hayes (corporal) get the publicity. There are dragons offstage, and Elucidated Brethren, and a Guild of Thieves. Michael Butt directs. I must wait for a few more episodes.</p>

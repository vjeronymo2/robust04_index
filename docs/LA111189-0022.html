			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN CHARGES POLICE BRUTALITY, BIAS;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY: A GAS-COMPANY AUDITOR'S LAWSUIT CLAIMS ARRESTING OFFICERS BEAT HER  BECAUSE SHE ISN'T WHITE.  </P> <P> In opening arguments of a lawsuit against five Simi Valley police officers, an  attorney for a black woman contended the officers acted out of racial bias when  they knocked her down and beat her during an arrest.  </P> <P> A defense attorney denied the allegations of racial prejudice, saying the  officers wrestled Debra Thomas to the ground because she was resisting arrest.  </P> <P> Thomas, 32, an auditor for the Southern California Gas Co. and a mother of  four, was mistakenly arrested by five Simi Valley officers who kicked open a  door to her home June 8, 1988. She and her family are seeking $10 million in  damages for pain and emotional suffering.  </P> <P> In the civil trial, which began Friday despite the federal Veteran's Day  holiday, attorney Stephen Yagman said officers arresting Thomas "knocked her to  the ground, injured her and beat her in front of her family."  </P> <P> "The evidence will show that there was a racial bias here, and that a  middle-class white person would not be treated like this."  </P> <P> He argued that if Thomas were white, officers would have investigated when she  told them the warrant for her arrest on suspicion of forgery had been  withdrawn.  </P> <P> In fact the warrant, issued May 12 by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department,  had been withdrawn because Thomas had appeared in Superior Court to resolve the  matter. It was issued after Thomas, who was on probation for forgery, violated  the terms of the probation by bouncing a $40 check, according to both sides.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Bert H. Deixler said that in arresting Thomas, the officers  acted in "good faith" that the arrest warrant was still valid.  </P> <P> Before the officers entered the home, Deixler said, they checked with their  dispatcher who verified that the warrant was valid. They did not believe  Thomas' claim, he said, because she became hysterical.  </P> <P> Deixler said that when officers told Thomas they had a warrant for her arrest,  she began to "scream bloody murder, to flail and squirm and resist arrest. She  was punching and kicking the police officers."  </P> <P> Deixler denied that the officers used excessive force to subdue Thomas, saying  that their conduct inside the house was appropriate, consistent with standard  police practice and not influenced by racial considerations.  </P></p>

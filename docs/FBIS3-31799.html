			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mirko Marjanovic, Serbian prime </F> minister-elect, by Dusko Petrovic in Belgrade on 23 February --  recorded]    [Text] [Petrovic] Mr. Marjanovic, let me first  congratulate you on the mandate you have been given by Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic to form a new government. What  will your first move as prime minister elect be?    [Marjanovic] My first step will be to form a government of  national unity, as the president clearly said. In order to do  that, we have to conduct consultations with the party leaders to  find the experts who will bear the burden of the entire program  for the recovery of Serbia.    It is also well known that several strategic moments have  been envisaged earlier, and we will keep them in mind in the  implementation of this program. These are the struggle for  peace, the struggle for the economic recovery of the country,  and the struggle for a stable and legal state, within which we  will also keep in mind the fight against crime.    As for the program itself, I believe that it has been  accepted in a way in the country, by the public, and I think  that this program has been devised by our best experts. It is  not a one-party program, it is not marked by any color.  Everything that has been done so far on the realization of the  program has yielded positive results. There are some problems  but we will deal with those. So, when all is said and done, I  will face the assembly as the prime minister elect with a clear  program and measures for the implementation of this program.    [Petrovic] The government of national unity will be  comprised of experts, expert economists.    [Marjanovic] Yes, we will try and find the people who are  the best in their line of work.</p>

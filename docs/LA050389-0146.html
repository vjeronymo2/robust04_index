			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS CONSIDER ALLOWING STRIKES  </P> <P> Soviet trade unions, long closely controlled by Communist authorities, will be  given the right to strike under a draft law to be adopted in the next few  months, union leader Stepan Shalayev said today.  </P> <P> The draft law, which sets out a broad range of powers for unions, follows  sporadic reports from across the country of wildcat strikes by miners, bus  drivers and carpet weavers demanding better pay and conditions.  </P> <P> "The right (to strike) is being considered as a means to press management to  speed up the resolution of labor disputes," Shalayev said in an interview with  the trade union daily Trud. "But it is an extreme measure which should be  applied only in exceptional cases." He said work stoppages should "not be  considered a normal phenomenon in our society."  </P></p>

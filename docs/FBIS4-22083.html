			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 18  April publishes on pages 18-20 a 3,000-word article by columnist  'Abd-al- Sattar al-Tawilah responding to the statement issued by  the Islamic Research Council, headed by al-Azhar's grand imam,  which denounces secularist writers for casting doubts on  al-Azhar's authority regarding Islamic affairs.    Al-Tawilah, who says he learned of the statement with "both  astonishment and shock," argues that it "explicitly announces  support for extremism and the extremists." He says al-Azhar, by  this statement, "has changed its negative stance to one  positively favoring the enemies of the nation." Explaining  this, the writer notes that the al-Azhar statement, in its  attack against secular intellectuals, says that they fight  extremism with even more misleading and harmful extremism.  This, he says, gives the terrorists an excuse to fight this  more misleading and harmful extremism.    Elaborating on this, al-Tawilah states: "All supporters of  extremism and terrorism justify terrorist criminal acts by  saying that this or that writer said something against religion,  hurting the sensitive feelings of those extremist boys and  angering those who harbor them in the dark. So they decided to  demolish banks, kill scores of men, women, and children, and  harm thousands of families." He adds: "The al-Azhar council is  using the same justification, giving the terrorists the green  light for further terrorism."    Al-Tawilah maintains that Egyptian intellectuals from both  the left and right have always respected al-Azhar and  highlighted its role in defending Islam and preserving the  Islamic heritage. He gives examples of many Egyptian leftist  writers and thinkers who highlighted the good image of Islam and  served religion in their literature. The problem, he says, is  that the intellectuals reject the right of religious authorities  to decide what can be published and what cannot. "The  difference lies in the fact that we do not want al-Azhar or  other religious institutions to impose an executive control over  our intellectual activity and mental interpretations," he says.  He adds: "That is, we object to al-Azhar making decisions, but  accept its making recommendations, giving opinions, and writing  reports."    Concluding, al-Tawilah says: "The attempt to provoke a  battle between al-Azhar and the Egyptian intellectuals serves  only the enemies of Islam, foremost of whom are the extremist  terrorists."    In an 1,800-word article on pages 20-21 of the 18 April  issue  of Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF, writer Ibrahim 'Isa also accuses  al-Azhar of supporting terrorism with its statement. The writer  begins: "What did al-Azhar leave to the extremists? Once you  differ with the extremists and oppose them you immediately, in a  blink of an eye, become hostile to Islam, an apostate, an  atheist, an infidel, or a rebel against religion; and this is  true if you are against anything that leads, for example, to the  shedding of your blood, and to them killing you physically and  morally!" The writer wonders: "If al- Azhar's 11 April  statement was not terrorism, what then is terrorism?"    The writer says that it was the people, not God, that  established al-Azhar and legislated the laws that gave it its  important role. Al-Azhar, therefore, is not above criticism.  "There are no religious institutions in Islam and there is  nothing like a `grand imam.' We, the people, invented the title  and put it in our civil law. And we can remove it whenever we  want; it is not inspired or imposed by God."    'Isa then challenges al-Azhar to issue a statement  explaining  what it has done to fight extremism, which has continued to grow  over the past 25 years. He notes that al-Azhar has never  mentioned extremist material such as 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman's  books or the audio cassettes containing destructive religious  ideas and preaching. Insinuating that al-Azhar has suspicious  links with Saudi Arabia and its religious establishment, the  writer also wants al-Azhar to issue a statement "explaining in  detail its position on the Wahhabi thought" [a fundamentalist  sect dominant in Saudi Arabia] and another "on the Arab oil  projects that have been established in al- Azhar over the past  few years, though I hope sincerely that such projects do not  exist."</p>

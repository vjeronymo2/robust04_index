			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: Rebellion opens the way for Labour THE REBELLION among Tory MPs over the British Coal closures accelerated yesterday - giving Labour a real chance of engineering a defeat for the government in next Wednesday's Commons debate. The list of Conservatives publicly questioning, if not openly opposing, the decision already exceeds the 11 necessary to wipe out the government's 21-strong majority in the Commons. It is not yet clear whether the extra help for miners announced last night by Mr John Major - coupled with strong lobbying expected this weekend by government business managers - will stop enough from abstaining or voting against the government next week. The two most vociferous Tory opponents, Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen) and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) said they hoped the pit closure policy would be overturned. Fresh recruits yesterday who might yet defy the government whips include Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth), who called for a 'breathing space' before pits close. Mr James Cran (Beverley) said the level of protest from his constituents had been unprecedented. Mr James Pawsey (Rugby and Kenilworth) said: 'The speed with which these proposals have been brought forward is precipitous.' Other Tories who have objected in varying degrees to the closures include Mr William Cash (Stafford), Mr David Nicholson (Taunton), Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent North), Mr John Carlisle (Luton North), Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East), Mr David Knox (Staffordshire Moorlands), Mr John Biffen (Shropshire North), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield), Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton) and Mr Michael Clark (Rochford).</p>

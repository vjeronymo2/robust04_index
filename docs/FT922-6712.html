			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Plysu moves 26% ahead to Pounds 9.47m PLYSU, the plastic packaging and housewares manufacturer, has again reported record pre-tax profits - in the year to March 31, they grew 26 per cent from Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 9.47m. High density polyethylene, the company's main plastics raw material, was freely available again after the Gulf war and 'prices have stabilised at a lower level', said Mr James Summerlin, chairman. The scale of the profits rise was aided by the net cash position attained by the year-end, which resulted in interest charges being cut by almost two-thirds to Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 1.04m). Turnover in the UK slipped to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 56.6m), while in the Netherlands there was an 11 per cent increase to Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 8.67m). Mr Summerlin said turnover figures revealed 'a negative inflation factor'. The company had passed the price savings on to its customers. Mr Summerlin expected capital expenditure next year to top the Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 5.6m) spent in the period under review. Earnings rose to 13.9p (11.4p) and the final dividend is 4.35p (3.15p) for a total of 6p (4.5p).</p>

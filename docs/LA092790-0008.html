			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAMMING THE DOOR ON HOUSING;  </P> <P> THE URGENCY OF KEEPING THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IN THE BUDGET  </P> <P> Congress may be in a cost-cutting mood, but some programs in the federal budget  are not expendable. Low-income housing tax credits, the primary government  resource for financing new affordable housing, is one of them.  </P> <P> The credits provide a strong incentive for private corporations to invest  locally. In exchange for financing the acquisition, rehabilitation or  construction of low-income housing, investors receive a credit deducted from  their federal income tax bill.  </P> <P> That tax break encourages the business community to want to build housing for  poor people. It also encourages solid public-private partnerships, a vital  social contract as government revenues become more limited.  </P> <P> The tax credits cost the federal government $300 million a year, but they also  generate the investment used to produce 100,000 apartments, townhouses and  single rooms designed for senior citizens, the poor or persons just down on  their luck. These tenants pay rents that by law cannot exceed 30% of their  incomes; that makes rents affordable even in expensive housing markets.  </P> <P> The tax credits are quite popular politically. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is a  big booster. More than 75 members of the Senate and more than 200 members of  the House also favor renewal. Mayors also endorse the credit because it funnels  significant investment to local housing needs. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley is  encouraging California businesses to invest $125 million in low-income housing  over the next five years. That investment would pay for the construction of  4,000 rental units and provide subsidies to keep the rents within the reach of  very poor families.  </P> <P> Given such bipartisan support, extension should be a done deal. But the  enormity of the nation's fiscal and political dilemmas requires Congress to put  just about everything on the table. Even so, millions of Americans need  affordable dwellings. It would be a crime if Congress failed to extend the  low-income housing tax credit.  </P></p>

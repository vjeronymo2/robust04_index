"This is a historic moment. February 23, 1994 means an end  to civil war in Russia", he told reporters.    However, a leader of another major Duma faction is of a  completely opposite opinion. Sergey Yushchenkov of the Russia's  Choice said the amnesty to rebels means "the beginning of a  civil war in Russia".    Yegor Gaydar, the leader of the faction, said the decision  was a move towards destabilisation and warned that the freed  rebels would return to their activities which would result in a  new bloodshed. "I am completely convinced that they would work  so that new blood is shed", he said.    According to Gaydar, the president cannot veto the Duma  decision.    Other Duma factions were somewhere in between the radical  points of view of Russia's Choice and Zhirinovskiy's party.    Sergey Stankevich from the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  said that Russia has got a chance for reconciliation, but warned  that "it is hard to predict how the chance would be used".    Leader of Russian Communists Gennadiy Zyuganov told TASS  that  he has a "feeling of certain satisfaction" as agreement has been  reached among most Duma factions. The Russia's Choice remained  alone "and began to immediately intimidate by provocations", he  said.    Vladimir Lysenko from the "Yabloko" bloc abstained from the  vote. He told TASS that it was very tempting to vote for  universal pardoning, however "if a considerable part of  extremists is freed this can destabilise the situation".</p>

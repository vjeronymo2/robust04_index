This is the topic of  a NODONG SINMUN commentary today.    The inspection agreed on recently is not routine or ad hoc  inspection under the safeguards agreement but, to all intends  [as received] and purposes, an inspection for ensuring the  continuity of safeguards, the analyst says, and continues:    The DPRK and the IAEA could reach an agreement because the  United States and the IAEA voluntarily withdrew their demand  that the DPRK accept routine and ad hoc inspections and promised  to make an inspection only for the continuity of safeguards.    As we have reached an agreement with the IAEA, we are  willing  to accept such an inspection and welcome an inspection group of  the IAEA.    Whether the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of  safeguards is made at an early date or not depends on the United  States, not on the DPRK.    If the inspection is to be made soon, an agreement on  follow-up steps for simultaneous actions must be reached as the  DPRK and the United States promised.    Such steps must include an inspection of the DPRK for the  continuity of safeguards and, at the same time, an official  proclamation by the United States of the suspension of the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises in 1994 and the joint  publication of the date of the third-stage talks by the DPRK and  the United States.    So, it is unfair that one side ought to take an action first  according to the promise, while the other side can take no  action, breaking the promise. The problem cannot be resolved in  this way.    It is a decisive moment in resolving the nuclear issue on  the  Korean peninsula and making a positive progress in improving the  DPRK-U.S. relations.    It is evident that if the United States throw a snag in the  way of reaching an agreement on steps for simultaneous actions  or resort to pressure, the agreement between the DPRK and the  IAEA cannot be implemented.    Some quarters of the United States, however, are arguing  that  only when the North and the South exchanged special envoys and  the IAEA's inspection was fully made, is it possible to stop the  "Team Spirit" and hold the third-stage talks.    It is attributable to this unreasonable position of the  U.S.,  not to ours, that though the DPRK and IAEA agreed on the  inspection for the continuity of safeguards, it has not been  carried into effect.    Only when the United States show in action the fulfilment of  its responsibility and obligation, will the inspection for the  continuity of safeguards be made at the same time.</p>

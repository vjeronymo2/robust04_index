			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of  the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman  confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims  over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion  on the issue by means of a referendum.    During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the  minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the  guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected  to take place during her term as minister and that they are  prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the  dispute.    As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council  has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda  will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the  Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their  opinion on the issue.    Even though the minister indicated that the Belize Council  will be directly responsible for negotiating the territorial  dispute, she also explained that at any given moment it could  request mediation by the international community, which has  expressed interest in the problem.    In addition, the United Nations will be made aware of the  objectives sought by the proviso submitted a few months ago.    With respect to the extradition of [former President] Jorge  Serrano Elias, the minister indicated that the court responsible  for the case has not yet forwarded any [extradition] request to  the Foreign Ministry.  <H5>  Belize Council To Be Established in 10 Days </H5>   The foreign minister stated that the Belize Council will be  established in no less than 10 days. She also abstained from  identifying the candidates selected to become members of the  aforementioned council and indicated that there are still talks  to be held with some of them in order to confirm their  disposition to participate.    According to the foreign minister, a preliminary list of  candidates has already been discussed with President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio, and, if there are no objections, she would proceed  to forward invitations to the citizens named as possible council  members.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yalcin Ozer: "Ciller's Political Angle Is </F> Being Restricted"]    [Excerpt] With the prime minister's return from her U.S.  visit the issue of a cabinet reshuffle has been included on the  agenda. The public is expecting a reshuffle and a restructuring  within the cabinet.    While the public expects a reshuffle the leaders of the  coalition partners have other problems to tackle.... Let us  begin with Ciller.    Ciller is struggling against a secret "Demirel opposition"  within the TPP [True Path Party]. This opposition, which was  working against the TPP during the local election campaign,  supported the ANAP [Motherland Party] candidates in important  centers such as Istanbul and Bursa.    The aim was to prepare a great election defeat for Ciller  thus ousting her from the party. The election results, however,  did not please the opposition.    This opposition, which retreated a bit given the election  results, has bounced back since then.... There has been no  change in either goal or calculation. There has only been a  slight delay and postponement. That is all....    Ciller does not have many trump cards against the opposition  because the TPP has a weak majority in the Assembly anyway. As  for the TPP electorate, it is not ready for such a struggle....  Furthermore, the opposition is led by the president (in other  words Demirel).... Therefore, Ciller, whether she wants it or  not, has to maintain harmonious relations with Demirel....    The main characteristics of this opposition are the  following;    The first is staffing... They want the best state cadres to  be at their disposal. Their complaints to the president are  based on the principle that "she is isolating and antagonizing  our senior colleagues"... Whatever the conditions, they want  the state to increase employment and they want to be in charge  of appointing personnel to the newly created cadres.    Secondly, this opposition is against the economic stability  measures. Many among them believe that the Ozal Model is  responsible for the current crisis and that, therefore, if this  model is abandoned the economy will automatically heal  itself.... Almost all within this opposition, and especially  [Assembly Speaker] Cindoruk, are against the closing down or  liquidation of the State Economic Enterprises that are in the  red. One will recall that in the past Demirel has also said  that the duty of the state was not to close down these  enterprises and lay off workers but to find a solution, though  he did not specify what this solution should be.    These conditions are, in a way, putting Ciller in a  difficult  position. The prime minister has, thus far, not been able to  form a good team around herself. People like Esat Kiratlioglu  and Necmettin Cevheri, though they are very valuable on an  individual basis, cannot contribute much to the masses. If one  removes Yildirim Aktuna from the picture, there will be no one  else left.... Ciller should speedily surround herself with  charismatic cadres like Aktuna but who are also experienced and  youthful.... [passage omitted]</p>

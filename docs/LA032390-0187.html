			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: MADONNA TRIES CHANGE OF FACE IN NEW VIDEO  </P> <P> WHO NEEDS hit movies? That's what I say after getting an advance peek at  Madonna's to-die-for, utterly fabulous new video called "Vogue." Wait until you  see Madonna in glorious black and white, singing and vamping in this tribute to  the glamour goddesses of the past.  </P> <P> The title "Vogue" refers not to the fashion magazine but to the dance style  where one strikes poses. Madonna says: "It's about attitude . . . giving face .  . . making the most of what you have!" And does this woman ever "give face"!  She has never looked so appealing, or so reminiscent of Monroe, Harlow,  Dietrich.  </P> <P> Unlike previous videos, this one won't cause any outrageous controversies.  Madonna is dressed to the teeth (well, OK, let's just say to the bosoms). There  is no religious imagery and no vulgarity. This is a video even an old-fashioned  mother might love.  </P> <P> MADONNA'S "Blonde Ambition" tour begins in the summer, to coincide with her  hotly awaited performance as Breathless Mahoney -- singing and dancing to fresh  new Stephen Sondheim songs -- in the big-screen movie "Dick Tracy." Oh, yes,  there's a guy named Warren Beatty in this film, too. There were reports by the  opposition that Madonna and Warren's romance has died. But last weekend, these  two took in the new French group Les Negresses Vertes at the Roxy in Los  Angeles. Madonna sat on Warren's lap, nibbled his ear, and behaved like a woman  in love.  </P> <P> DON'T SAY I didn't warn you of the possibility that another, very big shoe may  drop in the Ivana and Donald Trump splituation, and it could happen next  Monday. But no, Mrs. Trump WON'T be suing for divorce.  </P> <P> BROADWAY HAD another great first night this week when Kathleen Turner sizzled  into her opening of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Eugene O'Neill Theater.  There was a ripple of black-tie civilization that night, hinting of the past  and making us wonder if civilized theater may really be making a comeback. (We  had some neat indications of this in "Orpheus Descending," "Grand Hotel,"  "Gypsy," "A Few Good Men," "Tru" and "City of Angels" already this season.)  </P> <P> "Cat" is my least favorite of all Tennessee's plays and I've seen its four  major versions, including Gadge Kazan's original and the sanitized 1958 movie.  But who could quibble with any excuse to see Kathleen?  </P> <P> And who can ever resist the poetry of Tennessee Williams, including his great  closing speech by Maggie about "beautiful weak people who give up too easily"?  </P> <P> Then there is the actor's actor, Charles Durning (coming into his own after a  long career), as Big Daddy. He brought a truly sensitive and unusual brightness  to his man-to-man talk with his son Brick, the athletic god who is sinking into  alcoholism.  </P> <P> Don't miss this show. Love it or hate it; you won't be bored.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUBA HALTS ANGOLA TROOP PULLOUT OVER REBEL ATTACK  </P> <P> Cuba on Thursday blamed the United States for a rebel attack on its troops in  Angola last weekend and temporarily suspended the withdrawal of its forces from  the African country.  </P> <P> The decision halted a Cuban pullout of soldiers and equipment from Angola that  has been under way since January, 1989, as part of regional peace accords  between Angola, South Africa and Cuba. Under the agreement, South Africa halted  support for the Angolan rebels and agreed to a U.N.-supervised independence  plan for Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor.  </P> <P> The rebel organization, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  (UNITA), which is backed by the United States, said it regretted the incident.  It said the Cubans failed to let the rebels know where Cuban troops were  located.  </P> <P> Four Cubans were killed and five injured in Sunday's raid on a water  purification plant guarded by Cuban troops in southwest Angola, about 250 miles  south of Luanda.  </P> <P> Cuba's announcement put a hitch in the complex peace process, but it seemed  unlikely to lead to a full-scale breakdown of the accords, Western diplomats  said.  </P> <P> Cuba has already brought home more than 31,000 of its 50,000 troops from  Angola, where they were helping the Marxist government fight UNITA, headed by  Jonas Savimbi. The rest of the Cubans are to leave by mid-1991.  </P> <P> Cuba said the suspension would stay in effect until it is satisfied that UNITA  will not harass withdrawing Cuban forces or try to disrupt the peace accords.  </P> <P> "Responsibility for these criminal actions by UNITA against Cuban troops and  for the sabotage of the peace accords which they imply ultimately lies with the  U.S. government, the logistical backer and political adviser of UNITA," the  Foreign Ministry said.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department noted that Cuba was ahead of schedule on  its troop withdrawal and said it will seek to clarify Havana's decision to  suspend the pullout.  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Theatre at the Traverse - The Edinburgh Festival / Alastair Macaulay finds sex, death and more hilariously camped up Ever since it moved (less than two years ago) to its new premises the Traverse has become a hub of Edinburgh life. Especially in Festival time. Even if you are not going there for shows, you use its cafe (from 10 am till midnight), you use its bar (open till early hours), you bump into old chums there. And this year, there is also the new Atrium restaurant. The old Traverse crowded you; this one has space. If you go to Fringe theatre, the Traverse is on your map anyway. This year, even the official Festival has used Traverse terrain, to present the opera double bill Anna and Tourist Variations. But, for most of the the Festival the Traverse is a core venue for Fringe plays. Either of its two auditoria is currently showing four different shows per day (except on Mondays), from 12 noon until 12.30 am: plays and actors from Scotland, England, Spain, Belgium, Canada, the States, South Africa. I report here on five Traverse plays from the start of the Festival. Penetrator (Traverse 2, world premiere), written and directed by Anthony Neilson, is the best Fringe play I have seen so far in '93 (I write this on Day 8). The worst thing I can tell you of it is that the advance blurb describes it as 'a taut and harrowing journey into the ferocious heart of masculinity' - though it is taut and harrowing, it is a journey into masculinity, and it sure gets ferocious. It is also a thriller about three young Scotsmen, two of whom are ostentatiously heterosexual and occasionally tease the third one that he's a poof; but all is not as it seems. The title warns you. Penetrator is about sex and threatened death. The real 'thriller' aspect of it, during the long and terrifying knifepoint climax, is its series of psychological revelations. Neilson is at his least canny in pacing the final ten minutes, which seem more neat and contrived - though still psychologically riveting. More than that I will not say, except to warn off those who are alarmed by ten-inch knives and four-letter words; and to praise BJ McMurphy, Alan Francis and James Cunningham for the exceptional conviction and fluency of their playing. The Edinburgh Festival often gives Londoners a chance to catch up with what we missed back home; and I am grateful for the chance to catch up with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company (Traverse 2), the New York troupe which recently played at the Drill Hall. Brother Truckers, by Georg Osterman, is described as 'a Comedy Noir' and 'the B-movie story of the men who haul trash and the women who love them': which is fair enough. It too is about sex and death - but is a hilarious exercise in intense camp. The heroine, Lyla Balskin (Everett Quinskin), is a brilliant Barbara Stanwyck type (with dashes of Bette Davis, Mae West, Joan Crawford and Joan Blondell). The snake-like way she darts her tongue as she names her lover ('Lech', as in Walesa), the smouldering way she hisses out lines like 'If you were as bright as your Clairol treatment, you'd know', and her final mad scene are highpoints amid wonderful ensemble playing. I'm not sure, but I think my favourite lines was 'I'm having difficulty breathing, and, with all due respect to the House of Chanel, this dress isn't making it any easier.' Speaking of camp, Neil Bartlett's Night after Night is playing in Traverse 1; but enough already - I covered that Upstairs at the Royal Court some months ago. Speaking of men, the Spanish show Muu] (Traverse 1) is a largely mime cartoon about four matadors. I laughed about six times (it is a 70-minute piece), and I object to the performers' mugging and milking each joke dry. True, it is good to know that Spaniards are laughing about both bullfighting and the cult of machismo. But, these days, who isn't? Comunicado, the Scottish theatre company, is presenting its largely non-speaking version of Flaubert's The Legend of St Julian (Traverse 1) with just seven performers. You can tell in the first five minutes that the director Gerry Mulgrew has a flair for poetic stage pictures, for pithy atmospheric evocation, for real theatre magic; and, also in the first five minutes, that he hasn't the rhythm to keep his storytelling taut - and the show lasts 135 minutes. Flaubert's medieval tale is laconic. Mulgrew catches some of its events with striking economy; but he draws out others, and allows composer Jim Sutherland to overdo the misterioso sound effects. Sleeping With You (Traverse 2) is the only one-man play the Traverse is presenting this year. Written by Godfrey Hamilton and played by his lover Mark Pintosh, this piece comes from Hawaii's Starving Artists Theatre Company. Despite the fact that it is a deliberate vehicle for one person's actorly virtuosity and a piece of socio-political agitprop (two big minuses in my book), it is arresting, varied, intelligent, touching and funny - standing both inside and outside its subject. In Sleeping with You, Pintosh plays both Marco and Andrew, shows their affair from different slants, depicts the whole sleaze scene of Hawaii gay hustlers, speaks of gay promiscuity, of serious gay love, and of Aids. Then he relates the big gay march on Washington DC; the organisers yelling 'I need to tell you we only have a permit for civil disobedience in this area'; and the 'pale queers' from Wisconsin chanting 'We're tired, we're bitchy, we want our rights now.' Any play that can suddenly make you guffaw out of the blue after an hour, and that can laugh at the cause it preaches, has real control. Brother Truckers and Night after Night continue until August 29; The Legend of St Julian until September 4</p>

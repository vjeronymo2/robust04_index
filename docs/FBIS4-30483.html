			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Makoto Suzuki] </F>   [Text] Hanoi, 25 June -- A decision was made to build  Hanoi International Airport, which will be the main gateway to  Vietnam, by using aid from Japan. Following the rapid economic  growth and promotion of an open-door policy, the number of  travelers and amount of cargo arriving in Hanoi suddenly  increased. The situation is such that the current international  airport cannot cope with this rapid growth in the long-run. As  a top priority, the Vietnamese Government had asked Japan for  aid. The Japanese Government, which started to grant project  loans to Vietnam in fiscal 1993, decided to promote airport  construction as a sales point for its yen-based loans. The  total construction cost of the airport is several hundred  million dollars and it is expected to be completed around 2000.    The new international airport will be constructed in an area  south of and adjacent to Noibai Airport [name as published],  which is about 20 km south of Hanoi. Currently, the Noibai  Airport is used as both an international and a domestic airport.  However, there is only one runway and the airport facilities  are old. On the other hand, the number of passengers of  international airlines which fly to Hanoi will be three times as  many as that of 1993 and the quantity of cargo will be  quadrupled by 2000.    The Vietnamese Government, which strongly hopes for  realization of the new airport project, asked a Japanese  Government delegation which visited Vietnam late this month for  aid. The Japanese delegation promised its cooperation and told  the Vietnamese Government that it would carry out a feasibility  study, which is a precondition for yen-based loans, from this  year to next year. On the basis of this outcome, the new  airport construction will be included in a list of next year's  yen-based loans as a new project.    According to a plan of the Vietnamese Government, the new  international airport will be constructed in a 490-hector area  of land and a 3,200-meter runway, terminal buildings, aprons,  and other facilities will be constructed there. The Noibai  Airport will be used as a domestic airport when the new airport  is constructed. It is expected that construction of the new  airport will be completed around 2000.    International financial organizations from countries around  the world started last year to provide full-fledged aid to  Vietnam. The amount of aid from Japan, which resumed  full-fledged aid to Vietnam in 1992, is far larger than that of  other countries. However, the yen-based loans have been used  for certain projects, such as the construction of  power-generating stations, which are not well-known to the  general public. Therefore, it is true that not many people in  Vietnam know about aid from Japan. The construction of the new  international airport in the capital city is a well-known  project. It will have an effect of publicizing Japan's  contributions.</p>

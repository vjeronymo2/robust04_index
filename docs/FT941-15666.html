			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / TSB sets cash aside in case of pension transfer claims TSB Group, the UK's sixth-largest bank, said yesterday it had made 'prudent' provisions for possible compensation payments from the sale of pensions to people transferring out of occupational pension schemes. The group has 55,000 pension transfer customers - about 10 per cent of the estimated 500,000 or so pension transfers sold. The total value of amounts transferred from occupational schemes to TSB is about Pounds 500m. Mr John Elbourne, retail director, said the bank had taken the step because of the study of pension transfers by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments Board. The report, which suggested that nine out of 10 pension transfer cases had not complied with regulators' rules, prompted the SIB, the City's chief watchdog, to set up an inquiry into the transfer business. The inquiry is not expected to reach conclusions until the summer about how to compensate people who have suffered from being wrongly advised. TSB has written to all its pensions transfer customers giving them a telephone number to contact if they have any concerns. Mr Elbourne said the bank had received only 40 letters or calls about pensions transfers in three months. He said the bank was satisfied with the quality of its pensions transfer business and was continuing to write it, under strict rules. He added that there would be a continuing debate about the standards KPMG had used in the study, saying that those went further than the standards imposed by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, in the guidance it issued in mid 1992. Announcing TSB's results, Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said it would not be 'good commercial practice' to say what provision was being made. There is no figure for provisions in the group's results, but the assessment will be reflected in the annual return that the TSB makes to the Department of Trade and Industry in connection with its insurance activities. The results presentation also highlighted continuing job losses in the banking industry, as Mr Ellwood confirmed that 110 branches would shut in 1994. He said there would be no compulsory redundancies this year. Even so, about 1,000 jobs are expected to be lost, with the focus on the group's administrative centres. Mr Ellwood said there would be further job losses in future years as the bank continued to respond to competitive pressures and the increasing use of technology.

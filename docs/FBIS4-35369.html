			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin revealed today that  the movements of Jibril al-Rujub, head of the PLO's security  apparatus in Jericho, have been restricted and that he has been  barred from leaving the city in the wake of his recent  pronouncements.    During a visit to the Bedouin town of Lagiya in the Negev  last Friday, al-Rujub stated that the autonomy was the first  phase on the road to the establishment of a Palestinian state  with Jerusalem as its capital, and that the Palestinians would  not cease their struggle until Jerusalem has been liberated.  Al-Rujub also called for the continuation of the armed struggle  from within the boundaries of the autonomy.</p>

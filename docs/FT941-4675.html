			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Hodgson: resuscitating another dying brand Howard Hodgson (right) is starting to flex his muscles at Halkin Holdings - formerly Hoskins Brewery - by appointing Arthur Till, 50, as managing director of Ronson, the cigarette lighter and pen company acquired by Halkin in December last year. The appointment is part of Hodgson's efforts to return the Ronson brand name to past glories, when it was once almost a generic name for cigarette lighters. 'It's interesting. Market research suggests that while Ronson is very well known by people aged 35 and over, it's much less familiar to under-35s,' says Hodgson, who is determined to rectify that imbalance, which is, he feels, a strategic marketing problem. Till has a strong marketing background, having worked for Colgate-Palmolive before joining Johnson Wax in 1973. Before joining Ronson, Till was director of business development and marketing services for Johnson Wax Europe, a business with turnover of Dollars 900m. His appointment is given extra resonance as his background in household aerosol products will be useful at Ronson's own household products' division, Chirton. Hodgson, who made a fortune in the 1980s with his family firm of undertakers which he transformed into PHKI and published a book called How To Be Dead Rich, paid Pounds 10m for Ronson and Pounds 9.5m for the gift company LGW. 'The Ronson name has not been damaged and although you might think that I am again back in the dying business, that's not quite true,' argues Hodgson. 'In east Europe and the Far East smoking is still very popular and on the increase. We are in the gift business, and as well as lighters and pens we plan to bring out watches and other accessories, using the Ronson brand name. The watch will be consistent with that brand image, which is not Cartier but more a Marks and Spencer, value-for-money product.'</p>

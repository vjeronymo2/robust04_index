			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / World Trade News: Eximbank chief hails huge openings in Indian market INDIA is being hailed as 'the new Mexico' at the US Export-Import Bank and proof positive that US industry has turned the tide in its drive to regain the edge over its foreign competitors, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. Mr John Macomber, Eximbank chairman, just back from an Asian trip, speaks glowingly of the 'huge opportunities' of an Indian market newly shorn of trade curbs. Eximbank's exposure there has leapt from Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m) to Dollars 500m in the past year, and it has on hand applications for Dollars 1.6bn in trade credits. 'We won't get all the contracts, but we'll get a good percentage of them,' Mr Macomber said. 'This doesn't take into account a gigantic deal for airframes, airports and avionics which is in the works.' Mexico has emerged as the Eximbank's biggest customer, with lending expected to hit Dollars 7bn this year. But bank officials see India has having equal potential; even as a candidate for 'bundling' - packaging together small loans for sale on the capital markets. Mr Macomber says US product quality has improved so much in the past decade that Asian buyers are no longer 'talking down' US products. Sales are mostly in the Dollars 50m-Dollars 75m range, including computers, avionics, machinery, and oil and gas equipment. 'There are few areas where the Americans aren't on top, whether it is telecommunications, advanced materials, medicine or biology,' he said. 'No amount of monkeying with the value of the dollar is going to make you competitive if your product is not.' Support for US exports has now achieved a consensus in Washington. Congress has removed the ceiling for export guarantees, with no opposition from the Office of Management and the Budget, and the only limit on lending is a Dollars 612m subsidy level. The value of exports backed is expected to rise from Dollars 12.5bn last year to Dollars 14bn in fiscal 1992. Last week, Congress repealed the Stevenson/Byrd Act, which placed a Dollars 130m lid on lending by Eximbank to the former Soviet Union and capped loans in the energy sector at Dollars 40m. Eximbank is finally prepared to go ahead with almost Dollars 200m in loans, approved months ago for sales to Russian businesses.</p>

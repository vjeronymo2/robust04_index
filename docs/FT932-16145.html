			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Relapse at Fisons Fisons can hardly be blamed for the failure of tipredane to make the clinical grade. The high rate of attrition among drugs during even the late stages of development is what makes pharmaceuticals a risk business. Even so, the shortcomings of tipredane might have been recognised earlier. The secret of success lies in weeding out ineffective compounds before serious money has been spent on development. As late as last month, the company was predicting the commercial launch of this product by 1997. More seriously, the failure raises the question of whether Fisons is big enough to compete in the long term. With no obvious successor to Tilade in the research pipeline, Fisons' franchise in asthma therapy could wither. Tilade is protected by patents until the end of the decade, but competition from the likes of ICI and the long lead-time required to develop new drugs dictate that it must move fast to plug the gap. Scrapping tipredane saves Pounds 10m a year which can be devoted to other compounds. Licensing drugs from other companies might provide a solution. Without one, Fisons' experience in asthma therapy would be worth more in other hands. If that makes a takeover more likely, yesterday's 13 per cent fall in the shares may be overdone. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that Fisons is worth less without the promise of tipredane. With such a long record of nasty surprises to be taken into account, potential predators will prefer to sit back and wait.</p>

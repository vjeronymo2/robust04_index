			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARTS FLY OFF TRAIN IN NEWHALL, CAUSING DAMAGE, NO INJURIES  </P> <P> Eddie Lemmon, manager of a car repair shop next to the railroad tracks in  Newhall, thought children were throwing rocks when he heard a series of loud  bangs outside the building.  </P> <P> But the four-inch bolt that shot through the shop's open garage door put a hole  in that theory. And the seven-pound chunk of twisted metal he found in the  street could not have been the work of pranksters.  </P> <P> The debris and about a dozen other large pieces of metal that showered cars and  buildings in Newhall on Saturday came from a cooling fan that flew off a  passing freight train locomotive, authorities said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shards Damage Cars, Businesses  </P> <P> No one was injured, but at least two parked cars and a number of businesses  were damaged by the flying shards, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Kathryn  Nielsen said.  </P> <P> "I heard the train coming, and all of a sudden the building was pelted by  pieces of this aluminum fan," Lemmon said. "It was like shrapnel flying  everywhere. I'm surprised nobody got hurt."  </P> <P> Lemmon said an eight-inch piece of metal came within inches of hitting a  pedestrian on the sidewalk outside his business, in the 24300 block of Railroad  Avenue. The shop is about 75 yards from the railroad tracks, he said.  </P> <P> He said shards also shattered the window of one parked car and sheared off the  side-view mirror of another. A large piece of the fan tore a hole in the side  of the Anawalt Lumber hardware store on the other side of the tracks,  authorities said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fan Discovered Missing  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies radioed the crew of the northbound train thought to have  caused the incident, said Jerry Pera, a spokesman for Southern Pacific  Transportation Co., which operates the trains. The train stopped several miles  north of Newhall, and crew members discovered that a fan was missing from the  top of the third locomotive, Pera said. The train was being pulled by four  locomotives, he said.  </P> <P> Crew members, who were all in the lead locomotive, told inspectors that they  were unaware of the incident, Pera said.  </P> <P> After a 2 1/2-hour inspection, the train was permitted to continue its trip  from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Pera said. The cause of the incident was  under investigation, he said.  </P></p>

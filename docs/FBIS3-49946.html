			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer Nada Rajkovic] President of the Bosnia-  Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic is on the line from  Geneva. Good evening, let us hear your assessment of the course  of negotiations today?    [Izetbegovic] Good evening, I wish you all the best.  According to the information that I have, the city [of  Sarajevo] seems to be somewhat peaceful today. I am glad to  hear that, you need some rest from that shelling. We have had  two very tempestuous days, two hard days. I could say that the  talks here, the first round of talks ended in a draw, to use a  chess expression. I am personally pleased with what we here  today, I cannot say achieved, but I am pleased with the outcome  of this round of talks.    We reiterated our demands for the return of territories, we  said that we do not wish just any kind of peace, that we want a  just peace. However, the Serb side was not ready to offer any  concessions. There was a proposal to let a series of questions  remain open and be handed over to an arbitration commission  which would work on their resolution for one to two years.  However, we did not accept that. The open questions referred  to the issues of Visegrad, Zvornik, Rogatica, Brcko, Sanski  Most, Bosanski Novi, and so on. We did not accept that.    We said that we could not allow these questions to remain  open, they have to be resolved; otherwise the conference would  be considered unsuccessful and would go back to the beginning,  back to the UN Security Council. This was our stance, and  consequently this proposal on the arbitration was rejected.    In order to salvage this peace process, the co-chairmen put  forward a proposal that in the meantime the fronts should  quieten down, hot-lines be introduced and talks be resumed on 10  February. We believe that the talks, the peace process, should  not be extinguished. Its extinguishing would not be in the  interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. We ought to  continue with further negotiations.    Of course, we are not restricted in any sense, we are not  going to accept a rotten compromise to the detriment of Bosnia-  Herzegovina. This is approximately our stance.    [Mufid Memija, Sarajevo radio-television editor] How do you  perceive the agreement between Serbia and Croatia in view of the  general course of the Geneva negotiations?    [Izetbegovic] Serbia and Croatia had their own agreements  parallel to these talks. They reportedly made some progress in  this respect, they agreed on the opening of missions. Some tend  to see this as the first step toward recognition. I,  personally, do not see things that way, that is not what it was  all about. I believe that mutual recognition is still a rather  remote prospect.    However, regarding our own problem, I would like to say that  some headway has been made. This might not only be a modest  achievement, we will see later on. The Serb side agreed to UN  administration of Sarajevo over the next two-year period --  something it had persistently rejected or made conditional in  the past. This was accepted unconditionally this time -- we  consider this to be progress. This is a point we scored in this  competition. This is the best solution for Sarajevo at this  moment. It would bring about the lifting of the blockade of  Sarajevo, the removal of the [Serb] artillery and an end to the  shelling, as well as to a certain kind of opening of the city.  This would not be a real opening of the city, but it would  certainly be a new situation that would enable us to find the  best solution within this two-year period in conformity with the  aspirations of Sarajevo's citizens. This was a result we scored  in these talks.    [Rajkovic] But Mr. President, let us talk about the  negotiations in global terms.    [Izetbegovic] Of course, as they would say in politics, and  this applies to the negative aspects of the negotiating process,  nothing has been agreed if everything has not been agreed [as  heard]. Therefore, this is only one of many elements making up  the mosaic of some future agreement. Such a solution would be  acceptable if an agreement is signed. This was one of our  demands, something we insisted on in order to avoid the division  of the city and find a solution in a more normal kind of  atmosphere and give maximum prominence to what the citizens of  Sarajevo want for their city and its future.    [Rajkovic] We have learned that you were invited to visit  Brussels tomorrow.    [Izetbegovic] I was invited not to the European Union  headquarters but to visit the NATO headquarters. I will do this  tomorrow on my return from here. Unfortunately NATO Secretary  General Woerner has been admitted to hospital. I will be  received by his deputy, as Woerner is seriously ill. However, I  will go there to hold talks in the NATO headquarters. I think  it will be a useful visit even though I do not expect any  (?major) results. This is something which could, as people say  [words indistinct], to visit NATO and hold talks with officials  in charge.    [Rajkovic] After that you are going to Malaysia where Bosnia  will also be discussed.    [Izetbegovic] Yes, Malaysia has organized three  parliamentary conferences on Bosnia-Herzegovina with  international parliamentarians taking part. The intention was  to make the cause of Bosnia-Herzegovina more popular, to make  the world more interested in Bosnia-Herzegovina. One conference  was held, as far as I remember, in Bonn, one in London and this  one will take place in Malaysia. I was invited to be one of the  speakers along with the Malaysian president at the two-day  conference. I will probably stay there for one day. Maybe I  will make a one-day visit to Indonesia and Brunei. Then I will  return, in order to make my trip as short as possible. I think  that this visit to Malaysia will be useful because it will be a  chance to present the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina in that  part of the world in the presence of numerous parliamentarians  from Europe, the United States, and of course from the Far East.</p>

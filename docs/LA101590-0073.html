			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 74;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER  </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> The massive buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf entered its final stage  after more than two months. M-1 tanks from two of the U.S. Army's strongest  units arrived in Saudi Arabia on ships, and officials predicted these units  would have all their equipment by midweek.  </P> <P> With this delivery, the United States now has more than 200,000 troops in the  region, along with 1,000 tanks, nearly 500 combat aircraft and 59 Navy  warships.  </P> <P> Although original deployment plans are now nearly complete, Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney held open the possibility that more troops and weapons could be  shipped to Saudi Arabia in the future, if the commanders decide that they are  necessary.  </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> The Soviet government's Novosti Press Agency reported that Iraqi leader Saddam  Hussein told a visiting Soviet official in Baghdad last week that he might  remove his troops from Kuwait in return for some Kuwaiti territory along the  Persian Gulf. But the Iraqi information minister denied the report.  </P> <P> Terrorism Front:  </P> <P> Egyptian officials said that two men carrying forged Syrian and Iraqi passports  are among suspects arrested in connection with the assassination of Egyptian  Parliament Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub in Cairo last week.  </P> <P> The Iraqi News Agency said the reports linking Iraq to the slaying were meant  to "cover up popular indignation" against Egypt's support of the U.S.-led  forces in the Persian Gulf region.  </P> <P> No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination.  </P> <P> Non-Western Citizens Still in Iraq and Kuwait:  </P> <P> Egypt: 1,300,000  </P> <P> India: 96,000  </P> <P> Pakistan: 80,000+  </P> <P> Lebanon: 55,000  </P> <P> Vietnam: 17,000  </P> <P> Bangladesh: 15,000  </P> <P> Philippines: 7,300+  </P> <P> China: 4,800  </P> <P> Soviet Union: 4,000+  </P> <P> Thailand: 894  </P> <P> Japan: 319  </P> <P> South Korea: 193  </P> <P> Turkey: 100  </P></p>

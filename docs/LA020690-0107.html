			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARKLEY TALKED INTO JOINING ALL-STARS  </P> <P> Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers said Monday he will bow to league  pressure and play in the NBA All-Star game on Sunday.  </P> <P> Barkley announced Sunday he would skip the game to rest, saying a strained leg  muscle had nagged him for several days.  </P> <P> He heard from the NBA Monday.  </P> <P> "I'm going to play," he said. "They gave me a play-or-else deal. They said I  would be suspended next week if I play this week and miss the the game. I don't  agree with them, but I've got to go."  </P> <P> The injury, originally diagnosed as a groin pull, hobbled Barkley on Sunday. In  a 114-89 victory over the Jazz on Monday, he played only 27 minutes but scored  16 points and had eight rebounds.  </P></p>

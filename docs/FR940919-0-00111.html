			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> ii. Other Newly Identified Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In addition to organic TC wastes, the wastes affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's final rule include coke by-product and chlorotoluene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes. Based on an economic analysis conducted by the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the listing of coke by-product waste, generators recycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these wastes rather than disposing of them in Subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfills. Therefore, EPA estimates that negligible volumes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coke by-product wastes would be affected by this rule. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorotoluene waste volumes, EPA conducted a detailed cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis using site specific data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> iii. Testing, Recordkeeping, and Permit Modification Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In addition to the costs for treatment of wastes, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated the incremental costs of the testing and recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in today's rule. Testing and recordkeeping costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were developed for all wastes addressed in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency examined the incremental cost of the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under today's rule. The Agency considered the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline scenario to include testing for waste identification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The post-regulatory scenario would include testing for waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification, testing to determine the number and concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of constituents requiring treatment, and testing following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment to ensure compliance with the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the analysis of recordkeeping costs, the Agency employed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the estimates developed in the Information Collection Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ICR) for today's rule. These estimates were employed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility specific analysis to develop a total incremental cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the testing and recordkeeping requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also performed a sensitivity analysis on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential permit modification costs for facilities which may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switch to on-site treatment. EPA applied a schedule of payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the costs of permit modifications to a group of nine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. The results of this analysis are provided in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background Document RIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> c. Waste Minimization Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Since reducing waste generation may be less costly than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating these wastes to LDR standards, the Agency performed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis examining the potential waste minimization alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to facilities. The analysis followed a multi-step  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology which included: (1) Develop a profile of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries which indicated plans for waste minimization in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 TC Survey Database, (2) select industries to examine which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be representative of the TC waste universe, (3) make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone data verification calls to facilities within these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries, (4) determine the cost components for the post-regulatory and waste minimization scenarios for all wastestreams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those facilities, (5) estimate whether potential total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs/cost savings for the waste minimization and the post-regulatory (i.e., without waste minimization) scenarios would be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitable investment for the firms, and (6) extrapolate results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the TC waste universe, and determine overall cost/cost savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> d. Economic Impact Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The economic effects of today's final rule are defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difference between the industrial activity under post-regulatory conditions and the industrial activity in the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of regulation (i.e., baseline conditions). It should be noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the volumes used for the economic impacts analysis do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the reduction in volumes, and thus in costs, from waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimization practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has evaluated the economic impacts for facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing organic TC wastes on a facility specific basis, limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only by the extent that data were available. EPA estimated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic effects by comparing incremental annual compliance costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a number of company financial measures, such as revenues, cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of operations, operating income, and net income. Financial data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were obtained from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation Descriptions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the last fiscal year reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since EPA believes that no costs will be associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for coke by-products in the final rule, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts will be associated with regulation of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes. Economic impacts of compliance for facilities currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land disposing chlorotoluenes were evaluated in aggregated form,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as information relating to these wastes are proprietary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> e. Benefits Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This section discusses the benefit estimates for today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. The section includes: i. Analysis of the universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards, ii. hazardous waste recycling exemption,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. groundwater pathway benefits, and iv. air pathway benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> i. Analysis of the Impact of the Universal Treatment Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> To determine the cost implications of the Universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment Standards (UTS), the Agency compared the UTS levels for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each constituent to those levels established for each constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in each waste code in the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency assumed that there would only be a cost impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the levels were sufficiently different to require a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the treatment technology used in order to meet the new UTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels. The comparison of levels rendered three results: (a) No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost impact because the constituent levels were the same, (b) no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost impact because the constituent levels were within one order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of magnitude of each other, or (c) a potential cost impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the constituent levels were greater than one order of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude apart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon identifying those waste code/constituent pairs which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were significantly different (i.e., greater than one order of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude), the Agency developed an estimate of the costs/cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings based on the incremental difference in the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology required and the new technology required to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> ii. Hazardous Waste Recycling Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Agency also estimated the potential cost savings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the hazardous waste recycling exemption for K069  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes. Obtaining volumes data from the Biennial Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System (BRS), and employing unit cost data, the Agency calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost savings associated with the change allowed in management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices. The Agency limited the analysis to K069 wastestreams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not mixed with other hazardous waste codes, since these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixtures may not be amenable or legal for recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> iii. Human Health Risk Reduction_Groundwater Pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Agency evaluated two types of human health benefits for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule: reduction in human health risks via the groundwater pathway, and reduction in human health risks via the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathway. EPA's analysis of the benefits of today's rule covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TC wastes only. These wastes dominate the other wastestreams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by today's rule in terms of volume. Moreover, these are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the only wastes for which the Agency had the data necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct a benefits assessment, in terms of attributes such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent concentrations and facility-specific wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volumes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fundamental assumption underlying EPA's approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing groundwater risk reduction is that Subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment is completely effective in the short-term, i.e., over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a period of about 30 years, but that in the longer term,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment systems will fail. The benefits analysis performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for today's rule examines this potential long-term risk which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be avoided under today's rule (i.e., only occurring at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 years into the future). The difference in risks from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline to the post-regulatory condition is the measure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental benefit associated with today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

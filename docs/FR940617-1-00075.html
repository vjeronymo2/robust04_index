			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Secondary amyltricresols is a mixture of isomeric secondary amyltricresols, which are derivatives of phenol, and has pharmacological properties similar to phenol. The agency agrees with the comment that the mixture of secondary amyltricresols is not equivalent to phenol and should be categorized separately from phenol. The submitted safety data included a study by Broom (Ref. 2), who reported that amylmetacresol is relatively nontoxic and less toxic than hexylresorcinol in rats and mice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No toxicity studies in humans were included in the information provided by the comment. However, in the tentative final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852 at 5858), the agency proposed that metacresol up to a 3.6-percent concentration be considered safe when combined with camphor and that a 3-to-1 ratio of camphor to metacresol reduces the irritating properties of metacresol. Although cresols may cause some irritation when applied to minor wounds, the agency believes that secondary amyltricresols at the concentration requested (0.1 percent) would not present any safety concerns, particularly considering the short-term use of antiseptics as patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. The submitted data are, however, inadequate to establish the efficacy of secondary amyltricresols.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data are also needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols. Only animal safety data are available, and these studies were limited to determinations of the minimum lethal dose by various routes of administration (Ref. 1). The submitted information on marketing history is not sufficient to provide general recognition of the safety of these ingredients. The data contained isolated reports of the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols causing occasional skin irritation, such as burning and blistering (Ref. 1), adverse effects that need to be more fully studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the effectiveness work on the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols has been in vitro. The combination is reported to combine the antibacterial activity of the single ingredients, that is, mercufenol chloride which is primarily active against gram-negative organisms and secondary amyltricresols which is primarily active against gram-positive organisms (Ref. 3). One in vivo study on the effectiveness of the combination as a patient preoperative skin preparation showed a substantial reduction in the skin microflora (Ref. 4). However, because neutralizers were not used, bacteriocidal activity cannot be differentiated from residual bacteriostatic activity. In addition, the effect of the 50-percent alcohol in the alcohol-acetone vehicle was not taken into consideration. Alcohol, 60 to 95 percent, is in Category I for antiseptic health-care uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the agency's guidelines for OTC drug combination products (Ref. 5), Category I active ingredients from the same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respects and the combination is on a benefit-risk basis, equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose. Accordingly, both mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols and the combination of these ingredients are placed in Category III. The combination needs further testing of the combined ingredients compared to each individual active ingredient to establish effectiveness of the combination as a patient preoperative skin preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recommends that in vivo and in vitro effectiveness data be submitted. The data should be based on both in vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products.

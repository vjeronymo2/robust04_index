In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday [10 January],  Kharchenko said that in 1994 Russia and the United States plan  to carry out 26 joint projects, compared to 17 in 1993.    He said the documents on mutual understanding and military  cooperation signed by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  during his official visit to the U.S. last year open up new  prospects for partnership between the two countries. The  documents have also sealed both sides' intention to leave the  years of nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers in  the past for good.    Grachev and his American counterpart agreed to meet  annually,  exchange delegations at all levels and train the Russian  military in the U.S. The delegations of the two ministries will  discuss a wide range of issues, including national security and  employment of the former army personnel in civilian sectors of  the economy. The two countries will also provide each other  with information.    The agreements provide for exchanges of ships and aircraft,  joint manoeuvres and war games, Kharchenko said.    In April 1993 the armies of the two countries conducted the  first joint manoeuvres to rescue the crews of aircraft and  helicopters in the Polar region. In June the U.S. and NATO  navy forces held war games in the Baltic Sea which were also  attended by warships of all Baltic Sea states, including the  Russian mine- laying destroyer Nastoychiviy.    Russia and the U.S. will conduct joint manoeuvres of their  peace-keeping forces in the Volga region this coming summer,  Kharchenko said.</p>

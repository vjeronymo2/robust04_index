Bruno Musso, chief executive of the main plant construction  arm of IRI's [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] vast  Finmeccanica engineering sub-group, painted an alarming picture  of the situation in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Slovakia and  Bulgaria. Of the 58 nuclear plants in Central and East Europe,  he said, 15 are of the same RBMK type as Chernobyl, with  obsolete cooling systems using normal water. Pointing to  "worrying" basic design faults, Musso said these plants "should  be shut down as soon as possible."    Another 43 plants use the slightly more modern VVER  technology, with cooling by pressurized water. Of these, the  oldest 10 should be closed, while 23 must be Westernized to  improve efficiency and safety, Musso said. The closures would  mean a fall in energy supplies in the former Soviet bloc of at  least 20,000 megawatts out of a total of 45,500.    Musso contended that the situation is "critical" because of  the "two major problems that have to be reconciled": on the one  hand, the safety demands of the Western world, which "can no  longer afford to risk another Chernobyl"; and on the other, the  economic needs of the Eastern nations, which "cannot see vital  energy cut off from one day to the next." For Lithuania alone,  he said, shutting the old power station at Ignalina would mean a  45 percent drop in the country's electricity supplies.    He thus launched a proposal embracing the two areas. "The  United States, in a confidential report, has declared its  willingness to buy the enriched uranium in the nuclear bombs of  the former Soviet Union; these resources, together with other  funding from the European Union, could be used for modernising  the less obsolete plants, restoring efficiency in the multi-fuel  plants, and building new sites."    These combined efforts should be enough to close the energy  gap caused by the cuts, also opening up interesting business  prospects for construction and engineering firms like Ansaldo,  which last month set up a company in Moscow with the Russian  energy agency.    Ansaldo's participation in the restructuring programme he  envisages, Musso said, could boost the company's turnover from  nuclear projects from 70 billion lire at present to 300 billion  in 1995, a figure he described as "very satisfactory."    He said that Ansaldo is thinking of asking the Italian  foreign ministry to have the problem of East European nuclear  plants formally placed on the agenda of the July Group of Seven  summit in Naples.</p>

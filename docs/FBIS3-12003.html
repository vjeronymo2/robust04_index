[Fujimori] I want to reiterate here the opinion I have  always  held of President Gaviria. I believe that his tenure as  secretary general will give the OAS the dynamism it needs in  this process of modernization the whole world is undergoing. I  think that in his capacity as future secretary general, he will  lay great emphasis on regional integration, on economic and  commercial development. [end recording]</p>

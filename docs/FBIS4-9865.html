			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez: "Participation in Upcoming Conference </F> Without Conditions"]    [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban  emigres from 40 countries and the local government will discuss  important topics starting with different ideological positions  and without preestablished conditions, during a conference  scheduled for this month.    Today, well-informed sources of the Cuban Foreign Ministry  informed PRENSA LATINA of the diverse geographical backgrounds  of the representatives invited to the meeting, which will be  held from 22 to 24 April in this capital.    The participants of the conference "The Nation and the  Emigre  Community," approximately 200, will include critics of the Cuban  political system who will be able to freely state their views  and even make proposals in pursuit of a common effort, an  authorized spokesperson confirmed to PRENSA LATINA.    Although the largest group will be from the United States,  given a large number of emigres reside there, other large  delegations will include Cubans living in Mexico, Venezuela, and  Spain.    There will also be delegates from countries that are very  diverse, including Costa Rica, Germany, Puerto Rico, Angola,  China, Argentina, Brazil, France, the Dominican Republic, the  eastern Caribbean islands, Australia, Hungary, Poland,  Switzerland, Czechoslovakia [as received], and Canada.    According to the agenda, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  will deliver a keynote address during the first working day on  the country's relations with the emigres as well as on various  issues. During the second day Vice President Carlos Lage will  present a report on the national economic situation.    Two other main presentations on the government's behalf will  be made by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and  Artists, who will give a presentation entitled "Culture and  National Identity." Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, will speak on the Cuban  political system and the work by the organization that he heads.    After each presentation, the participants will exchange  views  and make proposals on immigration regulations and emigres'  participation in the cultural and economic life of their country  of origin.    Regarding the latter, it was noted that professionals and  Cuban-American businessmen recently demonstrated great interest  in participating in a seminar also held in Cuba, an interest  intellectuals who reside abroad have also shown.    Information obtained by PRENSA LATINA indicates the  government is stressing the fact that guests to the event should  include delegates from a broad spectrum of political positions,  excluding only those who are engaged in aggressive or terrorist  attacks.    Although current problems are different and the concept of  bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States are also  different, Cuba believes the dialogue with the emigres held in  1978 can serve as a precedent for the new talks.    On this occasion, according to the same source, the Cuban  Government has decided to raise again the issue of normalizing  relations with emigres, despite the fact there are no  expectations that bilateral ties with Washington will improve,  as happened during the 1970's.    In this context, it is expected Cubans who live outside the  country will be able to voice interests and concerns of a  specific nature. Also, it is understood the conference will not  be able to exhaust all the topics of interest to the government  and nationals who live abroad.    In light of this, the meeting can be described as the first  step in an important direction and, also, as a pillar for even  more ambitious and definitive projects.</p>

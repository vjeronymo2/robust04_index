			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Diez and L.R. Aizpolea: "Prime Minister </F> Postpones Any Decision on the Government Until 12 June Results  Are Known"]    [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has put  together an initial plan of action for the next four weeks which  rules out compliance with any of the opposition's demands. He  is not considering resigning or handing over to another PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] member; he does not plan to  submit to a confidence vote in parliament; and he does not  intend to propose a series of resignations in light of his  acceptance of Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion's resignation.    Nor does he intend to reshuffle the government. All the  government and PSOE sources we consulted -- except for a  minority demanding immediate measures -- recognize, however,  that these actions, or at least some of them, may be implemented  after the European and local Andalusian elections on 12 June, as  long as the Nationalists continue to support the government.  That support is assured for the time being.    The Socialist leader is to make no statements today, leaving  the limelight to the outgoing interior minister. The government  now expects the opposition to use Asuncion's gesture as an  excuse to attack Gonzalez for not resigning. Sparks are  guaranteed to start flying at the spokesmen's committee meeting,  during which the People's Party representatives are to demand  that Gonzalez appear before a special congress plenum.    The government has no intention of submitting to the  opposition's diktats, judging by the statements issued after  Gonzalez' appearance before his party's Federal Committee on  Friday [29 April] evening. Joaquin Leguina, Madrid's Autonomous  Community president, and Joaquin Almunia, the PSOE member  responsible for research and programs, tried yesterday to lend  political weight to Felipe Gonzalez' instruction that  "hysterical reaction" must be avoided.    "We are on the eve of the 12 June European and Andalusian  elections of 12 June and a chain of resignations would lead to  instability; we must think ahead, a little beyond the situation  entangling us," Leguina urged, not forgetting to direct a few  choice epithets at Luis Roldan and Mariano Rubio.    Almunia pointed out that the prime minister recently took  part in the debate on the state of the nation and, on that  occasion, it was seen that he has the confidence of a majority  in the Chamber of Deputies. The Socialists admit that the  situation would become unsustainable if the CiU [Convergence and  Union] withdraws its support, which would mean that the Gonzalez  government could not push even one more law through.    The calm picture that is being painted by the Moncloa [prime  minister's residence] and the PSOE's main leaders was reinforced  by Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra in Barcelona last night.    The deputy prime minister set out to confirm the  government's  basic contention that it is capable of running the country with  the support of the Catalan Nationalists and, in some instances,  that of the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]. Serra stressed that  the Socialists' fight against corruption is its main task,  although this might initially cause the party's image to  deteriorate further.  <H5>  Minority Opinion </H5>   The government's strategy is countered by a minority in the  PSOE, especially the Socialist Left faction and certain regional  leaders. They are calling for an immediate gesture from  Gonzales. In the opinion of this group, which has made its view  known to the prime minister, it is politically dangerous for him  to allow too much time to elapse without making any drastic  decisions, since public opinion is shocked and demands decisive  political gestures.    According to these high-ranking Socialists, these demands  should be met with a sweeping change of government. A change of  government, the Socialists add, which would have a cathartic  effect, freshen up the image, and save Gonzalez from a  no-confidence vote. Those defending this proposal suggest that a  change of government would also boost the executive's battered  political profile, which currently leaves a lot to be desired.    This position, however, is not shared by the majority of the  Socialist leadership, which believes that implementing the  changes now would leave no political alternatives to offer  public opinion if the 12 June elections do not go well.    Public Works and Transportation Minister Jose Borrell,  speaking in Fuerteventura yesterday, referred to the Roldan and  Rubio cases saying: "It takes a lot more than two unscrupulous  men to tip the historical scales of Spanish socialism toward  `negative.'" Borrell mentioned that he could not say "which of  the two is worse, because I cannot choose between the plague and  cholera."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Daniyel </F> Bloch, Moti Bassok, and On Levi; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [DAVAR] Will we be ready to  withdraw from Gaza and Jericho even before all the fine details  of the Gaza and Jericho agreement are worked out?    [Rabin] We should make a distinction between withdrawing --  that is, ceding the overall responsibility -- and between  starting to implement certain elements of the agreement, even if  all the details have not been concluded yet -- providing the  security issues are being implemented in a clear and  well-organized manner. After all, we must set up completely new  security networks there. We have to establish a foundation for  the Palestinian police force which will assume responsibility in  Gaza. Greater Gaza numbers 250,000 Palestinians. I have no  desire to see Israeli soldiers and policemen roaming there.  They have no business being there once a Palestinian element  assumes responsibility for law and order and for preventing  terrorism in Gaza, but this cannot happen overnight.    We must prove to the enemies of peace on all sides that  despite the despicable murders of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], the Islamic Jihad, the rejectionist front  organizations and those coming from the Israeli side -- mainly  the crime of that murderer from Qiryat Arba' whose name does not  deserve mention -- that we are continuing the process.    [DAVAR] In view of the present situation, wherein every step  forward is followed by three steps backward, is it not  preferable to skip over the interim stages?    [Rabin] It is impossible to skip over the interim stages,  because that would lead to a complete stalemate. If we start  dealing with the permanent solution, the problems of Jerusalem,  the settlements, and the borders will crop up. The main test  now is to continue the negotiations and to implement the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement. I understand the Palestinians'  and 'Arafat's predicament, but he has to understand -- just as I  and the Israeli Government do -- that any delay only causes  problems in implementing the agreement and is helping the  enemies of peace on both sides foil it. The answer is that both  sides overcome all the difficulties and realize that the  appropriate answer to the enemies of peace is to attain and  implement the agreement. [passage omitted]    [DAVAR] There are those who claim -- some ministers included  -- that in order to minimize the friction in Hebron the Jewish  settlers should be evacuated now, without waiting for the next  stages.    [Rabin] I do not want to remark here on various operative  proposals. When I was prime minister between 1974-1977 I did  not permit any Jewish settlement in Hebron. Now, however, after  the fact and on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, we  are not uprooting settlements. It is very probable that in the  special circumstances of Hebron, as long as the small Jewish  settlement exists there, we will have to find other arrangements  which would provide security to the 120,000 residents of Hebron  vis-a-vis the 415 Jews living there.    [DAVAR] Will you at least make sure that no more Jews move  there?    [Rabin] I do not want to enter the details.    [DAVAR] Was it not possible to evacuate the two minor  Jewish enclaves in Hebron a long time ago?    [Rabin] Tall al-Rumaythah was established in August 1984, a  month after the elections and a month prior to the establishment  of the national unity government. The place is an  archaeological site, perhaps even a cemetery. Mrs. Pli'a  Albeck, who approved the Jewish holdings there, at the time  stated that it is forbidden to dig in that ground and is  necessary to dwell in mobile homes there because they do not  call for digging foundations in the ground. If anybody dared to  build a road somewhere in Israel over such a site, a great  outcry would have ensued. Some seven or eight families live  there. Two people under administrative arrest live there --  Barukh Marzel and No'am Federman. One of them is under  detention and the other is on the wanted list. The decision to  settle there was stupid, it is the classical example of a stupid  political decision.    [DAVAR] Is not the presence of five armies in Hebron -- the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces], armed settlers, international  observers, the Palestinian police, and Hamas people -- a sure  recipe for a powder keg?    [Rabin] Unfortunately it has already been proven that Hebron  is a powder keg. Today we are paying the price of this  despicable murderer, the lives of Jews worldwide and in Israel  have been endangered by him. The first thing we must do now is  to provide security for both Jews and Arabs in the present  layout, with a urban police force and international presence.  This is the price we must pay for the crime perpetrated by the  despicable murderer in the Cave of the Patriarchs. [passage  omitted]    [DAVAR] How do you see the West Bank following the  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho?    [Rabin] I regard Gaza as marginal for Israel's future and  security. The status of Judaea and Samaria, from both the  historical-religious and the security aspects, is totally  different. My national priorities are as follows: United  Jerusalem has top priority. Then come parts of Judaea and  Samaria, the Golan Heights, and Gaza is in last place.    [DAVAR] Will you consider the removal of problematic  settlements such as Netzarim following the withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho?    [Rabin] I want to adhere to the agreement. At this stage we  are not discussing the removal of settlements. In Hebron we  somewhat deviated from the agreement by accepting the  international presence, but here we are paying the price of the  despicable murderer from Qiryat Arba'.    [DAVAR] There are assessments according to which if we  declare our willingness to withdraw from all of the Golan, a  full peace agreement with Syria can be attained in a short time.    [Rabin] I maintained that in the previous circumstances,  faced by an inflexible Syrian position, we should have given  priority to negotiations with the Palestinians. I hope that  upon the resumption of the talks in late April Syria will evince  a new willingness. We must remember that the Palestinians do  not constitute a threat to Israel's existence. The main problem  with them has to do with the personal security of Israelis. A  strategic threat to Israel's existence comes from the direction  of Arab armies, and it is possible that in future they will be  supported by military aid from another Muslim country. This is  where we invest most of our defense budget. We do not need the  F-15's, F-16's, Apache helicopter gunships, and Merkava tanks  for our confrontation with the Palestinians. This is why we  need a peace agreement with Syria, but it must be a peace treaty  which will provide Israel with strategic security. With the  Palestinians we are trying to create a new reality which will  improve chances for coexistence. In the framework of the  interim arrangement we are trying to bring about coexistence in  a different format than today, a format enabling the  Palestinians to run their own lives and defend themselves.    [DAVAR] Based on what you heard from Clinton about his  meeting with al-Asad, and on what Ambassador Rabinovich told  you, do you think there are any chances for a breakthrough with  Syria?    [Rabin] I always believe there is a chance. But I cannot  tell you that this breakthrough is within reach at this stage.    [DAVAR] Are there secret contacts with Syria?    [Rabin] Unfortunately, no.    [DAVAR] Turning to Lebanon, it looks as though things are  getting worse there. Palestinian terror organizations have  taken advantage of the agreement with the Hizballah for firing  katyusha missiles at our northern settlements for the second  time.    [Rabin] There is no point in downplaying this. There has  been an escalation in Hizballah activity, and Palestinian  organizations have been joining this activity more intensely  than before. At the same time, the understandings remain in  effect even if there are occasional deviations. If I am not  mistaken, there were two such cases since last July. At the  same time, for the last eight or nine months calm and security  have prevailed along the northern border. The IDF and SLA [South  Lebanese Army] are paying a dear price for maintaining this  security.    [DAVAR] In retrospect, do you not think it would have been  preferable to continue Operation Accountability for another few  days in order to attain a better agreement?    [Rabin] No, we achieved our main objective. It would have  been a grave mistake to repeat the Lebanon War.    [DAVAR] What expectations do you have of your upcoming  meeting with Yeltsin?    [Rabin] I have not asked for this meeting. He invited me,  and during the visit in late April I will try -- if nothing  unexpected happens -- to discuss various political issues with  him and with the top Russian echelon. We are witnessing renewed  Russian political activity. This is not up to us, it is a fact.  We are mainly coordinating our moves with the United States,  but we cannot ignore the fact that Russia has been a partner,  together with the United States, in the Madrid process and the  ensuing negotiations, and we must maintain the dialogue with it.  The second important aspect of this visit will be the meeting  with Russian Jewry.    [DAVAR] Can the Russians offer any help on the Syrian track?    [Rabin] It is hard to answer this question before I speak  with Yeltsin.    [DAVAR] Will you ask Yeltsin to act on the issue of the  POW's and MIA's?    [Rabin] Everywhere I go I raise this issue, including during  my meeting with the pope. [passage omitted]    [DAVAR] A group of South African scientists have threatened  to reveal the secrets of nuclear and missile cooperation between  Israel and South Africa. Are you concerned about this?    [Rabin] I am not concerned about anything relating to what  you term the nuclear cooperation between Israel and South  Africa, because there never was such cooperation. [passage  omitted]</p>

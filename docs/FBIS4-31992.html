			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Jan Strasky, the  representative of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in a  coalition commission dealing with the restitution of church  property, has proposed that in the first phase the commission  focus on settlement of the church property question, from which  it would later draw a line heading for "the restitution full  stop."    Speaking at a press conference today, Strasky said the ODS  was interested in a rapid agreement. The party still insists  that only the state be the obliged person, and that the issue be  not described as restitution but "equipping of church  organizations with the property they need to carry out their  activities," Strasky emphasized. The ODS also keeps to its  proposal that the return of the church property be not settled  by a law but through individual government regulations, he said.    Strasky said the ODS supported the prior return of those  buildings from the state property which could continue to serve  the spiritual and administrative purposes of individual  churches, or as accommodation facilities for church  representatives. The buildings and premises which have been  serving social, cultural, and education purposes, should be  returned where churches were ready to carry out these activities  serving the public, under the same conditions -- including the  amount of state subsidies -- as everybody in this sphere,  Strasky said on behalf of the ODS.</p>

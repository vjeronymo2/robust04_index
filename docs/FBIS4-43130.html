			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French  President Francois Mitterrand have lent emphasis to their  initiative for a speedy closure of the Ukrainian nuclear power  station Chernobyl. In a letter to the heads of state and  government of the European Union (EU) and the G-7 countries, as  well as to European Commission President Jacques Delors, the two  leaders said that another accident in Chernobyl would have  far-reaching consequences for the population, the whole human  race, and the international energy situation. The initiative  was announced by Kohl and Mitterrand at the French-German summit  in Mulhouse [at the end of May].    According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, Kohl and  Mitterrand expressed their conviction that the topic will be a  "central issue" of the talks at the EU summit in Corfu at the  end of June and at the G-7 summit in Naples in mid-July. A plan  of action for the closure of Chernobyl is to be decided on in  Naples.</p>

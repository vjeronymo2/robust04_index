			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Post office queues to get piped TV shows Customers queueing in the 500 largest high street post offices will in future be able to watch advertising-based television programmes while they wait, the Post Office has announced. Programmes will contain film reviews, children's cartoons and competitions, as well as product information and advertisements. Customers will be able to pick up leaflets and order forms for goods and services advertised. Some post offices already show TV advertisements to customers, but this is the first time full programmes will be shown. The Post Office is one of the first retailers to experiment with the medium, and has attracted advertising from Barclaycard, Citroen and Alliance &amp; Leicester. Aspen Specialist Media, which will operate the channel, said advertisers typically paid about Pounds 20,000 for a 30-second commercial which played up to eight times an hour for five weeks. Aspen said about 7m adults would visit a post office more than four times during each five-week programme period, giving the channel a potential audience of nearly 29m. Mr Howard Bickley, media markets manager at the Post Office, said the programmes would be 'seen in the heart of the high street, close to major retail outlets, where consumers' impulse to respond to direct response television advertising can be satisfied immediately'.</p>

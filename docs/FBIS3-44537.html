			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- China plans to  produce at least 450 million tons of grain this year and  increase the per capita net income of 900 million farmers by  five percent.    Those are two of the targets unveiled here today by  Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang at a national conference on rural  work.    The minister said that China has set the production targets  for cotton at 4.85 million tons and oil-bearing crops at 17  million tons.    According to the plan, China is also expected to produce  more  meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit  this year.    "In order to materialize the plan, priority of the  agriculture and rural work this year will be given to increasing  farmers' income, deepening rural economic restructuring and  development of rural economy," said Liu.    He called for stable production increases for grain, cotton,  meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit,  and great efforts devoted to the development of the rural  enterprises.    Liu said that "the work of increasing farmers' income should  be the core of agriculture and rural work at present and for the  rest of the 1990s." To steadily increase farmers' income is the  foundation for stabilizing the countryside and the whole society.    "While paying close attention to raising farmers' income,  efforts must be continued to reduce the financial burdens on  farmers and to eliminate poverty," he added.    Starting this year, China will take a series of measures to  push ahead the restructuring of the farm produce circulation  system and market construction, including allowing the market to  determine grain prices, after the government has purchased the  contracted 50 million tons of grain.    In addition, China has started to set up a grain price  protection system, a nationwide grain reserve system and a  national fund for grain risks, all designed to protect the  interests of grain producers when grain prices are too low to be  profitable.    Liu also talked about the plans to improve the existing  agriculture policies.    He said the central government also decided to earmark  policy- based loans for economic development in China's major  grain and cotton production centers, integration of trade,  industry and agriculture in rural areas and development of rural  firms in middle and west China.    The minister added that the investment in agricultural  technology research and commodity grain production centers made  by governments at all levels will be increased.    "Agricultural departments all over the country should try  their best to induce governments at all levels, departments  concerned, township and village collective economic units and  farmers to increase their investment in agriculture."</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Portillo's mini-pension AS Mr Michael Portillo proceeds with his review of public spending, he shows every sign of relishing the opportunity to spread alarm and despondency among those who wish to preserve the welfare state. The Treasury chief secretary's declaration at the weekend that he favours greater personal provision for pensions in the 21st century looks like one more case in point. Yet this provocative kite-flying does at least have the merit of ensuring that the assumptions behind spending priorities are discussed. And in the case of pensions, the assumptions that lie behind government policy look highly questionable. Mr Portillo and his fellow ministers appear to believe that social security, including pensions, takes an unsustainable share of national income. Certainly there are grounds for worrying about the recent surge in spending, which reflects the combined impact of pre-electoral promises and the extent of the recession. But over a longer time span, total welfare spending has been relatively stable, even if there has been a change in composition away from housing and education in favour of social security and health. And the effect of demography on long-run pension costs has been wildly exaggerated. As John Hills of the London School of Economics points out in an admirable new study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on the future of welfare, the so-called demographic time bomb is relatively unthreatening. Applying today's level of welfare spending per member of the population to the age structure in the year 2041 would produce an increase equivalent to no more than 3.8 per cent of GDP at 1991-92 spending levels. To put the British welfare state in a wider context, the ratio of working people to retired people in Britain in 50 years will be higher than in any other developed country apart from Ireland. In the specific case of pensions, the Department of Social Security's own central projections show that pensions spending will fall as a percentage of GDP by the year 2000. Over the next 50 years, costs will rise. Yet the Hills study points out that the net effect on the public finances of an ageing population, the increasing cost of the state earnings-related pension and higher basic pensions would add up to 5 per cent of GDP if benefit levels were to keep up with living standards  - all of one-tenth of 1 per cent of GDP per year. The bill will actually be less, whatever the outcome of Mr Portillo's review, because the government decided in the 1980s to link benefits to prices rather than earnings, claiming that demographic pressure made the present system untenable. The fact is that the present share of welfare in national income is perfectly tenable; but it may not be compatible with the aspiration of successive chancellors to reduce the share of taxation in national income. Even without reductions in taxation there must be serious doubts whether personal pensions can fill the gap that is being left by the state, as the state basic pension falls to trivial levels in relation to contemporary incomes. Most reputable insurance companies are reluctant to provide personal pensions to those on much under Pounds 10,000 a year because they are simply not an economic proposition for the lower paid. This is because the average cost of a personal pension is high, at about 20 per cent of total contributions spread over a working lifetime. For the many who do not pay over a full working life, the expenses - chiefly the cost of maintaining an army of salesmen - will be higher. And because many insurance companies make a fixed charge, the costs rise hugely on smaller policies. Since a majority of those who are not in occupational pension schemes earn less than Pounds 10,000 a year, personal pensions cannot provide a remotely adequate alternative to the state scheme. Yet the government appears to have no alternative to this non-alternative. Perhaps the social security secretary Mr Peter Lilley should come up with one before Mr Portillo creates an even bigger gap in the system. While it makes obvious sense to have the private sector play a growing part in pension provision as incomes increase, the government cannot continue to ignore the practical shortcomings of its present pensions policy.</p>

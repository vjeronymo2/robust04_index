			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman today dismissed the film about China's  prisons shot by the British Broadcasting Corporation TV as  "sheer fabrication."    The spokesman said that it is very sinister for a handful of  people hostile to China to go out of their way to smear China  with fabricated stories under the current situation.    The spokesman made the statement in answer to a question  about a TV film shown by the BBC on May 16 that alleged that  "China has 10 million prisoners who are in desperate conditions."    The programme was made by British reporter Sue  Lloyd-Roberts,  who said she shot the film with a concealed camera while she was  in Xinjiang.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that "this is sheer  fabrication." According to information provided by the relevant  Chinese Government department, he said, the total number of  prisoners in China is slightly over one million -- about the  same number as in the United States.    The spokesman said that "It is the consistent practice of  China's law enforcing department to provide humanitarian  treatment to prisoners and run the prisons in a civilized manner  in keeping with the law."    "Under the current situation, a handful of hostile people in  the world have gone out of their way to smear China with  fabricated stories. Their motive is very sinister," he said.</p>

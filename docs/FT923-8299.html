			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Cadbury proposals too vague, accountants say THE CODE on corporate governance proposed by the Cadbury committee is too vague to be effective, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said yesterday. The association, which represents 38,000 accountants, said in its response to the proposals that annual reports should give a statement of principles, setting out goals and how effectively they have been met. It said the objectives set by Cadbury required far more clearly defined responsibilities and methods of compliance by bodies including the Stock Exchange and the Financial Reporting Council. The association called for more weight to be given to internal audit and control systems and for less reliance on non-executive directors. It said the guidelines should be extended to smaller companies. Separately, Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, issued a submission arguing that the Cadbury committee should be more forthright on the supervisory role taken by company boards. It said responsibilities should be allocated to specific non-executive directors, and consideration given to creating 'two-tier' boards in which non-executives would act as guardians of shareholders' interests, scrutinising the work of executive directors. It also called for interim and annual financial statements to be published more quickly - perhaps three months after the period in question. The committee, which issued its draft proposals in May, is to produce a final report in November.</p>

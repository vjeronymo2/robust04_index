			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK puts freeze on fresh aid to Nigeria BRITAIN yesterday announced a freeze on new aid to Nigeria until a democratically elected civilian government is installed and shown to be working unhindered. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said in a parliamentary statement that limited military sanctions imposed by the government last week in response to the annulment of this month's presidential elections by Nigeria's military rulers would remain in force 'until a democratic civilian regime has been installed and is working unhindered. Meanwhile no new aid commitments for Nigeria will be made.' Britain's bilateral aid amounts to about Pounds 14.5m a year. The sanctions do not affect delivery of the last batch of an order for 72 Mark 3 tanks worth Pounds 150m. But British officials said the option of suspending delivery would come under review if a handover to effective civilian rule was delayed beyond August 27. Nearly three weeks after the annulled poll, transition to democracy remains confused. President Ibrahim Babangida has annulled the victory of Moshood Abiola in the June 12 elections, banned both candidates and ordered fresh polls with new candidates, but insisted the handover to elected civilian rule is still 'on course'. Many southerners see the government's action as a determination to stop a Yoruba becoming head of state but there are no signs yet of the threatened rift between north and south in Nigeria. The military hierarchy has backed the annulment of Mr Abiola's victory at last week's meeting with senior officers in Abuja, but they told him that the regime must make way on August 27.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No rationale for price controls Sir, Christopher Johnson's summary of the National Commission on Education's proposals (Personal View: 'Lesson in maximising human capital', February 23) proposes to introduce market principles to higher education funding, through recouping some of the additional earnings which successful graduates can hope to make in later life. I am puzzled that he should stumble over his logical conclusion, that universities should in turn be allowed to charge students what the market will bear. The government's current resistance to 'top-up' fees, which Mr Johnson supports, is an oddly socialist position. 'It would,' he tells us, 'avoid the most sought-after universities using the scheme . . . further to enhance their relative advantage.' But he offers no rationale for this imposition of price controls, which is likely in the long run to level down the quality of the best universities through limiting their ability to raise income to match their necessarily higher expenditure. The impression given is of a poorly thought-out tactic intended to avoid protests from middle-class Conservative voters, without considering its implications for higher education strategy. Does the government want good universities to get better - or does it wish to level down to a uniform pattern of mass higher education? If market principles are to be applied, there is no case for government regulation to impose uniform fees across almost 100 universities. If Gatwick Express is allowed to charge more for getting people there faster than Network South-East, there is no justification for refusing to allow Oxford to charge more for offering a premium service.

			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. USERS AND COLOMBIAN 'WAR'  </P> <P> My mother was born in Colombia. I have visited that great country on one  occasion and I was very impressed with the sense of serenity and happiness of  its citizens. Now the people are cowering, praying that the scourge of the  narco-traffickers will end.  </P> <P> I appeal to the citizens of this country, although not as eloquently as  President Barco in his sobering world-wide appeal, that American drug users  look into their hearts and know with each sorry sniff of cocaine it equates to  a vote for repression and torture.  </P> <P> Colombia suffers today because the coca plant is indigenous to the land; it  grows without much nurturing or tending. For years the medicinal properties of  cocaine were used for toothaches, pains, and the such. Colombians, by and  large, are not afflicted with cocaine addiction.  </P> <P> How I loathe the insolent attitude of all the crack smokers and cocaine  sniffers. You are the cause of an entire nation's potential demise.  </P> <P> JUSTO SANTIAGO, Hollywood  </P></p>

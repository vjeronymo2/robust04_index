			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by military observer Vladimir Klimov: "Russian </F> Arms Under Contract"]    [Text] Approve the attached Statute on the certification  and registration of enterprises for the right to export weapons  and military equipment and to perform work and services for  military purposes. (From the Russian Federation Government  Decree No. 479).    Our defense industry is on starvation rations. It has  already become a habit to complain of the dwindling size of  funds earmarked by the state. At a press conference Defense  Minister Army General Pavel Grachev complained that the defense  industry enterprises are not being allowed to earn money. If  they were allowed to trade in their output many problems of the  financing of the defense industry would be removed.    It is not long since the day when this wish was voiced but  it  looks as though the minister's dream is beginning to come true.  The government decree, one of whose clauses is cited at the  start of this article, has switched the trading light for the  defense industry from red to green.    What rights are being offered to the enterprises which  develop and produce weapons and military equipment and which  have been certified and registered as participants in foreign  economic activity in the field of miltary-technical cooperation?  They can look for foreign clients, make presentations, and pass  on during talks the tactical and technical specifications of  arms authorized for export, give a guideline price, and perform  advertising and other marketing operations.    But that is only the first authorized step. The second is  the signing of contracts and, on the basis of the licenses  received, the independent export of weapons and military  equipment produced over and above the state defense order, and  operations and services for military purposes.    But what if a defense enterprises does not yet have  specialists capable of trading at international level? In that  case it is permitted to choose middlemen among the organizations  which have the right to conduct foreign economic activity in the  field of military-technical cooperation.    The final point of a decree usually contains something of  secondary importance. Probably the compilers of this decree did  not regard as important the permission given to enterprises  without drawing up a government decision to export spare parts  and training and auxiliary materiel for weapons and military  equipment already supplied abroad and also to perform work on  their technical servicing and repair. But this point is  extraordinarily important, since because of the absence of  permission to carry out repairs and servicing and to sell  training models, deals ready for signing were frequently  thwarted.    This factor is also considered in the low percentage of  sales  of Russian weapons on the foreign market. Optimists believe  that our share is something in the region of 11 percent, while  pessimists believe it is 5 percent. Both figures are an  indicator of our inability to trade.    What is of interest to the foreign customer right now?  Primarily aircraft. There is a constant demand for the "Mig-29"  and the "Su-27."    A lot has been written about the sale of combat aircraft.  Just as much has been written about firearms. But in speaking  of firearms we for some reason as a rule mention the Kalashnikov  assault rifle. But we now produce completely new firearms --  underwater, noiseless, with a great killing power, for the  special troops. These innovations are a tasty morsel for  foreigners. High-class weapons -- and without exaggeration it  may be said there is no other kind in Russia -- are essential in  the struggle against terrorists and criminals.    The press mentions considerably less frequently the fact  that  the Russian "Igla" and "Strela" small air defense missile  complexes are no less popular in the world than the U.S.  "Stingers." The "Strela" was developed at the "Tochmash" design  bureau and is intended for troops' air defense. Over 30  countries have bought the "Strela" for their own armies. The  latest model, the "Strela-10MZ," is a lightweight missile  complex which is directly in the combat formations of the  motorized rifle and tank regiments and can effectively protect  them from aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, and remotely  piloted vehicles.    Even more flattering terms can be used to describe the  S-300B  mobile system of anti-aircraft guided missile weapons with two  types of missiles. This supermodern air defense system was  created at the "Antey" science and production association and  despite its high cost is finding no shortage of customers.    And where are these countries which are prepared to respond  to our offers of weapons? Russia's defense industry people have  business relations with the states of the Near and Middle East,  Southeast Asia, China, and India. The East European countries  also remain purchasers of Russian weapons.    I wrote about the defense industry people's business  relations and though I had made a mistake. After all,  previously neither the "Tochmash" design bureau nor the "Antey"  science and production association nor any other defense  enterprises had anything. They had to make do with just the  state order issued from above. And with the ruble, constantly  dwindling because of inflation. But now the defense industry  people will be able to obtain the "greenbacks" so prized in our  country now. I want to believe that the dollars it earns will  help the defense industry to survive under present conditions  and to retain its powerful scientific potential and will enable  it to pay people a normal wage.    But I want to tell those who, having heard about the  dollars,  are rushing to conclude the first deals, that the government  decree supplements the "statute on the certification and  registration of enterprises for the right to export weapons and  military equipment and to perform work and services for military  purposes." Each point of this statute should be studied  thoroughly by a future participant in the trade in arms and  combat equipment to avoid any misunderstandings which could  result in a criminal case.    Meanwhile let us report that the certification and  registration are being carried out to assess the possibility of  enterprises' foreign economic activity, to protect Russia's  state interests, and also to create conditions for coordinating  and monitoring enterprises' activity in the field of  military-technical cooperation. The Russian Federation  interdepartmental commission for military-technical cooperation  with foreign countries is carrying out the certification at the  request of the Russian Federation state committee for the  defense sectors of industry.    And so the defense industry's path into international trade  is open. I want to believe that even the pessimists' percentage  for our participation in a highly profitable business will  exceed the optimists' present indicator. But although the green  light has been given you must remember that the journey is  always full of surprises. You must know how to prepare for them.</p>

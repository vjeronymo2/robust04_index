			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Savings seen in new VAT collection system THE SWITCH at the start of next year to new European Community rules for collecting valued added tax will cost British companies Pounds 100m, according to Customs and Excise. But once companies have adjusted to the changes, there should be overall net annual savings of Pounds 135m, Customs said yesterday. The analysis by Customs of the costs and benefits of the new VAT system, which comes into effect on January 1, marks the first stage in a publicity programme to make business aware of the changes. Business organisations and companies of all sizes have expressed concerns at the costs and complexity of the new rules. The new system of collecting VAT and collating trade statistics is necessary because of the creation of the European single market and the removal of customs checks at ports and border posts. Companies will file their own VAT data and trade statistics to customs. Doubts were cast yesterday on Customs' calculations. Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick said it had calculated the changeover costs at Pounds 200m. It doubted whether Customs had taken into account all internal costs involved in upgrading companies' systems. The move from border controls will mean that between 7m and 8m import and export documents will no longer need filling in, an end to delays in obtaining customs clearance, and costly bank guarantees to cover deferred VAT payments will no longer be necessary.

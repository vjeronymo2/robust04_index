			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Aerospatiale funding inquiry The European Commission yesterday said it would carry out a inquiry into whether the French government's capital injection of FFr2bn (Dollars 330m) into Aerospatiale would distort competition and therefore constitute illegal state aid, David Buchan writes from Paris. Aerospatiale said it needed the addition to its current capital which is FFr6bn or less than half its FFr15bn debt. But it was confident that the capital increase would win Brussels' approval, given that the company had last year considerably retrenched on its FFr2.38bn loss of 1992 and hoped to move into profit by 1995.</p>

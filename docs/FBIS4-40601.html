We cannot go without each  other," said Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking at  the opening ceremony of the 19th World Gas Congress here on  Monday.    The premier stressed that Moscow is waiting for concrete  proposals from the G7 countries on cooperation in regulating  investment flows and on development of adequate and specific  mechanisms for their encouragement and insurance.    "Russia wants that the partners in the coming Naples summit  should recognise it as `a country with a transition economy' and  made new concrete moves to improve conditions of access of its  goods to foreign markets," Chernomyrdin said.    "I'm sure that the turning of the G7 into a G8 will bring  about basically important and positive changes in the  geopolitical balance and create new favourable conditions for  Russia's full-fledged participation in the world economic  system."</p>

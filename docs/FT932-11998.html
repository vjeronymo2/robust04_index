			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lloyd's Business Plan: Record losses at Lloyd's LLOYD'S EXPECTS to report record losses of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 2.8bn for 1990 when it reports results for the year in June. The figure is artificially high because it counts some losses twice. When syndicates that insure the legal liabilities of agents in the market (the so-called errors and omissions insurers) and syndicates that provide stop-loss insurance (personal reinsurance for Names) set aside sums for possible future claims, the market as a whole provides for the same claim twice. Without this, Lloyd's says, losses would be near the Pounds 2bn of 1989.</p>

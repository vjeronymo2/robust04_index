Nissan inaugurated its 300 million pesos (11.1 million U.S.  dollars) worth of press and stamping plant as the first phase of  its two billion peso (74 million U.S. dollar) Nissan Technopark  in the country.    Toyota will invest some 1.2 billion pesos (44.4 million U.S.  dollars) to enhance its distribution network in the Philippines  within two years.    Mitsubishi will conduct a three-year expansion program worth  800 million pesos (29.6 million U.S. dollars) in its local  subsidiary to double its car production by 1997.    With the strong performance of the economy in the first  quarter, coupled with the ongoing economic restructuring such as  trade and investment liberalization and the stable political  situation, more and more Japanese investors are eyeing the  Philippines.    The country's economy grew by 4.84 percent in the first  three  months of the year following the resolution of the power crisis  and the government's bold economic reforms.    Economic division director Kazuo Sunaga of the Japanese  Embassy said today that Japanese investments into the country  are expected to further increase following the country's much  improved economic conditions.    "I can confidently say Japanese investments will now start  pouring," he added.    He also cited the Philippines' edge over other ASEAN  countries, noting that Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are  already saturated with Japanese investments.    Japanese investments in the country amounted to 25.039  billion pesos (927 million U.S. dollars) since 1988 up to may  this year followed by the United States with 16.536 billion  pesos (612 million U.S. dollars).</p>

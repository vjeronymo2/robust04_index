			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "The </F> Blockade Wall Will Collapse Whether They Like It or Not"]    [Text] Those who follow international affairs know that few  states have carried out UN Security Council resolutions.  Because, very often big power interests influence the issuance  and implementation of these resolutions.    Perhaps, Iraq is foremost among world states that have  responded positively by fulfilling its obligations under UN  Security Council Resolution 687, as admitted by UN Special  Commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, who acknowledged  Iraq's full cooperation with the council.    The question now is: Since the United States pressured the  council to pass that resolution in order to impose an unfair  blockade on the Iraqi people, and it has kept demanding for  several years that Iraq must first implement that resolution,  which links the lifting of the blockade to Iraqi fulfillment of  its obligations under the resolution, and since the United  States has spoken clearly in those terms, why is it now raising  political issues and aims that have nothing to do with  Resolution 687, whose Paragraph (22) permits Iraq to export oil  once it has fulfilled its obligations?    This clearly shows that Washington is pursuing a double  standard policy and that it will not hesitate to commit the most  hideous crimes, such as the unfair blockade it has imposed on  the Iraqi people, in order to achieve its aggressive designs  against peoples that struggle for their freedom and dignity.    It is now clear to the whole world that two standards are  being followed with regard to UN resolutions: First, an  objective standard that calls for strict implementation of a  clear resolution, and this is the standard upheld by the  majority of world nations and most UN Security Council member  states. Second, a standard based on a hostile and biased  attitude toward Resolution 687 in order to harm the Iraqi  people, and this is the dirty standard followed by the United  States, the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, and other pro-U.S. regimes.    These vile people do not care about anything in the world  other than devising the most hideous ways in order to harm the  Iraqi people and to commit crimes against them.    Resolution 687 is clear and frank. It places certain  obligations on Iraq as well as on the Security Council. Now  that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, justice, fairness, and  international legitimacy and legality, which Washington often  brags about, oblige the Security Council to honor its  obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, which is  no longer justifiable following the removal of all the causes  which are supposed to have led to the passing of Resolution 687.    Washington's procrastination and attempts to circumvent the  resolution in order to bar the council from honoring its  obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, and its  claim about "a constant Iraqi threat" in order to blackmail  Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and to plunder the wealth of the Arab  people, who have been afflicted by those traitorous rulers, are  poor and ridiculous excuses which cannot maintain any form of  stability and security in the region, and they will certainly  not guarantee the legitimate interests of Washington and other  powers in the region.    The wall of the blockade will certainly collapse through the  solid will of the Iraqis and their great leader Saddam Husayn.  The unfair ones will only reap failure and disappointment.</p>

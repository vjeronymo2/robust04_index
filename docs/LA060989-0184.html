Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> UNO BALKS AT PUBLIC QUERY ON GEISHA  </P> <P> Prime Minister Sosuke Uno today refused to respond as a questioner in  Parliament broke precedent by asking him about a news report claiming he kept a  highly paid geisha as his mistress.  </P> <P> Uno, who previously denied the report to journalists, said he would not comment  on it in a public forum.  </P> <P> The report surfaced last weekend in the Sunday Mainichi magazine. An article  quoted an unidentified 40-year-old woman as saying Uno had paid her $2,100 a  month over a four-month period in 1985. "He is not a man of noble character,"  the article quoted the woman as saying. "I don't want him to use politics the  same way he treated me."  </P></p>

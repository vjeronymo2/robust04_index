The following summarizes the procedures and logistics associated with this informal hearing pursuant to 40 CFR part 750. Participants and/or commenters are advised to see 40 CFR part 750 for greater detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each person or organization desiring to participate in the informal hearing shall file a written request to participate with the OPPT Document Control Officer, TSCA Docket Receipts, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Rm. E&hyph;G99, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The request must be received by the Agency no later than November 9, 1994. The request shall include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. Organizations are requested to bring with them, to the extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each of the areas to be addressed. An organization that has not filed main comments on the rulemaking will not be allowed to participate in the hearing, unless a waiver of this requirement is granted in writing by the Record and Hearing Clerk or the organization is appearing at the request of EPA or under subpoena (40 CFR 750.6(a)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A panel of EPA employees shall preside at the hearing, and one panel member will chair the proceedings. The panel may question any individual or group participating in the hearing on any subject relating to the rulemaking. Opening statements should be brief and restricted to points that could not have been made in main comments, or to emphasize points which are made in main comments, but which the participant believes can be more forcefully urged in the hearing context. Persons in the hearing audience may submit questions in writing for the hearing panel to ask the participants, and the hearing panel may, at their discretion, ask these questions (40 CFR 750.7(a) and (b)). See 40 CFR 750.7(c) for the rule governing the submission of additional material by the hearing participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the close of the hearing, any participant in the hearing may submit a written request for cross-examination. The request shall be received by EPA no later than 1 week after a full transcript of the hearing becomes available (to determine when the transcript is available, interested persons should call the number listed under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).

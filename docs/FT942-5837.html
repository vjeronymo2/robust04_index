			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norway warned on banking The Norwegian government's continued control of commercial banks risked distorting competition in the sector, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Norwegian Bankers Association chairman, yesterday warned. Mr Hvistendahl, who is also president of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest commercial bank, said the government should make it an objective to re-privatise state-owned commercial banks. 'The government stake in the major Norwegian commercial banks will inevitably affect competition in the (domestic) banking industry,' he told the association's annual meeting in Bergen. Norway's banks last year returned to profit for the first time in several years, after emerging from the country's worst banking crisis since the second world war. The crisis forced the government to undertake a far-reaching rescue operation, in which it became the single biggest owner of the capital of the top three commercial banks. DnB received more than NKr7bn (Dollars 981m) in state cash, while Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, received a NKr9bn injection. The Labour government has repeatedly stressed its intention to maintain a minimum 50 per cent shareholding in DnB and Christiania Bank, at least for now. Last year, the state boosted its stake in DnB, to 87.5 per cent from 69 per cent, by converting NKr3.5bn in preference capital in the bank to 350m new shares. The state reduced its stake in Christiania to 68.9 per cent from 98.8 per cent last December. It remains the sole owner of Fokus Bank. In March, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned against continued dominant government involvement in the banking industry.</p>

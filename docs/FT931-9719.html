			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / CO2 emissions to exceed target THE European Community is likely to miss international targets for stabilising carbon dioxide emissions by a margin of at least 4 per cent, according to member countries' national plans submitted to the Commission. A report circulating in the Commission shows the 12 EC members likely to emit at least 2.878bn tonnes of CO in the year 2000, compared to about 2.775bn tonnes in 1990. The EC is committed by its own policy and international agreements, to stabilise CO emissions, believed to be implicated in global warming, at 1990 levels by 2000. The Commission has been urging member countries to produce projections of their emissions. According to the briefing paper, distributed in the environment directorate, some have given targets for curbing emissions while others have used forecasts based on national energy plans. According to the paper, Germany, the largest emitter, has the most ambitious plan - to cut emissions in 2005 to 75 per cent of 1987 levels. Denmark is aiming to cut 20 per cent of 1988 emissions by 2005, and the Netherlands and Belgium to cut about 5 per cent of 1990 levels by 2000. The UK, the second largest emitter, is aiming to stabilise levels, as are France and Italy. However, Greece and Spain expect a rise of at least 25 per cent this decade. Portugal has the highest projected rises, of 29 and 39 per cent, depending on economic growth. Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, said yesterday: 'These figures show that more has to be done even if countries stick to their national targets.' The difference in projections between richer and poorer EC members has caused tension over proposals for carbon and energy taxes, which poorer countries feel should be aimed at the heaviest polluters.</p>

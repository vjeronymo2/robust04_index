			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HONDA ANNOUNCES NAVIGATION CD WITH MAP DISPLAY FOR CARS  </P> <P> Honda Motor Co. said today it has developed inertial navigation equipment for  automobiles that always provides accurate information to the driver.  </P> <P> The major Japanese automobile maker said the new system combines navigation  technology such as one used for aircraft and a map database system using a  compact disk.  </P> <P> The distance driven is measured by the Vehicle Speed Sensor and the changes in  direction are measured by the high-precision Gas Rate Sensor to calculate the  route traveled, the company said.  </P> <P> The route traveled is continually checked against the road information stored  on the compact disk.  </P> <P> The current location and direction and the route traveled are displayed on a  road map on a 6-inch color cathode ray tube display, the company said.  </P> <P> The vehicle's position and its direction are displayed in the center of the  map, and the route traveled is displayed as a dotted line. When the destination  is designated, the travel direction is shown by a solid line and the distance  as the crow flies is shown in kilometers, the company said.  </P> <P> The company said the map database on a single compact disk contains most  information needed for ordinary driving such as the names of prefectures  (states) and cities, intersections and public and leisure facilities, which are  displayed in a color scheme.  </P></p>

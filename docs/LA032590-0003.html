			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, HAPPY DAYS!  </P> <P> Regarding "O, Happy Days!" (Feb. 4): The 1950s in Los Angeles were important  because they marked the watershed between Los Angeles, the big city, and Los  Angeles, the megalopolis. Thanks for the fine collection of memories. However,  we must look forward and not back as we prepare to enter the 21st Century.  </P> <P> CLIFF DEKTAR  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

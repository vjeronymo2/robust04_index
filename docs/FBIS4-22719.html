			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova and Vadim Tyagniryadno: "See </F> You at the Elections on 3 April. A Round Without Winners"]    [Text] The city electoral commission is continuing to  verify the results of the elections. Chairman of the Electoral  Commission Vladimir Fomichev stated yesterday that, as of  yesterday, the elections might be considered validly held in  only 25 districts, with a winner not being revealed in any one  of them. Voting is to be held yet again on 3 April  everywhere.    Democratic Unity was the most successful among public  associations that took part in the campaign: All of its  candidates qualified for the second round. All of St. Petersburg  managed to qualify six candidates, the City We Love--two  candidates each [as published], and Business St. Petersburg and  the Motherland--one each. Another 15 participants in the second  round were nominated by the voters in their districts.    The city commission is continuing to review petitions  concerning violations. However, observed Fomichev, even if the  case of propaganda on election day is proven, it is not clear  what sanctions can be used. The commission is not entitled to  bump a candidate out of the competition; meanwhile, ruling the  elections invalid would result in punishing not only the  violator but also his competitor.    Meanwhile, the future of the new representative organ of  power in the city remains uncertain. According to the  regulations, the first meeting of the City Assembly should be  held no later than the 30th day after the elections. However, it  is already clear that the City Assembly will have legal  incapacity until the repeat elections are held (the date has not  been determined yet). No fewer than one-half of the established  number of the elected representatives of the people should be  present even in order for a meeting to have the right to make  decisions. Besides, many fundamental decisions (this is  particularly the case with mutual relations with executive  power) may only be passed by the assembly by two-thirds of the  votes. Vladimir Fomichev refused to comment on this situation.  He stressed that the directive of the mayor to extend voting was  addressed directly to precinct electoral commissions, whereas  the city commission restricted itself to establishing procedures  for sealing ballot boxes. When journalists inquired whether this  means that precinct commissions report to the mayor, Fomichev  merely shrugged his shoulders: "You are asking strange  questions."    To this day the legitimacy of the mayor's decision to extend  the elections by one day has not been determined. As is known,  on Monday the procuracy lodged a protest with the mayor's office  which points out that the length of voting is established by  Article 33 of the Basic Regulations on Elections to the  Representative Organs of State Power of the Russian Federation  Components, which were confirmed by an edict of the president on  27 October of last year, and cannot be changed.    Yesterday, Anatoliy Sobchak signed a response to the protest  of the procuracy. In the response he rejected the complaints.  The response reads: "An organ that has issued a regulatory act  is entitled to amend it." In the opinion of the mayor, Article  33 of the Basic Regulations imposed a ban on changing the length  of elections for district electoral commissions, but not for the  organ which has issued election regulations. Besides, the mayor  recalled that the Basic Regulations are advisory in nature.    The procuracy refused to comment on Anatoliy Sobchak's  response, referring to the fact that this document has not been  received through official channels yet. In any case, under  legislation in effect the procurator is left with just two  possible alternatives for action: accept the arguments of the  mayor's office or forward the protest to the courts.    What is to be done? Representatives of seven electoral  associations tried to answer this question yesterday. Igor  Artemyev (the City We Love) and Aleksandr Belyayev (Democratic  Unity) informed their colleagues about a conference held at the  mayoralty. Anatoliy Sobchak expects to conduct a second round in  the fall in the belief that the Goodwill Games will improve the  mood of the citizens. In his opinion, the elected deputies  should focus on working with the voters.    A majority of those in attendance proceeded from the need to  acknowledge that the elections were not validly held in all  districts because the extension of the elections made them  illegal.    Aleksandr Belyayev voiced a different point of view.  According to him, Anatoliy Sobchak was entitled to change the  voting schedule.    An agreement in principle on forming councils of electoral  associations was reached at the meeting. The issue of the future  of executive power is up in the air. The Motherland and Great  Russia insist on restoring the powers of the old city soviet.  Our City--Our Home proposed to create an organ which is new in  principle for the duration of the transition period--the public  chamber of St. Petersburg. A law on such chambers could be  passed by the State Duma.    On Friday the State Duma will consider the issue of the  elections in St. Petersburg. Sobchak has already stated that he  will challenge any decision of the parliament.</p>

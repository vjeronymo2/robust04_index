			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to import cotton INDIA IS TO import 500,000 bales of cotton to ease shortage and contain the runaway rise in local cotton prices. The state-owned Cotton Corporation of India will immediately import 200,000 bales of yarn to feed 15m hand looms. This season's cotton crop of 11.6m bales (170 kg each) is down from the earlier estimate of 12.2m bales at the beginning of the season in October. Cotton prices were stable at this time last year, although the 1990-91 crop was only 11.7m bales, because of 3m bales carried forward from the previous year and low consumption by the textile industry. But cotton consumption surged by 1m bales to an estimated 13m bales this year. Prices soared late last year following the 24 per cent rupee devaluation in July that made textile and yarn exports competitive overseas. The government is concerned, however, over the sharp increase in yarn exports, which has created domestic shortage, hurting labour-intensive handloom sector and threatening politically unacceptable unemployment. Fresh export commitments for cotton yarn have been banned, sending a signal to the textile industry of the need to meet the yarn needs of handloom weavers. The shortage should to ease when corporation begins importing cotton. Mr. MB Lal, the corporation's chairman, says, overseas cotton is 20 per cent cheaper on landed-cost basis.</p>

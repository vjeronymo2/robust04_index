			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Choice That Faces Europe"] </F>   [Text] The successful outcome of membership negotiations  between the European Union [EU] and the applicant countries is a  cause for celebration. Referendums and European Parliament  permitting, Austria, Sweden and Finland should be able to join  at the start of next year. The only regret is that Norway has,  as yet, been unable to agree terms.    The accession of all four states would be a cultural,  political and economic boost to the Union. These countries  share the EU's democratic values and each will extend the  Union's diplomatic reach into new areas of the Third World. The  EU would also gain much from closer links with the Czech  Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The German plan to  secure for these countries some stake in EU decision-making by  the end of the year merits the strongest support.    Establishing this close relationship will not be easy. The  EU may find itself taking on a financial burden it can ill  afford. But it is a risk worth taking. For it would underwrite  the introduction of democracy to these states and provide a  measure of the security they were denied when their applications  to join NATO were rejected. They would also be encouraged to  push ahead with developing market economies.    Our continent, too, would be stronger. Instead of two blocs,  one wealthy and self-centred, the other poor and envious, there  will be a chance to build a community in which prosperity is  shared.    Enlargement also has considerable implications for the way  the Union is governed. While there were only six, nine or even  12 members, it was possible to argue the case for a centralised  Union. Even when the Union was small, the desirability of this  goal was questionable; with 20 members, it is not even a  practical possibility.    The Union has a choice: it could become a loose  confederation of nation states which worked closely together in  a single economic market and operated together as a political  unit when there was a consensus. This approach is favoured by  Denmark and Britain.    The alternative is a federal structure where many matters  ranging from drinking water to education, which the Union is now  involved in, would be the sole responsibility of member states.  Control of the major issues, including foreign, monetary and  economic policy, would be conducted on a supranational level.  This would be feasible only if implemented on majority voting  with countries losing their right of veto.    The future of the Union is too important a question to be  left to the politicians. There must be the widest possible  democratic debate across the Union. There must be an attempt to  build a democratic consensus. Our politicians should tell us  openly what kind of Union they wish to see. They must then try  to persuade us to accept their vision.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Heseltine's magic lantern MR MICHAEL Heseltine is enjoying himself again. After hard labour in the House of Commons over the future of British Coal, the trade and industry secretary is again doing what he does best - reorganising a Whitehall department and selling a line in policy. The central themes of the slide show he premiered to the Financial Times and a group of industry leaders last week are incontestable. British industry is inadequately competitive and the rambling government department which oversees it is unfocused and ineffective. Mr Heseltine has a good track record in Whitehall management. At both the Department of Environment and the Ministry of Defence, he improved motivation and efficiency. At the Department of Trade and Industry, he will use similar techniques, overhauling structures and accountancy procedures and drawing in private-sector managers to sharpen up performance. 'Partnership' has long been a Heseltine watchword and it is still very much in vogue. A key aim is to improve communication within the department and between officials and industry, so that the DTI knows what it is talking about. There will once more be teams of officials to analyse the competitiveness of 15 sectors of British industry; data base will speak unto data base in government research establishments; a 'domesday book' of regulations will be heavily edited; there will be 'one-stop shops' around the country to facilitate the transmission of advice and information to business. Mr Heseltine will proclaim these plans with a promoter's flair. Hezza is backing British industry, in export markets and in the cabinet. Good deeds It will be some time before the effectiveness of these changes can be judged, but they will certainly be welcome to British industrialists. The question is whether Mr Heseltine, in his 1990s manifestation, will stop short of the market-distorting and economically damaging forms of dirigisme with which he flirted in the 1980s. To judge by deeds rather than words, his record in the last year has been good. He has fought for the right policy on coal, at some personal political risk. He has resisted the temptation for quick, taxpayer-funded fixes at Leyland Daf. More doubtfully, his strengthened financial support for exporters could result in subsidies for poor business deals, even if the measures are not lavish by international standards. Government selection of 'national champions', even in the limited context of bids for export contracts, is a tricky game. Competition policy But the biggest question marks over Mr Heseltine's tenure at the DTI concern competition policy and Europe. On the former, he insists that there is no change in the Tebbit-Lilley doctrine, to confine competition policy judgments to questions of competition. But doubts have been raised in practice by his decision to overrule the Office of Fair Trading in a couple of recent cases. Since Mr Heseltine shares the view of his predecessors that no public explanation should be given for these decisions, there is a danger that policy will become opaque and arbitrary. With crucial judgments ahead on British Gas and other privatised utilities, this is worrying. More important still, if Mr Heseltine fosters an illiberal culture of shady ministerial meddling in his own department, it will be reflected damagingly in the councils of the European Community, where DTI ministers play a large role, on everything from energy to trade. Mr Heseltine's instincts will certainly be to join the political fray on questions such as the future of Airbus and its potential collaboration with Boeing on a super-jumbo project. He looks back with pride at his role in creating the European Space Agency. On some such matters, ministers have a necessary role, but there is a risk that Britain is lured towards the unrewarding and outdated game of picking industrial and technological Euro-winners. More broadly, Britain could blunt its influence as an economic liberaliser, in matters of trade, industry and energy. If he can avoid these pitfalls, Mr Heseltine will show that he is the right man in the right job at the right time.</p>

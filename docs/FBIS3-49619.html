			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Chairmen of  the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) east Slovak  branches voiced concern this weekend over Slovak President  Michal Kovac's new year's speech.    In a letter, approved over the weekend and published in full  by today's eastern Slovak pro-government daily LUC, HZDS leading  officials recall that Kovac ran for the 1992 parliamentary  elections to the former Czechoslovak Parliament on the HZDS east  Slovakia branch's slate. They accept with understanding the  suspension of Kovac's HZDS membership (as long as he holds the  post of Slovak president), but with "less understanding" the  establishment of a corps of the president's advisers filling the  President's Office, the letter says.    "We were disquieted at your (Kovac's) new year's speech in  which among other things you urged political entities  (fortunately there are not many of them in parliament) to form a  broad coalition. Unfortunately you did so only on a general  level which did not address anyone," reads the letter.    The HZDS functionaries ask him whether or not those who  refused to vote for the adoption of the Constitution and the  Declaration of Slovakia's Sovereignty, who formed new groups in  parliament, call for early elections, and "question each of the  present government's steps every day" are also among those to be  represented in the coalition he proposes.    "Our questions require clear answers. A general appeal which  can only further destabilize the political scene and give the  executive power again to those who failed to gain it in the  regular (1992) democratic elections is not sufficient," says the  letter, which LUC says was also signed by four HZDS deputies of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Han Zhenjun [7281 2102 6511] and </F> correspondent Su Yi [5685 1837]    [Text] Qinshan, 15 Dec (XINHUA) -- Since joining the grid  in 1991, the Qinshan nuclear power plant, China's first  domestically designed, built, and managed nuclear power plant,  has earned praise for its safety and reliability of operations  as it rapidly and smoothly regulates its operating loads, all  neat and clean, and free of environmental pollution and  transportation pressures. So far this year, the plant has  generated 1.62 billion kWh of electric power, already beating  the annual plan by 200 percent, and operating as it is, at a  load factor of 64 percent, it is two years ahead of its planned  annual performance capability.    The first load of concrete for the Qinshan nuclear power  plant was poured on 20 March 1985, and 81 months later, on 15  December 1991, it was successfully tested on the grid. Last  July, after reaching full-power operations, its facilities were  completely realigned, and the plant was brought up to its  maximum operating capability. On 12 March this year, the plant  was again successfully operated on the grid, and on 25 June its  100-hour "examination and acceptance test" was completed without  a hitch. The plant is now well into its high-operational stage,  generating up to 7.2 million kWh per day.    An official of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation told  reporters that since the plant joined the grid two years ago it  has generated 2.145 billion KWh of electric power, exceeding the  original plan. There have been no harmful effects to the  facilities, personnel, or the environment. The Environmental  Surveillance Department reports that the amount of radiation  from waste water discharged into the environment is less than  the limit of one part per thousand set by the State, and the  volume of discharged inert gases is about at allowable limit of  one part per 100,000, which proves that the operation of the  Qinshan nuclear power plant is clean, safe, and economical.</p>

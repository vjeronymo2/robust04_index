			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong continues in record territory STRONG buying interest in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gave some support to the market but general activity was dull, agencies report from Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average added 58.09 to 16,817.70 after a day's high of 16,746.12 and a low of 16,885.12, slightly down on the week. Volume was estimated at 270m shares, up from 244.5m on Thursday, with decliners outnumbering gainers by 498 to 443, while 197 issues were unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 2.20 to 1,268.31. Brokers said that the market will continue to be dominated by quiet trading in individual issues until the government announces more measures to boost the economy. NTT resumed its recent rally, climbing Y39,000 to Y705,000 in heavy volume of 59,000 shares on buying by public pension funds. Related issues also rose with Nippon Comsys up Y26 to Y745 and Fujikura Y25 higher at Y595. NTT has been the market leader for most of this week on expectations of more government investment in communications. NEC rose Y41 to Y661 on public fund buying. Reports that an immunosuppressive drug for liver transplants, developed by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, was nearing approval sent the company's shares up Y67 to Y845. Pioneer fell Y30 to Y1,980 on news that it may post a loss in the last 1992/93 quarter. Stocks linked to Japan Railways moved ahead further on speculation that the privatised rail system may benefit from infrastructure spending. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets found widely mixed fortunes. HONG KONG remained in record territory as the market gave a guarded welcome to Governor Chris Patten's comments on the latest state of play in the dispute with China on the colony's future. The Hang Seng index rose 35.01 to a second consecutive all-time high close of 6,502.81, for a weekly rise of 2.3 per cent. Turnover remained heavy at HKDollars 4.7bn with continued strong demand seen from domestic, US and Chinese investors. Shares dipped shortly after the opening as profit-taking took the index down almost 40 points, but confidence re-emerged before Mr Patten addressed the Legislative Council. 'In the event, the speech was neutral to positive, fully justifying the rally we have seen so far,' said one analyst. HSBC Holdings, which will report earnings mid-month, led the actives and rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 68. Its Hang Seng Bank unit, which posted a 26 per cent rise in profits, added HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 67. AUSTRALIA continued lower, under pressure from weak News Corp shares and uncertainty in the run-up to the election. The All Ordinaries index closed 9.3 points down at 1,613.6, little changed on the week. News Corp, which said its options issue raised Dollars 507 million, fell 15 cents to ADollars 7.15 as 8.2m shares changed hands. Brokers explained that the 5.5 per cent yield on News America Holdings' liquid yield option notes was higher than expected, leading to the sale of shares in favour of the new security. TAIWAN turned back after its strong run earlier in the week and the weighted index finished 5.47 lower at 4,731.85, a 10.6 per cent rise on the week. SEOUL recorded a new low for the year after falling for the eighth consecutive day. The composite index dipped 6.65 to 615.57, for a weekly decline of 4.6 per cent. BOMBAY suffered a round of selling by speculators who had overbought ahead of last weekend's national budget. The BSE index fell 60.93 to 2,471.74 after recovering from a low of 2,459.50, down 11 per cent on the week.</p>

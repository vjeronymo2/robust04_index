The Benxi Steel and Iron Complex, one of the leading  pollutant dischargers in this city in Liaoning Province, has  recently equipped all seven huge boilers at its power plant with  dust removal devices, thus reducing the local dust fall by  one-third, local officials said.    The dust-removal project has cost three years and 80 million  yuan, contributed by the government and the complex. After it  went into operation recently, local citizens, especially those  living in the surroundings of the complex, said that they felt  the air is obviously cleaner this winter, according to the  officials.    Song Jian, a State Councilor, sent his congratulations to  the  complex for its encouraging achievements in reducing pollution.    The project is a part of "Operation Blue Sky," launched in  the city five years ago to reduce serious air pollution.    The "Operation Blue Sky" involves a total investment of 375  million yuan, part of which will be undertaken by the Benxi  steel complex.    Though suffering from a serious shortage of funds, the  officials said the complex will invest another 300 million yuan  to carry out five more projects to reduce pollution.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Tomsk to become launch-pad for Estee Lauder distribution in Siberia The city of Tomsk, which yesterday held its first auction of medium and large-scale enterprises, is also to become a launch-pad for Estee Lauder to distribute cosmetics in Siberia, writes Leyla Boulton. Mr Igor Piltsov, an entrepreneur and local council member, said his company, Stix, had an agreement with Estee Lauder to set up shops in Tomsk and other western Siberian cities such as Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk. Mr Piltsov said the US cosmetics company had sent an architect to help him design a shop in Tomsk and sales staff had been trained in Moscow, where Estee Lauder is already established. A pot of face-cream costs Rbs5,000 (Pounds 6.3) at current exchange rates, or the minimum monthly rouble wage.</p>

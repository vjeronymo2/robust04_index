			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Observer: Top cat Hello, hello. Sounds of more headbanging at Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss blue chip which prides itself on being the world's largest trade inspection and testing organisation. Elisabeth Salina, the beautiful and determined chairman, has sacked her chief executive, former Perrier boss Thierry Chereau, less than two years after she brought him in to help sort out the business. His appointment had always looked a bit odd. SGS was still recovering from a nasty boardroom battle in 1989 when Salina, then only 34, had headed a posse of younger founding family members that won back control of the board. Many observers were surprised that she brought in Chereau rather than become chief executive herself. Salina is now abolishing the position of chief executive claiming SGS has become too complex to be run by one person, and is creating an executive board. . . . which she will chair. She hopes potential successors will emerge in the next five years, so she can withdraw again. Don't hold your breath.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (6): At peace with its past - Peter Bruce assesses the country's foreign policy FROM the ramparts of St George's castle, overlooking Lisbon and the vast estuary of the Tejo river spilling into the Atlantic, it is easy to feel the pull of the sea and the west. Out there, for centuries, Portugal sought, and found, its place in the world. Nearly 200m people in Africa, America and Asia speak its language now. And while the stories of an often bitter decolonisation have been told many times, it is still striking, just walking along Lisbon's streets and observing the black, the golden and the white faces, how comfortable the country seems to be with its past. But Portugal has been able to put the past in its place. While the British - probably Portugal's oldest European ally - still hanker for old colonial and Atlantic ties, the Portuguese have turned their heads, if not yet all of their hearts, to Europe. It is important, this, because it makes Portugal predictable. As a member of the European Community, though, Portugal has had to let itself be counted with the laggards, not the leaders. It is one of the 'southern' lot (including Italy) which forever seem to be asking their richer northern partners for more money or more time to do hard things. Its almost seven years of EC membership have brought about wrenching changes to the way the country works. Today three-quarters of the country'sexports go to Europe, more than double the proportion of a decade ago. But there are perhaps more important though less obvious ways to measure the effects of EC accession. In the first half of this year the country assumed the presidency of the Community, a task which demanded a huge modernising effort of its cobwebbed public administration. Civil war in the former Yugoslavia and the ECs efforts to mediate in it propelled the country and its urbane foreign minister, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, into the centre of the kind of European dilemma that Portugal had time and again turned its back on. Even now, as the European Community's leaders struggle to find ways to calm growing internal scepticism about the way the EC's institutions function, Portugal is busily discovering completely new foreign policy postures for itself. At issue are accusations across the Community that the European Commission is reaching well beyond its powers to control minute aspects of life in member countries. In Britain, Germany and Denmark, governments are trying to find ways to convince voters that this is not so and that the principle of 'subsidiarity' makes control from Brussels impossible. 'I loathe the word 'subsidiarity',' says Mr Deus Pinheiro. 'Let's talk about 'proximity' or 'openness'.' The concept, which the Portuguese enthusiastically support, means that EC institutions should not try to govern aspects of life in member countries which are best left to national governments. Arcane, perhaps, but for Portugal an ideal issue upon which to take sides and, perhaps, make new friends. The subsidiarity debate does three things for Lisbon. There is little opposition to EC membership in Portugal, and the issue is a useful tool for the government to use to insist on a more transparent EC without appearing to have been put under pressure into doing so. Also, it marks a clear separation from its closest neighbour, Spain, which fears that subsidiarity, if applied too deeply, could for ce it to c e d e powers to powerful regional governments in Catalonia and the Basque Country. And it ranges Portugal alongside the virtuous and the mighty, especially Germany. 'We are one of the oldest countries in Europe and we don't want to lose our national identity,' says the foreign minister. 'We have fought hard for it.' It is clear that the hard lessons of European unity that now reverberate in the UK are being quickly taken on board in Lisbon. There may not be much EC opposition now but should the economy slow even faster than it has this year and generate ill-feeling, the government wants to be ready for it. So much so that Mr Deus Pinheiro happily discusses holding referenda on European issues in the next few years. The point, though, would be to avoid the French and Danish traps and make the questions very specific. 'I would not be surprised if we had some referenda,' he says, looking to 1995 and 1996. 'I think people should be asked if they are prepared to have a common European defence policy, for instance.' There is symmetry here. Just as foreign policy determined the fate of the Salazar dictatorship - his colonial wars in Africa were the old regime's undoing at home - Portugal's actions in Europe are moulding life at home now. If the old colonies, particularly in Africa, still matter, they do so not so much as influence lost but, for thousands of Portuguese, as beloved homes hurriedly left. While both Angola and Mozambique work their way unsteadily towards ending their civil wars, many people in Portugal wonder whether they might not be able to pick up the strands of their younger lives there. Given that unemployment in Portugal is set to increase as it struggles to become more competitive, the emergence of potentially rich Portuguese speaking nations in Africa must be a tantalising prospect for threatened workers and a worried government. Lisbon has been hard at work for years preparing a mini Marshall plan, funded with its new European partners, to help consolidate peace in Angola. Some Es80bn is already in place to help resettle guerrilla fighters. But can Portugal have it both ways? 'We want to be a good friend and an honest broker' in Angola and Mozambique, says Mr Deus Pinheiro. 'Africa is a natural extension of the culture of Europe.' Perhaps only a Portuguese or French foreign minister could still say something like that with a straight face.</p>

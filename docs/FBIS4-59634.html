			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hanadi Saqf-al-Sayl] </F>   [Text] Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the Hamas  Movement in Jordan, has said the movement supports legislative  elections, through which the Palestinian people would freely  elect their leadership and representatives. In an exclusive  interview with AKHIR KHABAR, Nazzal said Hamas reiterated its  rejection of self-rule and the agreement which paved the road  for it. He said: This stand does not contradict the movement's  stand welcoming the return of the Palestinian police. He said:  We consider the police to be part of our Palestinian people and  call on them to safeguard the unity of the people, not to crush  them or confiscate their freedom. He said: We will not clash  with them.    Nazzal denied reports that Hamas has asked the PLO to  mediate  with Israeli authorities to release Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. He said  this issue cannot be used as bargaining card to pressure the  movement, saying Shaykh Yasin himself rejects this. He said:  No contacts to this effect have been made with the PLO.    Muhammad Nazzal reiterated Hamas' rejection of recent  developments, noting that the refusal of national figures  respected by Palestinians to participate in the national  authority shows the recent agreement has blatantly bypassed the  rights of the Palestinian people.</p>

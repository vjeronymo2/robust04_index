			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Period of low inflation forecast Britain is entering a new period of low - or even zero - inflation, Midland Global Markets said yesterday. The bank says the broader structural changes occurring in the industrialised world have created greater market flexibility and fewer inflationary pressures. October's retail prices index, published today, is expected to show monthly inflation remaining relatively subdued at about 0.3 per cent.</p>

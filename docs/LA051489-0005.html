			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Thanks to Channel 9, we are now able to see "Crazy Like a Fox" on Sunday  evenings. Thousands of other viewers like us protested to the programmers at  CBS when this delightful family program was taken off the air two years ago.  Thanks again to Channel 9 for making Sunday evening more enjoyable.  </P> <P> Charles and Inez Scott, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Sailing: Old money in Newport - The New York Yacht Club is 150 Newport 100 years ago was New York-by-the-sea. When hot, humid summer came, the affluent closed up the brownstone houses on Fifth or Madison and came to Rhode Island. Nothing much has changed, least of all the family names. This week the New York Yacht Club has been celebrating its 150th birthday (being the NYYC, of course, it has to be the tongue-knotting Sesquicentennial Regatta). When the result lists go up, a du Pont can be found next to a Doubleday. As the yachts headed out into Naragansett Sound all the chatter and pointing was towards the yellow-painted house on the headland. As a dynastic town Newport loves nothing better than a will, and Jackie Kennedy's had just been published. Hammersmith Farm, the seaside retreat where the young Jacqueline Bouvier spent her childhood riding ponies and sailing, came to symbolise the Kennedy presence in Newport. After her marriage to John F Kennedy at St Mary's Church, the wedding party was held at this glorious pale yellow mansion overlooking the Atlantic. Once JFK became president, the house became the summer White House for the first family. Of course, it is no more a farm than Blenheim is a country rectory. That is another quaint Newport custom. The Italianate palaces out on Ocean Drive, built at the turn of the century for families such as Vanderbilt or Astor, are invariably known as 'cottages'. When probate was granted and 'the farm' was left to step-brother Hugh Auchinloss, le tout Newport heaved a discreet collective sigh. The two Kennedy children had been bequeathed the other waterfont property on Martha's Vineyard 50 miles away. That should keep the paparazzi out of town for another generation. As the sporting home of the fabled America's Cup for 100 years or so, one might have supposed that Newport and the club might have grown used to the media. After all, Harold Vanderbilt, racing Sir Thomas Lipton for the oldest trophy in international competition, was hardly low-profile, even in the 1930s. Then, as now, the NYYC simply adopted a marvellous disdain. Journalists wanting to cover this week's splendid and historic regatta were told that it was private, 'by invitation only'. Race results, numerical tables of times and handicaps with as much flavour as packet soup, would be available from a subfusc office in a shopping mall. Perhaps they should not have been so discreet. When the club let its hair down, the scenes were wondrous to behold. The steep sloping lawns in front of Harbour Court, the waterfront mansion it calls home, became impromptu grass slides for younger crew and, after cocktails, their parents. Many yachting enthusiasts from around the world were sharing the magic of Newport for the first time. The NYYC had invited sailors from clubs such as the Royal Yacht Squadron and Royal Thames Yacht Club to come and race with them. 'We've been almost a year building up to this and I think its bloody marvellous,' said Mike Slade, a London property man and owner of Longobarda, one of the world's top maxi yachts. If that sounds a lot of preparation for a week's sailing, consider that the 80ft Longobarda sails with a crew of 24, a mixture of family, friends and professional racers. In her wake follows a baggage train of spare sails, ropes, and even carbon fibre to repair the hull should it prove necessary. Surely Slade, who heads Helical Bar, fits into the classic definition of yacht-racing as tearing up Pounds 20 notes under a shower. Slade bristles, in his amiable way. 'This, believe it or not, is a business. She's available for major regattas at Dollars 50,000 a week and we'll do two, maybe three, charters this year,' he said. 'It should cover the running costs.' Next week Longobarda sails for Australia and a customer who wants to race the Sydney-Hobart classic in December. Bill Koch, the US amateur sailor who won the America's Cup two years ago after an expenditure of treasure that startled even the battle-hardened, is in Newport with two yachts and a cast of thousands. Next spring Koch defends the America's Cup with an all-woman crew, a radical move that has shaken the NYYC, who cannot quite make up their minds even about lady members. Thirty-four athletic women, ranging from top dinghy helms to Olympic rowers, are racing Koch's crack maxi Matador2. He had her brought out of storage in Antibes especially. Koch himself, an engagingly diffident, self-deprecating individual and one of the richest men in America, has brought a classic 12-metre, Kiwi Magic, over from New Zealand solely for the week. At the two rented crew houses a marquee has had to be erected to host dinner for the crews, coaches, and hangers-on. 'We won't spend anything like we did in the last Cup,' said Koch, patting what he likes to call his Dollars 68m belt buckle. The logoed clip on his belt is from the 1992 America3 campaign: Dollars 68m was the net cost, after deducting sponsorship.</p>

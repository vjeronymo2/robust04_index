			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Heseltine wants Channel 5 decision delayed Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has written to the Department of National Heritage calling for a delay in the decision on Channel 5's approval. Mr Heseltine, it is believed, has argued that the decision should be postponed until a government review of cross-media ownership rules has been completed. This is unlikely before the summer. Supporters of a fifth television channel, which would use existing analogue technology, fear that the DTI wants to kill the idea of the channel and reserve all the available frequencies for the development of digital television services. However, it was Lord Young, a predecessor of Mr Heseltine at the DTI, who championed the idea of the channel to increase competition in the television advertising market. Last month the Independent Television Commission came out in favour of re-advertising the franchise for the channel, which could reach three-quarters of the UK population provided the government guaranteed that the necessary frequencies would be available. A number of large media groups are interested in the channel including NBC, the US network company; CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster; and a consortium which groups Time Warner of the US, MAI, the company that controls Meridian, the ITV broadcaster for the south of England, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Later this week Mr Gary Tonge, controller of engineering at the ITC, will argue that there is no real conflict between launching a conventional Channel 5 and developing digital services over normal land-based transmitters as opposed to satellite or cable networks. Mr Tonge and the ITC will point out that the existence of Channel 5 would have a minimal effect on digital television. Support for a conventional Channel 5 ranges from advertising organisations to independent producers. Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, is among those who support the channel. It would, he believes, help to develop a secondary market for programme makers in the UK. The heritage department says it will decide in the next two or three months. Last week Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, suggested broadcasting policy was now being made in the trade and industry department rather than in the Department of National Heritage. 'The poor old DNH is being dragged along behind like Winnie the Pooh, being bumped up the stairs on his head, in the wake of a resurgent Christopher Robin,' Mr Mellor wrote.</p>

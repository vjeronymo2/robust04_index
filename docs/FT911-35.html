			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Severn Trent to pay Pounds 212m for BET unit SEVERN TRENT, the water company, has agreed to pay Pounds 212m to win Biffa, one of the UK's leading waste disposal concerns, from BET, the debt-laden business services group. The deal means Severn Trent will finally gain a significant presence in waste management. Last year, Severn Trent decided not to proceed with an earlier attempt to do so by taking over Caird, a listed company. BET put Biffa up for sale three months ago, as part of a review of its funding capabilities and management structure. Analysts yesterday expected the company's net debt to fall to about Pounds 250m after completion of the sale, which produced proceeds at the top end of market expectations. Mr John Bellak, Severn Trent's chairman, said: 'We are delighted to have been able to buy such a good business at a fair price.' Mr Nicholas Wills, BET's chairman, said a range of potential acquirers and joint venture partners had shown interest. Severn Trent's shares closed 3p down at 277p and BET's were 2p lower at 178p yesterday. Biffa, one of the largest presences in the UK waste management business, made profits before interest of Pounds 17.8m on sales of Pounds 102.3m in the year to the end of March. No debt is being taken on with Biffa. Mr Bellak said Severn Trent would be funding it through borrowings incurred by its public limited company. The deal intensified speculation about the fate of the 29.9 per cent stake in Caird with which Severn Trent was left after it dropped its bid last October, when Caird cut its profit forecast. Mr Bellak insisted yesterday that all options remained open. Caird's shares closed unchanged at 75p. Mr Bellak said that, once Biffa was aligned with the company's existing business, waste would account for about 15 per cent of total group turnover. For BET, the sale comes at the end of a turbulent spring which saw a bear raid on its shares early in February. A new chief executive, Mr John Clark, took over last month from Mr Wills. BET has said that it wanted to dispose of Biffa because of the risks arising from its exposure to environmental legislation. Mr Martin Bettington stays on as managing director of Biffa, which is best known for its UK collection and landfill activities. Using experience acquired in their core water business as a basis for assuming a wider role in waste management has been a priority for most of the 10 water companies since they were privatised in November 1989. Severn Trent's is the biggest step taken in the sector to date. In February, Wessex Water announced a Pounds 125m joint venture with Waste Management of the US, one of the world's biggest treatment and disposal groups. Lex, Page 20</p>

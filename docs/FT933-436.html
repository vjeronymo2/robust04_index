			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Recruitment: The truly hard school of reality - No excuse for teachers of management to plead there are only some aspects of it they can teach SINCE you readers clearly like to know what's really going on, the Jobs column naturally leapt to take up the invitation. It was to the World Reality Seminar in Spain. Even though the mail failed to bring the promised detailed programme, the event's title gave me high hopes of being able to wise you up on my return. In particular, the title seemed very relevant to my sermon last week about the unhealthy practice of referring to workers as 'players', so glossing over the important difference between people's real-world efforts to make a living, and their indulgence in mere pastimes such as games. Alas, I at first felt disappointed on reaching the event at Madrid's international management school, the Instituto de Empresa. For when it comes to distinguishing games-playing from essential bread-earning, academic studies strike me as being largely on the sporting side of the divide. And the World Reality Seminar turned out to be a part of the most academic of the IE school's courses, for younger people studying full-time for a Master of Business Administration. But the disappointment soon disappeared when meetings with half a dozen of IE's teaching staff showed that, besides sharing my view of the games-like nature of many academic studies, they feel it conflicts with the object of equipping each student to be a good manager in real life. They nevertheless claimed that the conflict was less of their own making than imposed on them by the fee-dependent IE's need to earn its real-world keep. After all, when people are choosing which management school to attend, they are not concerned solely with what they are likely to learn there. They also want their choice to have a name that adds prestige to their curriculum vitae. That is especially important to ambitious youngsters, not long out of their first university course, who now often aim to pursue their career worldwide. Their hopes are improved if they have a 'passport' recognised by recruiters outside their home country, and in the opinion of international employers the best passport is an accredited MBA degree. And the only criterion on which an esteemed university will award such a degree is good performance in the intellectual games presided over by the scholarly authorities. In sum, the issue of passports is controlled by the academic play-makers, and for as long as employers pay high regard to the paper, it will have a real-world value of its own. Hence no matter how much a management school's staff may want to cut out games-playing and focus on realities, they dare not do so. IE's response is evidently to keep the playing to an expedient minimum. There are very few pure theorists in the faculty, I was told, and relatively little value is given to theoretical research in the judgment of staff-members' worth. Much greater weight is put on effectiveness at teaching, the prime gauge being assessments made by students. 'We fire some professors most years,' said academic dean Tomas Garicano. 'Teachers whose students don't learn are a luxury we cannot afford.' The school also relies heavily on exercises such as the reality seminar, which concentrates on marketing and is made up of presentations by people working in the field. Moreover, although that particular event goes on for four whole weeks, it is far from the only occasion on which IE brings in practising managers to tell how they do their jobs. Since the aim of importing them is to anchor scholarship to actuality, if what they say conflicts with the theory, so much the better. If that seems to be no more than a common-sense approach to the topic of management, all I can say is that it contrasts markedly with some approaches adopted elsewhere, and not only in academic institutions. Witness the first of a new series of columns about management just launched by Britain's Sunday newspaper, The Observer. Seeing the launching as a noteworthy event for the topic, I was perplexed by a statement early in the first article, reading: '. . . although everyone admits the legitimacy of economics (even in its most far-fetched assumptions), management - the art of orchestrating human effort for a common goal - rarely gets such benefit of the doubt. Management is the invisible discipline.' Now what took me aback was not just the bit about economics, although it furrowed my brow more than somewhat. After all, it isn't true that 'everyone admits the legitimacy of economics', because some people clearly take quite the opposite stance. Moreover, besides myself, they include even highly esteemed academics such as the US psychologist Amos Tversky who has closely studied how people make actual buying decisions, and found that the way they really make them differs radically from the way in which they are assumed to do so by economists. But the part of the Observer's statement most likely to perplex real-life managers even if they believe in economics, is the sentence: 'Management is the invisible discipline.' For the fact is that few if any disciplines are more visible than the sort actual managers work under, at least if they operate at the sharp end of business. So readers who toil in that type of vineyard might well be wondering what anyone could mean by calling management 'the invisible discipline'. If so, the only suggestion I can offer is that the quotation's last word is used in the specific sense of an academic discipline - the system of rules made and policed by the leading players of the particular intellectual game in question. An example of such a discipline which is visible, of course, is economics - which would seem to raise the question whether management can wisely be treated as no different from economics even if only so far as the study of it is concerned. To the Jobs column's mind at any rate, the answer is no. True, the work of managing entails intellectual operations, which can be particularly helpful in the advance planning of what should be done. But according to most of the managers I've talked to, reaching planning decisions of that kind is a doddle compared with the task of getting the decisions implemented in some way that usefully resembles what the planners intended. And success in implementation clearly hinges on human faculties that academia has so far been unable to explain, let alone to teach. Even the unusually practical IE staff doubted that they could go beyond teaching would-be managers to carry out rigorous analysis and then take the initial action in line with the results. 'But how to carry things through to a successful conclusion must largely be left to be learned by experience,' said one. 'The best computer simulations can't cover anything like the complexity real implementation involves.' That, however, surely misses the main point. If implementation is the most decisive phase of management, then it is no excuse for outfits styling themselves schools of management to plead that implementation cannot be taught by their academically established methods. The onus is on them to find out how to teach it, and change their methods accordingly - if, that is, they expect the outside world to go on funding the cost of their keep.</p>

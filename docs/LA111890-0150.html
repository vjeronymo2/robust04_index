			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEEDED: ALTERNATIVE TO PROTECT THE RIDGELINES IN LAGUNA NIGUEL  </P> <P> More than 4,000 registered voters of Laguna Niguel have expressed their desire  to see our remaining ridgelines protected from further development.  </P> <P> In its haste to 1) enlighten those of us who signed the ridgeline initiative 2)  divert attention to the union in Vegas that apparently contributed to the  initiative 3) protect their own interests and 4) demean the backers of the  initiatives, the City Council has utterly failed to keep the original intent in  mind: Our community wants its ridgelines protected!  </P> <P> So the initiative wasn't worded well. We see that now. So a lot of innocent  people would be gravely affected by the initiative. We now understand that,  thank you. So the initiative could wind up potentially bankrupting our new  city. We can't have that now, can we? These are all consequences we don't want  to see come to pass.  </P> <P> But what hasn't been addressed is an alternative to the ridgeline initiative  that is strong, yet fair. Why hasn't the council made any efforts toward that  end? And if they have, why not present it? The council's name-calling,  back-stabbing and threatened lawsuits are unproductive and don't really address  Laguna Niguel's concerns for the remaining ridgelines.  </P> <P> I think that a fair yet substantive alternative ordinance proposal, with some  involvement from those involved with the initiative and the community as a  whole, would go a long way toward easing property owners' concerns. It would  also go a long way toward giving those of us against ridgeline development a  reason to feel as though our council has heard us.  </P> <P> Wasn't ridgeline development one of the biggest concerns during the cityhood  drive? That was one long year ago! The council mustn't continue to stall while  leaving the door open for developers to finalize more devastating developments.  Give us what we have all dreamed of for years: local control and sensible  protection of our remaining ridgelines.  </P> <P> THOM TAYLOR  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

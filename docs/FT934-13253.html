			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Unit trusts The humble unit trust has long been due an overhaul. The complex system of bid and offer pricing does not encourage public understanding and is a fundamental barrier to export. Rigid rules covering fee structures and investment strategy have put a block on innovation, notwithstanding the introduction of futures and options funds in 1991. Unsurprisingly, London has been losing out to easy-going financial centres such as Dublin and Luxembourg. The Securities and Investments Board deserves credit for trying to hurry the process of change. The problem is that many of SIB's proposals carry a cost for unit trust managers. Single pricing would make it more difficult for them to make profits by holding units on their own account ready for resale. Charging investors when money is taken out of trusts  - rather than front-end charging as the current rules demand  - would squeeze managers' cash flow as business expands. Big managers usually cover their costs from annual fees and could stand this strain. Neither are they reliant on own-account profits to make ends meet. Smaller managers might feel the pinch. The European Community directive on collective investments should encourage a sense of urgency. The introduction of continental style open-ended investment companies is not far off. These vehicles will surely have to carry a single price, making them saleable from Manchester to Madrid. Without reform the unit trust might look outmoded by comparison.</p>

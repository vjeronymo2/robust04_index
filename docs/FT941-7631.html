			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Envoy links peace to Mexico reform Mr Manuel Camacho, the presidential peace envoy in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas, has linked the resolution of the 54-day peasant uprising there to national democratic reforms, in an apparent switch in strategy. After publicly insisting that negotiations with the Zapatista rebels must focus on economic and social problems in Chiapas, Mr Camacho seemed to join with the rebels after the second day of talks in criticising Mexico's political system. He agreed that democracy must play a part in a solution to the uprising. 'Many of us want changes in the country. We want more democracy, more freedoms and advances in justice,' he said 'The solution is a new treatment for all indigenous communities in the country and a commitment to democracy.' Mr Camacho, known for his negotiating skills, may have changed his tone to gain the trust and confidence of the Zapatistas before seeking concessions from them. But he could be acting on behalf of President Carlos Salinas, who in the past has used Mr Camacho to prepare the public for democratic changes. However, Mr Camacho is known to believe privately that electoral reform is an essential condition for an agreement with the Zapatistas. Discussions between the government and the opposition parties on democratic reforms have recently stalled, and Mr Camacho may have been trying to press on the governing party the importance of making the necessary political concessions if it wants to solve the conflict in Chiapas.</p>

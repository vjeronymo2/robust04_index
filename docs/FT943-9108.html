			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Crime bill defeat will test durability of 'comeback kid': President Bill Clinton must regroup quickly to minimise fallout after the devastating House vote President Bill Clinton promised to 'fight and fight and fight until we win this battle for the American people' as the White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress tried to regroup yesterday after their devastating defeat in the House of Representatives on the crime bill. But the vote dealt an immediate knock-on blow to Mr Clinton's most cherished objective of healthcare reform, when House leaders decided at a late-night meeting to delay debate on the health bill - possibly into September. Cabinet secretaries scattered after an emergency meeting yesterday morning for a lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill, while Mr Clinton himself flew to Minneapolis - accompanied by Republican and Democratic mayors - to rally support at a meeting of the National Association of Police Organisations. 'We are going out now - the cabinet, mayors of both parties, citizens of both parties all across this country - to say that this crime bill cannot die,' Mr Clinton said as he boarded the presidential Boeing 747 on his way to Minneapolis. Congressional leaders scrambled to negotiate changes to the crime bill, which includes measures such as gun control, more police and the 'three strikes and out' rule imposing mandatory life sentences on repeat offenders. The bill was blocked on Thursday evening as the Republican leadership and the gun lobby linked to defeat by 225 votes to 210 a procedural motion for debate to begin. But Mr Thomas Foley, Speaker of the House, predicted it would be brought back to the floor and win passage next week. Nevertheless, Thursday's surprising setback - despite furious lobbying from the president - has already started to ripple wider. Unless the White House can win back the initiative on both crime and healthcare in the next few weeks, Mr Clinton's entire presidency could become bogged down. If he cannot win in this Congress he is less likely to do so after November's congressional elections, when the Democrats seem certain to lose seats and could even lose their majorities in one or other chamber. 'We're at a turning point both in the administration and in the country,' said Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary and an old friend of the president. No one expects a healthcare reform bill to pass by more than a handful of votes, but members will be less inclined to stick their necks out on a difficult vote for the president after his defeat on crime. Until now Mr Clinton and his allies could always say he had pulled off crucial votes such as his budget last year, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now, however, the label of loser will be harder to shed. Abroad, Mr Clinton has still not extricated himself from the complications of Haiti, Bosnia, Cuba and Rwanda. Any of these could blow up in the weeks ahead. Nor does the vote bode well for the promise of a more disciplined and focused White House under the new chief of staff, Mr Leon Panetta, whose long experience as a member of Congress was expected to help the administration on Capitol Hill. Congress already faces a crowded agenda before it goes home for November's elections, in which the entire House and one third of the Senate must face the voters. Other bills are now likely to be simply pushed off the calendar, while even crime and health legislation could simply run out of time. This is scarcely auspicious for Democratic members of Congress, many of whom are already seeking to distance themselves from Mr Clinton. Now they will have no crime bill to wave in front of their constituents, and they must face the charge that, despite a majority in both houses of Congress, they are unable to deliver. The vote is not without peril for the Republicans, however, some of whom are nervous at the prospect of returning to their districts to face criticism for having blocked the anti-crime legislation. At the same time, Republicans risk being viewed as obstructionists and agents of gridlock. Mr Reich said yesterday that Mr Clinton was 'as usual, resilient', while Ms Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, said the entire cabinet was 'riled up and enthusiastic'. Nevertheless, rebounding from this defeat will be hard, even though Mr Clinton loves to call himself 'the comeback kid'.</p>

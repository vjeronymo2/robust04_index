			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: BO'S HOMER DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP  </P> <P> Bo Jackson hit a tape-measure home run off Nolan Ryan in Arlington, Tex.,  Tuesday night, but he has a lot of distance to cover before he catches up with  Mickey Mantle, according to the man who virtually invented the term  "tape-measure homer."  </P> <P> Arthur E. (Red) Patterson was the New York Yankees' publicity man in 1953, when  Mantle hit what many still believe to be baseball's longest home run.  </P> <P> Patterson went outside Griffith Stadium that night, April 17, 1953, stepped off  the distance of a majestic Mantle home run and came up with a figure of 565  feet.  </P> <P> When he worked for the Yankees, Patterson said he saw Mantle hit "about a  dozen" home runs in the 450- to 500-foot class. But the Washington blast, he  says, outdistanced them all.  </P> <P> Add Mantle: The homer seems to get a little longer every time Patterson tells  the story. When contacted Wednesday, Patterson, now 80, described it again.  </P> <P> Mantle, batting right-handed against left-hander Chuck Stobbs, hit a drive that  was helped by a wind.  </P> <P> "The ball not only cleared the left-field bleachers, but went out of the park  about halfway up the scoreboard, which was on top of the bleachers," recalled  Patterson, now a special consultant for the Angels.  </P> <P> "It was still going up when it went out.  </P> <P> "I found a kid with the ball, and he told me the ball came down 'In a lady's  back yard.' He showed me the spot and I stepped it off -- I never really used a  tape measure -- to the outfield fence. Then I added the home-to-fence distance  inside the park.  </P> <P> "I gave the kid $10 for the ball, got Mantle's bat, and convinced the Yankees  to put them on display in the Yankee Stadium lobby.  </P> <P> "We did, and someone stole them.  </P> <P> "Our radio announcer, Mel Allen, made pleas every day for them to be returned,  that no questions would be asked. Some kid returned them. He told us he took  them.  </P> <P> "The (New York) writers accused me of fabricating the whole thing, but it's a  true story. The bat and ball are in the Hall of Fame today."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Jackson's homer traveled 461 feet, according to the IBM tape  measure chip in Arlington Stadium's scoreboard. According to Kansas City  writers, it was Jackson's second-longest homer. He hit a 475-footer in 1986.  </P> <P> For Added Measure: Only one player, Willie Stargell, ever hit a fair ball out  of Dodger Stadium, and he did it twice. The first was a 506-foot 6-inch blast  off Alan Foster in 1969; the second a 470-footer off Andy Messersmith in 1973.  </P> <P> Stargell's 1969 homer cleared the outfield pavilion roof on the fly. The 1973  shot hit the roof, then bounced out of the stadium.  </P> <P> Only four players, according to the Dodgers, ever reached the loge level  (second level) with home runs: Frank Howard, Dave Kingman (twice), Dave Parker  and Nick Esasky.  </P> <P> For Short Measure: There can be no discussion of tape-measure homers without  mention of Frank Howard's rocket launched at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in  1960. Someone stepped that one off at 565 feet, too.  </P> <P> For decades, Babe Ruth was credited for a spring training homer in Tampa, Fla.,  that traveled anywhere from 560 to 656 feet, depending on who was telling the  story.  </P> <P> Another epic Mantle home run occurred at Yankee Stadium in 1963. Batting  left-handed against Kansas City's Bill Fischer, Mantle hit a ball that struck  the upper-deck facade, 18 inches below the roof. It was one of two homers  Mantle hit off the facade.  </P> <P> There is no record of anyone hitting a fair ball out of Yankee Stadium, but  there are stories of Josh Gibson accomplishing the feat in a Negro League game.  </P> <P> For Final Measure: Steve Gietschier, archivist at the Sporting News, says he's  never seen a list of baseball's longest homers.  </P> <P> "We have a thick file labeled 'tape-measure homers,' but it's just old  clippings," he said. "From looking at it, I'd say every well-known home run  hitter in the game has hit at least one."  </P> <P> Dept. of Brains and Spikes: One of the entries in the women's mile at the Aug.  6 Jack-in-the-Box Invitational track meet at UCLA is Kathy Kanes, who recently  received her doctorate in chemistry at Caltech.  </P> <P> Wait a minute. Caltech?  </P> <P> "She's probably on the top-50 list of U.S. women milers," meet director Al  Franken said. "She's never going to beat Mary Slaney. But then, Mary Slaney  never explained room temperature fusion to me, either."  </P> <P> Quotebook: "I enjoy physical contact," said Dennis Byrd, 270-pound defensive  lineman from Tulsa and a New York Jet draft pick. "I really like to hit. This  is the only sport except boxing where you can abuse someone and not go to jail  for it."  </P></p>

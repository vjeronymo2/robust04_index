			<p>BFN     [Text] In the absence of a major government or  parliamentary initiative, the "Europe begins at Sarajevo" list  will be submitted to the Interior Ministry on Friday. Leon  Schwarzenberg, its leader, confirmed that yesterday. However,  some of the intellectuals who support this list are wondering  about the need to maintain it after Michel Rocard's statements.  For instance, Bernard-Henri Levy thinks that in advocating the  lifting of the embargo on arms supplies, the PSF [French  Socialist Party] first secretary has "committed his list."  Laurent Fabius, his predecessor as head of the PSF, expressed  his agreement with Mr. Rocard's position, explaining that he had  "taken a position on this basis" since August 1992.    On the other hand, Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of  the  PR [Republican Party], thinks that Dominique Baudis, leader of  the UDF-RPR [Union for French Democracy-Rally for the Republic]  list, "demonstrated a calm attitude" by refusing to give way to  "a media event" in favor of lifting the embargo on arms supplies  to Bosnia. Pierre Lellouche, RPR deputy for Val-d'Oise and  Jacques Chirac's diplomatic adviser, also spoke out against  lifting the embargo, adding that Bernard-Henri Levy "is not  Malraux." Jacques Barrot, centrist vice president of the UDF  group in the National Assembly, said that "giving way to emotion  and trying to lift the embargo on arms sales to Bosnia would  amount to making a threefold mistake," namely burying the hope  of peace, creating a terrible spiral, and making an admission of  weakness. Finally, PCF [French Communist Party] National  Secretary Robert Hue also stated his opposition to the lifting  of the embargo.</p>

The reason is that during last four months Racha,  the relatively well-being settlement, transmuted into the center  of drug business and drug addiction. He said to SNARK that the  drugs are trafficked in Georgia from Georgia.    According to Makhadiany the only way to stop this evil is to  block the border, that passed through Oni city. The police  doesn't control the situation, and even more, the authorities of  the region are involved in the drug business.</p>

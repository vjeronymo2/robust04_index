			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Brussels pleased with Bull rescue proposals Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, yesterday gave a positive response to outlines of a restructuring and privatisation plan for Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group. He had a series of meetings with Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull chairman, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. Mr Van Miert said that he had been impressed by Mr Descarpentries' ideas and commitments. During the meetings the French government agreed to freeze a tranche of FFr2.5bn (Dollars 424m) of state aid for Groupe Bull pending the European Commission's decision on the group's recapitalisation. This is the final tranche of a FFr7bn capital increase announced last year by the government. Mr Van Miert is due to receive a final version of Bull's plan within the next few days. He said a decision on the plan could be reached by the summer, and would not take more than six months. Brussels' decision is regarded as crucial to the recovery of the group, which has lost more than FFr15bn over the past four years. The French government has said the capital injection was a necessary final payment to allow the group to be privatised. Mr Descarpentries aims to reduce the state's 76 per cent shareholding in Bull to below 50 per cent this year. He plans to achieve this through an increase in employee shareholdings and the participation of industrial partners in the company's capital. NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull, is seen as a potential candidate for a larger stake in the group. According to the plan, productivity is to be increased through a separate profit centre and tighter reporting procedures. Non-salary costs are to be reduced through a sale of most of the company's Paris sites.</p>

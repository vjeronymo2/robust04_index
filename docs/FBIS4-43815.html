			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Lothar Ruehl: "A Measure of Strength"] </F>   [Text] Basically, NATO has reached agreement with the  Russian Government concerning the conditions and limits of  security-linked and political cooperation within the framework  of Partnership for Peace [PFP]. Therefore there is a likelihood  of more stable relations between the two countries. However,  the problem of each country's different attitude toward other  East European countries has not been resolved.    Nevertheless, despite the differences in view, a consensus  has been reached on Russian Defense Minister Grachev's demands  concerning the extent of NATO and its role vis-a-vis the CSCE,  these demands having been rejected by the allies. According to  this consensus, NATO will not accept any new countries that  share a border with Russia. The emergence of a new dividing  line through East Europe is to be avoided by means of the PFP,  but no one knows how.    The most important issue in this sphere, i.e. the extent of  the alliance east of Germany, remains open. Signing a  partnership agreement with Russia in Brussels does not yet  justify any special privileges for Russia vis-a-vis NATO, as  President Yeltsin would like. The prospect of NATO admission by  the four East and Central European countries was brought  somewhat closer by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at  the NATO foreign ministers conference in Istanbul at the  beginning of June. But this question, too, remains open.    Moscow still expects an Atlantic-European gesture of  recognition for its great power status for the benefit of  European security, with this recognition assuming a concrete,  binding form. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has merely  agreed to NATO assurances to seek a broader basis for a  relationship with Russia. German Foreign Minister Kinkel has  been saying cautiously in public that the "discord" between  Moscow and NATO on this issue was "reduced" in Istanbul, which  means that this discord still exists. A special protective and  order-creating function by Russia within CIS has also not been  recognized by NATO. NATO and the remaining East European  countries have forced their wishes upon Moscow on the subject of  all these controversial issues.    On the other hand, Kozyrev won a major concession in  Istanbul  on the central issue of an eastward expansion of NATO.  According to this concession, NATO is to postpone any decision  concerning the acceptance of new member countries. A clause  describing the significance of such NATO partnerships for the  future admission of individual countries to NATO was deleted  from the draft communique at Istanbul. The effect of this is  that the admission of new countries to NATO is more doubtful  than the efforts of aspiring East European countries would have  us believe.    The framework of strategic cooperation for a broader Russian  relationship with NATO, which is what Kozyrev wants, basically  conforms to the "strategic partnership" concept presented by  U.S. President Clinton and NATO Secretary General Woerner in  Moscow early in the year. Kozyrev's remark that this  cooperation would take place without mutual vetoes and  reservations indicates a deep-lying compromise formula -- no  prerogatives on either side.    U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has described this  compromise in the following terms: "This is the most creative  strategic innovation since NATO's inception." However, he made  it plain that "neither new demarcation lines nor new spheres of  interests" may emerge in Europe. No country may claim for  itself a role that is not compatible with international norms,  according to Christopher. And: European stability is  conditional on a respect by all countries of the independence  and territorial integrity of the countries of the former Soviet  Union.    The indication of a rejection of the Russian demands  repeatedly expressed by Yeltsin and Kozyrev since 1993, and  therefore of the Russian doctrine whereby Russia bears special  responsibility toward the "near abroad," i.e. the countries of  the former USSR, could not be clearer in diplomatic terms. But  the failure to resolve the problem of a hierarchy of interests  between the United States, NATO, and the remaining partners has  been made equally clear in Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski's  warning of a "marginalization of smaller countries in the  region." The various interests must first be brought down to a  common denominator if a new European balance is to be created.    This is also the reason that there is going to be great  interest in Russian relationships with the G-7 countries at the  world economic meeting whose political part will be attended by  Russian President Yeltsin in Naples this year. That is also the  main reason for Yeltsin's rapid agreement to the Istanbul  compromise formula. After the establishment of a possible "G-7  plus one," everything else would follow smoothly.</p>

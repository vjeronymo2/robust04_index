			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Britain and US are bright spots in bleak global economy Britain and the US are among the few bright spots in a bleak global economy, according to the latest quarterly worldwide survey of business optimism from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group. The survey of 11,000 executives in 16 countries recorded a sharp increase in sales and profits expectations for the first quarter of this year among managers in Britain, while hopes in the US were steady at a relatively high level. However, in Europe as a whole first quarter sales expectations fell to their lowest level since D&amp;B began polling in 1988. The Japanese survey was the gloomiest since 1990.</p>

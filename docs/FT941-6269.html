			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Crossroads Oil returns to black with Pounds 156,000 Crossroads Oil Group, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration company, swung back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 156,000 for the six months to end-December. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 298,000 last time and came from turnover - boosted by a Pounds 536,000 contribution from the Crossroads-Melrose joint venture - up from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 645,000. There was a nil tax charge for both periods and earnings per share came out at 0.286p (0.694p losses). The company also announced that shareholders at yesterday's EGM had voted unanimously in favour of a capital reconstruction to offset the deficit on the profit and loss account. Subject to completion of the reconstruction and sustained profitability, the board intends to declare a dividend in 1994.</p>

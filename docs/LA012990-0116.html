			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FANS HEAVILY BLUE OVER BLUE, ORANGE BRONCOS  </P> <P> Fans who saw their Super Bowl dreams dashed a fourth time took the loss hard,  although a few attempted to keep their perspective.  </P> <P> At the Mammoth Events Center in Denver, a radio station's Broncos celebration  ended up being a wake Sunday evening as San Francisco's rout of Denver  unfolded.  </P> <P> "It's awful," said Milton Dicker, 36, of Denver.  </P> <P> "It stinks," said Viveca Natulund, 19, of Golden.  </P> <P> "It's embarrassing," said Angel Portee, 16, of Denver.  </P> <P> Joe Deltoro, 39, of Denver, was more conciliatory. "There's nothing wrong with  being No. 2," he said.  </P> <P> Among the orange-and-blue faithful were sprinkled a few 49ers fans, and they  showed compassion for the Broncos.  </P> <P> "During the regular season, I root for the Broncos, but when it comes to Super  Bowl, the 49ers are my team," said Doug Spainhower. The Lakewood contractor's  red-and-gold 49ers jogging outfit and cap stood out in the sea of  blue-and-orange-clad Broncos fans at Jackson's Hole, a large sports bar owned  by former Bronco Ron Egloff.  </P> <P> "I think the Broncos will be in the Super Bowl next year and they'll probably  win," Spainhower said. "I don't feel sorry for the Broncos, but I feel sorry  for the fans."  </P> <P> "Obviously I'm very disappointed," said Egloff, as the crowd began to dwindle  at the end of the fourth quarter. "They had a slight chance, but the 49ers  played a great game. How do you stop a team like that?"  </P> <P> Jackson's Hole, in suburban Lakewood, was the scene of one of dozens of Super  Bowl parties. The standing-room-only crowd gathered around the pub's 33  television sets included out-of-town visitors.  </P> <P> "I was a New England Patriots fan, but I was converted," said Donald O'Connor,  27, of County Kerry, Ireland.  </P> <P> Hope began to fade for most Broncos fans by halftime, when Denver trailed 27-3,  but a few were confident of a second-half comeback. "The Broncos are a  second-half team," said Debbie DeThomas, 33, a Denver travel agent. They proved  not to be Sunday, however, as the 49ers out-scored them 28-7 in the second  half.  </P> <P> At the Denver County Jail, two fights erupted during the first quarter among  male inmates watching the game. The women prisoners traded gibes instead of  punches.  </P> <P> Harvey Milkman, a psychologist in private practice and a professor of  psychology at Metropolitan State College, said Denver has experience in seeing  its expectations dashed.  </P> <P> "The odyssey of the Broncos mirrors the plight of the Denver or Colorado  resident -- all dressed up and no place to go," said Milkman.  </P> <P> "It really parallels the expectations of a state that was built up and expected  to be on top of economic growth and development and has really fallen short in  that endeavor," he said. "We feel a sense of underdog, struggle, not being able  to actualize our dreams. That is really symbolized in what the Broncos have  been doing."  </P> <P> Broncos fans won't be able to welcome home their fallen heroes today.  </P> <P> Team officials asked that a planned rally at Stapleton International Airport be  canceled, said Brian Muir, a spokesman for the Denver Super Celebration '90.  "It was a team decision," Muir said.  </P></p>

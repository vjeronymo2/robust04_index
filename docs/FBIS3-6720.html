This is the  first visit to Malaysia by the Vietnamese highest leader.  Following is our radio opinion on the visit and relations  between Vietnam and Malaysia.    Last year, Party Leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and  Thailand. This year, he is preparing to visit Malaysia.  Vietnamese State President Le Duc Anh will visit Indonesia  early next month.    In the last two years, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited  most countries in the region. Vietnam does respect its  relations with other regional countries, especially with the  ASEAN member countries. Furthermore, all countries in Southeast  Asia have acknowledged the cooperation for mutual benefit with  Vietnam. The British Broadcasting Corporation radio on March 17  quoted Mr. Chew Tai Soo, the Singaporean ambassador to the  United Nations, as saying that Vietnam was on the threshold of  ASEAN. Vietnam should join ASEAN and the visit to Malaysia by  party leader Do Muoi will contribute to promoting this process.    The visit will also strengthen relations between Vietnam and  Malaysia, which have achieved progress after the visit to  Malaysia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1992. Two-way trade  turnover has reached $100 million. Malaysia has invested in 16  projects in Vietnam worth $95 million. Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed himself has a deep sentiment towards Vietnam  and respects bilateral relations between Vietnam and Malaysia.    The visit to Malaysia by our party leader will contribute to  implementing the desire of leaders and peoples of the two  countries to consolidate and develop friendship and cooperation.</p>

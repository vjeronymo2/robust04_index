ROSSIISKIYE VESTI carries pronouncements by prominent state  and public figures under the front-page banner headline: "A  Cabinet Reorganisation All of a Sudden Resulted in a Sunday  Governemtnt Crisis".    The newspaper runs the text of Gaydar's letter to President  Boris Yeltsin. In the letter, gaydar expressed regret over the  fact that decisions, in the preparation of which he did not  participate and which he categorically objected to, used to be  adopted increasingly often recently.    IZVESTIYA:    Gaydar's resignation was unexpected but not more than an  earthquake in a quake-prone area. One can take various views of  the policy suggested by Gaydar two years ago, but "the  liberalisation of prices..., privatisation -- all are directed  associated with Gaydar and his team, just as, incidentally, the  decline in the living standards of a large proportion of people,  shut-downs of factories and other hard problems connected with  attempts to cure the chronic totalitarianism by means of a shock  therapy".    TRUD queries whether the resignation of the first  vice-premier signifies a cardinal change in the reform policy,  pointing out that "if a future government will lack Gaydar,  Fedorov, Chubays and Pamfilova (the latter three are ministers  in charge of finance, privatisation, and social protection of  the population), the world community would view that as a sign  that radical reforms in Russia are done away with."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on First Vice-Premier Yegor  Gaydar's resignation:    Noting that Gaydar's example is being followed by other  members of the Russian Governemnt, the newspaper points out that  this happens at a noteworthy moment -- elections to the Federal  Assembly (parliament) were held recently and parliamentary and  political blocs have undergone a considerable regrouping. Next  crucial moment in the life of Russia will be not so distant  presidential elections.    "Since representatives of the blocs hurried to distance  themselves from the present government, it is quite logical to  suppose that this is more advantageous that sharing  responsibility with it".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject:    The newspaper believes that Gaydar's resignation "cannot  change in any way the nature of an economic policy of the Viktor  Chernomyrdin government, because the governemnt had no policy to  this effect even after Gaydar's comeback".    "The point is that reforms-related theorising receded into  the background six months ago with regard to the cabinet's  trouble- shooting activities".    PRAVDA strongly criticises the shock therapy policy, at the  rise of which Gaydar stood.    "Is it not his policy of slashing credits to industrial  enterprises that leads to their shut-down everywhere and a steep  increase in unemployment? Was it not he who wanted a common  rouble zone within the CIS when the International Monetary Fund  wanted it? Why then does he lament this?"    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, touching upon the work of the State  Duma,  points out in particular:    "Fully confirmed has been the forecast that not a single  side  in the duma would have a solid edge while political clashes  would get exacerbated and become even keener than was the case  in the Supreme Soviet".    TRUD carries an interview with President Nikolay Fyodorov of  Chuvashia. "I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop and really  prosper only as part of Russia", he said.</p>

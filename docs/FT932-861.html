			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Grants to employers on disabled to be halved GOVERNMENT grants to companies to help them to meet the extra costs of retaining employees who become disabled are to be halved under new rules. At present, employers can obtain specialist equipment on free loan, grants for adaptations, help with extra costs of fares to work and 'readers' for blind employees. From April next year companies will have to make a 50 per cent contribution towards help for employees who have worked for them for six months or more. The employer's contribution will be capped at a level yet to be announced. The Employers' Forum on Disability, members of which include the high street banks, B&amp;Q and Wellcome, said yesterday any measure that 'discourages employers from developing positive policies on retention (of disabled employees) is very worrying'. The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (Radar) said the move 'makes no sense from a government which claims to want to keep people in work'. It said many employers would not be prepared to pay more to retain disabled staff. Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat spokesman on social security, said the government had 'again chosen to attack the most vulnerable in society'. The move would increase employers' costs and jeopardise disabled people's jobs, he said. The Department of Employment said yesterday there was 'no question of a budget cut' in the Pounds 13m a year being spent on measures for disabled people at work. The government aimed to widen access to grants and put more resources into getting disabled people into jobs, it said. The scheme benefits 8,000 to 9,000 individuals a year. Under the new rules, the department said, companies would be expected to pay the cost of one-off items of equipment or help costing less than Pounds 100 for employees with six months' or more service. Employers would not be asked for any contribution for new recruits or employees who had worked for them for less than six months. There will also be a ceiling on grants for each disabled person over a five-year period. Radar said the ceiling would particularly hit those receiving recurring payments such as help with fares to work. Both Radar and the Employers' Forum welcomed other changes in the rules meaning that, from next month, unemployed deaf people will be able to get help towards the cost of 'communicators' at job interviews. Grants will also be available towards the cost of personal assistants for employees with other disabilities.</p>

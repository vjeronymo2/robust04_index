			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Infrastructure attracts more private finance Private financiers are moving into infrastructure development, in volumes well above expectations of just a few years ago, despite the risks of investing in emerging economies. This is according to a report released by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm. The IFC is playing a leading role in managing private sector infrastructure development. Since its first infrastructure financing in 1966, the corporation has undertaken 88 infrastructure transactions worth Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in 20 countries. The 'renaissance' in private sector financing can be traced to several developments. In many countries, both the governments and consumers are disappointed by the poor performance of public projects. Other governments, with tight budgets, are turning to their private sectors. Developments in financial markets have created a wider pool of financiers and more financing techniques. Technological changes in telecommunications, power and transport systems have reduced unit costs and eased private sector entry. In 1988-1992, governments in 15 developing countries privatised more than Dollars 20bn of infrastructure-related assets. 'Companies have supplied finance, and the ability to take risks and to implement projects efficiently, while governments have contributed a willingness to privatise, to experiment with new more competitive regulatory environments, and to encourage non-guaranteed financing,' the report says. The rise in private financing and management of power plants, roads and other infrastructure can ultimately deliver better results than projects managed by governments, the report said, noting that, while it is still too early to judge operational performance, signed contracts suggest that efficiency gains are being achieved. The IFC says companies are also learning to manage environmental risks. Project managers are bringing in foreign companies to apply the lessons of environmental management learned in their own countries. 'Private ownership that encourages better cost recovery is also having an impact on energy conservation by customers,' it said.</p>

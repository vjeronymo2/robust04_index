			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Yes means Nein for D-Mark: Danish vote raises fears over German currency DENMARK'S vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty has given a boost to the project of European union. But dealers in financial markets wonder whether the Danish Yes has also signalled the start of a long-term decline for the mighty D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Over the last 12 months, the German currency benefited greatly from the turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism, as currency and bond dealers sought a source of stability. But as Maastricht gets back on track, there are signs that dealers are regaining confidence in currencies and bonds outside the D-Mark bloc. This process threatens to lift the veil on fundamental weaknesses in Germany's economy and its public finances. 'The poor fundamentals underpinning the German currency are becoming gradually exposed,' says Mr Avinash Persaud, of UBS. 'I anticipate the D-Mark will soon be one of the weakest of the major currencies.' This week, the Danish vote has already triggered a sharp outflow of 'hot money' from the D-Mark into other European currencies and bonds. In recent months, international investors had bought the D-Mark as a means of hedging against the possibility of further devaluations of currencies like the Danish krone, the peseta and the escudo. But the last three days have witnessed a one-off flow of funds out of the D-Mark, lifting sterling, the Italian lira and the Iberian currencies, while weakening the D-Mark and German government bonds. Simultaneously, there has been a surge of short-term investment in the dollar, following US consumer inflation figures that show a 3.7 per cent rise in the first three months of this year, from just 3 per cent in the previous quarter. Some dollar investors believe the data may have given the Federal Reserve's open market committee, which met this week, a reason to raise short-term US interest rates - a move that would increase the premium on short-term dollar holdings. Initially, the developments in Denmark and the US may only affect flows of hot money between the main currencies. But several longer-term factors are forcing institutional investors to ponder the weighting of D-Marks in their currency and bond portfolios. The increase in Germany's current account and budget deficits, as a result of the reunification of East and West Germany, has raised fears about a build-up of D-Mark denominated paper on the world's bond markets. For 1993, the federal deficit forecast has risen from DM43bn (Pounds 17.4bn) to DM70bn. But this figure still appears implausible to many analysts. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, says that the settlement of the IG Metall strike may worsen the budget deficit, as East German metalworkers were guaranteed that their wages would grow to 80 per cent of those for their western counterparts, in spite of their much lower productivity. 'That was a political settlement, and not the one the markets wanted to see,' he said. With German GDP set to fall by about 2 per cent this year, the Bundesbank is also likely to reduce short-term interest rates further, thus reducing the premium for investors holding D-Marks. It is also in the interest of the government and central banks to pull down short-term rates as quickly as possible in order to alleviate the funding burden and attract investment into longer-dated bonds. Following the five realignments since last autumn, the D-Mark is the one currency in the ERM that remains significantly over-valued. It is thought to be 20 per cent over-valued on a purchasing power parity basis: this will have to be redressed if the country is to maintain its share of export markets. Amid all these factors, the near-term outlook for the D-Mark depends on how the Bundesbank responds. Several Bundesbank council members have raised concern that a weakening D-Mark would raise the prospect of imported inflation. But Mr Steve Hannah, a director of IBJ International, believes that it will be difficult for the Bundesbank to respond to this danger by tightening monetary policy. 'If the D-Mark falls independently of German interest rate cuts, the Bundesbank might have to slow its easing of monetary policy to keep the D-Mark strong, worsening the recession,' he said. The Bundesbank's hope must be that, as interest rates come down, there is an orderly depreciation in the D-Mark. But the long term outlook for the D-Mark remains far from certain. The D-Mark remains an important reserve currency of European central banks and the proportion of foreign exchange turnover in D-Marks has increased in recent years. But a parallel is often drawn these days between the D-Mark's current situation and the way in which the dollar's status as a reserve currency has been gently eroded in the last 30 years by the build up of America's trade and budget deficits. 'I wonder whether, two or three years after reunification, the same phenomenon is beginning to affect the D-Mark,' says Mr Hannah. 'The atmosphere is certainly changing, and the relative strength of the D-Mark will be a talking point for some time to come.'</p>

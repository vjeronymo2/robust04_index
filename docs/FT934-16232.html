			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Yeltsin confirms election date and eases press censorship PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin called on Russians last night to put the 'nightmare of these black days' behind them, eased his press censorship and confirmed that parliamentary and possibly regional council elections would be held in December. Mr Yeltsin, seemingly close to tears after his first address since the suppression of the armed uprising in Moscow this week, strove to heal the wounds of the violence. 'Let us not say that someone has won and someone has lost,' he said. 'Such words are out of place, blasphemous. We have all been scorched by the death-like breath of fratricide.' But he warned that the fledgling democracy had in future to be more decisive in its use of force to prevent further attempts to destabilise his regime. Apparently criticising his own staff, he said 'not everyone had the self-control to withstand the huge tension at the critical moment'. General Vladimir Pankratov, head of the Moscow police, admitted the police 'did not always act brilliantly' during the mob attacks on Sunday, but excused them by saying 'they were not prepared or trained for military action'. Echoing Mr Yeltsin's point that democracy needed better defences, he announced a shopping list for his men, including armoured cars, heavier weapons, and training in sharpshooting and riot control. In an article banned by censors in the liberal newspaper Sivodnya, Mr Sergei Parkhomenko, stationed in the Kremlin last Sunday, alleged Mr Yeltsin and his aides in the Kremlin had been in a state of panic when demonstrators broke through police lines to the White House. Although censorship of mainstream newspapers was lifted, opposition publications, including Pravda, remained banned. Mr Yeltsin's call for regional council elections had been trailed by his aides, but he stopped short of ordering such elections. The round of resignations continued with that of Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the Constitutional Court and a long-time target of Mr Yeltsin's camp. In a further break with the past, the guard of honour was removed from the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, one of the founders of the Soviet Union. Further reports, Page 5</p>

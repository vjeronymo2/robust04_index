			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (4): Flying in the face of competition - Airfreight EARLIER suggestions that traditional international airfreight services would be overwhelmed by competition from new-style integrators offering express movement of goods worldwide now appear wide of the mark. Certainly, the long-established providers of airfreight services - airlines and freight forwarders - have over the past decade lost much of their intra-European distribution business to specialist express delivery operators using their own air and truck networks. On the broader global scene, though, the airlines and forwarders remain a significant force. Their well-established connections and varied capacity/routing options often enable them to offer their customers, the shippers, a wider and often more flexible range of distribution possibilities than their integrator competitors. Emphasising that point, Mr Klaus-Michael Kuehne, chairman and chief executive of large Swiss-based forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel AG, claims many international customers need 'more flexibility in their day-to-day business than that offered by a highly sophisticated but rather inflexible air network (of an integrator)'. The global airfreight market can in fact now probably be broken down into three broad sectors - traditional air cargo, special commodities and express. The last-named, express, is now dominated by integrators such as FedEx, TNT, United Parcel Service and DHL. International airline efforts to develop their own door-to- door express services, either alone or in conjunction with freight forwarders, have largely proved unsuccessful. Latest example of that involves Skyracer, an airline-owned door-to-door delivery company, which was recently shut down by principal shareholder Swissair, the Swiss airline, because of 'disappointing revenues and limited prospects for growth'. Even that failure, though, has not deterred all airlines from trying to establish new air express operations. Next development in that context is likely to come from German airline Lufthansa which is planning to launch its own overnight freighter network in Europe next year using two full freighters and seven 'quick-change' B737 aircraft which can carry passengers during the day and cargo at night. But the main roles for most airlines as far as the international air express market is concerned now appear to lie in acting as carriers for the integrators or as wholesalers. British Airways Cargo, for example, has over the past few years developed a strong on-board courier network under the name Speedbird Courier. Currently, says Mr Peter White, managing director BA Cargo, Speedbird covers more than 70 international routes to and from the UK, with up to 124 couriers flying each day. 'A timetable is published detailing all the flights on which a Speedbird Courier travels. Space is sold to both retail and wholesale courier companies. Support is received from both small and large retailers, including the big four (TNT, FedEx, UPS and DHL), and over time, retailers have discontinued their own couriers on routes operated by Speedbird Courier,' he says. Other airlines have decided to tackle the express market with an 'if you cannot beat them, join them' approach. Most obvious example of that involves Lufthansa and Japan Air Lines which have over the past couple of years each built up a 25 per cent stake in air express company DHL. Mr Rainer Butz, vice-president cargo Europe for Lufthansa, admits the German airline's decision to buy into DHL followed the failure of earlier efforts by the carrier to break into the express market through joint ventures and co-operation with various major freight forwarders. He stresses, though, that the involvement with DHL is an alliance aimed at promoting co-operation rather than a merger or classic takeover. 'The co-operation currently covers over 100 synergy projects. The most impressive to date has been the development of a same-day service in Germany where Lufthansa and DHL can combine their resources optimally,' he adds. Other examples of co-operation between potential rivals include instances where integrators are offering freight capacity to forwarders. Most obvious example of that involves US-based integrator Federal Express which in addition to developing its own international air express services is also seeking to forge alliances with forwarders to create jointly-branded express and express cargo services. The second major sector of international airfreight services involves special commodities such as perishable products, live animals, project/outsized cargoes and hazardous goods. That business looks set to remain largely in the hands of its traditional carriers, the airlines and forwarders, which have the experience and facilities necessary to handle them properly. The main future battleground between airlines/forwarders and the integrators is likely to involve the third sector of the airfreight market - traditional air cargo. That encompasses the transportation of normal industrial and commercial shipments moving in parcel, container or pallet form. The integrators are already making substantial inroads into that market, forcing the airline and forwarders to look hard at ways of improving their services. Mr Butz of Lufthansa picks out some of the key issues in that context. 'It will be increasingly necessary to improve product quality and to quantify this quality. Airfreight must not be allowed to become merely a commodity. It must maintain a clear, unmistakable performance profile. Product enhancement through improved information systems will be an integral part of this process,' he says. 'Just as important as the improvement in cost quality will be constant effort in the area of cost improvement. Cost-cutting will have to be intensified. But the shipping community should not, however, anticipate services in 2000 at 1970s' prices.' Many airfreight shippers claim they would be prepared to pay more for better quality airfreight services from scheduled airlines. But, they argue, they are often being asked to pay premium rates for less than premium services. That point is made strongly by the chairman of the British Shippers' Council air transport committee, John Boyce. By monitoring airlines' performance, he says, shippers have been able to establish that some of the better airlines are aiming to get 90 per cent of cargo flown as booked. 'So they are expecting us to pay the going rate for a service which will certainly fail 10 per cent of the time and probably more,' he claims. Mr Boyce argues that in addition to better value for money, shippers also want airlines to offer a wide choice of airfreight services. In that context, he suggests carriers should consider introducing different product classes for cargo along the lines of those used for passenger services. For example, a 'first class' service might offer a 100 per cent flown-as-booked guarantee, while 'business class' cargo might be given greater priority than 'economy' freight.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Lord Spens awarded legal costs LORD SPENS, whose trial on charges relating to Guinness's share-support operation in the 1986 takeover of Distillers was abandoned, was yesterday awarded legal costs that could total more than Pounds 250,000. The former merchant banker's trial for conspiracy and false accounting was abandoned early last year after five months when his fellow defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, was judged too ill to continue. Lord Spens was finally cleared last November. Lord Spens has attacked the regulatory authorities from his seat in the House of Lords and is suing the Bank of England for allegedly pressuring his former employers, the merchant bankers Henry Ansbacher, to dismiss him as their corporate finance managing director in 1986.</p>

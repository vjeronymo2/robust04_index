			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Italian security chief quits: Old-guard politicians, Mafia and renegade intelligence agents said to be behind car bombs in Rome and Milan THE head of Italy's domestic intelligence service resigned yesterday as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi talked of a 'criminal design' to destabilise Italy at a delicate moment of political transition. They called for calm in a nation last week rocked by the suicides of two prominent figures involved in the corruption scandals. The resignation of Mr Angelo Finocchiaro, head of the Sisde intelligence agency, followed three car bomb explosions in Rome and Milan on Tuesday night. Five people were killed. It was not clear whether Mr Finocchiaro's resignation was forced by the Ciampi government. But there has been strong criticism by politicians of the lax control of Italy's security services, and their apparent failure to control terrorism that has killed 10 people in the past two months. Although the precise responsibility for the car bombs remains a mystery, officials said yesterday they had been planned deliberately. The bombs exploded as political parties are about to approve electoral laws that will usher in a largely new political class and at a crucial stage in the investigations into political corruption: leading politicians of the past decade are expected soon to be linked to enormous sums of illicit money. In response to the latest outrage, Italy's trade unions held two-hour stoppages in Rome and Milan yesterday, accompanied by large demonstrations. Pope John Paul II made a point of inspecting the damage at the sites of the two car bombs in Rome - the basilica of St John Lateran and the 12th century church of St George, Velabro. As with the two earlier bomb outrages at Florence's Uffizi Gallery and in a wealthy residential area of Rome in May, the authorities were unable to give clear indications of those responsible. No arrests have been made in the two months since these bombskilled five people in Florence and damaged part of the world-famous picture gallery as well as injuring 23 in Rome. Mr Nicola Mancini, the interior minister, pointed the finger at organised crime. He said there were similarities between Tuesday's bombs and the car bomb that assassinated Mr Paolo Borsellino, the anti-Mafia judge, in Palermo last July, as well as the bombing of the Naples-Milan train in 1984 that killed 15 people. The Borsellino killing was the work of the Sicilian Mafia, while the Naples-Milan train bombing was blamed on a mix of organised crime, right-wing extremists and elements within the security forces. Uncontrolled elements in the security services along with the Mafia, backed by some of the old-guard politicians, are now being accused of orchestrating the car bombs. In the wake of the Uffizi car bombing on May 27, the Ciampi government carried out four changes in the senior hierarchy of the security services. Pressure for a major clean-up of the Sisde has increased in recent weeks following the discovery that a number of top officials, past and present, had expropriated L14bn (Pounds 5.8m) of its funds and had been running a travel agency on the side. The car bombs all exploded during the late evening/early morning. Yesterday, the authorities played down earlier suggestions that firemen had been lured to a burning car in Milan with the bomb then being exploded. Two car bombs were placed beside two ancient religous buildings in Rome - St John Lateran, which once housed the Popes and was where Mussolini signed the 1929 pact with the Church. All three bombs were directed against Italy's cultural/artistic heritage, the Milan explosion being outside the Contemporary Art Museum. The portico of St George, Velabro, was destroyed after recently being restored at a cost of L300m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guido Passalacqua: "Maroni: `Scalfaro Can Rest </F> Assured -- I Will Guarantee Italy's Unity'"]    [Text] Milan -- "President Scalfaro has nothing to worry  about. On the contrary, through the presence of one of its  members in the Viminale [Interior Ministry], the federalist  Northern League will guarantee Italy's unity." Barely a few  minutes after the official announcement of his appointment to  the Interior Ministry, Bobo "the mediator" [Roberto Maroni] --  staying in his Lozza cottage -- was already thinking of the  future and of the president's doubts. For his part, [League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi learned the news in his office in Via  Bellerio. He had been unavailable for the whole day, not  answering phone calls, and giving rise to some concern,  especially in Rome, that he might be in the throes of a  brainstorm. For the time being, Bossi limited himself to a few  spirited remarks: "I am satisfied with the whole government  team. It is made up of fairly young people. Besides, there are  few recycled individuals, and this, too, is an important factor."    Later on, an official communique arrived in which the League  secretary confirmed the "democratic guarantor's role fulfilled  by the League through the Interior Ministry." In the economic  field, the League ministers will play "a reformist role" while,  through the Institutional Reform Ministry, the League will  pursue a twofold objective: "Reforming the existing republican  Constitution along federalist lines," and embodying the local  governments' competences in a new ministry.    Yesterday was Bobo Maroni's day, however. Sitting on the red  and green sofa in his living room, holding hands with his wife  Emi while his children played in the garden, Maroni waited for  the official announcement on television. "Moved, touched -- I  defy anybody not to be," he said, but he then returned to  politics. "I was not worried. We were in no doubt. Early in  the afternoon [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi phoned to  tell me `everything is in order.'" Not even the story of the  exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi had shaken  Maroni's confidence: "I would myself have signed the letter  that Berlusconi sent to the president of the Republic," he  remarked in the morning. "Scalfaro's letter," he now added, "was  intended, in a sense, to make Berlusconi assume responsibility  for the fact that he was appointing a League member to the  Interior Ministry. Under the circumstances, I believe that the  prime minister behaved like a true prime minister." Maroni then  resumed the tones of political and institutional reassurance:  "Today, through the signature of the state's highest authority,  it has become apparent that federalism and national unity are  not incompatible, that federalism is not the same thing as  separatism." The new interior minister made a promise: "I will  not tell you what my first measure will be, it will be a  surprise -- but, paradoxically, I who am a northerner by  definition, will have the moral obligation to tackle and solve  the South's problems -- I am fully aware of this."    What about the protests from high-ranking bureaucrats and  the  prefects? "I have been told that the Interior Ministry has a  very efficient structure. I will spend the first few months  studying and observing matters, meeting with senior officials  and staff, as well as traveling." He then promised: "I will be  prudent. You see, the first phone call I received this  afternoon, after the news came that the government had been  formed, was not from a fellow party member or a politician, but  from a police inspector whom I did not know. He congratulated  me and wished me all the best, and told me not to worry. This  pleased me very much."    Yesterday was not only Maroni's day, however. It was also  the first time the League has been in government and at the  Viminale -- a true miracle in which, up to a few months ago,  only Bossi seriously believed. Yesterday he said that, during  the consultations, he provokingly proposed himself for the  Interior Ministry: "They all jumped to their feet," he  recalled, "crying out against subversion." Early in the morning  on Tuesday [10 May], in the yard of party headquarters, he told  of how his decision to aim for the government had been reached  on the night Patelli was arrested. It was in the course of a  dinner at the "Patrizia" pizzeria that the League's leader  outlined the path that, months later, enabled his party to  obtain the appointment of the first non-confessional interior  minister in close to 50 years, as well as four other portfolios.    "We came out of this in tiptop form," Maroni said. "We are  part of the government, we have been legitimized by the voters,  by the ministries, and by our visibility within the majority.  The League is a political subject."</p>

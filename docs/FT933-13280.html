			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The shadow that hangs over Medeva - Yesterday's slump in the pharmaceutical group's share price WHEN A statement warning that profits will be Pounds 10m lower than City expectations causes the market value of that company to halve, something has clearly gone badly wrong. When over 28m shares are traded in the process, it is clear that investors have experienced a failure of confidence approaching epidemic proportions. Yesterday Medeva, the niche pharmaceuticals company, suffered just such a fate. The company said stock problems at IMS, its Californian subsidiary, and a two-week closure at MD Pharmaceutical, another US company, to meet Food and Drug Administration requirements would lower pre-tax profits for 1993 by Pounds 10m to about Pounds 45m, against Pounds 36m last year. However, much more than the company's profits, the main casualty from yesterday's dramatic sell-off was the confidence in the depth of management that Medeva has been working so hard to cultivate. Since it began its rapid rise six years ago, Medeva has attracted no shortage of unbelievers. Medeva was a drug company growing by acquisition rather than research and development of new drugs, the sceptics said; it was following a strategy that relied heavily on the purchase of drugs considered too small or too old by the world's largest pharmaceutical companies; and it had a management forged from an unusual alliance between an ex-chief executive of Glaxo, Mr Bernard Taylor, and an astute, but little known, wheeler-dealing former stockbroker, Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith. This strategy had within six years built a company from almost nothing to a market capitalisation on Friday of nearly Pounds 600m. And through various acquired subsidiaries, it is waiting for FDA approvals for new drugs and new presentations of existing drugs that have recently gone off patent that could give a significant fillip to sales. But the unconverted were taking yesterday's 100p share price fall to 116p as proof that even if they were unable to put a finger on where the formula would break down, they knew it was flawed. Medeva was yesterday trying to stress the problem was one of control, not of strategy. The group was aware that growth through acquisition could lead to problems of financial and quality control. More professional operational management had been appointed earlier this year in Europe and four weeks ago in the US. 'We know what the problems (of growing through acquisition) are likely to be,' Mr Taylor said. 'We did not succeed in pre-empting them in the US where we made our appointments just a whisper too late. 'I believe the overall strategy is still sound and has not been undermined by these two problems but there is an understanding that we have moved too slowly.' Better controls may have led to an earlier audit of IMS stocks held in the warehouses of independent wholesalers in California. These had reached double normal levels and were therefore exaggerating the company's sales. The turmoil in the US health sector as the Clinton administration tries to tackle the rising cost of health care, also appears to have forced hospitals to buy lower value added cheaper products from the wholesalers. What the market and investors are more concerned about, however, is that yesterday's warning may not be the last of the bad news. With confidence in management controls now dented, will Medeva do what Spring Ram, Hartstone and Tiphook have done recently - make more than one trading statement, analysts were asking yesterday. If Medeva's only problem was poor controls it could face a rocky few months and then begin to rebuild confidence with the help of a revived focus on operational controls. But Medeva faces a much more long term problem in the shape of the US Food and Drug Administration. Last year Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company, ran into problems with the FDA over the conditions of a plant in the UK. These have mostly been ironed out. But the incident and similar actions with Glaxo, over its advertising in the US, suggest the FDA is pressing more aggressively for tighter controls. Not surprisingly, perhaps, Mr Taylor agrees. 'The FDA is really flexing its muscles at the moment and is not content with the standards of manufacture,' he said. While Medeva thinks it has rectified the problems, Mr Taylor has no idea when the FDA will visit MD again, although it will be this year, and cannot say when Medeva will know if its standards now reach the required level. Until the FDA's position becomes clear, Medeva is likely to remain under a shadow. But this and yesterday's price fall does not appear to have detered some analysts. While consternation was almost universal yesterday, Warburg for instance, has lowered its earnings estimates - but maintained its buy recommendation.</p>

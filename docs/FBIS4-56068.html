			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miodrag Vukmanovic: "Substitute for Yeltsin"] </F>   [Text] The visit paid by Russian Patriarch Aleksiy II to  the Serbian Orthodox Church was announced as a first-class  international event. Television moderators, even those who were  reminded of "an internal enemy" by the sound of church bells in  earlier times, competed in who would speak with more inspiration  and piety about his highness. The arrival of the patriarch of  Moscow and Russia was interpreted in "all Serbian countries" as  a diplomatic substitute for what the Serbian politicians with a  strong affinity to Russia expected from President Yeltsin, who  -- allegedly out of fear of the West -- does not want to support  his Serbian brothers openly. Numerous representatives of the  "Russian people" -- political vagabonds and senile officers of  the former Red Army who toured Serbia, Montenegro and the  self-proclaimed republic of Srpska during the last war years,  inciting the Serbs to rebel and make terror by promising them  senseless things and raising false hopes of the almighty Russian  protection -- could not fulfill the requirements set by their  host.  <H5>  The Difference </H5>   Now everyone is raising hopes in the head of the Russian  Church, which is still a mighty institution with a good  political rating -- although democracy separates the church from  the state -- because of the repression it was exposed to during  the long period of the Soviet leadership.    Patriarch Aleksiy II is an outstanding church dignitary who  uses well-measured words and gestures, as is appropriate for a  man of his rank.    This is what constitutes the difference between him and his  hosts, the Serbian rulers, whose prayers and public  announcements are full of a certain hatred and false generosity  and whose peace messages sound as if they were uttered under  pressure, which has in no case come from God. The shepherds of  the people of Saint Sava [Serbs] are probably not very happy to  express their humble respect for their brother who is partially  of German origin.    Immediately after his arrival in Belgrade, the Russian  patriarch said that the task he would like to accomplish within  his mission was to end the bloodshed and solve all problems at  the negotiating table. Variations of the same sentence were  also included in other official statements issued in connection  with the conversation between the two patriarchs. It was  noticed that both dignitaries wanted to include all parties to  the conflict in their peace message, that they did not want to  blame only one party to the conflict, or to differentiate in any  way between God's unrighteous children. This is the point that  will make many people mistrust the sincerity of Aleksiy's  mission. In the spirit of "gospel etiquette," [Serbian]  Patriarch Pavle advised his nation: "Do unto others as you  would have them do unto you!" There is the danger, however,  that many Serbs who can read and write will find a typing  mistake in this Bible message.    It will probably never become known what the dignitaries of  the two Orthodox churches, in the present situation of huge  national frustrations in their countries, discussed in private  and with their closest assistants. Both churches have very  delicate relations with their respective state leaderships. The  Saint Sava believers from Pale are closer to the Serbian church  than "the freshly refurbished" communists in Belgrade,  regardless of the privileges they returned to the church. Its  leadership fears that any concession to the West that would  leave some of the Serbs in the domain of a mighty Catholic or  Muslim influence would be a danger to the Serbian national  entity that is derived from the Orthodox religion.  <H5>  Keeping Up With the West </H5>   Through many schisms since the 17th century, through Peter's  reforms and the Catholic influence under Polish rule, as well as  through the contact with Scandinavian Protestantism in its  neighborhood, the Russian church has actually kept up with the  West. The appearance of the "Asiatic" orthodoxy after the  collapse of communism is not a logical spiritual continuation of  the Russian state religion. It is rather an anarchist protest  of "the crazy with Christ," which is used as an explanation for  unbelievable moves the red and the black are making in the  present Russia. As far as help for the Serbs is concerned, the  restrained behavior of the Russian patriarch is not caused by  his neutral attitude toward the warring factions in the Balkans;  it arises from his consultation with the Russian state  leadership. It is not difficult to notice that the patriarch's  messages for peace and his insistence on negotiations correspond  to what has been concluded in ministerial meetings in Geneva.  It was obviously made clear to the Moscow patriarch what the  limits of help for the Serbs are.    After the meeting with Milosevic, the patriarch did not  spend  many compliments on his conversation partner. This points to  the possibility that the conversation was predominantly  informative and strictly official, accompanied by conventional  phrases about the traditional friendship between the two  countries. When travelling to Pale, the Russian patriarch was  accompanied by persons who were, with good reason, heavily  accused by Russian diplomats, which has to be interpreted as a  part of the inevitable protocol. It is not probable that the  Pale leadership will hear from the head of the Russian Church  something different from what his hosts in Belgrade heard. What  they heard can be guessed at, based on the speech delivered by  Serbian Patriarch Pavle in which he reminded his listeners of  the time of Arsenije Carnojevic and his petition for mediation  at the Austrian Court when Russia "was not able to do anything  in order to help the Serbs." "The Serbs understood" and kept on  loving Russia. They will probably understand this time also.</p>

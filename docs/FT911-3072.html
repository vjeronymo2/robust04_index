The improvement - from Pounds 4.59m to Pounds 5.05m  - for the six months to end-December came despite what directors described as 'continuing pressure on margins in UK contracting and the severely depressed market for housebuilders.' Turnover expanded to Pounds 104.08m (Pounds 78m). The group was cushioned to a certain extent by its expanding rental income, up from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.69m, reflecting satisfactory first lettings and rent reviews. Trading profit of Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 3.15m) included interest receivable of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 164,000). The interim dividend is raised to 3.12p (2.83p), payable from earnings per share of 32.28p (29.42p).</p>

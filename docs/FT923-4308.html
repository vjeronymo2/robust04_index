			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / 6% fall in private housing starts THE NUMBER of new private homes started by builders fell by almost 6 per cent during the first seven months of this year compared with the corresponding period last year, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. If this trend continued for the rest of this year the number of homes started by private builders would be the lowest annual total for more than a decade. The department said starts of houses in the private sector during the three months to the end of July were almost 9 per cent lower than in the corresponding quarter last year. The figures, which have been adjusted to take account of seasonal variations, underline the deepening recession in the private housing market. The downturn still shows no sign of slackening - almost four years after house prices peaked in southern England. House prices published last week by Halifax and Nationwide, the country's two largest building societies, showed that the cost of an average UK home has continued to fall during the summer although the rate of decline has slackened. Halifax warned that any recovery in prices next year would at best be muted and would depend upon an improvement in the general economy. The environment department said builders started work on 77,900 private homes during the first seven months of this year compared with 82,600 in the corresponding period last year. During the whole of last year builders started work on 134,900 private homes, the lowest figure for more than a decade. It compared with a peak of 221,000 recorded in 1988. Building by housing associations, by comparison, has continued to advance rapidly. Starts made by associations during the first seven months of this year rose by more than half from 13,000 to 19,800. Associations are expected by the government to take over from local authorities the central role of providing social housing. Overall builders started work 14,400 private and public sector homes in July compared with 16,000 in the corresponding month last year.</p>

He told a press conference in Umtata he would stay on as  head  of state in spite of a busy campaign schedule that starts with a  visit to the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] this  weekend. "During the election campaign I will continue in my  present position as chairman of the ruling military council and  attend to state matters as is applicable to other heads of  government in southern Africa or in South Africa such as  (President F W) de Klerk."    Gen Holomisa, who is on the ANC's list for the national  assembly, said the election campaign would be used to inform  "locals" of the impending end of the homeland system and of  homeland government. His participation on an ANC ticket did not  imply other political organisations in the territory would be  exposed to unfair treatment.    Whatever the Transitional Executive Council and independent  electoral commission put forward to ensure free political  activity would be implemented in Transkei. "Personally I'm an  advocate of free politicking...not even the TEC will teach  Holomisa and his government how to be tolerant."    He said the shift from being a military ruler to campaigning  for the ANC would mean he would have to submit to party  discipline and not use "dictatorial terms". Gen Holomisa will  campaign in all four provinces in the run-up to the elections.</p>

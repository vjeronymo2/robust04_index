			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Margins boost as Securiguard rises to Pounds 5.74m SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning company, yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. However, Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman, said the US economy was showing only 'glimmers' of life and in the UK there was as yet no sign of an upturn. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-November rose from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds 5.74m on sales up 2 per cent at Pounds 165.11m. Earnings per share rose 2p to 19p and the final dividend is 5.9p, giving a total of 9.4p, up 10 per cent. Net debt fell by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 9.6m, leaving the company with gearing of about 200 per cent, but interest covered 5.5 times by trading profits, suggesting that the group has restored some order to its balance sheet. The dividend is more than twice covered by earnings. Margins in the largest cleaning and security divisions suffered, but the smaller communications division, which includes the overnight parcel service, enjoyed an increase in profitability. While the performance of the cleaning division improved, the US operation was adversely affected by the economic slowdown, particularly in New York where Securiguard has a large presence. The division as a whole made Pounds 2.8m operating profits from sales of Pounds 65.26m. The security division was hit by poor sales in the first half when the company said it missed a trend towards cheaper contracts. In the second half, that mistake was rectified, Mr Baldwin said. Overall the division's trading profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 3.45m. The security division's sales in the same period of 1991 were bolstered by the effects of the Gulf war and in the last period profits were hit by the cost of moving headquarters. City Link, the overnight parcels delivery business, had a record summer. The personnel division returned a reduced trading loss, down from Pounds 703,000 to Pounds 552,000.</p>

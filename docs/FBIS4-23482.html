			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Christo Retief] </F>   [Excerpts] A high-level investigation in United Democratic  Front [UDF] ranks has been launched after confidential and  sensitive information was apparently "leaked" to local  newspapers on the UDF's role in attempts to establish a new  political group comprising smaller opposition parties. UDF  President Mr. Justus Garoeb yesterday confirmed to DIE  REPUBLIKEIN that he is personally in charge of the investigation  and that "there will be trouble" if a UDF member turns out to be  the source of the information. In a news release Mr. Garoeb  also confirmed the UDF's involvement, as stated in the release,  in the preliminary negotiations with opposition parties in the  National Assembly concerning the formation of a new political  coalition and the reaching of election agreements.    He stated that the formation of a coalition and cooperation  agreements is a normal occurrence in a democratic system and  declared that the latest negotiations between opposition parties  is nothing strange or exceptional. "We are, however, deeply  concerned about the deliberate and untimely leakage of official  documents to the press at this sensitive stage of negotiations  on coalition. These actions are highly irresponsible." [passage  omitted]    He did not want to comment further on the establishment of  the planned coalition since he did not have a mandate to release  information to the media. According to him the launching  committee on coalition, under the leadership of Mr. Che  Ngaringombe, was responsible for ironing out "hitches" between  participating parties and will report to the leaders of the  various parties "as soon as possible".    Some of the parties, such as the UDF, will discuss the issue  with their respective Central Committees before any decision is  taken on the planned coalition. According to him the "hitches"  include, among other things, the usual administrative details  between the various parties such as the proposed name and motto  of such a coalition. Mr. Garoeb also did not want to comment on  a list noting names and portfolios of the proposed coalition,  which was released to DIE REPUBLIKEIN by sources in the  launching committee.    According to the document the coalition will be known as the  Democratic Coalition of Parties with Mr. Garoeb as president,  Mr. Moses Katjiuongua, of the NPF [National Patriotic Front],  and Mr. Hans Diergaardt of the Rehoboth Free [Democratic Party],  as vice presidents; Mr. Gerson Veii of SWANU [South-West Africa  National Union], chairman, and Mr. Kephes Conradie of the FCN  [Federal Convention for Namibia], secretary general. The  members of the politburo are: Mr. Peter Kayser of the German  Action, Mr. Allen Liebenberg, a Mrs. du Plessis, Mr. Oiva  Angula, Mr. Hans Peters, Mr. Eric Biwa, and Mr. Gabriel Sisehe,  all of the UDF.</p>

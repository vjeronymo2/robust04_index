			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FANS WILL FIGHT ON ABOUT TROJANS LOSING TO NOTRE DAME AGAIN  </P> <P> After suffering through another USC loss to an overrated Notre Dame team, I  have come to the belief that Larry Smith is a Big Ten coach masquerading as a  Pac-10 coach.  </P> <P> I question a game plan that does not attack the most vulnerable part of a  defense. The weakest link of the Irish defense is the secondary. So what  happens? Not one deep pass.  </P> <P> Larry Smith should realize that the lack of a deep passing game will prevent  the Trojans from winning any national championship.  </P> <P> SIDNEY BAKER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

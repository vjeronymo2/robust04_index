			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Government privacy proposals could slow paper inquiries Government proposals for new legal safeguards against the invasion of privacy would deter legitimate inquiries by newspapers, a Liberal Democrat committee warned yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. The party's press and broadcasting working group believes that invasions of personal privacy should continue to be dealt with case-by-case by the courts. It maintains in a document for the party's conference later this month that, while a privacy law might assist some victims of press intrusion, it would also allow others to deter legitimate inquiries with the threat of legal action. However, it favours carefully tailored criminal offences of physical intrusion to deter peeping toms and aggressive 'doorstepping' by the press.</p>

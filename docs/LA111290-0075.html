			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLUB MEMBERS DUCK TO AVOID PLANE CRASH-LANDING; 3 HURT ABOARD CRAFT  </P> <P> A pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries Sunday when their small  plane ran out of gas and crash-landed in front of a secluded beachside club,  where several startled members and a valet had to duck to avoid being hit.  </P> <P> Orange County sheriff's officials said the single-engine Cessna was en route to  Fullerton Municipal Airport from a small airfield in San Diego County when the  pilot made an emergency landing on Niguel Road near the Ritz-Carlton hotel  about 2:15 p.m.  </P> <P> The four-seat plane was nearly destroyed by the impact, said Sheriff's Lt. Jay  Mendez.  </P> <P> Ron Beckmeyer, 46, his wife, Carol, 39, both of Visalia, and Brian Paulino, 23,  of Inglewood were treated for minor cuts.  </P> <P> At the Tennis Club at Monarch Beach, club members and employees who had  gathered for a tennis tournament said they heard the Cessna's sputtering engine  and saw it flying toward them, barely missing trees.  </P> <P> The plane landed in front of the club on Niguel Road, bounced once, and caught  a wing in palm trees in the median, witnesses said. The trees sheared off the  wing, and the plane spun around before it came to rest in the median.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Untitled item MOST NHS trusts have not introduced local pay setting, single-union deals, or changes in the skill mix of health workers, according to a survey by Industrial Relations Services, David Goodhart writes. The research organisation, which received detailed responses from 33 out of the 160 first- and second-wave trusts, found that some staff working for 80 per cent of the respondents were on local terms, but they were mainly managers or specific occupational groups such as healthcare assistants. Some analysts argue that a crucial element in the government's health reforms is the more effective use of labour, with local managers breaking away from the Whitley system of national pay bargaining. 'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given for caution in making change. Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10 respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months.</p>

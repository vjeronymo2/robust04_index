			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Vodafone sets up an overseas overseer VODAFONE, the UK mobile communications group, has set up an international company to oversee its growing overseas business. Although the UK still accounts for most of Vodafone's income, the company has significant stakes in Cellular franchises in Hong Kong, Germany, South Africa, Australia, Greece, Sweden and Denmark. Half of its projected Pounds 300m capital investment this year is devoted to overseas franchises. The company has bids pending in Egypt and Hungary, and plans further expansion in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region as opportunities arise. Its medium-term objective is to have overseas franchises covering a population base as extensive as the UK, allowing for income differentials. The managing director of Vodafone Group International will be Mr Julian Horn-Smith, currently managing director of Vodapage. Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive of Vodafone, said: 'The new company recognises the important role our overseas businesses will play in the future of Vodafone, and will allow us to devote the necessary time and effort to the UK companies which are still the backbone of our business.'</p>

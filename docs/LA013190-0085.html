			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN'S LAWYERS SAID TO BE IN TALKS ON PLEA BARGAIN  </P> <P> A long-expected new indictment of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond  chief Michael Milken has been delayed again, this time because Milken's lawyers  have held talks with federal prosecutors on a possible plea agreement, sources  close to the case said Tuesday.  </P> <P> But the sources cautioned that such contact is fairly "routine" at this stage  in a criminal case. They said there wasn't any indication that the two sides  would reach an agreement or that they were even close to one. The prosecutors,  meanwhile, have informed all of the individuals who may be named as defendants  in the new indictment that it still could be filed within days, the sources  said.  </P> <P> Milken, 43, was named last March in a 98-count federal indictment in New York.  It accused him of violating the federal racketeering law through a pattern of  securities fraud and stock market manipulation while he headed Drexel's junk  bond operations in Beverly Hills. His brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader  Bruce L. Newberg also were named in the indictment. All have pleaded not guilty  and said they will vigorously fight the charges.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have said publicly for months that a "superseding" indictment will  be filed in the case. The new indictment, originally expected last fall, is to  contain many additional charges and name more defendants. Sources have said the  new charges will include additional counts of insider trading, relating to  trading in securities of Caesars World Inc. and Tiger International Inc. Milken  is also expected to be charged with using highly valuable warrants and other  securities to pay off some customers personally in exchange for having their  firms buy junk bonds of doubtful value.  </P> <P> Milken's lawyers had also held talks with the government shortly before the  original indictment was returned last year about a possible settlement. But  those talks led nowhere.  </P> <P> One source said of the contacts within the past two weeks by Milken's lawyers  and federal prosecutors that "they're negotiating to cut a deal." He said the  lawyers have attempted to work out a possible accord, which would then be  presented to Milken. But, the source said, no tentative deal has been reached,  and if one is hammered out, "I don't think anyone knows, including Milken, if  he's going to take it."  </P> <P> Ken Lerer, a spokesman for Milken, said: "We have not commented in the past and  we are not going to start commenting now on the unfair press leaks that have  accompanied this case and that are designed to deny Mike Milken a fair trial."  He added: "Rather than printing the rumor of the day, everyone would be better  served by waiting for the facts."  </P> <P> Jess Fardella, an assistant U.S. attorney on the case, refused to answer  questions about possible talks. He said: "I have no comment on any aspect of  the case."  </P> <P> Milken's lead defense lawyer is Arthur L. Liman, who gained national attention  as chief counsel for the Senate in the televised Iran/Contra hearings in 1987.  Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney in Liman's office, promised to return a  reporter's phone call on Tuesday but didn't call back.  </P> <P> Another source involved in the case also said "discussions are going on"  between Liman's firm and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. People  involved in the case note that, in recent months, a long list of former Milken  co-workers and clients have become cooperating witnesses for the government.  Several of them were among Milken's closest associates, including Gary Winnick,  the former head of Drexel's convertible bond department, who later headed an  investment partnership in which Milken held a large interest.  </P> <P> Lawyers involved in the case, as well as defense lawyers who aren't, have said  the long list of government witnesses could make it extremely difficult for  Milken to win an acquittal. Milken and his lawyers have long maintained that he  didn't violate any laws.  </P> <P> It wasn't clear under what conditions, if any, Milken might find a plea  agreement acceptable. The charges contained in the indictment already filed  carry potential penalties of many years in prison and forfeiture of assets  totaling $1.85 billion.  </P> <P> The superseding indictment has been repeatedly postponed, at one point because  Liman was involved in a trial in another case. Government lawyers had informed  defense lawyers that the new indictment would be returned last week, and then  had named specific days. But each time the filing was delayed. Prosecutors told  defense lawyers Monday that the indictment still may be filed within several  days.  </P> <P> Frederick P. Hafetz, a lawyer representing Newberg, refused to answer any  questions about the activities of Milken's lawyers. But referring to Newberg's  defense team, he said: "We are not having any discussions with the government."  He added: "We're awaiting the superseding indictment, and we expect to go to  trial."  </P> <P> Michael Armstrong, the lawyer for Lowell Milken, said: "As a matter of policy I  am not commenting on anything."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Industrial, commercial, tax, and public security  departments in Zhaoyuan city have adopted powerful and effective  measures to deal strict blows to gold smuggling and other  illegal activities in coordination with other fields, yielding  remarkable results. Since the beginning of this year, these  departments have cracked 48 cases on illegal production and  sales of gold and have confiscated 885 grams of gold, 1,500  grams of silver, 83 tonnes of gold ore, 67 tonnes of gold  concentrate, and 395 gold ornaments molds.    Zhaoyuan city is well known throughout the country for  abounding in gold. Over the past few years, along with the  increasingly more gold mining activities, such unlawful  activities as illegally producing, processing, and selling gold  have become relatively serious. For this reason, industrial,  commercial, tax, and public security departments in Zhaoyuan  city have gone into concerted actions to deal severe blows to  gold dealers. They have specially established a gold  instruments inspection station and also set up six inspection  posts in key gold townships and towns in order to investigate  and deal with cases right after they are discovered. In  addition, they have established a gold production rectification  group in close coordination with other departments concerned and  formulated the decision on protective gold mining. For the  newly initiated enterprises, their quality has been put under  strict control. Those false collectives and those enterprises  which were unable to mine and dress gold ore in a connected  sequence have all been banned. At the same time, specific  regulations have been promulgated to punish illegal gold  producers. Those who violated these regulations have had their  illegal materials and money confiscated and have been punished  by imposing fines.    From January to March this year, some 300 enterprises and  individuals have been punished for illegally extracting finished  gold. Now, the city's gold mining has embarked on the path of  regularization, legalization, and standardization.</p>

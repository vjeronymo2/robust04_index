			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Kings of the bouncy castles set for a hard landing HAS the bounce finally gone out of the market for inflatable castles? 'Too many people have jumped on the bandwagon in the last two years,' said one castle-maker, 'and now there are just too many castles to go around.' Newspaper advertisements persuaded thousands of budding entrepreneurs to become self-employed hirers of bouncy castles, for which all they need is Pounds 1,000, a car and a love of children. Inflatables now appear regularly at service stations, fetes and shopping malls, as well as at children's parties, as the legion of hirers seeks fresh business in a market that industry observers estimate turns over Pounds 15m a year. But margins have come under pressure as competition increased. A small bouncy castle for a private party typically costs up to Pounds 40. Now, prices as low as Pounds 20 are being quoted. The popularity of inflatables has also caught the attention of the Health and Safety Executive which has issued a sombre document entitled New Guidance On Inflatable Bouncing Devices, after a flurry of minor accidents. Insurance rates for operators have risen accordingly. In spite of these rumblings of pessimism, both manufacturers and hirers remain outwardly confident that the industry's expansion can be maintained. 'We've got hundreds of different types of inflatables, not just castles,' said Mr Brian Turner, managing director of Bee-Tee inflatable products, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Bouncy castles and other inflatables were imported from the US during the 1970s, mainly for use in fairgrounds. The past decade, however, has seen the reduction in size of inflatables and the development of what Mr Turner calls 'a cottage industry' of producers and hirers. While some insiders admit to a degree of saturation in the bouncy castle end of the market, the specialist larger inflatable business continues to grow. 'Companies and organisations are continually looking for something different to both entertain clients and advertise themselves,' said Mr Mark Shears, general manager at Jumbo Inflatables, which supplies personalised bouncy inflatables for between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 3,000. A leading building society recently bought a 30-ft high Egyptian pyramid-style castle, British Gas an inflatable oil rig, and a Scandinavian shipping group a bouncy cruise liner. And while there may be an air of deflation over one side of the market, there is great excitement at the latest development which involves Velcro-wearing participants hurling themselves at a wall of the same material - contained within an inflatable structure - and hoping to stick. 'This,' predicts Mr Shears, 'will be as big as bouncy castles.'</p>

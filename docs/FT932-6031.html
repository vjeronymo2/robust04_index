			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Rouble falls to Rbs1,024 to the dollar THE rouble fell through the Rbs1,000-to-the-dollar barrier yesterday as part of a relentless slide caused by inflationary expectations, loose monetary policy and the government's inability to push through a credible economic reform package, writes Leyla Boulton. The Russian currency yesterday fell to Rbs1,024 to the dollar on the official currency exchange from Rbs994 last week.</p>

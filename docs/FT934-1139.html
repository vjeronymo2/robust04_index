			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Blob on the landscape: The UK's falling share of world pop sales If you want to know what ails British pop music today, look at Mr Blobby, says Mr Chris Wright, chairman of the Chrysalis music and entertainment group. Mr Blobby, for the uninitiated, is a corpulent, spotty, rubber television character with a song which currently occupies top position in Britain's singles charts. Mr Wright believes the UK music industry has become obsessed with one-off hits such as Mr Blobby, rather than promoting bands long term so that they can succeed on a world stage. The statistics appear to bear out his concerns. British artists' share of world music sales has fallen steadily over the past four years, according to figures produced by the British Phonographic Industry, which represents UK music companies. In 1982, Mr Peter Scaping, BPI's research director, estimates UK artists accounted for about 25 per cent of worldwide music sales. In 1989, the figure was 23 per cent. Last year it was 18 per cent. The decline in UK market share has occurred worldwide. In the US, album sales by UK artists fell from 19.6 per cent of the market in 1989 to 14.5 per cent last year. In Europe, including the UK, British artists' albums accounted for 29.8 per cent of sales last year, compared with 35 per cent in 1989. The UK has produced a string of international artists over the three decades since the 1960s, from Cliff Richard, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to Elton John and Boy George. But there have been few new British successes since the early 1980s. George Michael, one of the more recent UK artists to attract an international following, is currently mired in a protracted legal dispute with Sony, his record company - although in his case he alleges that it is Sony's US executives who have failed to back his musical development while its UK managers have supported him. Mr Wright argues that the UK music industry's concentration on the success of single songs has made the local charts more volatile. Because many groups have not built up a substantial body of music or customer loyalty, they tend to disappear when their hits drop out of the charts. This has reduced the credibility of the UK charts overseas, Mr Wright says. 'There was a stage when you could go to America or Germany and say that someone was number one in England and people would say 'they must be good'. Now nobody in America or Germany cares what's number one in England. They say: 'So what? The last 20 people who were number one in England we never heard of again.'' The industry's defenders argue against reading too much into the worldwide market share statistics. These figures are volatile, they say, and could change suddenly if a few new UK artists emerged. Mr Rupert Perry, BPI chairman and UK chief executive of EMI Music, prefers to concentrate on the overall benefit British music continues to bring to the domestic economy. Visible exports of UK music, in the form of compact discs, cassettes and vinyl records, have grown from Pounds 86.2m in 1987 to Pounds 141.9m in 1989 to Pounds 211.9m last year. Imports have, however, also grown steadily throughout that period. While the UK had a positive balance of trade of Pounds 72m last year, this was slightly down on the 1990 figure of Pounds 74.5m and the Pounds 72.3m recorded in 1991. Exports of CDs and cassettes represent, however, only a small proportion of the UK's earnings from music. More important are the industry's invisible exports, which include royalties and income from performances. The BPI estimates that UK artists' invisible earnings rose from Pounds 450m in 1989 to Pounds 550m in 1992. Mr Perry accepts that the worldwide market share figures might be a sign that invisible earnings from music could turn down in future years; royalty earnings, for example, include the exploitation of the rich back catalogue that British musicians have produced over the years. Fewer UK artists in charts around the world today could translate into lower royalty earnings in the future. Mr Perry accepts that the UK charts have become more volatile, but adds that the same trend is now apparent elsewhere. He says the fragmentation of the UK market, with the proliferation of different musical genres, has also made it more difficult for groups to make an international impact. Different musical forms attract relatively small groups of consumers with insufficient mass to provide bands with large-scale sales. An additional reason for the decline in the UK's worldwide market share, Mr Perry says, is the increased popularity of local artists in markets around the world. Some in the industry attribute the rise of local artists to the revival of nationalism in Europe and elsewhere. Mr Martin Mills, managing director of the music company Beggar's Banquet, also points to the increasing success of American rock groups such as Nirvana. He says: 'For a long time, American bands didn't export very well. Rap still doesn't export very well. But the Americans have become much better at it than they used to be. I think there's as much musical vitality in this country as there used to be. But the other side are doing it much better than they used to.' Mr Perry adds that satellite television has helped increase the popularity of US rock acts in regions such as south-east Asia. Some critics in the industry argue that the technical expertise of UK musicians has declined, aided by the punk wave and its celebration of playing instruments badly. But even Mr Wright, who this year started a new label called Echo after selling Chrysalis' recording interests to Thorn EMI, believes there is as much musical expertise and proficiency in the UK today as in previous decades. What some British groups lack, he says, is an understanding of how the music industry operates and how to market themselves. He adds: 'American musicians, however good they are, think that they have to behave like businessmen. English musicians think talent's enough. They think they're degrading themselves by talking to people in the music trade.'</p>

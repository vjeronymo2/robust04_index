			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, March 31 (CTK) -- Parliamentary  representatives of Vietnam and the Czech Republic are reviewing  economic and trade agreements before Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec's visit to Vietnam, Vietnamese deputies told CTK.    A Czech parliamentary delegation is currently on a four day  visit to Vietnam, led by parliament chairman Milan Uhde.    The need to update existing agreements has arisen from the  Czech Republic having undergone substantive changes in economy  and foreign trade, a subject discussed with the Vietnamese side  by Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy during his  visit to Vietnam last November.    An agreement is being drawn up on settling the Vietnamese  debt worth 92,3 million XTR (interchangeable rubles) and $7.4  million.    Vietnamese deputies agreed with the Czech proposal that  bilateral agreements on double taxation and the protection of  investments be signed, Czech deputy Jan Krycer said, adding that  use might be made of the knowledge and expertise of the  Vietnamese who had received Czech training and worked in the  Czech Republic.</p>

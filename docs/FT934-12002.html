			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: A game of not-so-happy families  -A dispute at a top Indian tyre manufacturer A LEADING Indian businessman has turned to the courts in a long-running battle with his son for control of his flagship company. Mr Raunaq Singh, who is 71, is fighting his eldest son, Mr Onkar Kanwar, for control of Apollo Tyres, a top tyre manufacturer, founded by Mr Singh. Mr Singh, company chairman, this week filed a suit in the Delhi High Court to block a recent bid by the Apollo board to transfer some of hisexecutive powers to Mr Kanwar, who is managing director. The dispute at Apollo is one of a spate of family rows which have recently erupted at family-owned Indian groups. Such arguments are not unusual since families generally hold wealth in common, creating many opportunities for squabbles between fathers and their sons and heirs. However, the onset of economic liberalisation has added a sense of urgency to these quarrels because increasing competition is forcing companies to make difficult decisions rapidly. Mr Singh has taken his fight into the open and hired a high-profile lawyer - Mr P. Chidambaram, a former commerce minister - to plead his case. Mr Singh said yesterday: 'I'm a self-made man. My son has been misbehaving. I have to deal with it.' Mr Kanwar has limited his public comments to conciliatory remarks. His staff said he was unavailable for comment yesterday. The dispute dates back to the mid-1980s when Mr Singh became increasingly active in business organisations. He served as president for the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Day-to-day control of Apollo passed to Mr Kanwar, who turned a poorly performing company into the biggest profit-earner in the Indian tyre industry. Under his de facto leadership sales grew from Rs1.46bn (Dollars 46m) in 1987 to Rs5.1bn in the year to March 1993, while net profits jumped from almost nothing to R210m. Mr Singh was not unhappy with his eldest son's performance but, with four other sons' futures to consider, he tried to reassert his authority. The dispute became so bitter that managers and directors representing institutional shareholders became increasingly involved in trying to keep the peace between father and son. The family jointly holds about 19 per cent of the equity; the rest is held by outside shareholders. The institutions have quietly sided with Mr Kanwar, whom they respect for his business skill and his strategy of focusing on tyres instead of diversifying into other industries. Mr Singh favours diversification - the traditional strategy of Indian business families. Mr Singh has gone to great lengths to try and turn opinion in his favour. This summer, he accused Mr Kanwar of infringing the Companies Act and engaging in questionable financial dealings including making a Rs5m loan to Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of last year's Bombay securities market scandal. Mr Kanwar denied the claims. Matters came to a head after a board meeting on September 10. Although the meeting began with Mr Singh in the chair and Mr Kanwar present, both men agreed to withdraw when the discussion moved to dividing responsibilities between father and son. The directors agreed to vest formally day-to-day control of the company in Mr Kanwar's hands, including powers over all Apollo's bank dealings. Mr Singh was given charge of 'diversification'. When he saw the minutes, Mr Singh said responsibility for 'diversification' was a 'mockery' in a company which his son was committed to not diversifying. In his suit, Mr Singh calls on the court to scrap the decisions the board took in his absence and postpone the next board meeting, due on Friday, until the matter is resolved.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Sweet and golden There is a theory, in the arcane subject of matching food and wine, that a region's own liquid produce generally goes best with its solid (edible) matter. It seems rather tenuous to me. Whisky may be delicious with haggis and Ribera del Duero with the pitifully short-limbed milk-fed lamb eaten in that part of Spain, but gin with jellied eels? Bandol with bouillabaisse? We could discuss this fascinating subject for many weeks, and certainly the wines that go best with foie gras are in general produced in regions where ducks and geese are never allowed to be peckish. Because foie gras is so rich, it tends to make all but the most sumptuous red wine taste rather thin and puny, whereas a sweet, golden liquid can seem just the job - especially when the foie gras is served with something sweet as it so often is. The south-west is not just France's centre for foie gras production, but also for her sweet wines: Sauternes most notably but also Monbazillac and, from further into foie gras territory, moelleux (sweet) versions of Jurancon and Pacherenc du Vic-Bihl. These last two are often easier and more refreshing to drink young (ie in single-figure prices per bottle) and in my experience go particularly well with foie gras. Try Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, Lea &amp; Sandeman of London SW10 and, of course, the determinedly francophile Nicolas shops in London for examples of these appellations. On the opposite side of the hexagone both foie gras and some sweet white wine to drink with it can be found in Alsace - although it can be devilishly difficult to tell from the label just how sweet an Alsace Vendange Tardive or Selection de Grains Nobles actually is. Many less expensive Alsace wines without these riper-sounding words on the label are actually made quite sweet enough to drink with foie gras. Rolly Gassmann from Bibendum, London NW1, Schoffitt from Oddbins and Adnams, and Faller from O W Loeb, traditional independent merchants and now Oddbins spring to mind. For a wide range of Alsace wines, La Vigneronne of London SW7 and Wine Rack are hard to beat.</p>

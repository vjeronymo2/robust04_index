			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the current visit to Indonesia by  Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh, KOMPAS says Indonesia has never  doubted where the cordial bilateral relations would lead to,  because in the past few years, the trade volume has continued to  climb steadily. Indonesia's exports to Vietnam in 1993 stood at  U.S. $165 million while its imports were at U.S. $32.45 million.  However, KOMPAS also notes that if the Vietnamese leader's visit  is aimed at holding talks on the refugee and continental shelf  issues, we can understand the urgent nature of these issues  because the Indonesian Government plans to develop Galang island  [refugee detention center], located in the south of Singapore,  into an industrial zone in parallel with the Batam island  industrial zone.    Meanwhile, PELITA believes that the Vietnamese president's  visit to Indonesia reflects the increasingly close bilateral  relations. The visit also reflects the imminent entry of Vietnam  into the ASEAN regional grouping. Since Vietnam withdrew its  troops from Cambodia, resulting in the termination of conflicts  in that country, Hanoi's stand has been viewed favorably by  ASEAN, whose policy is to create security, peace, and stability  in Southeast Asia. Since that time, Vietnam has consistently  reiterated its desire to join ASEAN and now it is only a matter  of time for that country to do so.    BERITA YUDHA says no ASEAN countries have any political  objection to Vietnam's desire to join the regional grouping. At  present, Vietnam, even Laos, has been involved in several ASEAN  activities. The only problem is Vietnam's economic system, which  is different from that of ASEAN countries. Therefore, Vietnam  must also make some adjustments.</p>

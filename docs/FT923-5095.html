			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Japan likely to meet car parts pledge JAPANESE carmakers are likely to fulfil their promise to buy US parts because of the North America free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico and Canada and higher than expected demand at home and abroad, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In January the carmakers proposed buying Dollars 19bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in US parts in the fiscal year starting April 1994. 'Out of the proposed target of Dollars 19bn, purchase for use at their US units will account for the greater part,' said Shinji Moriyuki, of the Daiwa Institute of Research. For cars to qualify for tariff-free trade within Nafta they will have to contain at least 62.5 per cent of parts procured from within the region. Out of the Dollars 19bn target, only Dollars 4bn is likely to be for US parts imported into Japan.</p>

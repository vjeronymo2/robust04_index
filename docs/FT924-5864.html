			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Court extends O &amp; Y protection AN Ontario bankruptcy court last night approved a motion by Olympia &amp; York Developments to extend the period the developer is protected from creditors in order to allow time for a debt restructuring plan to be negotiated, Reuter reports. It ordered the stay of protection to be extended to February 1 from December 30, and the dates creditors will vote on O&amp;Y's proposed plan to between January 11 and 15 from November 25 to 30. O&amp;Y and its creditors are still working on developing a plan to restructure about CDollars 8.6m (USDollars 6.82m) in debts on its Canadian assets. A new plan is now scheduled to be presented to the court by December 14.

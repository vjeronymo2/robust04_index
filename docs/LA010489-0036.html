			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEYNESS  </P> <P> Prof. Laurence Goldstein's lament ("Ground Down by High-Rise Fever," Editorial  Page, Dec. 24), about the disappearance of the old-fashioned homeyness of a  city, is easy to sympathize with. Others may see beauty in endless towers and  little else. Thus, I recall a lady's remark as she confronted the venerable  skyscraper in New York, the Woolworth Building. She exclaimed, "My! How  heavenly!" Not all would agree. Be that as it may, I offer one small  suggestion; more greenery to the scenery, please!  </P> <P> JOSEPH P. KRENGEL  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

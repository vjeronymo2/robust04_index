			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS VETO PAYING FOR SOUND WALL IN TOLUCA LAKE  </P> <P> Toluca Lake residents who have been clamoring for a Ventura Freeway sound wall  have resoundingly voted against paying for it themselves, Los Angeles officials  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The project had been viewed as a potential precedent-setter. Several other  neighborhoods are considering paying for their own noise-deadening walls.  </P> <P> But City Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area, said Tuesday that  the mail vote of 104 to 78 against the resident-financed wall "is the end of it  as far as I'm concerned."  </P> <P> Residents along the north side of the freeway between Clybourn Avenue and  Cahuenga Boulevard would have been assessed from $4,000 to $24,000 each for the  $2.1-million project. Assessments were based on distance from the freeway and  the size of each parcel.  </P> <P> Had they gone ahead with the project, the state Department of Transportation  eventually would have reimbursed them.  </P> <P> Caltrans has designated the 3/4-mile-long stretch of freeway in Toluca Lake as  qualifying for a sound wall paid for by the state, officials say.  </P> <P> But 220 other neighborhoods in the state also meet minimum standards for sound  walls.  </P> <P> Neighborhoods are ranked according to the severity of the noise, the cost of  building a particular wall, the projected noise decrease and the number of  homes affected.  </P> <P> At the present rate of construction, the Toluca Lake wall would be built in 15  to 20 years, according to Caltrans engineer William Minter.  </P> <P> State law requires that Caltrans reimburse cities or residents that build a  wall once the project reaches the top of the state priority list.  </P> <P> Although the assessments could have been paid over 15 years, many residents  complained at a recent neighborhood meeting that they lived on fixed incomes  and could not afford the payments.  </P> <P> Gil Farias of the city Public Works Department, which conducted the poll, said  some residents were concerned that the assessment lien would make it difficult  to refinance their properties.  </P> <P> "But the main feeling I got is that they feel the state should pay for it,"  Farias said.  </P> <P> Of the 206 residents who would have been within the assessment district, 182 --  or 88% -- cast ballots.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLUB M: A MENU-VENUE MIX;  </P> <P> ITALIAN RESTAURANT SERVES UP BANDS AT NIGHT  </P> <P> Each evening, shortly after 9, beer replaces red wine, and the lasagna may be  done for the night. The dinner crowd gives way to the dance crowd. Canoga  Park's Mancini's Restaurant, an Italian eatery, becomes Club M, the West  Valley's new home of live music for almost any appetite.  </P> <P> Sample the menu: Sundays -- ballroom dancing, big band music. Mondays -- Dead  Head Night. Tuesdays -- jam sessions. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays -- rock  'n' roll. Thursdays -- Top 40.  </P> <P> "The competition with Italian restaurants is so thick," said Dennis Mancini,  "that I had to find another way to entice people." He has owned the restaurant  since 1970 and got his liquor license in 1988.  </P> <P> Mancini opened the club in January, bringing in Matthew Smyrnos -- who has  contacts with L.A. bands -- to book entertainment. The first month was "a  disaster," Smyrnos recalled. "We'd get five or 10 people a night. I hated it."  </P> <P> The club raised the cover price to $7, then lowered it to $5, and briefly  contemplated no admission charge at all. (The current cover is $3 during the  week, $5 on weekends.)  </P> <P> Finally, business picked up. Smyrnos attributed the turnaround to the  introduction of new sound and lighting equipment and other renovations;  altogether, Mancini spent $230,000 to remodel the restaurant. Soon bands that  were reluctant to play at a restaurant far from the Hollywood strip, or even  the East Valley, began signing up for frequent gigs. They earn a fixed  percentage of the gate.  </P> <P> "We've played at FM Station and the Palomino, and the equipment at Club M is  the best we've come across," said Greg Herman, guitarist for the Valley-based  psychedelic group Pur'p'l Tur't'lz. "Plus, it doesn't have the L.A. club  atmosphere, where everyone is up-tight, and it makes us play a lot more  relaxed. There's no attitude there."  </P> <P> Which is exactly the way Mancini and Smyrnos envisioned the club -- an escape  from the strip scene, yet still a venue for the best possible rock 'n' roll  talent. The square dance floor is surrounded by several dozen tables, and there  are plenty of good views of the stage. Among other local bands that have  performed there: Tuff, Captain Cardiac &amp; the Coronaries, and the Dead  Center. "There are none of the hassles, like parking, that you get in  Hollywood," Smyrnos said. "Down there, you'll spend $10 to $20 a night, and  have to deal with the whole scene."  </P> <P> Still, is the club too secluded from Hollywood and the East Valley to draw  enough customers, and will the record industry show up to check out new acts?  </P> <P> "We're surrounded by people in this area," Smyrnos responded. "That's not even  counting Simi Valley, which is 10 minutes away, and that place is dead. Kids  from there come here."  </P> <P> Similarly, he said, the club has held several showcase events attended by  industry representatives.  </P> <P> In 1988, another Canoga Park club, Michael Fell's Industry, tried to make it in  the West Valley but closed about six months later. Smyrnos sees no parallel.  "They were expensive, and we've been able to establish a nightclub without  losing the aspect of being a restaurant. We still have that base."  </P> <P> Smyrnos sees the club's versatility as its chief asset. On Wednesdays, it holds  a "No Top 40 Junk" night for people tired of the familiar radio music. "We're  not restricted to a specific format," he said. "Take a place like the Country  Club, which has to rely on speed metal shows."  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Club M started a new Sunday night series of ballroom dancing.  Couples, mostly in their 50s and 60s, danced to the sounds of Patsy Cline's  "Crazy" and Frank Sinatra's "Chicago."  </P> <P> "We don't do that disco stuff," said Barbara Rose of Encino. "We like to do the  swing and the cha-cha. And there just aren't that many places in the Valley  where older people can go dancing. Most of the places have small dance floors."  </P> <P> Two nights later, the Geniuses, a blues/jazz band, jammed before about 50  people -- 200 is the club's capacity. The crowd was much younger.  </P> <P> "These are the people we're going after the most," Smyrnos said. "They want the  rock 'n' roll."  </P></p>

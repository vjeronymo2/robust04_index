			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dividends to fund restructuring A PORTION of dividends paid by companies in which Olympia &amp; York is a shareholder will be set aside to help the ailing property developer fund its restructuring costs, a Toronto court was told yesterday. O&amp;Y also said the company expected to finalise audited accounts for the fiscal year ended last January within the next day or two. They are expected to include a write-down of at least CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) on the value of its real estate holdings. The allocation of general, administrative and restructuring (GAR) expenses among the lenders and the Reichmann family which owns O&amp;Y has been the focal point of creditors' attention in recent weeks. These costs have totalled about CDollars 9m since O&amp;Y filed for court protection in Canada in May. Under proposals filed by O&amp;Y and its creditors, about CDollars 5m in dividends due from the newsprint maker Abitibi-Price this month will be used for O&amp;Y's general, administrative and restructuring costs. O&amp;Y owns 82 per cent of Abitibi's shares. A contribution may also be made by Carena, a Canadian property group in which O&amp;Y holds a minority stake. Carena's main subsidiary is Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer. O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi, Carena and in Gulf Canada Resources, which last week halted dividend payments, are pledged as collateral on some of its CDollars 13.5bn debt. An O&amp;Y lawyer said in an interview that the company's reliance on dividend income for its restructuring should have no impact on the dividend policies of Abitibi, Gulf Canada and Carena. O&amp;Y estimates that its dividend income this month alone will be be CDollars 15 to CDollars 18m, several times more than its GAR requirements. Lenders to specific O&amp;Y projects and holders of marketable securities have so far paid the bulk of the restructuring costs. Part of the costs to be incurred over the next few months will also be met through sales of about CDollars 70m worth of unencumbered assets, such as parcels of land and the corporate jet. Mr Steven Sharpe, an O&amp;Y lawyer, told the court yesterday that the company was anxious to put the GAR issue behind it so that it could have 'some quiet uninterrupted time' to negotiate its debt restructuring proposals which are due to be presented to lenders by mid-July.</p>

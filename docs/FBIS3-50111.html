			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 January carries in  its regular five-minute newscast four reports on the fighting in  the republic.    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "although  the attacks of the Chetnik and Ustasha forces have entered their  fifth day, we can already say that their offensive is a total  fiasco. Great losses in their ranks have taken their toll,  although this morning they are perpetrating combined  tank-infantry attacks on the southern sector of the front, on  the entire stretch from Bradici to Nekolje. The fighting is  fierce, but the knights of the 201st Maglaj [Brigade] are  holding their own. The aggressor army is taking out its rage on  the civilian population. Howitzer shells of all caliber, mortar  and tank shells are raining down on Maglaj. Four people, two of  them children, have been wounded in the past 24 hours. The  material damage is also great."    An unidentified correspondent from the 4th Corps information  service says that "in the past 24 hours, the free part of Mostar  Commune has been the site of the fiercest shelling registered in  the past month. The Ustasha [words indistinct] criminal policy  with large caliber shells, and destroyed the densely populated  residential areas. They fired over 160 howitzer, tank, and  mortar shells at the parts of Mostar controlled by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps. The Ustasha artillery  targeted the Mostar districts of (?Zelic), (?Padina),  (?Pazoric), and (?Ceric), while the enemy used antiaircraft  weapons and snipers against the southern parts of the city.  There was no peace on the northern part of the Mostar Commune.  The Ustashas fired around 40 shells from all types of artillery  weapons at this region. Potoci, (?Krivac), and [name  indistinct] were targeted. In the south of the Mostar Commune,  15 120-mm mortar shells were fired at Blagaj, while five 120-mm  mortar shells landed on Svacici. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  reconnaissance units have discovered that the Ustasha forces are  again using captured civilians to dig trenches and reinforce  their positions. The demarcation lines in the 4th Corps  operational zone are strong and stable."    Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "strong  Chetnik forces continue to regroup on the Brcko front.  Concentrations and movements of enemy tanks were again sighted  last night on the central part of the front, just outside Donja  Brka. Four truckloads of manpower have arrived in the same area.  Movements of the enemy's armored vehicles have also been  sighted in the areas of Sumari and Delina Ravna. Overnight, the  enemy has been using chain saws to clear the undergrowth and  make room for his tanks. The enemy's reconnaissance groups were  intensely active last night in the areas of Cadjavci and  Omerbegovaca."    The studio announcer cites a report by the 4th Motorized  Brigade information service and says that "there is some  sporadic artillery fire on the Ilidza front, while Hrasnica,  Sokolovici, [name indistinct], and Butmir are the scene of small  arms' provocations."</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Electronics sector warned of 27,000 job losses The Scottish electronics industry, which employs 45,000 people, has been warned that employment could fall 40 per cent to only 27,000 by 1997. In a report by Monitor, the US consultants, the industry is described as structurally weak, poorly integrated and 'misaligned'. Senior members of the industry yesterday launched the Scottish Electronics Forum, aimed at tackling its serious weaknesses and uniting for the first time indigenous Scottish electronics companies and the multinational companies which have plants in Scotland. It has agreed what it calls a 'road map' for addressing immediate problems and building a more robust, sustainable industry. The Scottish electronics industry is often seen as a success story. It accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports and about 35 per cent of all personal computers and workstations made in Europe come from Scotland. IBM's personal computer plant is at Greenock. Other multinationals include Motorola (with two plants), Compaq, NCR, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Digital (two plants), NEC and OKI. Yet as Mr John Ward, IBM's resident director in Scotland and chairman of the forum, pointed out yesterday, the industry leans heavily to production, which accounts for 70 per cent of output. Only 6 per cent of employees are in research and development - mostly in the relatively closed defence sector  -and 3 per cent in marketing. Most Scottish plants are purely manufacturing operations, making products designed and marketed elsewhere. The exceptions include NCR, which runs its worldwide automated teller machine operations from Dundee, and Hewlett-Packard, which has a telecoms operation at South Queensferry, near Edinburgh. Indigenous companies play a tiny role in the industry. Mimtec, which has built its second plant close to IBM, and Fullarton Computer Industries, part of Laird Group, are among the very few sizeable Scottish components suppliers. Only 12 per cent of components used by the industry in Scotland are made there, while Scottish-based companies account for only 11.5 per cent of Scotland's Pounds 5bn a year output of electronics products. The Monitor report, commissioned by Scottish Enterprise, the development body, says the industry is misaligned partly because of its dependence on manufacturing when the global trend is to software production, while miniaturisation and greater on-chip integration threaten traditional assembly. The manufacturing base will face increased competition as companies trim capacity and look to lower-cost countries as a source of supply. Indigenous companies are far too few and weak to fill the gaps that would be left by any departing multinationals, the report says. Growth in Scotland's electronics industry has tailed off. After compound growth in the 1980s of 16 per cent a year, output has been flat since 1989 and the numbers employed have fallen by 1 per cent since then. The forum has 30 members, including the main multinationals and about 15 from indigenous companies, although neither Mimtec nor Fullarton is among them. It will operate through several sub-groups, each focusing on a different issue, and will seek to improve the industry's competitiveness and support indigenous companies, trying to persuade multinationals to try to source more components locally, and encouraging local companies to try to meet their demands. But the problems it is tackling have largely defied solution in the past decade. As one Scottish manufacturer said yesterday: 'The weak entrepreneurial culture here is a problem that is not going to disappear overnight.'</p>

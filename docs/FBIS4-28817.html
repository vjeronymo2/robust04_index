			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- A revised insurance law to  allow insurance brokers to operate in Japan will require such  brokers to have the ability to meet claims arising from the  products they sell, finance ministry sources said Saturday (11  June).    Other points in a draft of the revised insurance law are a  ban on insurance companies acting as brokers and a requirement  that brokers give the best advice possible when signing up  customers for insurance products, the sources said.    Insurance brokers sell insurance products on behalf of  insurance companies. The brokerage system is widespread in the  United States but in Japan insurance companies sell their own  products directly.    In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the US is  demanding that insurance brokers be allowed in Japan as the  Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister,  proposed two years ago.    Under the revised law, insurance brokers will be licensed  through an exam to be conducted by an association of such  brokers to be set up under the jurisdiction of the Finance  Ministry.    The law will authorize the ministry to inspect brokers and  to  cancel the license of any broker found guilty of wrongdoing.    Insurance industry officials say introduction of brokers  could lead to a major shakeout in the insurance industry,  causing insurance firms to compete against each other on the  strength of their products rather than on the ability of their  sales staffs.    The Insurance Council is slated to hold a hearing Tuesday to  obtain the view of foreign insurance companies on how to revise  the insurance law.    The Finance Ministry is now working on revising the law and  the revision is expected to take place in fiscal 1996 at the  earliest.</p>

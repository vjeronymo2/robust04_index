			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 5 DIE, 127 HURT AS WORST RIOTS IN 7 YEARS SWEEP MOROCCO CITY  </P> <P> Thousands of rioters burned down a hotel and attacked vehicles, shops and banks  in the ancient city of Fez in Morocco's worst violence in seven years.  </P> <P> At least five people were killed and 127 were injured in the rioting, which  flared during a one-day general strike Friday and continued Saturday, the  official news agency MAP reported.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 demonstrators, some armed with chains, iron bars and knives,  rampaged through the narrow alleys of the old walled city of Fez -- one of  North Africa's most popular tourist centers -- and into the modern part of the  town, burning and looting.  </P> <P> On Saturday, protesters set fire to a police station and several vehicles in  Fez, but order was restored by nightfall, authorities said.  </P> <P> Trade union sources said there were also disturbances in the northern towns of  Tangier, Kenitra and Sidi Slimane.  </P> <P> It was the worst street violence in Morocco since January, 1984, when more than  100 people died in bread riots.  </P> <P> MAP said several hotels in Fez, 90 miles east of Rabat, were set ablaze, but  there were no casualties among staff or guests. Rescue teams plucked some from  the flames.  </P> <P> One hotel, the Merinides, a 200-room landmark on a hill overlooking the old  city, was burned down.  </P> <P> Friday's strike was called by Morocco's two trade union federations. The unions  are demanding an increase in wages from a minimum of $130 to $260 a month.  </P> <P> The government denied reports from a trade union spokesman that 20 to 30 people  were killed when security forces and troops in armored vehicles fired on  demonstrators Friday.  </P> <P> MAP said troops used tear gas and fired warning shots to break up the riots,  which erupted when students attacked buses driven by soldiers replacing  striking drivers.  </P> <P> Police arrested 110 looters, including a group carrying a safe containing  $75,000.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SUPPLEMENTS ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR BALANCED NUTRITION OF  A GOOD DIET  </P> <P> Are you among the millions of Americans who start each day with a vitamin pill?  If so, you may do it despite knowing that your diet probably provides all the  nutrients essential for good health, and that even the best supplement is no  substitute for a well-planned diet.  </P> <P> The National Research Council recently released a wide-ranging report on many  topics related to diet and health. The report confirmed the conclusion that  vitamins are not necessary for many people. According to evidence, daily  vitamin or mineral supplements are neither harmful nor beneficial to the  population at large.  </P> <P> This issue made headlines throughout the country, drowning out other aspects of  the report such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and osteoporosis. Yet despite  all the media coverage, our guess is that American behavior has changed very  little. And for understandable reasons. A single vitamin and mineral supplement  is, after all, a bit of low-cost nutritional insurance for any of us, and  particularly useful at special times -- during infancy and early childhood,  pregnancy, lactation, for the elderly whose caloric intake may be limited and  for many people who are ill.  </P> <P> While we have a good idea of who would benefit most from supplements, we know  little about the relationship between use and need. But we are learning. As  part of a national survey conducted in 1986, the National Center for Health  Statistics, along with the Food and Drug Administration, collected data showing  who is taking supplements and what they are taking.  </P> <P> In each family interviewed over a six-month period, information about  supplement use was obtained for one adult 18 or over and one child age two to  six. (The findings don't include pregnant and nursing mothers, groups of  particular interest.)  </P> <P> During 1986, over one-third of all U.S. adults took vitamin and mineral  supplements. Factors associated with usage included sex, race and age. Among  adults, heaviest users were white women, ages 45 to 64. At the other extreme,  black males 65 and older were least likely to use a vitamin and mineral  product. Income was a great divider too. While only 28% of those with family  incomes under $7,000 took supplements, approximately 45% of those whose incomes  were over $40,000 reported using them.  </P> <P> Young children were also big consumers, averaging 43% among three- to  six-year-olds, with heavier use at the younger end. And there were differences  by race. While 45% of white children took a supplement, among the black  children the figure was only 30%. And here, income was an even bigger factor.  Just 23% of children ages two to six in families earning less than $7,000 took  supplements, compared to 50% of those whose incomes were at least $40,000.  Higher education levels of adults were also associated with more widespread use  by both adults and children.  </P> <P> The survey collected information about types of supplements used. Regardless of  how many supplements they took, roughly 40% of adults took multivitamins. For  more than 90% of children, the supplement of choice was a multivitamin.  </P> <P> Of the single vitamins taken, Vitamin C was identified most often, by about 31%  of adults. Women were more likely than men to take mineral supplements,  explained partly by the more frequent use of calcium by older women. Iron  ranked second, and was the mineral consumed most often both by adult men and  young children.  </P> <P> Quantitatively, many Americans take much more than the Recommended Dietary  Allowances (RDAs) in the supplements they consume. The average daily intake of  Vitamin C for men was 250% of the RDA, while that for Vitamin B-12, was 300%.  Among women, Vitamin E and B-12 intakes were highest, 250% of the RDA for each,  followed by thiamine (225%) and riboflavin (217%). Ten percent of supplement  users consumed an average of 15 times the RDA for no less than six vitamins,  including E, C, thiamine, riboflavin, Vitamin B-6 and B-12. For 5% of these men  and women, average intake of thiamine, riboflavin, B-6 and B-12 totaled over 30  times the RDA. But why people take such huge amounts is unclear.  </P> <P> Use of individual minerals was not as extreme. In general, average intakes were  less than 200% of the RDAs. And among young children, average intake for most  individual nutrients was between 100 and 200% of recommended levels.  </P> <P> These data illustrate on a broader scale what smaller studies have shown  repeatedly: Many Americans take vitamin and mineral supplements that go well  beyond the one-a-day "nutritional insurance" plan. How do supplements  complement the diets of those who use them? What possible hazardous effects  might befall people who continue to take massive amounts of single supplements?  </P> <P> The fact that such important questions remain unanswered should convince any  sensible person that taking supplements far in excess of recommended amounts is  taking a risk without benefit.  </P> <P> Don't Choose Breakfast Cereals Solely for the Vitamin Content  </P> <P> Question: A TV commercial I saw for a breakfast cereal showed that you'd have  to eat boxes and boxes of other cereals to get all the vitamins you receive  from one box of their brand. Should I choose my cereal on the basis of vitamin  content?  </P> <P> Answer: No. The product you describe sounds like what we call "a vitamin pill  in a cereal bowl." That is, it contains 100% of the U.S. Recommended Dietary  Allowances for various vitamins and minerals. If you prefer the taste, fine.  But there's little reason to choose it on nutritional grounds.  </P> <P> Although the science of nutrition has expanded, we are far from creating  perfect nutrition in a pill (or in a cereal bowl, for that matter). There is  more to being well-nourished than simply meeting the day's need for vitamins  and minerals. For that we must depend on a varied diet stocked with fresh and  lightly processed foods.  </P> <P> Q: What causes severe food allergies?  </P> <P> A: Severe or mild, the mechanism for the development of allergies is the same.  It's also the same whether the offending substance comes from food or from  drugs, insect venom or poison.  </P> <P> Basically, it is an abnormal response to an antigen, usually a protein. In  susceptible individuals, initial exposure induces production of an antibody  called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. These antibodies then attach themselves  to certain types of cells in the body, setting the stage for the next encounter  with the offending antigen. When the substance containing this antigen is  consumed, it links onto the IgE antibodies attached to particular types of  cells, causing them to release large amounts of histamine and other substances.  </P> <P> These substances, in turn, make blood vessels expand and leak fluids into  surrounding tissues, prompting smooth muscles in the airways to contract.  Resulting symptoms vary in type and severity. In the extreme, life-threatening  anaphylactic reactions usually begin with a sensation of warmth, followed by  severe itching, often on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The  skin becomes flushed, hives may appear, the face may swell and breathing  becomes difficult.  </P> <P> Q: I read about a new type of vacuum-packaged prepared foods requiring  refrigeration. The article said that while these may taste better than  conventionally processed foods, they are potentially more of a health hazard.  The quality sounds superior. But how great is the risk?  </P> <P> A: Doubtless you are referring to what the French call sous-vide (literally  translated as "under vacuum") foods, a method widely used in Europe that is  gathering momentum here.  </P> <P> The process, used for a growing number of mixed dishes, involves placing fresh  ingredients in plastic pouches and vacuuming out air. Some manufacturers also  add either nitrogen or carbon dioxide to modify the atmosphere in the pouch.  The sealed container is then cooked under very precise conditions and  refrigerated. To prepare the food, you simply place it in a pot of boiling  water to reheat.  </P> <P> Since the food is subjected to neither the high heat of canning nor the very  low temperatures needed for freezing, damage to cell structures is minimized,  resulting in fresher flavor. However, the oxygen-free or nearly oxygen-free  environment provides an excellent arena for the growth of several bacteria that  can cause such serious forms of food poisoning as botulism, listeriosis and  Yersinia poisoning. The problem is that the temperatures used to process the  food are high enough to kill harmless organisms that produce unpleasant odors  signaling food spoilage.  </P> <P> Q: Every time I read a nutrition article that advises eating more "complex  carbohydrates," I wind up feeling frustrated, because I'm not sure what it  really means. Can you fill me in?  </P> <P> A: Common sources of complex carbohydrates in our diets are wheat, corn,  barley, rice, oats and potatoes. In the wheat kernel, the complex carbohydrates  include both digestible starch and indigestible fiber.  </P> <P> A more descriptive name for complex carbohydrates is polysaccharides, a term  that translates directly to "many sugars." And that is exactly what complex  carbohydrates are: many molecules of simple sugars linked together, sometimes  with an acid built into the structure. The structure of pectin, for instance,  includes two simple sugars, glucose and arabinose, and galacturonic acid as  well.  </P> <P> The way sugar molecules (and acids) are strung together determines the type of  carbohydrate formed, and thus its physical and chemical properties. Amylose,  the starch in such foods as wheat and corn, is made up of molecules of glucose  attached in straight chains. The human digestive system has enzymes that can  separate the glucose units so that they can be absorbed.  </P> <P> To experience this for yourself, chew a plain cracker longer than usual. The  sweetness that begins to develop is the result of enzymes breaking the starch  molecules down to their simple components. But if these same units are linked  in a more complicated way, as they are in cellulose, the body cannot pull them  apart. They are part of the fiber that travels through the body undigested.  </P> <P> Q: I'm an avid reader of ingredients lists and never cease to be amazed at what  I find. For instance, recently I noticed that frankfurters and luncheon meats  contain corn syrup. Then I became curious about just how much sweetener they  contain, but there was no way to tell from the ingredients list. I wonder if  you could provide the information.  </P> <P> A: They don't contain much. Frankfurters, bologna and similar products can  contain a maximum of 2% corn syrup by weight. That translates to just over half  a gram per ounce. To put that into more visual terms, a one-ounce slice of  bologna would contain about 1/8 teaspoon of corn syrup.  </P></p>

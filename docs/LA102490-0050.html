			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRASILJAZZ COVERS TWO CONTINENTS  </P> <P> It took Brasiljazz exactly one song to leave its adopted Latin roots and move  to fertile American jazz soil with a Charlie Parker-inspired rendition of Cole  Porter's "I Get a Kick Out of You" Monday night at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> On the third tune, it was back to Brazil. And so it went for most of the  hourlong opening set by this most interesting trio composed of singer Kevyn  Lettau, guitarist Peter Sprague and percussionist Michael Shapiro.  </P> <P> Just about everything about this group without bass or keyboard was far  different from the norm, and just about everything worked to the group's  advantage. Singer Lettau displayed a beautiful soprano that benefited from the  sparse sound created by her cohorts. Whether funky in a voice-and-drums  recitation of "Secret Code," a Latin-tinged tune composed by Sprague and  herself, or deliciously sultry in the ballad "Stairway to the Stars," Lettau  showed experience well beyond her obvious youth.  </P> <P> That same sense of accomplishment was evident in Sprague's consistently musical  accompaniment. A brilliant technician, the guitarist deftly backed Lettau with  finely constructed harmonies and spurred the action with inventive stretches of  improvised melody.  </P> <P> As a songwriter, he has come up with some gems, particularly in "Words and  Music," a delightful tune that expressed his own view of music's magical  properties.  </P> <P> The trio's great sense of dynamics was most impressive, with drummer Shapiro  demonstrating that powerful percussion need not be loud. His use of various  bells and whistles, along with brushes and hands on his oddly tuned kit, were  wonderfully effective.  </P> <P> Though the group had a certain affinity for Latin inclusions that left one  wanting more, it would have been a shame to remain in the South American vein  and deprive the audience of such rarely heard tunes as "All I Want" and "I'm  Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter." For Brasiljazz, which appears  Saturday night at Lunaria's, eclecticism works just fine. A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

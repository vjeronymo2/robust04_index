			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Murdoch and the law MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S latest trail of deals and manoeuvres has reopened some old questions. Britain's Labour party wants him referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, having branded his simultaneous expansion of News Corporation's satellite TV interests and the price war he has launched in the UK broadsheet newspaper market 'an affront to democracy'. However overexcited these comments may appear to those who have not, like Labour politicians, endured years of abuse from Mr Murdoch's titles, this renewed debate is of interest across the EC, where structures of media regulation are bending beneath the pressures of changing consumer taste and technological advance. In Britain, Mr Murdoch faces two complaints: that by cutting the price of The Times from 45p to 30p, News is aiming to kill off the rival Independent and that the expanded BSkyB (of which Mr Murdoch owns half) when added to his 35 per cent share of UK national newspaper sales, makes him too powerful. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a significant stake, last week launched a new 14-channel pay-TV service, and is forecast by some to overtake the terrestrial ITV commercial network in terms of revenues within the next three years. Predatory pricing Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, says he is watching with interest the newspaper price war that Mr Murdoch has also ignited in the tabloid sector. His office's definition of predatory pricing - the deliberate acceptance of losses in the short term with the intention of eliminating competition so that enhanced profits may be achieved in the long term - looks prima facie as if it may indeed apply to the battle between the loss-making Times and the struggling Independent. The OFT has recently been active in pursuing bus companies accused of predatory actions, but in examining the newspaper industry, it will also note how The Independent worked to ensure the demise of the Sunday Correspondent or, to take an earlier example, the lengths to which Associated Newspapers went to kill in its infancy Mr Robert Maxwell's rival to the London Evening Standard. Predatory behaviour, resulting in short-term losses, does not have to include a price war. The question of the concentration of media ownership and the related regulatory framework is more complex and important. What can be stated with confidence is that the law is outmoded. This imposes detailed restrictions upon the ability of newspaper companies to own more than 20 per cent of terrestrial television and radio (even local radio) companies and yet sets no limit on the ownership of satellite TV. Yawning gap In the press, there is no general law on concentration of ownership, although the 1973 Fair Trading Act requires that any merger involving circulations of more than 500,000 should trigger an MMC investigation. In practice, this has not impeded Mr Murdoch, who has twice argued that the only alternative to his purchases (of first The Times and The Sunday Times, then of Today) would have been the closure of newspapers, thus enabling ministers to waive the rules. The yawning gap in these arrangements, however, is the lack of guidance on what amounts to an unacceptable accumulation of power across the whole of the mass media. UK law recognises, in the case of the press, that these matters exceed in importance normal competition issues, since a democracy needs 'accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion'. The time has thus come for the UK authorities to wrestle again with this principle in the new media world that Mr Murdoch has done so much to develop. It would be wrong to prejudge Mr Murdoch's case, since the barriers to entry in satellite television are still lower than in terrestrial broadcasting. Equally, however, it is unreasonable that terrestrial ITV companies continue to face costly regulatory requirements, for example on the national origin of programmes, from which their satellite competitors are exempt. The most promising direction for change is to liberalise the over-regulated, rather than the converse, but a coherent approach is now a matter of urgency.</p>

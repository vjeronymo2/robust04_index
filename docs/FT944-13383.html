			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bass wanted Bass again stood out among brewers as a combination of yield buying and some finger crossing on the budget helped lift the shares 8 to 544p on turnover of 2.5m for a two-day advance of 12. There were signs yesterday that yield-hungry buyers were moving in ahead of Bass's traditional chunky final dividend. The 1993-94 results are due at the end of next month and analysts expect the final payment could be edged up to 15p a share. Bass is market leader with 23 per cent of UK beer sales, and yesterday tentative hopes for a reduction in beer duty in the November budget showed signs of gaining ground. However, stockmarket opinion here is polarised. Resilience of Vodafone stock, up a penny at 199p contrasted with losses in both BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, was attributed by marketmakers to strong support from Hoare Govett, the stockbroker. Hoare's telecoms team was said to have been promoting Vodafone shares on the view that the company will come up with a rapidly improving performance in Germany and following recent excellent figures from US cellular companies. The broker was said to have highlighted the expansion of Vodafone's E Plus subsidiary in Eastern Germany and its highly competitive tariff across the whole of Germany. Vodafone launched E Plus in May this year and is expected to cover 60 per cent of Germany by the end of the year. Hoare was said to have put a valuation of Dollars 1.3bn on E Plus. The bulls got the better of the long standing two-way pull in P&amp;0, pushing the shares up 8 to 602p in turnover of 2.6m following a major assessment of the company by UBS. The securities house reiterates its buy stance, pointing to strong yield and the 85 per cent of operating profits that arise from business other than cross channel ferries. According to UBS, P&amp;0 is the third highest yielding Footsie share. BTR was again the most actively traded Footsie share, gaining 1 to 302p in 16m of turnover which compared with 14m trades on Tuesday. Much of the activity stemmed from the exercise of 28m warrants at 288p each with substantial batches of the newly created shares said to have changed hands. The oil majors attracted solid support in the US overnight and again at the outset yesterday as institutions responded to the encouraging numbers from the US majors and the prospect of good third quarter numbers from Shell Oil this afternoon. Dealers said the market was looking for 'clean' profits in excess of Dollars 320m, against a comparable Dollars 239m, from Shell. Shell Transport moved up 6 to 700p, after turnover of 3.2m while BP settled 2 1/2 up at 413 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.3m. Mining group RTZ slipped 7 to 847p as Panmure Gordon reiterated its sell stance. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome shed 11 to 622p with traders saying that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which reiterated its negative stance on the company earlier in the week, had a sizeable sell order on its books. Meanwhile SmithKline Beecham improved 2 1/2 to 405 1/2 p in the 'A's as reports in the US press gave suggested that the purchase of drugs distributor DPS would go ahead as planned. There had been suggestions that the US Food and Drug Administration was concerned about the acquisition. Motor parts services group Kwik-Fit put on 2 to 151p on news of a Pounds 9.5m takeover which increases outlets numbers by more than a sixth to around 800. Among motor distributor, Cowie gained 7 to 212p with the shares bouncing from what analysts saw as an earlier oversold position. Prudential Corporation put on the best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 as the market responded positively to news of a 15 per cent upturn in worldwide new business figures. Prudential shares jumped 10, or 3.3 per cent, to 308p, on turnover of 4.8m. Elsewhere in life assurance stocks Legals edged up 5 to 433p. Lloyds Abbey Life, given a rough ride by the market in the run up to the SIB report, were heavily traded and settled 10 higher at 336p. Britannic edged up 3 to 407p, London and Manchester eased 2 to 318p and Refuge dipped a penny to 275p. United Friendly retreated 15 to 483p. In the composites area Commercial Union moved up 6 to 524p, as did General Accident, 556p. TSB was the second heaviest traded stock in the market after Smith New Court, the securities house bought a block of 5.7m shares at 210p and placed the majority at 212p. The recent big buyer of Standard Chartered made a series of fleeting appearances in the market, helping stabilise the shares which closed only a shade easier at 278p;turnover of 1.1m was well below recent levels. Dealers pointed to heavy options activity in HSBC whose shares moved up 4 1/2 to 699 1/2 p. Merchant bank SG Warburg took another tumble, falling 14 to 600p reflecting uncertainty across the range of both global bond and equity markets. Supermarket chain J. Sainsbury was weak early in the day with dealers saying Morgan Stanley had cut its forecast ahead of half-year figures next Wednesday. However, the shares rallied later to close 2 firmer at 386p.

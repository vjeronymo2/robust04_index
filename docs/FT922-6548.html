			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UN insolvency 'near unless members pay up' THE UNITED Nations will run out of cash by the end of this month unless member states substantially reduce their debts, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, warned last night. At Dollars 1.093bn, these exceed the entire regular budget for 1992. The arrears level, including peace-keeping expenses, has virtually doubled in the past six months, to Dollars 1.898bn, he said. In this period, the UN has mounted the peace-keeping operation in Yugoslavia, estimated to cost more than Dollars 600m, and its biggest-ever operation, in Cambodia, where the bill may exceed Dollars 2bn. Also, the UN General Assembly will meet today to consider the adoption of an additional assessment for peace-keeping in Colombia and El Salvador, estimated at Dollars 637m. Reflecting a trend of growing reliance on the UN since east-west divisions were largely healed, no fewer than 13 peace-keeping operations had been launched since 1989, equalling the total for the previous 45 years. The main cash contributors are in recession and none of the operations has been adequately funded. The UN has had repeatedly to rob Peter to pay Paul by borrowing among different accounts. Only 14 out of 175 member countries are fully paid up. The US now owes Dollars 555m for the regular budget and Dollars 308m for peace-keeping. Russia's arrears total Dollars 341m in the two categories and are unlikely to be reduced soon, given Moscow's financial problems. Mr Boutros Ghali is under pressure from Washington to cut costs to the bone and reduce staff. Morale in the UN secretariat is at an all-time low even as the organisation's prestige has soared. Adding to the staff's fears, McKinsey, the management consultancy, has quietly begun a study of UN administrative practices. This seems to be at the behest of Mr Dick Thornburgh, US former attorney-general and now in charge of administration and management in the secretariat.</p>

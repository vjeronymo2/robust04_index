			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Japanese computer makers fall below expected earnings JAPAN'S computer and semi-conductor makers yesterday reported worse-than-expected earnings for the fiscal year just ended. The parent companies of NEC, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric and Fujitsu announced falls in pre-tax profits ranging from 43.1 per cent to 68.6 per cent. They blamed the poor performance on a weak semiconductor market and, in particular, falling prices for the latest generation of memory chip, the 4Mbit, on which they may never recoup their investments. Sharp reported a smaller drop in profits - 11.9 per cent - although along with other makers of consumer products, it reported a fall in demand for audio-visual equipment. Most of the chip makers' factories are running at well below capacity. Toshiba, for example, produces about 300m of the 4Mbit chips, instead of the planned 500m each month. In the past year, the price of those chips has more than halved, to Y1,400 (Pounds 5.90) each. As a result, Japanese companies which have dominated the memory chip market in recent years, are cutting back on new semiconductor investment. NEC said the industry had been hit by global recession and falls in domestic capital expenditure and consumer spending. Fujitsu, the world's second largest computer manufacturer, is hoping for a 25 per cent rise in profits, to Y50bn. Mitsubishi Electric reported flat parent sales of heavy machinery, industrial products and automation equipment. Air-conditioners were the best-selling consumer line, but audio-visual equipment sales were weak.

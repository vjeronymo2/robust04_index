Robaina made this statement during his announcement of the  conference, which will bring together approximately 200 Cuban  exiles from diverse countries. Robaina also stressed that given  the difficult situation Cuba faces today, it is time to prevent  emigration from being a negative factor in the hands of others.    "This invitation is an opportunity for Cubans abroad, acting  in good faith, to express their logical concerns and hopes to  Cuba. There is no possibility for political manipulation, nor  space for meddling with hopes that are by nature the sole  concern of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland.  There is no room for doubt or speculation. This invitation does  not include counterrevolutionary organizations, nor does it  concern itself with the opinions of their kingpins."    Robaina added during the news conference, conducted to  announce the conference:    "In the bosom of the exile community there are today sectors  and organizations separate from the counterrevolution. These  concur in criticizing the hostile policies toward Cuba,  particularly, the blockade. They advocate respect for our  national sovereignty and the normalization of relations, and  support the Cuban people. In this manner, they contribute to  creating an atmosphere conducive to advancement. The maturing of  this process, despite the counterrevolution and those who  manipulate immigration issues and try to create a schism between  the exile community and Cuba, confirms that relations with  Cubans abroad is an issue Cuba is undertaking in a sovereign  manner and without conditions by foreign interests. The Cuban  people and their authorities will not be manipulated by  illegitimate, minority organizations and spokesmen [words  indistinct] who with the worst of intentions try to represent  the exile community and speak on its behalf when in reality they  are tools of anti-Cuban policies moved by petty personal  interests."    Ricardo Alarcon, Carlos Lage, and Abel Prieto, as well as  Robaina, will participate in the conference, "Cuba and the Exile  Community."</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ULTIMATUM PRESENTED BY ARNOLD;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: HE THREATENS TO DROP HARNESS RACING AT LOS ALAMITOS.  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos Race Course, told a  special subcommittee of the California Horse Racing Board on Friday that he  will pull harness racing out of Los Alamitos if additional weeks of racing are  not approved at Pomona's Fairplex Park for 1991 and 1992.  </P> <P> Arnold, who appeared before the committee that recommends racing dates, said  that if the CHRB does not approve 18 weeks of harness racing at Pomona, he will  ask that the board rescind all his dates for 1991 and 1992 because the sport  will not be viable in California.  </P> <P> "If you say we are not going to run at Pomona, then you are saying we should  not run harness racing," Arnold said. "Instead, we're going to come back and  apply for thoroughbred dates during that time. And if we have to build a mile  track to do that, we will. We've already had architects and engineers out there  looking."  </P> <P> The special four-hour meeting in Burbank was punctuated by several  interruptions and one harness trainer was asked to leave.  </P> <P> The harness interests say the sport will die without year-round racing in  Southern California. The opposition comes mostly from Hollywood Park and Santa  Anita, whose horsemen use Pomona as a training track. There are about 500  thoroughbreds at Pomona.  </P> <P> If Arnold's demand is met, there will be daytime racing at the thoroughbred  tracks overlapping racing of quarter horses at Los Alamitos and harness horses  at Pomona during the evening.  </P> <P> Don Robbins, general manager at Hollywood Park, said the overlap racing would  adversely affect the thoroughbred handle. He cited 1986, when three tracks ran  on the same day. Hollywood's fall meeting lost 15.5% in attendance and 14% in  handle during that period, he said.  </P> <P> The harness interests contended that the average on-track handle at Hollywood  Park dropped almost $600,000 between 1985 and 1987 and the average handle at  Pomona was only $262,000, so that there were other forces besides overlap  racing at work. Since then, satellite wagering has increased handles at all  tracks.  </P> <P> The subcommittee members, Leslie Liscom, Henry Chavez and Rosemary Ferraro, all  said they needed more time and would not offer a recommendation to the board.  The full board of the CHRB will rule on Friday.  </P></p>

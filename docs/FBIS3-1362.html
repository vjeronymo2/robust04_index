He said he was not satisfied with the OAU  recommendations which, despite urging troop withdrawal from the  peninsula, have refrained from condemning the Abuja regime as  Yaounde expected. According to Oyono, the Cameroon and Nigerian  armies are now facing each other and are only 300 meters apart.</p>

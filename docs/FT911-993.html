			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Letter: The problem of presentation that dogs the Tory party Sir, The recent episode regarding cost savings at certain hospitals which have opted to be independently managed, and specifically Guy's hospital, has confirmed to me a long-held belief that the Tory party is incapable of presenting itself in such a way that it wins hearts and minds and thereby persuades the voters that it has the right policies. It is not good enough to have the right policies; it is necessary that voters' perception is that this is in fact the case. When the news of the proposed cost savings at Guy's hospital broke, the government gave the impression of being totally surprised that this had happened and did not effectively put forward its position. Instead, in a rather weak way, Mr William Waldegrave, secretary for health, indicated that he had no prior knowledge and that really it was not any of his business to interfere. While Mr Waldegrave's stated position may be totally accurate; it is however totally inadequate. The Tory party must be ready for such events happening. It must be prepared to state clearly why it considers its policies to be correct and also why a superficial interpretation of events is not correct. What has happened at Guy's could be justified on grounds of the efficient use of resources. Clearly, it does not mean that fewer resources will be applied to the National Health Service but that those resources which are applied will be used more effectively, thereby improving patient care. The basic change in management philosophy will inevitably cause changes and upsets and the government must be prepared to ride these and other upsets by forcibly putting forward the merits of its policies. Effective spokesmen must get in front of the media and make themselves heard and their policies understood. The Labour party, having put forward the superficial interpretation of events without being effectively countered, was able to make political capital out of these events. As this occurred shortly before the local government elections, the government's failings in being able to present the merits of its policies in a timely and effective manner have no doubt cost it dearly.

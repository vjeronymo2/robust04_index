			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Working by ethnic groups surveyed SELF-EMPLOYMENT is far higher among some ethnic minorities in Britain than among white people, accounting for 22 per cent of the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, according to the Department of Employment. The rate for white people is 13 per cent. However, ethnic minorities have an overall rate of self-employment of 16 per cent, with the West Indian community down at only 7 per cent. Self-employed members of ethnic minorities are more likely to create jobs for others, with 40 per cent having employees, compared with 31 per cent of whites. The figures are from the department's Labour Market Quarterly Report, published yesterday by the Sheffield-based Skills and Enterprise Network. The report says a difference is also emerging in self- employment patterns between men and women. There were 3.1m self-employed people last year, compared with 1.9m in 1979 - an increase of 65 per cent; but the number of self-employed women rose by 109 per cent, double the rate of increase for men. The reports says that in the 10 years from 1981 the number of self-employed women who employed others rose by 49 per cent, or 3 1/2 times the 14 per cent rate achieved by men. The idea that a large proportion of the self-employed are unskilled jobbing builders or labourers is fading. In 1981 nearly two fifths of those who were self-employed had no qualifications, but that had fallen to just over a quarter by last year  - and that was a proportion of a much bigger total. However, the proportion with qualifications at degree level rose only slightly, from 10.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent. The report draws a distinction between self-employment and owner-management of a limited company, where directors are classed by the Inland Revenue as employees. It is therefore difficult to estimate how many small businesses there are, although the number is put at 3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiating teams from the government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  today approved specific principles for the implementation of  modalities for national reconciliation. As is normally the  case, in its attempt to hinder the peace talks, UNITA wants to  introduce new elements in the issue connected with Jonas  Savimbi's status which has already been discussed and has  received the consensus of all parties. Our correspondent Alves  Antonio reports.    Negotiating teams from the government and UNITA have finally  approved specific principles for national reconciliation which,  among other things, include the issue of installations for Jonas  Savimbi's organization. Thus, the government and UNITA are now  able to tackle practical issues in the implementation of  modalities for national reconciliation which include the major  guidelines and a future government of national unity.    Surprisingly, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim said and we  quote, it is not necessary to have a special status for  President Savimbi, unquote. Meanwhile, regarding this issue,  the government version is different in that Savimbi's status has  already been discussed and approved. What UNITA now wanted was  to introduce new changes. This being the case, the government  is demanding from UNITA a written document saying that it wants  to withdraw this issue from the dossier.</p>

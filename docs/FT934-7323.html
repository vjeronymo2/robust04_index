			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Industrial output falls in France A DROP in car and consumer goods sales led to a 0.3 per cent decline in French industrial output in September from the level of the previous two months, according to Insee, the official statistics agency. However, Insee revised upward its initial estimate of zero growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter to an increase of 0.3 per cent. The economy ministry, commenting on the output figure, said the fact that the overall level in July-September was 0.45 per cent higher than in the previous quarter convinced it that France was on the road to recovery.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: Choose your weapons for the holiday weeds - The killer instinct surfaces in Robin Lane Fox GARDENERS cannot complain at the first proper rain for months, but it is threatening to sabotage my weekend strategy. Whenever the strategy works, I recommend it: it involves a double act which cuts down effort and keeps me off my hands and knees. It is rapidly approaching its last chance in the calendar. In another fortnight, border plants will have spread sideways: the first crop of weeds will have seeded itself and the enemy will be in place for a summer on the offensive. My idea of a good May Day weekend is to launch the attack first: it is your last chance for a pre-emptive strike. Hand-weeding bogs down the troops and limits them to one sector at a time. It may appeal to your instincts for self-punishment, as if the weeds are somehow your fault. Nonetheless, resist it and reach for the sprayer instead. I have not the slightest scruples about spraying wherever possible and I look on its opponents as non-gardening fantasists who do not even have pacifism's high moral ground on their side. Naturally, its effects depend on what you choose to spray. My armoury is twofold. It relies heavily on glyphosate, marketed in several brands, of which garden shops are most likely to sell you Tumbleweed. This brand is satisfactory if you are gardening in a small area, but in my experience it is not the strongest, is designed for amateurs whom suppliers equate wrongly with half-wits and is far too expensive for use on a larger acreage. As a result, I buy Roundup instead. It is sold by agricultural stores and suppliers to farmers who may be half-wits but are at least thought to be professionals. It comes in bigger cans but is has greater clout and I do not mind paying Pounds 50 or so for a serious can which will see me through two or three years and behave better than any other grass-killer on the market. Roundup takes up to two weeks to turn the leaves of undesirables a shade of mildly-pleasing orange. It kills anything with grassy leaves; it wipes out couch grass; it may take two strikes to destroy a well-entrenched nettle or dandelion and it may even need three to put ground elder out of action. In the end, it wins, killing plants right down to the root, unlike that relatively useless Weedol which simply scorches off the growth above ground. Roundup's particular merit is that it kills only through the leaf, not the soil. All you have to do is to aim straight. Aiming is much easier if you use a spray-pack with an adjustable nozzle: for everyday gardening, I use Killasprays and I reduce the quantities per acre on the Roundup bottle to one tablespoon per large-sized Killaspray. If the chemical hits the soil by mistake it does it no damage whatsoever: indeed, you can plant it up with fresh stock within half a day of rounding up the ground. All those long years of hand-cutting turf or forking out couch grass and dandelions are out of date. You can spray the lot and watch them turn a brilliant colour before dying totally after a month. My second weapon works on the opposite principle. Whereas Roundup hits the leaf, Weedex remains in the soil and prevents those awful crops of annual weeds. The vital ingredient here is simazine and although it is available in various brands, for flower-garden work I stick to plain Weedex, not the Super variety, and follow the instructions about particular types of crop which resent it. It is a protective film for fresh, clean ground, but it is not a weapon against old, invasive weeds. Its proper place is on a bed which you have carefully weeded already and want to ensure against disaster. If you seal it with Weedex, you never need to waste much time on all those bits of chickweed which otherwise germinate in summer and ruin your weekends between the Derby and Royal Ascot. To this co-ordinated armoury, alternative gardeners have no convincing answer. I have used glyphosate for years without any trace of long-term damage to myself or anything desirable. If I have a complaint about Weedex, it is quite the opposite: its protection does not always last throughout the season, especially if the year is wet. 'Organic' gardeners have nothing else as strong, clean and sensible as my two weapons. They are welcome to try alternative tactics for weed-control, but it is no use telling me that unwanted weeds are best smothered with unwanted lengths of user-friendly old carpet. There are only three obstacles to my double attack. The first is the most serious: it needs to be launched in showery weather. If either prong fails, it is almost always because heavy rains washed the chemicals away afterwards or a long drought stopped the plants from taking them up in time. This weekend, conditions look highly promising, as the garden is damp and the rain may abate for at least six hours, the necessary interval. I am planning a major assault. Of the other two obstacles, one is my own planning, where I will have to compromise. This weekend, I also intend to sow outdoors annuals like white flax and white cosmos daisies where I want them to flower from late July onwards. If their ground is Weedexed first, they will fail totally. Do not repeat the mistake of an over-eager reader who was so pleased with simazine in year one that he put it all over his bare flower beds in year two and then expected them to grow his light-scented stocks before he left for late August in the south of France. Chemicals cannot distinguish between an unwanted weed and a desirable tobacco plant. The only answer is to mark out safe havens where flower-seeds can germinate and hand weeding has to continue. The last of the three obstacles is much more familiar. For the past six weeks, most of our gardens have been troubled with a tiny white-flowered weed which is often known as Bitter Cress. It thrives where the soil is slightly damp; it is about two inches high and in its own wicked way, it is one of nature's marvels. This weekend, it is nearly mature and unless you pull it out now it will spread exuberantly by its own seed-mechanism. As soon as its seed pods are hard and straight, they are able to catapult seeds at the first touch of a human hand. It is no use trusting Roundup to destroy it because it will grow on, seed and finish the cycle before the poison works. You have to pull it out - and you have only a few last days before it has beaten you. I rather think that in the next world, avenging angels will bury me in mounds of it. It has dogged my years of gardening, from early rock-gardening to hours with a bucket in a German botanic garden where it was pursued with Teutonic efficiency. Botanically, Bitter Cress is a type of Cardamine, cousin to a pretty wild Ladies Smock. In popular German, it also translates as Jumping Jesus. One touch, you see, and it soars skywards, leaving thousands of future disciples on the area round the point of contact. This weekend, I am planning a real Nero of a persecution: having rounded-up the nettles and Weedexed between the catmint, on Sunday morning I will be sending the last of this particular Jesus for the high jump.</p>

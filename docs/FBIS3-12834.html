And  God loveth not those who do mischief.) [Koranic verse]    God says: (Not will they cease fighting you until they turn  you back from your faith if they can. [Koranic verse]    While the Zionist enemy is waving the mirage of peace, an  officer from the occupation army stormed into the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque at dawn today to kill more than 90 unarmed worshipers  kneeling in prayer. The treacherous occupation army finished off  the rest, thus raising the number of the massacre victims.    The Muslim Brotherhood strongly condemns this ugly criminal  incident which shows the perfidious and corrupt nature inherent  in the treacherous enemy. They call on the international  community to hold an urgent Security Council session to discuss  the status of the Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,  and Jerusalem; to place these areas under international  supervision; and to send international forces to protect  unarmed civilians, women, and children and protect the Islamic  and Christian holy places. They also call for holding free  elections under neutral international supervision to choose  representatives of the Palestinian people in this part of  Palestine, which the United Nations admits is under occupation,  so as to govern these areas, protect its people, and manage  their affairs. They demand that no agreement, which has been  drawn without their will and where their opinion has not been  legitimately sought, be imposed on this people.    This ugly incident clearly indicates the aggressive nature  of  the Zionist enemy who has gathered [the Jews] scattered all over  the world, usurped the country, and expelled its owners who have  become either refugees or displaced persons, or are living under  repression and occupation. This is a racist, aggressive, and  expansionist entity that does not acknowledge or seek peace and  waves the banners of peace only to deceive and to achieve  further expansion and superiority.    The Arab and Islamic nation is called upon at this critical  time to rally under the banner of Islam (And hold fast, all  together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be  not divided among yourselves) [Koranic verse], make ready your  strength to the utmost to deter aggression and protect the  innocent, and not to slip into the false mirage. The continued  full boycott of the Zionist enemy is a pressing demand under  these circumstances until the full rights of the Arab and  Islamic people in the land of Palestine are restored.    O Islamic peoples. The path of Islam is the path to  deliverance. Applying God Almighty's shari'ah is the way to  retrieve rights and attain sovereignty.    O steadfast Palestinian people: Hold on to your religion.  Hold on to your land. Lift up the intifadah all over  Palestine. Raise the banner of jihad because it is the only way  to attain glory, dignity, independence, and life.    (So lose no heart, nor fall into despair: for ye must gain  mastery if ye are true in Faith) (If a wound hath touched you,  be sure a similar wound hath touched the others) [Koranic  verses]    Know ye that the Islamic nation in general and the Arab one  in particular are supporting you with all their might and  resources and their hearts are with you. They are waiting for  the day when they break the shackles that are preventing them  from participating effectively with you in liberating the whole  holy land. Tomorrow is not that far away. And God hath full  power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know  it not. [Koranic verse]    God is great.    Thanks be to God and God's prayers and peace be with our  master Muhammad, his scion, and his companions.    [Signed] Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr.    General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

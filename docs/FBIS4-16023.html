			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonid Levitskiy: "Estonian Government Gets Rid </F> of Awkward Newspaper"]    [Text] Tallinn -- RAHVA HAAL (Voice of the People), one of  the most popular and influential newspapers, has lost literally  everything -- its autonomy, all its journalists, and its voice.  The latest issue has been produced by a new team catering for  the ruling Fatherland Party. According to Toomas Leito, RAHVA  HAAL's former editor, the collective has been punished for  refusing to serve as this party's instrument.    Following Estonia's proclamation of independence, Edgar  Savisaar's government made RAHVA HAAL a state joint-stock  company.    Throughout this period RAHVA HAAL has been the Estonian  state  newspaper. It has upheld its interests and those of the  Estonian nation vigorously, forthrightly, and not always  objectively in my view. In terms of its number of subscribers  it is Estonia's second newspaper. While ceasing to be an  official press organ de jure it remained one de facto. But the  journalists, primarily the editor and the editorial collegium,  did not identify the state with the latest government, or the  Estonian nation with the ruling Fatherland Party. Journalists  consistently opposed the government's economic and social  policy, And the authorities evidently grew tired of putting up  with this opponent. RAHVA HAAL was put up for privatization.  Young and rich entrepreneurs from Fatherland Party circles won  the tender. But the "victory" was so equivocal that the  privatization council, scared at society's abrupt response,  immediately canceled the results of the tender.    Following the abortive cavalry charge with kroon in hand the  government carried out a purely political attack -- and  dismissed Editor Toomas Leito. Haste went hand in hand with  carelessness, a breach of the law -- the first order had to be  abrogated and a new one issued, formulated in more precise  terms. Then the whole collective bar one man handed in their  resignation. They began publishing the newspaper EESTI SYNUMID  [name as transliterated] (Estonian News) with Toomas Leito as  its editor.    Even the protection of Europe's organizations of journalists  did not have an effect although the government is usually  sensitive to European opinion. In last fall's municipal  elections, the Fatherland Party suffered a major defeat. There  will be parliamentary elections in a year's time, and the  Fatherland Party is in a hurry to assert its ideological  monopoly.    "While examining the most acute problems of the day from the  position of the poorest population groups, RAHVA HAAL is failing  to take notice of key aspects in the recent past," a member of  the Fatherland Party asserts. That is unforgivable for a  newspaper that is geared to the opinion of the poor, in other  words the opinion of most voters, and enjoys their trust.  According to official statistics, 5 percent of the republic's  inhabitants are rich and around 20 percent are middle class,  while the rest are poor....    Will the government not try to do the same to other  newspapers? "We are particularly alarmed by the Russian-speaking  press, which sometimes engages in patently antistate propaganda  (MOLODEZH ESTONII, ESTONIYA)," the Fatherland Party's official  organ stressed.    If the Fatherland Party starts combating the  Russian-speaking  press by publishing its own "pro-Estonian official" newspaper,  that is an exclusively party matter. But the easier and more  tempting option is to make short shrift of ESTONIYA and MOLODEZH  ESTONII. That is possible now that RAHVA HAAL has effectively  been knocked out.</p>

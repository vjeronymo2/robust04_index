			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: WITH INJURED HAMSTRING HEALED, YENDORK IS AGAIN JUMPING FOR JOY  </P> <P> Juliana Yendork of Walnut had reason to smile after picking up her award as the  top high school girl in the field events at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays  last Saturday afternoon. She had won the girls' invitational long jump with a  leap of 18 feet 10 3/4 inches, after having won the triple jump Friday night  with a mark of 41-10 1/2, which broke her own meet record.  </P> <P> And projecting future efforts made her even happier.  </P> <P> For weeks before the Mt. SAC meet, Yendork had been hampered by a right  hamstring injury, which caused her to miss several meets and practice time. Now  she can look ahead.  </P> <P> "My injury really set me back," Yendork said. "If I had not gotten hurt, I  would be (triple) jumping 44 feet right now."  </P> <P> Yendork, a junior, is already well known locally. Among her accomplishments:  </P> <P>  -- 1989 state titles in the long jump and triple jump.  </P> <P>  -- A national indoor record in the triple jump of 42-5 1/2, set at the  national interscholastic championships in Syracuse last month.  </P> <P>  -- The sophomore national triple jump record of 42-6 3/4, which made her the  No. 3 all-time prep performer.  </P> <P> However, Yendork's greatest feat might have been competing in the long jump in  the 1988 Seoul Olympics for her native country, Ghana, when she was 15.  </P> <P> Yendork left Ghana when she was 6 and lived in Houston until 1985, when her  father, Charles, took a job as men's and women's track coach at Paul Quinn  College in Waco, Tex.  </P> <P> "Once I started competing, we would send updates on my performances back to  Ghana," Yendork said. "Because they knew about my dad and were kept up to date  on me, they sent for me to compete in the African Games in Algiers."  </P> <P> Yendork made the most of that opportunity by winning the long jump with a  then-personal best leap of 18-8 1/2, which opened the door for her to make the  Ghana Olympic team.  </P> <P> "When I went to Seoul, I was excited more or less just to be there," Yendork  said. "My mind was not into the competition because I was so young. I wasn't  thinking about my future then."  </P> <P> She failed to qualify for the finals in the long jump, finishing 16th in the  preliminaries.  </P> <P> After the Olympics, Charles Yendork realized that Juliana had outstripped her  competition and needed a better place to train, so he resigned from Paul Quinn  and checked with friends about moving to California.  </P> <P> "It was a high-risk move for me to leave a full-time job to come out here," he  said. "But the situation was much better for her here."  </P> <P> Yendork found work as assistant track coach at Walnut High -- he has since  moved to coach the jumpers at Mt. SAC -- and Juliana, who had set a national  Junior Olympic triple jump record at 40-10 while living in Waco, quickly made  her presence felt, becoming one of the country's best jumpers last spring.  </P> <P> "I did not have any real problems adjusting to our move out here," Yendork  said, who became a U.S. citizen in December. "I was able to start training more  seriously on my technique and emphasize on the little things."  </P> <P> With her father as her coach, Yendork improved her triple jump by nearly two  feet last season. Now she has set her sights on the national prep record of  42-10 1/2.  </P> <P> "Every year I have been able to improve by two feet on my triple jump, but my  injury slowed me down so far this season," said Yendork, who also is a fine  sprinter. "But now I am almost 100% and my goal is reach 45 feet and to compete  in the World Junior championships."  </P> <P> Last Friday night, standout sprinter Inger Miller of Pasadena Muir announced  her decision to attend USC next fall, following in the footsteps of her father,  Dr. Lennox Miller, who was a sprint star at USC and won Olympic silver and  bronze medals in the 100-meter dash in 1968 and 1972.  </P> <P> "My father and I went over the pros and cons of every school I was  considering," said Miller, whose final college choices were USC, California,  Brown and Texas. "It came down that I wanted a small-school situation."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unnamed interviewer questions Begum Nusrat Bhutto in </F> Islamabad; date not given]    [Excerpts] The meeting was not accidental or coincidental;  AL-MAJALLAH had requested an interview with Begum Nusrat Bhutto,  mother of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, to hear of  the latest developments in Pakistan's political situation. The  battle is at its fiercest between the opposition, led by former  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and the People's Party government,  which returned to power led by a non-iron woman, yet one who has  firmly established her presence in a country where power has  always been wielded by men.    Nusrat Bhutto is the wife of the respected politician  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who was executed by former Pakistani  President Zia-ul-Haq, on the charge of having carried out the  murder of a member of the opposition. Her maiden name was Nusrat  al-Isfahani; she is Iranian, of the Shiite sect. Her husband  became acquainted with her, then married her.    Our meeting with Nusrat Bhutto was at Sindh House in  Islamabad, which is composed of connected residences for the  convenience of politicians in this state, seen as the most  important of Pakistan's states by far, for when they visit the  new capital established by former Pakistani President General  Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1964.    Nusrat Bhutto looks to be in her early fifties, but is  actually in her late fifties. She is surrounded by a group of  male and female attendants, all of whom await her on the lower  floor, while she prepares herself for a full day on the upper  floor of one of the residences at Sindh House. [passage ommitted]  <H5>  Wholesale Accusations </H5>   We were not with Nusrat Bhutto long before asking about the  relationship between her and her daughter, though we avoided  entering too directly into this subject. She embarked on her  answer as she seated herself in a comfortable chair in a  beautiful and orderly sitting room: "She will hurt herself. She  will be the victim of her own unpredictable behavior."    Nusrat Bhutto spoke on, ignoring the protests of one of  those  present who did not want to turn the session into a discussion  of family matters. She said, "Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, God rest his  soul, gave her two pieces of advice: to obey her mother, telling  her that paradise lies at the feet of mothers, and never to  distance herself from the poor; to take up their problems and  issues constantly."    She went on to say, with no pause at the remarks and  gestures  of those who came in to stop the interview, "She has done the  exact opposite of what her father advised. She has distanced  herself from the poor, and surrounded herself with a retinue of  (former President) Zia-ul-Haq's bunch, and the Reform Party. She  no longer listens to a word from me, or to one particle of my  advice."    She said that she herself is to blame, because she spoiled  her daughter Benazir more than necessary, having gotten into the  habit of refusing her nothing. Nusrat Bhutto said that the poor  are the ones who had made Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto the leader of  Pakistan, and that he had focused most of his attention on  providing every Pakistani with his or her daily bread and  clothing.    She added, with bitter sarcasm, "Zulfiqar was grooming  Shahnawaz [the son who is said to have committed suicide in  France some years ago] for leadership and governing. To him,  Benazir was just a spoiled girl he wanted to be educated, to  graduate from the finest universities."  <H5>  Bhutto's Ring </H5>   Without stopping, without even paying the slightest  attention  to the protests of some, Nusrat added that her daughter Benazir  is "bewitched," and that she became certain of this when she  sent one of her friends to inspect her bed: "This friend  actually went and inspected the bed and found twelve fingernails  painted black in the bedstead over the bed."    In a fiery tone she exclaimed, "I never believed these  things, but I checked myself, and we found these black nails in  Benazir's bed frame. I took them to a clergyman who is famous  for fighting evil spirits. He took them and poured a certain oil  over them, then burned them. At that point I noticed that  Benazir's behavior changed, and that she had become rational  again, but that was only temporary."    Begum Nusrat told the story of the struggle for leadership  between the Bhutto family and the family of Benazir's husband.  She said that her son Murtaza, currently imprisoned in a Sindh  prison, had asked for his father's ring, which had been kept by  his sister Benazir after Zulfiqar's execution, "but she put him  off, procrastinated, and avoided doing it."    She continued with this story, which is a highly painful one  for her, saying, "When I found out that she wanted to keep this  ring for herself and her children later on, I asked her to give  it to me temporarily so that I could take it to a jeweler for  him to make one exactly like it for Mortaza. She refused. I  found out that she had had made a ring just like it made for her  son, who is still a young child."    Nusrat Bhutto repeated the story of this ring again and  again, and told how she had given the specifications of the ring  to a jeweler, and asked him to make one like it based on her  description, "but the jeweler was not able to. He gave us a ring  that did not look one thing like Zulfiqar's ring."  <H5>  Rats in Prison </H5>   Begum Nusrat moved on from discussing Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's  ring, which Benazir had insisted on keeping for her and her  children, to the story of her son Murtaza, who had been  imprisoned on the charge of hijacking a plane in the early  1980s. She insisted that the charge was fabricated, and that the  intention was to put an and to the Bhuttos' rule and finish off  their political life in Pakistan.    The widow of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and mother of Pakistan's  prime minister, asserted that she did not want to interfere in  the case, but that all she was asking was for Benazir to  intercede to speed up the trial, "because the conditions Murtaza  is enduring in prison are unbearable. He has been put in a small  cell, like a criminal's cell."    Nusrat Bhutto says that her son told her the water in his  cell was shut off some time ago, and that he cannot shave  himself; and that mice and rats can roam freely and play. "We  asked the director of the prison why there are rats, and he said  the reason is the changes in the climate. But I found out that  they brought them on purpose to frighten and terrorize him."    Nusrat Bhutto returned to the subject of her daughter,  describing her as stubborn and moody. "I told you she is  bewitched. I am afraid she will be murdered, because her enemies  have been able to infiltrate her entourage, and because she does  not listen to the advice of her father's friends, who want only  the best for her."

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Channel link bill expected next week Draft legislation to allow construction of a Pounds 2.7bn rail link between the Channel tunnel and London is expected to be put to parliament on November 24. The rail link bill will be one of the first pieces of legislation considered in the new session of parliament, which starts today with the Queen's Speech. It will mark the start of a parliamentary process expected to take up to two years. Provided there are no unforeseen difficulties in the passage of the bill, construction should start in early 1997 for completion in 2002. The fast rail link will cut 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between London and Paris. The route, which passes under the river Thames near Gravesend before crossing Stratford and east London to St Pancras station, has been decided - although small variations are allowed within a designated 'envelope'. Even so, the legislation is expected to prompt several thousand protests from residents and other interested parties along the 68-mile route. The bill takes the form of a 'hybrid bill' under Commons procedures covering legislation involving both public and private interests. It is expected to be given its first reading next Thursday and could receive its second reading by Christmas before going into committee for detailed consideration. Protestors will be able to petition the select com-mittee which considers the bill. In parallel with the passage of the bill through parliament, the Department of Transport will select a consortium to build and operate the rail link. Four consortia were shortlisted in August. They are Eurorail, including BICC and GEC; Hochtief and Costain; London and Continental including Blue Circle, National Express and Virgin; and Union Link, including Holzmann, Mowlem and Taylor Woodrow. Bids must be made by March 14 and the government will decide on the winning consortium by late next year. This decision will be influenced by the degree of risk which the bidder is prepared to take on and the amount of public-sector subsidy it requires. The public-sector contribution will include Union Railways, the company which has developed the project, European Passenger Services, which operates the Eurostar high-speed trains, and surplus railway land at King's Cross in London. The consortium that builds the route will be granted a 999-year lease to operate services. It will be expected to provide timetable slots for Kent commuter services between the high-speed cross-Channel expresses. Regular Eurostar services between London, Paris and Brussels started on Monday. Two trains leave London daily for each Continental destination but this will increase to 15 a day by next summer.</p>

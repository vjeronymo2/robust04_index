			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US funds push oil price above Dollars 14 a barrel Oil prices held on to their sharp Easter Monday gains yesterday as European markets resumed trading after the holiday. The benchmark Brent blend May futures contract was at Dollars 14.34 a barrel in late trading on London's International Petroleum Exchange, 13 cents off the day's high but a gain of Dollars 1.09 from the pre-Easter close. Dealers said that the rise appeared to have been triggered by US investment funds, which had been seeking new opportunities following the recent weakening of bond and equity prices. Strong buying in the US markets on Monday left the oil price at its highest point for two months. The change in sentiment came despite the recent agreement by Opec to leave its 24.52m-barrels-a-day production ceiling unchanged for the rest of the year. The agreement helped drive the Brent price below Dollars 13 a barrel to a five-year low early last week. The question now facing dealers is whether the latest gains can be sustained. The market fundamentals have not altered and oil demand faces its period of greatest seasonal weakness as the northern hemisphere advances into summer.</p>

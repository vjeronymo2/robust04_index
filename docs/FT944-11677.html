			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help TBS to lift operating profits Turner Broadcasting System yesterday reported a 46 per cent improvement in third-quarter operating profits, to Dollars 88m, on revenues of Dollars 739m, up from Dollars 501m a year ago, in the wake of strong contributions from recently-acquired units, including the New Line Cinema and Castle Rock movie production companies. TBS, however, reported a net loss of Dollars 5m for the period due to several extraordinary items, including accounting changes and a charge to cover the retirement of debt. Mr Ted Turner, chairman of TBS, singled out the performance of the group's New Line Cinema unit, which produced the hit film Mask, TBS's first film to gross Dollars 100m in box office revenues. Of the Dollars 234m increase in entertainment operations revenues to Dollars 542m, Dollars 178m came from New Line, Castle Rock and the Hanna-Barbera animation unit, all of which were acquired between late 1993 and early 1994. TBS's news division, which includes the CNN network, posted an 18 per cent increase in revenues to Dollars 163.5m. Higher domestic advertising revenues were boosted by stronger viewer ratings, and subscription revenues increased 16 per cent, primarily because of higher sales in the US satellite dish market. The baseball players' strike affected TBS's miscellaneous revenues, which include earnings from the Atlanta Braves baseball clubs. These fell 39 per cent to Dollars 37.7m. TBS's share price climbed Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 18 1/8 in New York yesterday.</p>

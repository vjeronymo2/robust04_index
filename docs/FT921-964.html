			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Philippines expects return to GNP growth THE PHILIPPINE government projects gross national product growth this year of 2.5-3 per cent, after no growth last year. Mr Cayetano Paderanga, economic planning secretary, yesterday briefed the policy-making National Economic and Development Authority, which is headed by President Corazon Aquino, on 'signs that the country is on its way to recovery'. He said growth in the domestic economy in the last quarter of 1991 'turned slightly positive', compared to a 3.1 per cent fall in the third quarter. Higher growth had come from increased public building, higher export receipts, and heavy industrial re-stocking.</p>

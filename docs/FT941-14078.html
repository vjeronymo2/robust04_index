			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Bonds: EIB dominates activity on quiet day A 10-year sterling bond for the European Investment Bank, two Swedish krone issues and a continued stream of structured floating-rate note deals dominated a quieter day in the Eurobond market. The EIB issued Pounds 400m of 6 per cent bonds due November 2004, priced to yield the same as the 6 3/4 per cent gilt due 2004. While the pricing was the tightest of recent EIB sterling issues, the deal met good demand from overseas investors, especially in eastern Asia, said a syndicate official with lead manager Samuel Montagu. 'It is tightly priced if you look at it in isolation, but when you consider that our 6 per cent bonds due 1999 were launched at one basis point over gilts and have traded as much as five basis points through gilts, it looks fair,' said an official at the Luxembourg-based bank. Given that half a dozen banks had bid aggressively for the mandate at a yield spread of between zero and two basis points over gilts, 'we felt comfortable that there would be sufficient demand to drive the issue,' he added. Much of the overseas demand for the bonds was attributed to the fact that they are easier for foreigners to trade than gilts. In the Eurodollar sector, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) launched Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds, the first Mexican global bond to be issued. Joint lead managers Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs indicated a spread of 160-165 basis points over Treasuries, the tightest for any Latin American issuer to date. The issue will be priced today. Yield-hungry investors were able to stock up on fresh supply in the Scandinavian sector, where two more Swedish krone issues were launched following offerings earlier this week from Swedish Export Credit and GECC. The French financing agency Credit Foncier de France issued SKr1.5bn of five-year bonds, priced at a spread of 20 basis points over the corresponding Swedish government bond, via Swiss Bank Corporation. Spintab, the Swedish mortgage lender, issued another SKr1bn of five-year bonds at 64 basis points over the benchmark, reflecting its lower rating. The lead manager was Morgan Stanley. 'The two issues were at opposite ends of the credit spectrum, so there wasn't too much overlap,' said one trader. The Nordic Investment Bank is set to issue SKr1.5bn of global five-year bonds soon via Merrill Lynch. Swedish bonds' substantial yield pick-up over core European markets and hopes for further currency appreciation amid continued rate cuts - the Swedish central bank yesterday lowered its marginal rate by  1/4 point - are spurring investor demand for Swedish bonds, traders said. The Kingdom of Sweden issued Es10bn of five-year bonds via Banco Portugues de Investimento. Sweden is the second sovereign to have tapped the escudo sector after Ireland's Es15bn issue last October. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks, according to the lead manager. Another raft of so-called corridor floating-rate notes with maturities of one and two years was issued yesterday, including borrowers such as General Electric Credit Corporation, Morgan Stanley Trust Company, Credit Suisse Finance, Swedish Export Credit and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The province of Ontario is planning to launch its third global Canadian dollar bond issue and its first global US dollar floating-rate note in the near future, Reuter reports. The transactions will cover Ontario's remaining CDollars 600m public borrowing requirements for the year ending March and provide pre-funding for 1994-95. The Canadian dollar global transaction will be jointly led by Goldman Sachs, Nesbitt Thomson, ScotiaMcLeod and Daiwa Securities. The US dollar FRN will be jointly led by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.</p>

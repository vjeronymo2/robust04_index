			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swedish forestry sell-off aims to raise SKr7bn Sweden yesterday launched its biggest ever privatisation, saying it hoped to raise up to SKr7bn (Dollars 860m) from the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the state forestry group, AssiDoman. The government is offering 53.5m shares in the company, which is the fourth largest Swedish pulp and paper group and one of the top 10 in Europe. Unlike previous privatisation issues, this one will largely be directed at the Swedish public. They will be offered 70 per cent of the shares, with the balance being sold to foreign and domestic institutions. Foreign institutions will be allowed to buy a maximum of 8m shares, equivalent to 7 per cent of the whole company. Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's industry minister, said latest estimates showed AssiDoman was worth between SKr10bn and SKr14bn. The offer price will be fixed on March 9 on the basis of bids submitted by institutions in the preceding days. The public offer will take place between March 9 and March 21, while first dealings on the Stockholm stock exchange are planned for April 8. In adopting the proposed ownership structure and pricing mechanism, the government hopes to avoid a repeat of the criticism which followed last year's sell-off of defence group Celsius. Then the public share offer was 17 times oversubscribed. AssiDoman has annual sales of SKr13bn and is Sweden's largest forest owner and its biggest producer of sawn timber products. The state will retain a 51 per cent stake in the group. AssiDoman intends to bid for Ncb, another Swedish forestry group, following its partial privatisation. The terms of the offer, to be launched between March 25 and April 22, have already been accepted by the government which holds 51 per cent of Ncb.</p>

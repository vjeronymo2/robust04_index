			<p>BFN     [Text] As we reported already, Turkmenistan stopped  supplying gas to Azerbaijan as of 1130 yesterday.    [Begin correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli recording] After  having received many warnings, Azerbaijan has finally faced the  facts. Turkmenistan stopped the natural gas supply to our  Republic because it wasn't paid for.    An Azerbaijani delegation visited Turkmenistan and concluded  an interstate agreement in February this year envisaging the  supply of 3 billion cubic meters of gas for 1994. During the  first quarter of the year, some $50 million of natural gas was  supplied. According to a clearing agreement, in exchange for  the gas, our Republic was supposed to send tools used in the oil  industry, fuel, cooling equipment condensers, and other  products. But Azerbaijan failed to fulfill its obligation.    The state firm Azerigas reported that because the Republic's  Council of Ministers has adopted no relevant decision, the firm  is unable to obtain credit and the needed goods. The Council of  Ministers Finance Department reported that a relevant draft bill  is being prepared and will be submitted for the approval of the  prime minister in the coming days.    We must realize that we must unfailingly abide by agreements  if we want to be seen among the ranks of the respectable states.  We want to note another aspect of this problem. In Baku alone,  industry owes 2 billion manats and households 9 million manats  to Azerigas. Failure to pay for the used gas is compounding  this problem.    We would also like to highlight another factor: With its  60-million population, neighboring Turkey uses only 6 to 8  billion cubic meters of gas per year, whereas Azerbaijan's 7  million residents use between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas.  Apparently, no one can compete with our wastefulness. [end  recording]</p>

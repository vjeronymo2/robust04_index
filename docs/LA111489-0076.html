			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PUTS SALK, LANDRY, 25 OTHERS ON DRUG PANEL  </P> <P> President Bush on Monday enlisted 27 citizens, including a medical pioneer, an  admiral and a football coach, to advise him in the battle against drugs.  </P> <P> Bush signed an executive order at the White House creating the new Presidential  Drug Advisory Council.  </P> <P> At a ceremony, Bush recalled that when he announced his anti-drug strategy two  months ago: "I asked the question, 'Who's responsible?' Everyone who uses  drugs. Everyone who sells drugs. And everyone who looks the other way.  </P> <P> "This council is composed of people, leaders in each of their fields, who will  not look the other way," Bush said.  </P> <P> The new advisers "all share my goal of ridding America of illegal drugs," he  said.  </P> <P> The panel, which has a two-year life span, will be headed by a Dallas oilman,  William Moss, and includes Dr. Jonas Salk, discoverer of the polio vaccine;  former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, and retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr.,  former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  </P> <P> Also on the committee are such corporate chief executives as Roger B. Smith of  General Motors Corp. and Robert Wright of NBC, as well as Dr. Burton Lee III,  the White House physician, and William French Smith, attorney general in the  Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> With drug policy director William J. Bennett at his side, Bush urged the  advisers to find better ways to:  </P> <P>  -- Encourage employers to keep workplaces drug free.  </P> <P>  -- Enlist volunteers in the fight against drugs.  </P> <P>  -- Communicate to all Americans, especially the young, the importance of  staying off drugs.  </P> <P>  -- Coordinate existing private and nonprofit anti-drug efforts.  </P> <P>  -- Involve the private sector "in the building of prisons and jails."  </P> <P> Bush announced a nearly $8-billion anti-drug program two months ago.  </P> <P> Other panel members include:  </P> <P> James E. Burke of Princeton, N. J., former chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson;  Alvah H. Chapman Jr. of Miami, former chairman of the board of Knight-Ridder  Inc.; the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame;  William J. McCarthy of Arlington, Mass., president of the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters; Ruben B. Ortega, police chief of Phoenix, Ariz., and  Richard F. Schubert of McLean, Va., former president of the American Red Cross.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / People: Further Education Quality Council SIR BOB REID, the chairman of British Rail, is to monitor standards in England's further education colleges. He will be the inaugural chairman of the Further Education Quality Council, a council set up under the government's auspices to ensure that adult education institutions are spending public money well and efficiently. Further education is somewhat unlike British Rail in that the government has ambitious plans to expand it over the next few years as part of its move to increase the numbers of students who stay in education after the age of 16. However, like British Rail, the colleges have recently undergone a period of turmoil as they were transferred from local education authorities to direct government control at the beginning of April. By appointing Sir Bob, who can expect to find the post demanding albeit part-time, the Further Education Funding Council for England also hopes to signal its determination that FE colleges will be guided by the needs and demands of industry. Four other industrialists - who have yet to be chosen - will sit on the council, along with five members from the world of further education, and one student.</p>

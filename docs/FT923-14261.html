			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Heavy program selling spurs decline in Dow Wall Street US STOCK markets fell sharply yesterday on heavy program selling and continued investor uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 44.03 at 3,295.17, with the bulk of the losses incurred in the final hour of trading. The broader based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending 4.67 lower at 409.17, while the Amex composite fell 2.32 to 380.26 and the Nasdaq composite 5.77 to 557.40. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 220m shares and declines outpaced rises by 1045 to 690. Ever since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week in reaction to bad employment news, the market has struggled to find a direction. Investors are hoping that the rate cut will trigger a rush of funds into equities, as happened the last time the Fed eased, in late 1991, but concern about the economy and second quarter earnings is keeping enthusiasm in check. Among individual stocks, Georgia-Pacific fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 55 in heavy trading after the wood and paper products group issued a warning that its second-quarter results would be only slightly better than break-even and well below the Dollars 33m profit it reported at the same stage a year ago. Other paper stocks fell in sympathy, with International Paper dropping Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 65 3/4 , Louisiana-Pacific falling Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 41 7/8 and Weyerhaeuser easing Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/8 . Digital Equipment, bucked the trend, rising Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 1/4 as investors bought the stock ahead of yesterday's expected overhaul of the computer company's product lines, which will include producing new machines for the mainframe market. Other computer stocks opened firmer but fell on the late program sales, with Hewlett-Packard down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 7/8 , IBM down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 96 3/4 and Motorola Dollars  1/8 weaker at Dollars 75 5/8 . W R Grace fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 in turnover of 1m shares after Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street broking house, reduced its rating on the stock from 'outperform' to 'neutral'. Motor stocks were mixed, despite news of lower oil prices, with Ford up Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 42 5/8, General Motors unchanged at Dollars 40&lt; 3/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 19 3/8 . American Health Products plunged Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 3/4 on the news that the company plans to divest certain psychiatric properties. Although the company said the divestment would not threaten its dividend, a writedown may be required. On the Nasdaq market, Micrografx plummeted Dollars 5 3/4 , or 43 per cent, to Dollars 7 3/4 after the software company said that charges relating to a cancelled secondary stock offering and other non-recurring costs would mean that it will report only break-even per-share results for the fiscal first quarter. Canada TORONTO stocks closed lower in active trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE 300 composite index fell 10.62 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 3,416.29. Declines led advances by 298 to 219. Trading volume of 30.8m shares was above Monday's 20.6m, and trading value was CDollars 361m compared with CDollars 242.6m. Ten of the 14 stock groups closed lower. The industrial products group posted one of the day's biggest declines, off 1.17 per cent on index. Energy and golds were down moderately, and financial services, mining, and consumer products were little changed.</p>

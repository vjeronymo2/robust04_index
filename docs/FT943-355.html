			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden reduces quarterly payout to maximum 1 cent Borden, the US food group, said it would cut its quarterly dividend to a maximum of Dollars 0.01 from Dollars 0.075 with its December 1 dividend payment, Reuter reports from Cleveland. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining Borden's definitive merger agreement with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co, the buy-out specialist, notes that the board of directors 'has resolved that, until resolved otherwise, the company will not declare, set aside or pay any dividends other than quarterly dividends on the shares of common stock in excess of Dollars 0.01 per share'. Borden posted a restated 1993 loss of Dollars 630.7m, or Dollars 4.47 a share. Borden and KKR last week announced a definitive merger agreement under which KKR would trade part of its stock in RJR Nabisco Holdings for all of Borden's stock. Under the Dollars 2bn deal, valued at Dollars 14.25 per Borden share, 41 per cent of Borden shareholders must approve the merger for KKR to gain majority control.</p>

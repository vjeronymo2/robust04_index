			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: UK may join pipe venture - Plan for Franco-German link British Steel said yesterday it was in talks about a three-way joint venture which would bring together the company's large-diameter welded pipe business with Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel group, and Mannesmann, the German engineering group. The possible joint venture would be the first time that three European steelmakers have pooled such resources. 'It is a highly competitive and variable world market,' a spokesman said. 'There is over-capacity so it's only natural that companies should be talking to each other.' The talks, which a British Steel spokesman said were at a 'preliminary' stage, are designed to create a three-way venture out of Europipe, a three-year-old joint venture between Mannesmannrohren-Werke, the German partner, and Dillinger Huttenwerke, a subsidiary of Usinor-Sacilor. The talks are not expected to reach any conclusion until early next year, British Steel said. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel chairman, has repeatedly urged European steelmakers to discuss mergers and alliances which would help lift depressed steel prices and cut over-capacity. 'Cross-border mergers and alliances are inevitable and desirable,' he said in a recent speech. However, a spokesman for British Steel admitted that the company had had no major successes with these efforts because of what he described as 'in-built resistance' among European steel producers. So far British Steel has two European joint ventures, Avesta Sheffield and European Electrical Steels, both with Swedish steel companies. Large-diameter pipes represent about 25 per cent of British Steel's total pipe and tube capacity. The company produces around 200,000 tonnes of large-diameter pipes a year at its works in Stockton and Hartlepool in the UK, where it recently modernised the 42-inch pipe mill. A spokesman for Mannesmann declined to give any details about Europipe's turnover.</p>

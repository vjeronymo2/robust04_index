			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- A regional center  for air traffic control was inaugurated in Arad, western  Romania, as the first in a set of five such up-to-date centers  designed to ensure coverage for the entire national territory.  The inauguration ceremony was attended along with the Romanian  authorities by representatives of the Eurocontrol, the body  concerned in air traffic control in Europe which assisted  Romania in building the center.    The Arad center equipment employs the latest technologies.  The center is endowed with an over-fly radar and other  automatic equipments enabling the pilot to locate any time the  position of the center and to know the flight-angle of his  plane. The center is furnished also with a computer system  securing a swift information coordination.    Beside the Arad center, other four similar centers for air  traffic control are being built in Bucharest, Cluj, Bacau and  Constanta. The Arad center has been recently visited by a NATO  delegation that showed interest in the cooperation relations  between the civilian and the military flights monitoring. The  NATO delegation said that the development and upgrading of the  traffic control of the civilian and military flights would  speed-up Romania's integration in the European and Euro-Atlantic  structures.</p>

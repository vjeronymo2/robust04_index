			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UDM challenge on pit 'mothballing' BRITISH COAL could be forced to continue cutting coal at the 10 pits that have been reprieved for only 90 days, according to the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. A further three of the 10 pits stopped cutting coal yesterday, to add to the four that stopped a week earlier. British Coal says the final three are likely to stop soon. British Coal is now charged with maintaining 'the essential fabric of the mine' in all 10 cases so that, in theory, they could all be reopened after the 90-day review, something that neither the government nor British Coal wants. But the UDM has written to British Coal challenging the economics and legality of ceasing coal production. The letter says the UDM 'cannot understand the economic logic of sustaining most of the costs of production but not cutting coal'. If it does not receive a satisfactory reply, the union will apply for an injunction against British Coal ordering it to resume coal production. Mr Paul Todd, the UDM's solicitor, said that some mines would quickly become unworkable and unviable after coal production ceased. 'Keeping mines on a care-and-maintenance basis is not enough, as British Coal knows very well because it is what they were always saying themselves in the 1984-85 strike,' he said. Most of the 7,300 miners at the 10 pits have been sent home on full pay, although some are working on salvage operations. If those miners are made redundant at the end of 90 days, their redundancy pay will be based on the their last period of full work. Some miners at the 10 pits have given up hope of a reprieve and are applying for voluntary redundancy, although they are being discouraged from doing so by their unions. British Coal said that at Markham Main in the Yorkshire area about 200 men have already applied. Meanwhile Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that he would do everything possible to secure new jobs for miners in the principality.</p>

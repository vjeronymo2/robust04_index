			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Fabius set to become French Socialist party chief MR LAURENT FABIUS, speaker of the French national assembly and former prime minister, is expected to be elected to succeed Mr Pierre Mauroy as the Socialist party's first secretary when its governing committee meets tomorrow. Mr Mauroy resigned yesterday He has won the appointment largely because of the decisive support of Mr Michel Rocard, also a former prime minister and leader of the third largest faction in the party. Between them, the two men command the support of more than half the votes in the 131-strong governing committee. The deal, hammered out by party barons, significantly strengthens Mr Rocard's chances of selection as the Socialist candidate in the next presidential election, due in 1995. Mr Mauroy, in his resignation announcement yesterday, described Mr Rocard as 'the virtual candidate' of the party. The one faction which appears least satisfied, because it has secured least from the intra-party negotiations, is the traditional main-line group led by Mr Lionel Jospin, education minister. Last-minute horse-trading is thus possible before the vote on Mr Mauroy's successor at tomorrow's committee meeting. As the ostensible price for his support, Mr Rocard has called on Mr Fabius to end the war between the party factions, and for a collegial and proportional sharing of party jobs in the departmental federations. The irony is that it is Mr Fabius who did most to stimulate the faction war. He made two previous attempts to seize the party leadership, in 1988 and in 1990, with the moral backing of President Francois Mitterrand. Both of failed, but they deepened the party's traditional splits and contributed to its sagging public repu-tation. In addition, Mr Rocard has called on Mr Fabius to resist any move (by President Mitterrand) to reintroduce a large element of proportional representation in next year's general election.</p>

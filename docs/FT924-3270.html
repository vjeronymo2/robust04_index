			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Geneva talks fail to make a start INTERNATIONAL mediators yesterday failed to get Bosnia's Moslem-led government to talk to Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, agencies report from Geneva. Diplomats said Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia, had asked Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, to meet the rebel Serb chief, but Mr Silajdzic, and Croat leader Mate Boban, both refused to hold direct negotiations with Mr Karadzic to discuss maps showing their visions for the future shape of Bosnia. Renewed fighting on the ground yesterday, especially around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, made real progress virtually impossible in Geneva. Fierce fighting broke out in Sarajevo yesterday, effectively cutting it off from the outside world after clashes closed the main road to the airport and the only other route into the capital from Serb-held Ilidza. Serbs besieging Sarajevo yesterday offered free passage out to anyone wishing to leave the city to avoid famine and cold.</p>

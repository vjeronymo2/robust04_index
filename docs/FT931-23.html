			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (24): Well serviced with sea and air links - From April a new catamaran car ferry will run between Weymouth and Guernsey / How to get there GUERNSEY is well serviced with sea and air links both to the British mainland and France. The traditional method is by sea using British Channel Island Ferries. A conventional roll on-roll off car ferry leaves Poole five times a week during the winter and every day between April 1 and October 31. The ferry leaves Poole at 9pm and arrives in Guernsey at 6.15am. It goes on to Jersey - then leaves Jersey for Poole via Guernsey at 9.45am. It arrives in Guernsey at 12.15 and Poole at 6pm. The day-time journey is shorter than the overnight one. The basic fare in Summer for a standard return for a family of four with a car works out at Pounds 360. A four-berth cabin with shower and lavatory would be Pounds 15 for an overnight journey. There are cheaper off-season fares and various budget-saver schemes. British Channel Island Ferries can be contacted in Poole (Tel: 0202 681155). From April 1 a new high-speed car ferry will operate between Weymouth and the Channel Islands. Condor is launching a new 74m wave-piercing car and passenger-carrying catamaran. There will be two sailings each day from Weymouth; one direct to Guernsey, the other via Jersey. The fastest journey time will be 2 1/4 hours. The Condor catamaran, which can carry 90 cars plus 600 passengers, will join the existing passenger-only catamaran which has been operating for the past two summer seasons, carrying more than 250,000 passengers. There will therefore be three services a day from Weymouth. The car service will continue through the winter. The passenger-only service will run from April until November. The fares are set at Pounds 160 return for a car, Pounds 70 for an adult single and 50 per cent of the adult fare for a child between 4-13 years. These tariffs are similar to those on the British Channel Island Ferries service. British Rail offers through fares to Guernsey: by train from any station to Weymouth, then on by Condor. Condor's Weymouth phone number is 0305 761551. By sea to continental Europe there are a number of services to Carteret, Dielette, Granville, Perros Guirec, Portbail, St Malo and St Quay Portrieux. Many of these services are run by Emeraude Ferries. The company can be contacted on 33 52 61 39 in Carteret and 33 50 16 36 in Granville. There are numerous air connections. The main routes are from Gatwick and Heathrow. Jersey European and City Flyer run what amounts to a shuttle service to Gatwick with almost 10 flights a day between them throughout the year. Air UK runs a number of flights each day to Heathrow. As well as flights to London there are services to 18 other UK regional airports, including Belfast, Birmingham, Stansted, Exeter, Norwich and Manchester. Aurigny Air Services, the official airline of Alderney which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, runs a regular service from Alderney to Southampton. The return Apex fare is Pounds 99. Jersey European charges Pounds 150 for a business class return in the winter. The airline can be contacted via a central booking agency (Tel: 0345 078400). The number for City Flyer Express is Tel 0345 222111. Air UK can be contacted on Tel: 0345 666777. There are numerous direct flights to Europe from Guernsey. KLM Cityhopper flies to Amsterdam. Delta Air flies to Stuttgart, Crossair goes to Zurich. Lufthansa Cityline flies to Dusseldorf, Frankfurt and Hamburg. These services are not as frequent as flights to the UK mainland. Aurigny, on the other hand, makes regular trips to Dinard and Cherbourg. It also provides an air taxi service between Guernsey and Jersey, and Guernsey and Alderney. The service to Alderney is particularly useful in that there is no boat service between Guernsey and Alderney. There are, however, regular sea ferries from Guernsey to Sark and Herm, run by local companies.</p>

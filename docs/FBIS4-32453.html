			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gojko Marinkovic, AIM: "From the Croatian Dinar </F> to the Croatian Kuna"]    [Text] Croatian President Tudjman has once again been  proving his obstinacy, arbitrariness, and messianism, but at the  same time his reputation as a dubious historian and scholar,  because he has used his power and a raft of pseudoarguments to  impose on Croatia a new currency, as of 30 May, Statehood Day,  which is called the kuna.    There were no warnings or assurances that could dissuade him  from his intention: "The president of the republic," Dr. Ivo  Banac, well-known Croatian historian at Yale, the prestigious  American university, said the other day, "cannot go to Knin or  to Glina, but he can impose the ustasha monetary unit. Entire  barrels of learned ink have already been consumed to prove what  cannot be proven, that is, that the kuna is a living tradition  of the Croatian people--not a Pavelic invention--the kuna was  used in the 13th century, the kuna is on the Slavonian crest,  and it is our most original kuna. This pseudoscientific battle  of wits deserves only scorn. This is the shabbiest invention of  tradition with the difference that the invented Scotch tartans  (tribal weaves) are something that can be turned into money,  while the only thing that can be paid with the kuna is Pavelic's  bills, which were always anything but Croatian. We who all our  lives in distant parts of the world have been defending Croatia  from what we might call kunism, can now give thanks to Tudjman,  the former political commissar, for this particularly pregnant  act of reconciliation. We will see how long it takes before Dr.  Tudjman apologizes for this brainstorm. The `only' pity is that  his `Trackless...' and kunas are paid for by others,  for example, the refugees from Vukovar or Konavale, whom Serbian  propaganda has always represented as coauthors of  `Trackless...,' or troglodytes wearing the fur of the  marten [kuna]."    The man who compares himself to Jesus, because on two  occasions in past days he has declared "Even among Christ's 12  apostles, one betrayed him, the other denied him, and the rest,  but for one, did not follow him on his road to the cross," thus  decided that the Croats shall no longer precede money amounts by  HRD [Croatian dinar], but by HRK [Croatian kuna]. Those who  attempt to point out the harmfulness of this decision of his,  that is, to change the name of the Croatian kruna [crown], which  had previously been adopted by vote, to the kuna, he simply  calls enemies and traitors, because "the kuna will be the proof  of Croatian sovereignty and the stability of the Croatian  economy. Croatia had a leadership with a clear objective in  which the people believed."  <H5>  The Croatian Jesus </H5>   What is done is done, and for the present, unfortunately,  there is nothing more that can be changed: The German mark [DM]  will be 3.7 kunas, and this dangerous little animal will be  divided into a smaller unit--the lipa [linden]. But in addition  to the crucial issue of the name, there are a number of others.  One is again in the sphere of history, and the other economic.  That is, many people, after analyzing the persons and cities  that appear on the new Croatian bank notes, have been calling  attention to a number of illogical things, that is, a system  which stubbornly wants to impose just one view of the Croatian  past. On the other hand, numerous experts are wondering whether  this is really the right time to remove three zeros and adopt  the real currency (the HRD was temporary scrip) and whether the  reasons are not really political and ceremonial?    The nine persons on the eight bank notes--according to  many--including Banac, whom we have already cited, have an  exceedingly pronounced semantic weight. Petar Zrinski and Krsto  Frankopan (the 5-kuna note), Juraj Dobrila (10), Josip Jelacic  (20), Ivan Gundulic (50), Ivan Mazuranic (100), Stjepan Radic  (200), Marko Marulic (500), and Ante Starcevic (1,000) are all  of them (except Radic to some extent) figures from the quite  distant Croatian past who are supposed to demonstrate the course  of the idea of the Croatian state. This choice demonstrates the  need of a small state to prove itself powerful, to prove that it  also had its great men, its bans and imperial generals, and, of  course, its Father of the Homeland.    There was no place on the new bank notes for a Rudjer  Boskovic, who until yesterday was on all the denominations of  the temporary dinar? Not a single woman was found, but it is not  that they could not have found an important Croatian woman. For  example: Ivana Brlic-Mazuranic, Dora Pejacevic, Cvijeta  Zuzoric.... Tudjman himself explained why, for instance,  Ljudevit Gaj, or Strosmajer, Frano Supilo, or even Vladko Macek  are not on a bank note. Demonstrating once again his incredible  unfamiliarity with history, or, at least, his strange and  monstrous interpretation of it, in a ceremonial interview with  the editors in chief of the Croatian media (but chosen by him)  he nervously declared: "Who told me that they reproached us for  not having put Gaj or Strosmajer on the new bank notes? All we  need is to do more to spread Illyrianism and Yugoslavism."  <H5>  The Front and the Back of the Coin </H5>   One can only imagine what the "Croatian Jesus" would answer  to the question of why there is no Miroslav Krleza, August  Cesarac, or Nikola Tesla on the kunas (although they would  probably turn in their graves because of the name). Tudjman has  proven for the umpteenth time that he is not bound by the  Croatian Constitution nor by the program of his pseudoparty.  After all, the Constitution clearly states that among other  things Croatian statehood is based "on establishment of the  foundations of state sovereignty in the period of World War II,  expressed contrary to proclamation of the Independent State of  Croatia [NDH], in decisions of ZAVNOH [Regional Antifascist  Council of the National Liberation of Croatia], and then in the  constitution of the People's Republic of Croatia, and in the  constitutions of the Socialist Republic of Croatia." And in the  program of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] it is written  that it is also based on the spadework done by the Croatian left.    On the back of the bank note are the city of Varazdin, the  arena in Pula, the Vukovar pigeon, Dubrovnik, the Rijeka  Cathedral, Osijek, Diocletian's Palace in Split, and Zagreb--the  Cathedral and the Monument to King Tomislav. The justification  offered for this decision has to do with Croatian geography;  that is, the four largest cities and four cities on the outer  edge are represented. At first glance this "holds water," but  again it is a question of the same criteria, only this time they  are a bit more confused, since what are the Arena and  Diocletian's Palace doing here anyway? And if the creators of  the kuna had taken some other criterion except for  monumentality, whereby they repeated the mistake they made in  choosing the people, perhaps the Holy Cross in Nin, Saint Donat  in Zadar, Viseslav's sacristy (which up to now has been on all  the dinar scrip), and even Knin (how sacrilegious it sounds)  might have turned up on one of the bank notes, because the  Croatian Government is thus obstinately repeating that Knin is  an old royal city? The front and the back of the Croatian kunas  have actually exposed the mindset of the Croatian ruler, which,  incidentally, he was not concealing even the other day when he  appeared in a military uniform for the first time in public,  which is probably the first step toward self-proclamation as  general or generalissimo, and when he turned medieval Medvedgrad  into some Altar of Croatian Freedom known only to him. But if  the Croats had to once again swallow the dumpling which Tudjman  thrust upon them, many are wondering what they have got in  economic terms with the kuna and the lipas? Croatian Prime  Minister Nikica Valentic, who is still declaring unlimited  loyalty to Tudjman and has not wondered for a moment whether the  kuna should be inaugurated right now, also had this to say a few  days ago: "The real problems and the wave of bankruptcies that  will be coming soon will affect entire branches of the economy,  because the structure of the economy which Croatia has today is  not tenable. Only now will we see whether we have the strength  and will to carry out the anti-inflation program on which  cooperation with international financial institutions depends."  <H5>  Political Decision </H5>   Up to now, the Croatian Government has boasted disdainfully  how it has managed to halt inflation, and when recently its  deputy prime minister was advised that this is a simple  operation, he replied: "Well, if it is simple, why didn't others  do it?" The creator of the "Croatian economic miracle" seems to  have forgotten that even a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where  inflation was measured in millions of percentage points, managed  to achieve domestic convertibility in just one day. Many  economic indicators warn that the Croatian economy has no chance  of that kind of rapid recovery and that up to now the government  has only carried out the anti-inflation program, but it has not  even begun the stabilization program, as Valentic himself has  declared so clearly. This is best indicated by the figures on  the drastic decline of industrial output, the drop in exports  and imports, and the deficit amounting to about $100 million....  Dr. Vladimir Veselica, member of the HDZ and a professor in the  School of Economics at Zagreb University, recently judged that  the "collapsing curve of economic activity, unresolved property  relations, that is, the incomplete and highly questionable  privatization, without whose completion there can be no  restructuring nor development of the economy, constitute a weak  support for real convertibility of the first sovereign Croatian  currency." Another economist (who incidentally is a member of  the first Croatian government, from which he withdrew because of  his attitude toward privatization), Dr. Drazen Kalodjera, is  still more precise: "The prerequisites have not been created for  introduction of the kuna. I think that the change in the money  system and denomination did not come at the right moment. This  is a political decision which has an economically neutral  effect."    Dr. Ivo Banac is convinced (nor is he alone) that Tudjman  will again have to apologize for yet another historical  brainstorm and invention as he did in the case of the Jews and  what he wrote about them in his Trackless.... Ivica  Racan, president of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia  [SDSH], says: "The new money will sooner or later pay the price  of this illusion concerning the great success against inflation,  regardless of what it is called. Perhaps it is not such a bad  thing for the odium to fall on a bank note with an inappropriate  name."</p>

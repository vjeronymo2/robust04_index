			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Have </F> the Mainland Authorities Tightened Control Over Chinese-Foreign  Joint Film Production?"]    [Text] It has been widely rumored lately in Hong Kong that  the mainland authorities are planning to "tighten control over  filmmaking" and reduce Chinese-foreign joint productions, which  has led to much discussion in show business circles. On a  public occasion the other day, when asked by the press to  confirm the rumor, Cui Songming [1508 7313 2494], deputy chief  of the culture and sports department of the Hong Kong Branch of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: The mainland has not at any stage  implemented a restrictive policy on filmmaking, but has merely  reiterated the original rules that Hong Kong and Taiwan  filmmakers must abide by the mainland's code of practice if they  are to make films on the mainland and refrain from cheating the  censor by submitting scripts that are different from those that  are really to be used; and that all films must pass the censors  of the Film Industry Administration [FIA] before being shown  publicly or entered in international film festivals. But Cui  Songming also admitted that the mainland should work out  explicit regulations for film and television circles to go by,  so as to avoid confusion.    It has been learned that the rumor about the mainland  authorities "tightening control on filmmaking" first came from a  report in Beijing's ZHONGGUO WENHUA BAO [CHINA CULTURE POST].  The paper quoted an official source as saying that, because  some Hong Kong and Taiwan film companies had not honored the  mainland's rules while making films on the mainland and caused  many problems last year, the control on joint production will be  tightened this year, including reducing the number of films  produced in conjunction with overseas film companies and banning  the establishment of joint-venture institutions and independent  film production companies run by Chinese. According to the  paper, the mainland authorities set the quantity of films to be  produced nationwide this year at 150, of which the number of  jointly produced ones will be kept under 30 (54 for last year),  and the productions must pass censorship by the FIA before  public showing.    Afterward, a number of newspapers and journals in Hong Kong  published the "FIA Provisional Regulations on Strengthening the  Joint Production of Films," which the mainland had not  officially promulgated. They revealed the following  information: The ceiling on jointly produced films set by the  mainland authorities for this year is 30, with large, medium,  and small film studios nationwide receiving quotas of three,  two, or one. The FIA is demanding that each studio follow the  principle of "mainly relying on ourselves" and that all projects  of Chinese-foreign cooperation must be carried out by the  procedure of "application," "listing," and "examination and  approval" and must be subjected to the control of the Ministry  of Radio, Film, and Television [MORFT]. The film authorities  should establish a strict and tight contract management system.  The shooting and last-phase production of a jointly produced  film must be consistent with the approved script. Last-phase  production must be conducted on the territory of China. The  authority of final judgment on Chinese-foreign jointly produced  films lies with the MORFT. Films that have not passed  censorship may not be shown in the territory or be entered in  any film festival or exhibition. In the production team of each  Chinese-foreign jointly produced film, leading members from the  mainland side must make up a certain percentage, below which the  film shall be considered a foreign production with Chinese  assistance (i.e., a film mainly produced by an overseas studio,  assisted by a mainland studio).    Around this time, FIA Director Teng Jinxian made this  remark:  "Our principle has not changed. Films may take various artistic  forms, but they must emphasize the theme." The "theme" refers  to "patriotism, heroism, and collectivism."    The mainland authorities have always emphasized the  ideological and didactic value of films, so it is not strange  that they have specified the above-mentioned requirements. The  recent ban on "Beijing Bastard [bei jing za zhong 0554 0079 7177  4429]," "Blue Kite," "Soul of Painting [hua hun 3973 7609]," and  "Farewell to My Concubine" and the ban on "Judou" and "Raise the  Red Lantern" of two years ago probably were imposed because the  authorities thought these films did not meet those requirements.    However, for various reasons, the box office returns for  mainland films has been steadily deteriorating in recent years,  which has spurred the interest of film studios in joining hands  with film companies outside China, with a view to improving  their performance at the box office. In 1982, China had only  two Chinese-foreign jointly produced films. The number rose to  six in 1986 and then jumped ahead by a large margin to over 30  in 1992. In 1993, the number of jointly produced films reached  54. Joint production has become very popular because studios  have no financial risks. They have a saying: "We spend no  money during production; we make money after production -- even  if we do not make money, at least we do not lose money ."    However, because the production process and guiding ideology  of Hong Kong films are very different from mainland films, many  problems have emerged. For example, the mainland attaches great  importance to the script, and a director must strictly follow  the censored script, while Hong Kong directors and producers do  not pay much attention to the script and often revise it as they  move on in the process of shooting, changing the content of the  completed production beyond recognition. Another example is  that nudity and sex scenes may not appear in a mainland film,  but Hong Kong films often use them as a "commercial factor" to  improve box office returns. Hence, there are two version of  each film, a chaste one which is handed in to the mainland  censors and another with additional sequences which will be  shown in Hong Kong and overseas. "Li Lianying the Eunuch" and  "Temptation of a Monk" belong in this category. Another film,  "Dragon Out of the Sea [jiao long chu hai 5754 7893 0427 3189],"  even contained additional anti-communist lines when shown  abroad. This is where the criticism of "not abiding by the  mainland regulations" came from.    "To Live," a Chinese-foreign jointly produced film which has  recently become a topic of discussion, was also entered in the  Cannes Film Festival without being censored by the mainland  authorities, thus causing dispute between the two sides.</p>

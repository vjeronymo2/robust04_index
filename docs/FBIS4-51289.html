			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The U.S.-China  Business Council, the leading organization of U.S. firms engaged  in business with China, today welcomed President Clinton's  decision to renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status  without conditions.    In a statement on behalf of the organization, M.R.  Greenberg,  council chairman and chairman of American International Group,  Inc., said the council applauds Clinton's decision as one that  maintains normal trade and economic relations between the two  countries. It not only permits the orderly and vigorous  development of U.S. trade and investment activity with China,  but also encourages the continued positive development of the  U.S.-China relationship on a wide range of issues, he added.    He also said that "the council is extremely pleased that our  two countries can now look forward to continued progress in the  many areas where our interests and priorities coincide."    Throughout the debate over MFN, the U.S.-China Business  Council strongly supported unconditional renewal. The council's  250 member companies include many of the largest U.S. firms  doing business with China.    Commenting on Clinton's decision announced here today,  Willard Workman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  said that "we are pleased that the administration recognizes  trade is but one of a number of issues the United States and  China must resolve together through cooperation, not  confrontation."</p>

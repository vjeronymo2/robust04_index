			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The analysis shall incorporate the vehicle testing data from the extension fuels specified at &sect;80.49(b), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at &sect;80.45, and vehicle testing results used to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary. A regression incorporating the following terms shall be fitted to the natural logarithm of emissions contained in this combined data set:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  x V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , where D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the coefficient for the term and V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all three fuels specified at &sect;80.49(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Existing complex model terms that do not include the parameter being extended and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Existing complex model terms that include the parameter being extended. The coefficients for these terms shall be estimated by the regression. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) If the unaugmented VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  complex models do not contain a squared term for the parameter being extended, such a term should be added in a stepwise fashion after completing the model described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. The coefficient for this term shall be estimated by the regression. The centering value for this term shall be identical to the centering value used to develop the complex model described at &sect;80.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The terms defined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The model described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles, as defined at &sect;80.62. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statistical criteria.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates the statistical validity of the regression described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including at minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Evidence demonstrating that colinearity problems are not severe, including but not limited to variance inflation statistics of less than 10 for the second-order and interactive terms included in the regression model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Evidence demonstrating that the regression residuals are normally distributed, including but not limited to the skewness and Kurtosis statistics for the residuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Evidence demonstrating that overfitting and underfitting risks have been balanced, including but not limited to the use of Mallow's C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates that the appropriate terms have been included in the regression, including at minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Descriptions of the analysis methods used to develop the regressions, including any computer code used to analyze emissions data and the results of regression runs used to develop the proposed augmentation, including intermediate regressions produced during the stepwise regression process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Evidence demonstrating that the significance level used to include terms in the model was equal to 0.90.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The complex emission model shall be augmented with the results of vehicle testing as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant and emitter category. These terms and coefficients shall be weighted to reflect the contribution of the emitter category to in-use emissions as shown at &sect;80.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the candidate parameter is not included in the unaugmented complex model and is not represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the modification shall be accomplished by adding the terms and coefficients to the complex model equation for that pollutant, technology group, and emitter category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the parameter is included in the complex model but is being tested at levels beyond the current range of the model, the terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The terms and coefficients of the complex model described at &sect;80.45 shall be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that are within the valid range of the model, as defined at &sect;80.45.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter that are beyond the valid range of the unaugmented model shall be given in percentage change terms by 100-[(100+A)&times;(100+C)/(100+B)], where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) ``A'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for a fuel with identical fuel property values to the fuel being evaluated except for the parameter being extended, which shall be set equal to the nearest limit of the data core, using the unaugmented complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) ``B'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for the fuel described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section according to the augmented complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) ``C'' shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions of the actual fuel being evaluated using the augmented complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) EPA reserves the right to analyze the data generated during vehicle testing, to use such analyses to determine the validity of the augmentation petition, and to use such data to update the complex model for use in certifying all reformulated gasolines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

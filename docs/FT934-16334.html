			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Ex-political prisoner given top party post in Malawi MALAWI'S ruling Congress party has appointed to the top job of secretary general Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, who served 13 years in prison on a sedition charge. His selection after a party meeting in closed session in Lilongwe took place in the absence of President Hastings Banda, who was flown to South Africa for emergency medical treatment last weekend. It is not yet known whether Dr Banda approved the appointment himself, or whether it was the initiative of senior party colleagues in an attempt to avert a constitutional crisis. Under the existing constitution, if Dr Banda is disabled, executive power passes to a presidential council led by the Congress party secretary general. This post had been vacant for 10 years. Its last occupant, Mr Dick Matenje, died in a 1983 car crash following disagreements with Dr Banda.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Trusts reach record levels - At a Glance The value of funds under management in the unit trust industry and in unit trust Peps, have both reached record levels. In the case of the industry as a whole, it was strong stock markets which pushed the total to Pounds 63.88bn; there were actually net redemptions in December. Unit trust Peps have benefited from last year's Budget change which allowed the full Pounds 6,000 allowance to be placed in trusts. In the fourth quarter of 1992, investors put an extra Pounds 340m in such Peps, and made redemptions of only Pounds 52m.</p>

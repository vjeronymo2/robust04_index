			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Mozart in the round - Opera The big event of the first BOC Covent Garden Festival is the specially-mounted production by British Youth Opera of The Magic Flute in Freemasons' Hall. The recent vogue for seeking out 'authentic' settings for opera - Aida at Luxor, say - promotes a kind of artistic tourism that at its banal worst can work crushing restrictions on the audience's own creative imagination. In advance, one feared that the staging of an opera imbued with Masonic symbolism in the London home of the United Grand Lodge of England might risk just such touristic banality. Happily, such fears were groundless. This is a hugely enjoyable Flute, and the use of Freemasons' Hall has in no way limited its artistic vision. It is indeed intriguing to sit beneath ceiling and stained-glass windows rich in images already well-known to every Flute-lover, but the advantages of this space for opera performance turn out to be much more basic ones. With its galleried arena configuration and acoustics reverberant without cloudiness, Freemasons' Hall proves itself an inspiring location for opera in the round; and the British Youth Opera production team - producer Jamie Hayes, designer Ruari Murchison, lighting director Paul Pyant - have taken up that inspiration with wit, economy and flair. Like the best of Earl's Court or Wembley opera productions, this Flute catches fire from the populist nature of the performance circumstances. A simple pyramid-shape crowns the centre stage area, on which the action unfolds at speed, with flashes of light and puffs of smoke to signal the scene-changes. No less but also no more is made of the opera's Masonic rituals than aptly chimes with the overall production stance. It is a Flute in modern dress (the Queen and her Ladies in Zandra Rhodes black leather and lace, the temple priests in suits with yellow shirts and shawls) and in Jeremy Sams's sparkling modern English translation. Apart from a disappointing marionette representation of the wild animals, it all comes together to provide fresh, truthful insights into the opera's many levels of meaning. Under Jane Glover's alert, springy baton, the musical character of the performance is exactly gauged. Thomas Randle's manly, poetic Tamino is its star; Rosemary Joshua's bright-toned Pamina, Elisabeth Vidal's clean-toned Queen and Jonathan Veira's jolly, roly-poly Papageno bulk large among its assets. Good Ladies and chorus, excellent (real) Boys. There is a particular sound made by a large audience - of pleasure, sympathy, happiness - as it falls under the sway of this opera. It was a sound much heard on Saturday evening. * Mozart similarly divested of proscenium-arch formalities, Mozart not in the round but on the Queen Elizabeth Hall's open thrust-stage, is to be heard and seen in the current revival of Opera Factory's 1991 Marriage of Figaro production, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth. The blessings here prove rather more mixed. By plumping out the stage with Aguas Frescas household activities around the main scenes, David Freeman transforms the opera into an Ayckbourn 18th-century farce with score by Mozart. It is keenly, at times brilliantly done. For my taste, however, it is hectically over-detailed, and its amplifications of character and situation end up by somehow limiting imaginative response to the emotional content of the music: in this case, more increasingly becomes less. The strength of the revival lies in its fine principals - Geoffrey Dolton's rubber-faced Count, Mary Hegarty's endearing, limpid Cherubino, Susannah Waters's quicksilver Susanna, above all Janis Kelly's Countess, who with a look, a gesture, a vocal inflection reveals more of Mozartian meaning than all of Freeman's narrative ingenuities put together. (Magic Flute, Freemasons' Hall, WC2, royal gala perfor- mance this evening; Figaro, Queen Elizabeth Hall, SE1, in repertory until June 12, then Birmingham and Reading)</p>

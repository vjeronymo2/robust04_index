			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> MIRACLE ESCAPE FROM BAD TV STATION PURCHASE  </P> <P> Anybody can make money for people by putting them into a good investment at a  low price. The real trick is to get out alive if you put people into a bad  investment at a high price -- a trick that J. Bruce Llewellyn has carried off  by finding someone to rescue his unfortunate purchase of a Buffalo, N.Y., TV  station at what turned out to be an excessive price.  </P> <P> In a deal that borders on the miraculous, Llewellyn has managed to get  Prudential Insurance Co. to pay his group 120% of what they invested in the  station -- and to leave them with 55% ownership to boot. This even though the  station hadn't come close to making enough money to pay its interest bills  since the day Llewellyn bought it.  </P> <P> In fact, it's fair to say that Llewellyn, a New York-based deal maker, has made  the greatest escape seen in Buffalo since the Amazing Randi was stuck into a  straitjacket, suspended by a crane over Niagara Falls and emerged to tell the  tale.  </P> <P> Having to fix a problem isn't what anybody had in mind in January, 1986, when  Llewellyn and his investors bought WKBW from Capital Cities Communications for  $65 million. The investors included household names like O. J. Simpson, Julius  Erving, Bill Cosby, former UN Ambassador David McHenry and car dealer Dick  Gidron. Not to mention money from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which sold $55  million in junk bonds to help Llewellyn's company, Queen City Broadcasting, buy  the station.  </P> <P> Cap Cities could avoid capital gains tax on the sale by selling to Queen City  because Llewellyn and most of his investors are black. Sales of media  properties to certain minorities qualify for special treatment. This is a silly  policy that -- as Howard Rudnitsky pointed out in an excellent Forbes magazine  article last year -- enriches wealthy, white-run media companies and already  rich members of minority groups. But it's the law.  </P> <P> Selling the Buffalo station to Llewellyn -- as well as another station in New  Haven, Conn., to a group of Aleutian Indians, both at below-market prices --  made Cap Cities look socially conscious. Cap Cities could have gotten the same  tax break for Buffalo -- but not the same good public relations -- by saying it  had been forced to sell by the Federal Communications Commission's  cross-ownership rule. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Corp., which had just  become Cap Cities' biggest stockholder, owns the Buffalo News, and the rules  required that Cap Cities sell the station or Buffett sell the paper.  </P> <P> So Cap Cities sold to Llewellyn for a "bargain" $65 million -- $10 million of  it in a note that required no cash payments until 1992.  </P> <P> But even with this break, the station didn't generate enough cash to pay the  cash part of its interest bill. The reason: Cash flow didn't grow as Llewellyn  projected. In fact, it barely grew at all.  </P> <P> The station paid its bills by borrowing and by tapping the $10 million in cash  that Llewellyn and his group had paid to buy their stock. By mid-1989, with TV  station prices starting to come down, Llewellyn's investors were in big  trouble. What's more, the day of reckoning on the Cap Cities note is drawing  near. The note, which will have a face value of $18.4 million, will carry a  cash interest tab of $2 million or $2.5 million in 1992, depending on how you  read the fine print. Cap Cities/ABC wouldn't say what the interest rate is.  "It's a private matter. We have no interest in discussing it," a spokesman  said. A nice attitude for a company in the news business.  </P> <P> Llewellyn, who is a financial guy -- you don't see him running the TV station  or his Coke bottler in Philadelphia or the former New York Times Co. cable TV  operation -- saved everyone by finding Prudential. How he did it, I don't know,  and he wouldn't tell me. All Prudential would say is, "We did this to make  money."  </P> <P> Prudential forked over $13 million for 45% of the station, of which $12 million  went to Llewellyn's investors, who continue to own the partnership that owns  55% of the station. When you add Prudential's 45% and the pieces owned by  Llewellyn's white investors, it's reasonably clear that non-minorities own more  than half the station. But the company is still considered a minority  enterprise because Llewellyn controls the entity that owns 55%.  </P> <P> Llewellyn says all his investors except Bill Cosby took Prudential's money. "He  would have had tax problems in his retirement plan" by cashing out his 2%  interest, Llewellyn said.  </P> <P> In a wonderful irony, Prudential seems to have belatedly realized that the  station owed too much money to be successful. So the Pru cleverly agreed to  lend the station money at 11.75% to buy back the 13.5% Goldman Sachs junk bonds  at 20% or so below face value. The bondholders are happy to get out of a risky,  illiquid investment, even at a loss. The bondholders' loss, of course, is  Prudential and Llewellyn's gain.  </P> <P> This stands normal investment rules on their heads. When an investment goes  bad, bondholders are supposed to be paid first, with stockholders taking the  loss. Here, stockholders made a profit and the bondholders take a loss.  </P> <P> The station still isn't out of the woods, though. If both Cap Cities and  Prudential actually insist on getting paid interest on their loans, rather than  pulling some face-saving stunt, the station won't be able to cover its 1992  interest payments unless its cash flow goes up substantially.  </P> <P> But that's 1992's problem. And, probably, Prudential's. Llewellyn has gotten  his investors out alive, which is a pretty neat trick under the circumstances.  Take a bow, Bruce.  </P></p>

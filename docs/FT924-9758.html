			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Cadbury faulted by Ernst &amp; Young THE RECOMMENDATIONS of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance are laudable but not feasible, accountants Ernst &amp; Young said in an unusually strong attack yesterday. The firm said it doubted that the present system of self-regulation was 'robust or responsive enough', raising the prospect of a US-style Securities and Exchange Commission in its place. The latest criticism comes days before the Cadbury committee meets to approve a final revised draft of its report issued over the summer. The report is due to be released in December. The Ernst &amp; Young conclusions include: Cadbury's proposed code of best practice will not be persuasive for directors. The statement of compliance with the code will be highly subjective and impracticable for auditors to verify. The role of chairman and chief executive should always be separate. The committee's expectations for non-executive directors are unrealistic. It will be difficult to find non-executive directors of sufficient calibre. The Cadbury proposals on non-executives suggest a 'two-tier' board that may be inconsistent with present law or effective practice. The Stock Exchange should reduce the time before filing annual and interim accounts to three months after year-end.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Where conflict is the norm: Fear, not hope, is the force driving the Middle East peace talks Peace is in the air, or at any rate on the air. Tune into the BBC World Service and you will hear it. In Athens, the warring Bosnian parties have accepted the Vance-Owen plan. In Washington, there is progress in the Middle East talks. In Abuja, talks have resumed between the Sudanese government and the southern 'rebels'. In Somalia, the US has withdrawn and handed over to the United Nations after an allegedly successful operation. Perhaps the BBC has been heeding the strictures of one of its employees, Mr Martyn Lewis, who recently said the news was too uniformly demoralising, and that more effort should be made to report the positive things that happen in the world. My answer to such pleas has always been that bad news is in itself encouraging. The essence of news is that it should be novel, unusual, surprising. So if disasters make up most of the news, that implies an assumption that they are not the normal state of affairs. When news is good, it usually concerns an area or a subject where gloom or disaster is the long-established norm. Examples: Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in 1977 (conflict and mutual suspicion were the norm, straightforward human contact a stunning exception); the non-violent collapse of communism in eastern Europe; signs of recovery in the British economy. It is the job of reporters to look out for what is new and report it. The job of columnists is harder to define, but part of it seems to be to explain that the news is wrong, or at any rate not what it seems. When the news is of disaster, the columnist must restore calm by setting it 'in context'. But when there is news of an exciting breakthrough he must point out all the problems that remain unresolved. So this week I could predict with confidence that the wars in Bosnia and Sudan will go on, and point out that there is still acute insecurity in Somalia, with no solution in sight. But, having spent the past two days in and around Jerusalem, I shall concentrate on telling you that there is little euphoria, among Israelis or Palestinians, about the prospects of agreement in Washington. Israelis, as is well known, have always felt insecure about the future of their state, though less so, I think, since making peace with Egypt in the late 1970s. Now, however, they feel personally insecure because of the recurrent and apparently random killings of Israeli citizens by Arabs from the occupied territories, especially the Gaza Strip. The authorities have responded by 'sealing off' the territories - which means that the Arab inhabitants are no longer permitted to enter Israel, although residents of Israel, Israeli settlers in the territories, and indeed foreign visitors such as myself, remain free to come and go at will. The Israeli economy, it seems, has learnt to do without cheap labour from the territories (although its replacement with cheap labour from places further afield, such as Thailand, is beginning to cause political controversy). But the masses cooped up in the Gaza Strip - with one of the highest birth rates in the world - have little prospect of alternative employment. And they have little to lose by engaging in terrorism, since whether they do or not they are affected by Israel's attempts to control it. Last December, a 10-year-old girl in Khan Yunis was shot dead in the street, by 'a stray bullet' from the Israeli army, when she went out to buy milk after the curfew had been lifted. For Israeli newspapers, that was not front-page news (though six weeks later a journalist from the leading newspaper Haaretz did go and visit the girl's family, which was more than anyone from the army had done). Nor are the endless humiliations to which Arab families are subjected, such as being pulled out of their houses and forced at gunpoint to erase graffiti sprayed (by unidentified people with whom they may have no connection) on the outside walls. The 'sealing-off' applies to the West Bank, as well as Gaza, but not of course to East Jerusalem which was declared an inalienable part of Israel after its conquest in 1967, and which Israel is determined to keep outside the scope of the proposed 'self-governing authority'. The closure is thus highly disruptive of social, economic and cultural life on the West Bank, for which Jerusalem is the natural centre. Besides making it impossible for West Bank residents to work or attend meetings in Jerusalem itself, it all but cuts off the north and south halves of the West Bank from each other: to reach Ramallah, normally half an hour away, a resident of Bethlehem now has to take a dirt road right down to the Dead Sea, along the Jordan valley to Jericho, and then back up again. Though introduced as a short-term security measure, almost a panic reaction to the deaths of Israelis, the closure has been extended for a second month and is now clearly intended to become the new normality. Lists of people exempted from it are being drawn up, and there is talk of upgrading the dirt road. All in all, life is not too pleasant. Does that contradict the 'good news' from Washington? Perhaps not. Insecurity, which drove Israelis to occupy the territories in the first place, is now driving them to seek disengagement, at least from the Arab-inhabited areas, at almost any price. And the prospect of relief from day-to-day harassment may induce the Palestinians to accept, as an interim solution, even an agreement that gives them only limited autonomy on only a small part of their land.</p>

The ICRC said in a letter to the Health Ministry of the  Bosnian Serb Republic on Saturday that the arrested medical  workers were allowed to contact their families through the ICRC.    Health Minister Dragan Kalinic on Saturday sent a letter to  the coordinator for medical evacuations of the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees threatening to suspend cooperation in  response to this inhumane and criminal act. The health  authorities of the Bosnian Serb republic will suspend all  medical evacuations until the arrested doctors and nurses have  been uncondtionally released and allowed to freely enter Serb  territory, said Kalinic.    Speaker of the Bosnian Serb Parliament Momcilo Krajisnik and  Bosnian Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic met at Sarajevo Airport  on Sunday [as received] afternoon for talks on rebuilding  confidence among the warring sides and releasing the Serb  doctors and nurses from the central Moslem prison in Sarajevo.    Until they were arrested, the doctors and nurses worked in  Moslem-controlled hospitals in Sarajevo.</p>

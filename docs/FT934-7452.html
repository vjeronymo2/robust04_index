			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Gaelic Resources looks to new process Gaelic Resources, the Dublin-based oil group, reported a reduced net deficit of IPounds 537,472 (Pounds 507,528) for 1992 partly reflecting its review of exploration operations and moves into other oil activities. The group acquired Interoil - which holds marketing rights to Vis-Breaker, an unproven oilfield engineering process to reduce heavy crude viscosity at the wellhead - in April. Mr Ian Forrest, chairman, said testing should be completed by the end of next year. 'If successful . . . the Vis-Breaker will enjoy a major international market, bringing significant benefits from direct sales and related licence fees.' Losses per share were 0.39p.</p>

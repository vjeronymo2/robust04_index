			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Look beyond Maastricht for role of UK in Community Sir, In the debate about Britain's role and future in the European Community the Maastricht treaty itself is not the biggest issue. Since Maastricht now lags behind the desire for political and institutional decentralisation revealed across the Community during the debate on the treaty, the focus of attention ought properly to shift to the next Inter-Governmental Conference in 1996. This provides the opportunity for those who wish to make a constructive contribution to prepare a detailed sketch of a new constitutional and institutional settlement which will learn from the Maastricht process. It is encouraging that the foreign secretary has announced a programme of work by the Foreign Office to prepare the ground so that Britain is not, once again, unprepared to help shape this agenda. The second big issue must be the impact of political and legal choices on economic outcomes. It is astonishing that, until the first studies emerged from this forum and the Confederation of British Industry, the consequences for Britain of a 'detached' role in the EC had not begun to be addressed. There obviously are consequences for policy outcomes affecting enlargement, the single market, regulation, social costs and inward investment. Not all will agree either the broad order of magnitude of these effects, which our study estimated as potentially affecting national output of some Pounds 10bn a year. Yet even for a light-hearted column, Dominic Lawson's suggestion ('Sour sound of twisted surveys', March 20) that this work is either the result of vested interests, or from 'the government's faithful Euro-hound', the CBI, is shallow stuff. Conspiracy theory will really have to be replaced by detailed and far-sighted intellectual effort if Britain is to help work out a meaningful place in and future for the Community.

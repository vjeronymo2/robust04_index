			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Steady stream of commitments to Spanish facility THE Kingdom of Spain's Ecu4bn borrowing facility, hailed as the largest financing to be put together by a European government this year, is 'drawing a steady stream of commitments from banks', according to bankers involved in the deal. The three-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility is being arranged by NatWest Capital Markets and has been described as fairly aggressive in its pricing. The Kingdom of Spain, which has a double A credit rating, will be paying a margin of 7.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in addition to an annual facility fee of 5 basis points, to be paid irrespective of whether the facility is drawn or not. The participation fees (the fees paid to a participating bank) are understood to be in the region of 7 basis points for Ecu300m, 5 basis points for Ecu150m, and 3 basis points for Ecu75m. NatWest Capital Markets points out that the terms on Spain's loan are higher than those commanded by the UK, which last September set up an emergency funding programme aimed at helping to support sterling in the foreign exchange market. The UK is a triple-A rated borrower. The UK Treasury's Ecu10bn funding programme consisted of an Ecu5bn three-year multi-currency revolving credit facility with a margin of 9.375 basis points over Libor. There was a commitment fee of 5 basis points, which applied if the facility was not drawn, and a front-end fee of 3.125 basis points. The Kingdom of Spain's deal is not intended for currency support, but as a means of establishing long-term liquidity. The facility has already been fully underwritten by a group of banks consisting of ABN-Amro Bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Citibank, Dresdner Bank, National Westminster Bank, Societe Generale, and Sumitomo Bank.</p>

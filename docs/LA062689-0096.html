			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. RABBIS URGE ISRAEL-PLO TALKS  </P> <P> The Central Conference of American Rabbis called on Israel today to negotiate  with "freely chosen representatives" of the Palestinian people in an effort to  bring peace to the troubled area.  </P> <P> In a sometimes sharply bitter debate, the conference -- the rabbinical arm of  Reform Judaism in the United States -- also condemned "the violence and terror  from whatever quarter" that has accompanied the 1 1/2-year-old Palestinian  intifada, or uprising, in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank.  </P> <P> "There is a deafening silence coming out of the CCAR when it comes to the  Palestinian uprising," said Rabbi Israel Dresner, Wayne, N.J., urging the  conference to speak tough to Israel. "Israel is now the party saying: 'no  partition, no recognition, no peace.' "  </P> <P> Opponents, however, urging the conference not to be arrogant in speaking to  Israel, reminded the body that no American Jews are at risk as a result of the  intifada.  </P></p>

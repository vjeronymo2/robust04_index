The  well-known results of the recent parliamentary elections having  been noted, a whole company of official presidential advisers --  recruited at one time or another more on the nomenklatura basis  -- were given their marching orders in the Kremlin, and now they  have started uniting the ranks of presidential experts.    Knowledgeable people believe that some analytical structure  is taking shape within the president's staff. It will be tasked  with refining the strategic political line, and elaborating a  course for the future development of which the head of state is  responsible under the new constitution. The sphere of interests  of the new super-center will include strategic problems of both  foreign and domestic policy.</p>

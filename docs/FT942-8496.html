			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / KIO wins go-ahead for fraud case against former directors A prima facie case exists that there was a conspiracy to defraud Grupo Torras, the Spanish subsidiary of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, of about Dollars 500m, a High Court judge ruled in London yesterday. Mr Justice Mance also ruled that the KIO could use the UK courts to pursue a civil action against former KIO and Grupo Torras directors to recover the money. In writs issued in April last year, the KIO claimed the money was misappropriated from Grupo Torras and a London subsidiary, Torras Hostench London. The claims also allege breach of directors' duties and breaches of trust. The 22 defendants in the action include Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the former KIO chairman, Mr Richard Robinson, a former head of the KIO's direct investment department, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the former KIO managing director, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the financier who managed the KIO's Spanish investments until May 1992. The allegations centre around four complex transactions involving Grupo Torras and Torras Hostench that took place between 1988 and 1992. In all cases, the KIO alleges the money disappeared into 'black holes' and was paid to third parties. Mr Justice Manse rejected claims by lawyers for some of the defendants that there was no prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to defraud Grupo Torras. 'The payment and disappearance were in each case covered up by sham documentation and transactions whose only intelligible purpose must have been to hide from enquiring minds the payments and their disappearance,' the judge told the court. Some of the defendants had also claimed that the case should not be heard in the UK because Spain was the appropriate country for such a civil action to be heard. They claimed that the Spanish courts had exclusive jurisdiction because the dispute concerned the decisions of parts of the Grupo Torras organisation. This argument was rejected by the judge. The defendants are expected to seek leave to appeal. Even if an appeal is not allowed, it is thought it will be at least a year before the case is heard. The new KIO management has claimed that all Dollars 5bn invested by Kuwait in Grupo Torras since 1986 has been lost due to mismanagement by the former management of the Spanish subsidiary.</p>

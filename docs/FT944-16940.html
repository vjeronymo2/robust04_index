			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy The record monthly increase in consumer credit in August appears to give the lie to the idea that consumers are feeling glum. But the latest figures sit oddly with signs of weakness from confidence surveys, as well as sluggish retail sales and the stagnating housing market. So one should perhaps take the consumer credit data with a pinch of salt. Not only do the data fluctuate widely from one month to the next' increased borrowing could be due to cheap credit offered by retailers to help move their stocks. The interim results from the clearing banks would certainly support this view. The essential point is that consumers still seem price conscious. If they are borrowing, it is certainly not yet to finance a spending spree in which cost is no object. While that holds true, there is less to worry about from the large increase in producer input prices. No doubt last month's base rate increase was a warning shot across the bows of companies thinking of trying to pass on higher costs of raw materials, but it remains quite difficult for them to do so anyway. The art for the authorities will be to tighten policy just enough to keep up that pressure without stifling demand altogether. The slight underlying acceleration in the rate at which producer output prices are now rising suggests the base rate move was timely. Gilts should take comfort from the fact that, though Mr Clarke needed some persuading to make his pre-emptive strike, at least he acted in the end.</p>

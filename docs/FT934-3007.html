			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kleinwort plans trust for European privatisations Kleinwort Benson is planning to launch the first investment trust to specialise in European privatisation shares. The trust, which is expected to be launched in January, will give the private investor a chance to participate in the forthcoming slew of continental privatisations. European governments are expected to raise between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 150bn (Pounds 101bn) over the next five years via privatisation issues, with France, Italy and Spain in the vanguard. Issues are also expected from former Iron Curtain countries. Kleinwort argues that in an era of low inflation and low economic growth, companies which can rationalise and cut costs are likely to have above average potential for profit growth. Companies which are emerging from the public sector are likely to have more scope for efficiency gains. For private investors the procedure for investing in an overseas privatisation issue can be complex. An investment trust is also likely to have more success in getting allocations. The trust is likely to have a simple capital structure and to be launched via a public offer. Because most of its portfolio will be in the European Union, the fund will qualify for a personal equity plan status. Applications for shares in Kleinwort's Second Endowment Policy Trust have had to be scaled down after the public offer was 3.18 times subscribed. Applications for 1,000 shares will be met in full. Those who applied for between 2,000 and 90,000 shares will receive 1,000 shares plus 15 per cent of the amount applied for; those who applied for more than 100,000 shares will get 1,000 shares and approximately 12.6 per cent of the shares they sought.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Small business boost - Good news on pensions for family concerns Pension schemes for small family businesses received good news this week when the Inland Revenue announced a measure to provide retired members with extra flexibility and control over pension funds. From February 4, members of small self-administered schemes (SSASs) will be able to continue to control the investment of their fund well into retirement, up to a maximum age of 75. This flexibility is not available for individuals with personal pensions, executive pensions or those who are members of 'money purchase' group pension schemes. Small self-administered schemes became popular in the late 1970s and today more than 30,000 businesses use a SSAS as their main pension arrangement. Membership, normally restricted to a maximum of 12, can be extended to any employee but generally is limited to a company's directors. The schemes are unique to the UK and effectively allow small businesses to retain a large degree of investment control over their pension contributions. Provided Revenue guidelines are adhered to, it is possible to use the pension fund to purchase new premises for the business and to provide funding for loans or share investments in the company. Although the pension under a SSAS is linked to the individual's final salary, the fund grows on a money purchase basis and at retirement is used to buy an annuity which provides regular income for life. Annuity rates - that is the level of income the individual's pension fund will purchase - are determined by the size of the fund, the individual's life expectancy and interest rates, which currently are very low. SSAS members who want to wait for higher interest rates and the better terms offered to older people, will be delighted that the five-year limit on deferment has been extended to any age up to 75. During the deferment period, the retired scheme member will be able to draw a pension income from the SSAS fund roughly equal to what would have been paid by an annuity. Ian Hammond, managing director of James Hay Pension Trustees, said: 'The individual will be able to live off the total investment return, including interest and capital growth, of about 8 per cent and virtually maintain the original full capital value. 'When he or she comes to buy the annuity at or close to the age of 75, even if interest rates have not improved, the annuity rate will be that much better since it will reflect the individual's decreased life expectancy.' SSASs are extremely tax-efficient and offer considerable investment scope including quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments such as unit and investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property. The company directors, as scheme trustees, can select and control the investment portfolio themselves or appoint a stockbroker to manage the fund. Duncan Howarth, chief executive of GM Benefits Consulting Group, said: 'As the trend towards fee-based advice accelerates, SSASs are proving increasingly popular for directors of small companies who are looking for a clear charging structure and the freedom to appoint an investment manager of their choice or to construct a broad portfolio of funds to spread risk.' Because it is an approved occupational scheme, employee and employer contributions are tax deductible, the fund grows free of tax and can pay death benefits of up to four times annual salary and, on a member's retirement, a substantial tax-free cash sum. Spouse and dependants' benefits are included, while the scheme can also provide a tax-free lump sum on death during retirement. The pension, worth up to two-thirds of final salary (restricted for some higher earners), is taxed as income. Under Revenue rules you can only run one SSAS at a time, which makes the choice of provider important. There are two main options. Fully self-administered schemes generally are offered on a fee basis and are available from about 60 firms of solicitors, actuarial consultants and life offices. These organisations provide all the administration and legal requirements, leaving you a free hand to appoint your own investment manager. The second option is a 'hybrid' SSAS offered by about 30 insurance companies. Under this arrangement, a significant annual contribution - usually about Pounds 5,000 in total - must be paid into an insurance fund, while contributions in excess of this can be self-administered. The insurance companies deduct a percentage of contributions paid into their own funds and may have other fixed charges for investment management and administration. Hybrid SSASs, for which charges are levied on a percentage basis, are generally thought to be more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000.

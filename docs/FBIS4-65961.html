			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck by </F> correspondent Titti Nylander in Brussels on 25 May; from the  "Ekots" program -- recorded]    [Text] Sweden is today for the first time taking part in a  defense ministers meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. The  meeting is for countries taking part in the Partnership for  Peace program that Sweden joined earlier this month. The other  countries had a long list of hopes on the Swedish contributions,  Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says.    [Bjoerck] Sweden is unique, among other things because we  have taken part in the UN peacekeeping tasks in such an active  way. As a matter of fact, more than 60,000 Swedes have served  as UN soldiers since the 1950s. We have had a unique experience  in this for which we have received a lot of praise. There are  many countries that have had no experience in this and want to  find out how we have managed: They want to have training,  information, and different sorts of assistance. We have of  course offered this to them; this is our niche, our speciality.    [Nylander] Most of the other members in this Partnership for  Peace cooperation agreement see this as a gateway to NATO--I am  thinking of the countries of Central and East Europe. How is it  going to be possible to try to convince the gathering here in  Brussels that Sweden does not view this matter in a similar way?    [Bjoerck] Well, it is a matter of information and more  information. In the plenary debate here today I made it  absolutely clear that we intend to maintain our foreign policy,  which is free from alliances. Our membership in NATO is not  topical. We differ in this from many of the East European  countries, which for different reasons are not being considered  for NATO membership. But this must be stressed over and over  and over again.    [Nylander] Russia has now announced that it will join the  Partnership for Peace program. Do you see this as a beginning  of a completely new security order in Europe?    [Bjoerck] In any case this is a good starting point for  that.  We were all terribly glad here today when Pavel Grachev made it  clear that they intend to sign the Partnership for Peace  agreement without conditions or rewards. Many had not dared to  hope for this. If everything goes well, we will maybe be able  to experience what I have always dreamed of, that the big and  mighty Russia--that is what it is at least potentially--will  start taking part in European security structures, and in the  cooperation organizations in Europe in a considerably more  active way than before. As a matter of fact, I think that this  is a precondition for lasting peace and stability in Europe,  that we have the Russians with us.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OH, BLAST! OLD BUILDING JUST REFUSES TO FALL  </P> <P> Neighbors of a high-rise apartment building were kept away Monday while  demolition experts worked out plans to bring down the building that wouldn't  fall.  </P> <P> "We told you so," said a grass-roots neighborhood organization that had argued  that the building and two others were solid enough to be renovated for  low-income housing.  </P> <P> More than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36-year-old building down  Sunday, although a second round of explosives knocked out the first two floors,  leaving the main part of the building and a wing leaning against each other.  </P> <P> The neighborhood organization, Project BASIC, had tried unsuccessfully in  federal court to stop the demolition of the 10-story Hartford Park building,  contending that it was structurally sound.  </P> <P> "Why didn't it fall? That's an open question," said David R. Evans, the  explosives expert who coordinated the blasts. "I knocked out the two floors I  wanted to knock out and, by all indications, the building should have fallen.  </P> <P> "It's the way it's built," Evans said. "It's built like a honeycomb."  </P> <P> The Providence Housing Authority decided to switch from explosives to a  wrecking crane, which will begin work today, Director Stephen O'Rourke said.  The process could take up to two weeks.  </P></p>

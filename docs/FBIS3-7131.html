			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA March 24 -- General Secretary Do Muoi held  a cordial meeting with delegates attending the 10th General  Meeting of Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (GMPECC) in  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On behalf of the participants, Mr.  Zainal Abidin Sulong, president of the GMPECC welcomed Mr Do  Muoi and hailed the achievements recorded by the Vietnamese  people during their current renovation process. He stressed  that Vietnam has gained a number of achievements on economic,  cultural and social fields. Vietnam is now a promising and  dynamic country. He also praised Vietnamese open-door foreign  policy and held that Vietnam has made great contribution to the  stability, cooperation and development in the region as well as  in the world. After that General Secretary Do Muoi addressed at  the GMPECC. Followings are main parts of his speech:    We Vietnamese have always been conscious that Vietnam is an  inseparable part of the Pacific, and together with the peoples  on the rim of this vital ocean area, we have always shared the  sorrows at disasters and the joys at good opportunities brought  about to the region.    In observing the development curves on the Pacific Rim, we  are deeply aware that as a country with thousands of years of  history, endowed with rich and diversified resources, a very  favourable geographic location and a people who are undaunted in  struggle and industrious in labour, Vietnam has the conditions  to quickly reach a high standard of development.    However, for the past nearly half a century, while other  nations were enjoying peace and had favourable conditions to  develop, the Vietnamese had to undergo one brutal war after  another and suffered from enormous sacrifices to regain and  defend their national independence and freedom, and to liberate  and unify their country. A huge amount of bombs and ammunitions  which exceeded even that used throughout World War II, was  dropped on the small country of Vietnam, leaving our people in  untold sufferings and lasting heavy consequences.    I have no intention to disturb your souls with this reminder  amid this peaceful atmosphere in Kuala Lumpur, but only wish to  say that the Vietnamese people have paid dear price to regain  their most fundamental and sacred right as human beings, namely  to live in independence and freedom that the Vietnamese people,  not less than anyone else, long for a peaceful life to do all  they can to build a prosperous country and that such an  undaunted nation fully deserves a life of plenty and happiness.    It is with such a consciousness that we have persistently  pursued our policy of `renewal' to mobilize all resources of the  society, tap to all potentials of the people and, at the same  time, broaden our international cooperation along the line of  diversification and multilateralization to materialize our goal  of becoming `a rich people, a strong country and an equitable  and civilized society'.    We have made important initial achievements. Despite the  major upheavals in the world, the profound changes in the  countries of our traditional trading partners and the embargo,  the Vietnamese economy never collapsed but has, on the contrary,  shown upturns. From a country of chronic food shortages, having  to import hundreds of thousands of tons of food a year, Vietnam  has now become a food exporter, selling each year from 1.5 to 2  million tons of rice. The hyper-inflation which used to  register at triple digits in the mid-1980's has gone down to  only over 5 a year. In the meantime, the GDP has clocked an  average annual increase of over 7 over the past three years and  is laying the premise for a still higher growth in the coming  years.    These achievements result from the self-sacrifices in labour  of our people, and of our persistent policy for all-round  renewal that has enjoyed the warm response from, and zealous  implementation by, our entire people. They also result from the  heartfelt support and assistance of our friends around the  world. From this rostrum, I would like to express our sincere  gratitude for that valuable support and assistance. The cause  we are pursuing has no precedent. We, have thus to strenuously  promote our sense of independence and sovereignty, and our  creativity in research and carefulness in development, giving  priority to economic renewal while carrying out political  renewal in appropriate forms and with suitable steps. To catch  up with the common momentum of development and gradually bridge  the gap between our country and others in the region, we  continue to consider economic development our central task, and  will persist in our policy of all-round renewal and our open  foreign policy of diversification and multilateralization.</p>

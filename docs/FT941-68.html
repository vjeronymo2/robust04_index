			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Connolly jumps to Pounds 28.2m Pre-tax profits of Wilson (Connolly) Holdings, the housebuilder, having fallen by two-thirds since 1989, jumped by 68 per cent from Pounds 16.81m to Pounds 28.22m last year. This compares with peak profits of Pounds 54m in 1989 when the group achieved sales of Pounds 193m. Profits in 1991 and 1992 were depressed by property and land write-downs of Pounds 2.02m and Pounds 5.49m respectively. Turnover last year rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 275m (Pounds 201m) giving an operating margin of 10.3 per cent compared with 8.3 per cent in 1992 and a peak of almost 28 per cent in 1989. Mr Lyn Wilson described last year's performance as outstanding in difficult market conditions. The final dividend is raised from 2.66p to 2.86p making a total for the year of 4.13p (3.93p) - a 5 per cent increase and the first rise since 1991. Net debt, including land creditors, was equivalent to just 4 per cent of shareholders funds at end-December compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. The number of homes sold by the group rose by a third from 2,880 to 3,840 at an average price of Pounds 54,500 (Pounds 53,000). Housing profits also benefited from the absence of fresh provisions and rose from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 22.5m. Commercial property profits, following the completion of two turn-key office developments at Northampton and Oxford, also rose sharply from Pounds 547,000 to Pounds 4.68m. Construction profits, reflecting very difficult trading in the UK, dipped from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 1.01m on a slightly higher turnover of Pounds 37.49m (Pounds 36.17m). COMMENT Wilson Connolly's shares have underperformed a UK housebuilding sector which has declined of late as concern has mounted over rising land costs and the possibility of more sluggish house sales and price rises should forthcoming tax increases knock buyers' confidence. The group, however, has net cash, excluding land creditors, and has a good reputation for making shrewd land purchases. It is a quality builder although some, at this stage of the cycle, might prefer less of an emphasis on first time buyers. It looks a little cheap against some of its peers, therefore, on pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 16 times for 1994 and 13 times Pounds 43m profits in 1995.</p>

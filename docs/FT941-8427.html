			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / The Long View: Toujours richesse With the clearing banks at last reporting increased profits after a protracted recession, it may seem premature to remind people that the party always ends in tears. But this column is not called The Long View for nothing; and it always pays to remember that movements in bank balance sheets have an important influence on the behaviour of the macro-economy. An accurate forecast of the precise way in which the banks will lose billions of other people's money in the course of the present economic cycle could provide important clues to the future rate of inflation and the relative performance of bond markets against equities. The starting point for this gloomily deterministic exercise  - perverse though it sounds  - is that bank balance sheets in the English-speaking economies are looking healthier than they have done for years. The efforts of the US Federal Reserve to prevent a credit crunch by encouraging the banks to trade in Treasury paper have been triumphantly successful. Both the capital and profitability of the US banking system have been restored, which is why the Fed was able to raise interest rates earlier this month without trepidation. In the UK, profits and capital are similarly on the mend, although the means to that end have been different. In American parlance, the banks have simply leveraged the customer base  - a euphemism for extracting increased profits from customers when you know that they are unable to go elsewhere. Recent howls of anguish from the small business sector are the sound of bank customers being leveraged. This unique approach to marketing, a variant of Morton's fork, is rooted in the notion that the customer is always wrong in a recession; and it is less stupid than it sounds, for the banker's relationship with the client is essentially monopolistic in an economic downturn and competitive in an upturn. Consequently the UK banks' operating income has remained strong through the recession. Now the fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts is having a geared effect on profits. That is, the improvement in bad debt experience causes pre-tax profits to rise disproportionately. This brings us to the central point. The British banks are about to confront an embarrassment of riches: capital and retained profits are set to grow uncontrollably as the recovery progresses. This might seem counter-intuitive. When bank capital is high, the return on capital employed is lower and the commercial banking system suffers a loss of competitive advantage to the markets. For in the wholesale money markets, securities firms compete with the banks to bring together those with surplus funds and those who are in need of funds; and the markets operate on a much smaller base of capital because they do not have a fiduciary obligation to millions of depositors. In the retail business, where banks face less competition from securities firms the problem is maturity. Home lending is a busted flush and there are growing doubts about the banks' prospects in life assurance. Moreover, excess profits usually lead to increased competition and then back to lower profits. So why are analysts forecasting a sustained increase in retained profits? The answer is that in Britain, unlike the US, universal banking is now the norm. A loss of competitive advantage between the banking system and the markets simply means that a bank such as Lloyds, which chose not to buy into a big securities firm, suffers at this point in the cycle relative to Barclays and Natwest which did. Retail business may be mature, but it still generates big profits. As for competition, it works only with a long delay in Britain's heavily concentrated clearing bank system. So Ogden Nash was right after all: bankers are just like everyone else except richer. But how will they respond to their sudden enrichment? The logical answer would be to return capital to the shareholders in the form of much higher dividends. The long-suffering owners do, after all, deserve it, having put so much capital into the banks over the past 20 years, often to see it either squandered or paid back in dividends, before receiving another call for fresh capital. A high payout policy would lead to a less managerial form of capitalism, in which shareholders would exercise a more powerful veto over grandiose expansion plans. But while dividends will no doubt rise, they seem unlikely to absorb all the extra profits. Even Lloyds, which has acquired a reputation for looking after shareholders' interests, appears to have lost its appetite for shrinking the business and is on the lookout for acquisitions. While a more conventional dash for growth in lending or other forms of expensive mistake cannot be ruled out, the acquisition trail looks an all too plausible answer to the problems of the sorcerer's apprentices. In the UK the belief that takeovers solve problems rather than create them dies hard. It would be good news if the banks acquired businesses at a premium over net asset value, the resulting goodwill on acquisition would cause their own capital to shrink. So might any subsequent poor performance by the acquired company. The monetary consequences would thus be less inflationary than with a plunge into property lending or corporate deal making, because shrinking capital constrains the growth of money and credit. The bad news would be that shareholders were made to suffer because of imprudent acquisitions. The history of bank takeovers prompted by excess capital and high ambition is profoundly discouraging  - witness Midland's disastrous acquisition of Crocker in California in the early 1980s and the TSB's acquisition of merchant bankers Hill Samuel in 1987. It is a sad fact that even the best banks have an unimpressive record in running their own businesses. The notion that they can turn themselves into wizards of the takeover game beggars belief. Stand by for more trouble, if only in the long term.</p>

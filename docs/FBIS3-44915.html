The number of  joint-stock industrial and commercial companies rose to 26 and  that of enterprises undergoing reform experiments conducted in  light of the policies for Chinese- foreign joint ventures  expanded to 230. There are now 36 standard enterprise groups  and 110 small state-owned industrial enterprises run by local  people all over the province. By the end of the third quarter  of this year [as heard], there were over 33,000 township and  town enterprises under the cooperative shares system.    Second, the internal management of enterprises, energy  conservation, and cutting down of consumption were strengthened.

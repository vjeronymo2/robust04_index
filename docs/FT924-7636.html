			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: My credit card strike I AM ON a spending strike at present. Not a full-out spending strike. I still buy food, toothpaste, cigarettes. Still travel into, and home from, work. Still visit the movies. But in all other respects I have reduced my spending to zero and at zero it will remain so long as Norman Lamont remains chancellor of the exchequer. Lamont has got to go  - as go he will presently, at which point I will career to the shops and start buying suits, shirts, sportsjackets, shoes, electrical and electronic equipment, fine foods and wines, paintings, etchings, silverware, books, expensive stationery and pens - a Mercedes, I shouldn't wonder. I am not alone in my Lamont strike. It is being imitated up and down the land. Detestation of the chancellor is probably the single factor most to blame for the continuing recession and the misery of retailers. Doesn't John Major read the papers? Does Major do anything, apart from shilly, shally and bleed? No matter. For I have been reading some of the literature put out by retailers in the run-up to Christmas, and exciting material it is, heralding a liftoff in consumer sales just as soon as Lamont quits Number 11 Downing Street. That may not be in time for Christmas 1992, but Christmas 1993 ought to see people fighting to spend money on things they are presently doing without. Forget the state of the British or world economy; the bankruptcy of politics; threats of trade wars; the looming millennium; the diseases and disasters that are obliterating the surface of this bone-weary planet. I give you . . . personalised welcome mats. The latest catalogue from Innovations includes a 'doormat with a difference - it can be printed with a house or family name or with a message of your choice.' 24in x 14in, up to 12 letters on each of three lines, Pounds 9.95. Absolutely brillo. I am tempted to order one. You can write a supremely rude message with up to 12 letters on each of three lines. I give you . . . the amazing Aquamag. 'Developed in the UK (Pat. Pending No. 9108667.8), Aquamag is a breakthrough in the treatment of limescale. The powerful curved ceramic ferrite magnets contained in Aquamag produce a super field of high magnetic flux.' Eco-friendly, fits in seconds around your cold water inlet, 15mm or 22mm, Pounds 29.95 or Pounds 34.95 - a recession-wrecker if ever I heard of one. I give you . . . a Sterling silver toothpick, crafted by hand, 3in long when open, twist-barrel action, 'can be worn as a pendant or attached to a key ring,' Pounds 19.95. I give you . . . the smokeless ash tray, battery-powered, 4 1/2 in x 2 1/2 in, Pounds 9.95 . . . water-filled insoles for wearing inside your shoes to act as shock-absorbers, developed in Japan, sizes 5-12, Pounds 8.95 . . . a desktop document shredder with easy-empty waste box, 7in x 4 1/2 in x 5 3/4 in, Pounds 19.95 . . . and the Pet Vac and Cat Vac battery-operated thingummies to vacuum-clean your pets, lightweight, cordless, non-abrasive brushes, Pounds 19.95 and Pounds 8.95. Above all, I give you . . . the 'amazing precision-made Litetronics light bulb, guaranteed for 10 years.' I explained some time ago that my flat in Notting Hill is illuminated by 46 light bulbs - in fact it is 47; I forgot the light in the fridge - and that I constantly have to replace them. The bulb in the Innovations catalogue is said to last 16 times longer than ordinary bulbs and comes in pearl or clear, bayonet or screw, 40-100-watt, Pounds 11.95 per three. I am ordering 48. Do you see what I mean? The sooner Stormin' Norman quits Downing Street, the sooner you, me and all our friends and pets can embark on a recession-busting spending spree of brillo proportions. But I don't like gadgets. Apart from the long-life light bulbs, I want none of the items listed above. I lead a simple life. For Christmas, I want cheap and simple presents. In descending order, they are: 1) A John Major dartboard. 2) A Norman Lamont dartboard. 3) A Michael Heseltine dartboard. 4) A Douglas Hurd dartboard. 5) A Gillian Shephard dartboard. 6) A Paddy Ashdown dartboard (I voted for Wing-commander Ashdown last April; how dare he not struggle with every sinew to unhorse this ghastly government). 7) A Margaret Beckett dartboard (no particular reason; she'd just look nice on a dartboard). 8) A Jacques Delors dartboard (or anyone from France). Plus a box of darts.</p>

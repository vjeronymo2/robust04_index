			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Ex-banker will bring panache to Treasury MR ANTHONY NELSON, the new economic secretary to the Treasury, used his detailed knowledge of the working of the City to press for more effective regulation of the financial services sector during the passage of the legislation which established the Securities and Investments Board. Mr Nelson, MP for Chichester since October 1974, led the final stage of the campaign for televising proceedings in the Commons and its most important select committees. A frequent participant in finance bill debates and a staunch advocate of Britain's membership of the European Community, Mr Nelson will bring panache and style to the Treasury team. He was a merchant banker with NM Rothschild for four years before entering the Commons and has served as a parliamentary private secretary to middle-ranking ministers. He was also one of Mrs Virginia Bottomley's 'political minders' when she won the South West Surrey by-election in 1984. Mr Nelson was one of the Tory backbenchers who successfully pressed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take action in his pre-election budget to freeze the transitional element in the uniform business rate by ensuring that the increase in 1992-93 did not exceed the rate of inflation. He also had the prescience to declare his support for the whole strategy underlying the Budget in his final speech in the last parliament.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Permanent interest-bearing shares ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investments only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Coupon     Issue   Minimum   Price    Yield Stock                   (gross %) price (p) (Pounds)   (p)   (gross %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires      9.375   100.165    1,000    87.50   10.709 Bradford &amp; Bingley       11.625   100.129   10,000   111.50   10.426 Bradford &amp; Bingley       13       100.2     10,000   123.75   10.505 Bristol &amp; West           13.375   100.338    1,000   124.00   10.786 Britannia                13       100.423    1,000   120.50   10.788 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs      11.75    100.962   50,000   114.50   10.262 Coventry                 12.125   100.749    1,000   113.00   10.715 First National           11.75    100.247   10,000   101.00   11.634 Halifax                   8.75    100.615   50,000    88.50    9.887 Halifax                  12       100.28    50,000   118.25   10.148 Leeds &amp; Holbeck          13.375   100.227    1,000   123.00   10.874 Leeds Permanent          13.625   100       50,000   134.25   10.149 Newcastle                10.75    100.317    1,000   99.625   10.790 Newcastle                12.625   100.446    1,000   116.25   10.860 North of England         12.625   100.135    1,000   117.75   10.722 Skipton                  12.875   100.476    1,000   118.75   10.842  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price at midday  25 Nov 94; excluding accrued interest.

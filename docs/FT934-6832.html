			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / High hopes for the seamy side of life: Michael Smith examines the prospects for the shape and size of the UK coal industry after privatisation Five years after promising what it called the ultimate privatisation, the sale of the coal industry, the UK government is ready to deliver. After last year's false start, when its plans were delayed by a public outcry over pit closures, ministers are determined to end the state's 46-year ownership of coal. A bill will be presented to parliament shortly, possibly this week, and what remains of British Coal should be in private hands by early 1995 at the latest. What, then, will be the size, shape and ownership of the industry in the second half of the decade? And how vulnerable will the government be in parliament over such issues as miners' pensions, regulation and safety. Arguments over protecting workers' pensions caused the government considerable difficulties in its railway privatisation bill this autumn. The scope for similar ructions in the coal sell-off were highlighted recently when the trustees of the mineworkers' Pounds 7.5bn pension scheme identified 17 'areas of concern' over government proposals. They want to 'ensure that the real value of benefits continues to be protected' against increases in the cost of living. Further controversy could be stirred by the government's plans for a Coal Authority to supervise the licensing of privatised mines. Conflict is expected over the authority's role in deciding whether to grant licences. Will it examine companies' safety records or just look at the highest bids? The government is sensitive to Labour party charges that pit safety has been compromised in the drive for efficiency. Despite such potential embarrassments for the government in the parliamentary debate over privatisation, few observers expect the sell-off to be sunk. The structure of the industry will be shaped not through debates in Westminster but through government talks with the would-be buyers of British Coal. Ministers have decided to offer British Coal for sale as five separate regions - Scotland, the north-east, Yorkshire, the Midlands and Wales. But they argue that their priority is to let the market decide the shape of the industry. Companies will have to bid for every pit and opencast site in the region of their choice. The government has chosen this method because in theory it opens the industry up to competition. However, it leaves open the possibility that one company could bid for all regions successfully and thus recreate a single entity. British Coal fears that fragmentation would lead to cut-throat rivalry within the industry at a time when competition from other energy sources, including gas and nuclear power, and from imported coal will be intense. 'If the government splits up coal, then it really will kill it,' says one British Coal executive. Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman of Caledonian Mining, a mining equipment manufacturer which is a potential bidder, has similar fears. 'The industry will be beaten into the ground through competition if British Coal is broken up,' he says. Mr MacLeod adds that he is interested in being part of a consortium to buy and manage British Coal, but if it is broken up he would 'only want a couple of mines'. Similarly, the British Association of Colliery Management, which represents middle and senior managers, hopes to co-ordinate a series of regional buy-outs on behalf of members, with the aim of combining them into a single company. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has not ruled out the possibility of a single organisation emerging after the bidding process, but he and other ministers are thought to favour the split into separate regions. Their thinking has been influenced by criticism over previous utility privatisations that overpowerful monopolies or duopolies have been created in the gas and electricity sectors. Offering the business for sale in five regions is the most likely way of attracting a significant number of buyers, Mr Eggar believes. By splitting up the sale, the government has responded to emerging companies such as RJB Mining, based in Nottinghamshire and recently floated on the Stock Exchange, and Ryan International, with interests in Wales and the north-east of England, which might be interested in bidding. The government has also increased the chances of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers having some stake in the industry. For instance, the UDM might be able to launch a management buy-out for the Nottinghamshire mines. Such a consideration is important because many ministers believe the government owes a debt to the union for keeping mines open during the 1984-85 strike. Regional privatisation also offers buy-out possibilities to British Coal managers at positions lower than board level. In selling off the company, the government is anxious to avoid a simple transfer of the organisation to the private sector with its structures and management intact. It believes fresh managers are needed but is keen to encourage the second tier of British Coal management to join the bidding. The recent contraction in the industry has contributed to the exodus by many disillusioned executives and managers, but there is still enthusiasm among some for the sell-off. Mr Bryan Riddleston, British Coal's opencast director in Wales, is among those who might bid for the region in which he works. When he talks about anthracite, a naturally smokeless fuel mined in Wales, he refers to it as 'black diamonds'. 'It is what everyone wants to get their hands on at privatisation,' he says. 'It is the best anthracite in the world. The management here (in Wales opencast) all want to be involved in the business after privatisation, although it is too early too early to say whether we will want to be employees or running the business.' He says, however, that he wants to see how the government will assess responsibility for any future claims arising, for example, from subsidence. If he is satisfied that he will not be saddled with enormous liabilities, then, like all other bidders, he will look closely at the future market for coal. There is little cause for cheer, particularly after 1998 when contracts with the UK's two electricity generators end. Caminus Energy, the UK consultancy, suggested in a report to the government this year that the total annual sales for British Coal's successors in England and Wales could be as low as 23m tonnes or as high as 54m. The lower figure would inevitably lead to further pit closures above British Coal's current rationalisation programme, which is likely to leave only 12 to 15 pits out of about 30 still in operation. Caminus's gloomier forecast would result in perhaps just half a dozen working pits. Given such uncertainty, why would mining companies want to bid for any of the regions? The answer is that some in the industry believe Caminus's higher forecast may be attainable and even beatable. In the short term, there is also scope for considerable profit in each region. In Scotland, where British Coal has just signed a five-year agreement with Scottish Power to supply 2m tonnes of coal for Pounds 400m, there is also some medium-term certainty. Like the Wales and north-east regions, the Scotland package will contain considerable amounts of opencast, which is much cheaper to mine than deep coal. On the other hand, Yorkshire and the Midlands are attractive because they are likely to contain all but perhaps three of the 12 to 15 remaining deep mines which provide the lion's share of coal to the generators, whose power stations are concentrated in those regions. All five regions should have contracts with the generators, ensuring their value to potential investors. 'Some may turn out to be short-term businesses but they can still make a lot of money over three years,' says Mr Dieter Helm, director of the consultancy, Oxford Economic Research Association. The government may thus find that its coal sell-off proceeds more smoothly than some observers have anticipated. The big question remains what British Coal's successors will do with the pits after the electricity contracts terminate in 1998. If markets in the UK continue to contract, the likelihood is another big round of mine closures. Then, privatisation will be seen as nothing more than a prelude to the slow death of an industry rather than the regeneration the government says it intends.</p>

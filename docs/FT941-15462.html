			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Investment banking division helps lift Bear Stearns 110% Bear Stearns, the New York securities house, yesterday announced a 110 per cent jump in its second fiscal quarter profits to Dollars 134.8m, or Dollars 1.05 a share. Revenues during the period totalled Dollars 752.1m, up sharply from Dollars 454.7m a year earlier. The record performance from Bear Stearns, which is the first securities house to report its profits for the December quarter, suggests the long boom in earnings on Wall Street is far from over, in spite of the recent upturn in US interest rates. Since 1990, declining US interest rates, strong demand from investors for stocks and bonds, and heavy activity in corporate underwriting and other investment banking and financial advisory businesses have kept securities industry profits on a steady upward path. Bear Stearns said yesterday its record-breaking second quarter was a reflection of strength in all its main business lines. Investment banking revenues posted the biggest growth, jumping 180 per cent from a year ago to Dollars 176.9m as more companies sought the firm's underwriting and mergers and acquisitions advisory services. Revenues from principal transactions, which climbed 58 per cent to Dollars 363.4m, remained Bear Stearns' prime source of income, as would be expected at a firm with a long reputation as an aggressive trading house. Earnings from brokerage, clearing and private client services rose 23 per cent to Dollars 129.5m, while interest and dividends brought in Dollars 326.5m. The firm's total non-interest expenses increased by 51 per cent to Dollars 520.2m, primarily because of a big jump in employee compensation and benefits, which are tied to business performance. Investors responded positively to Bear Stearns' earnings report, pushing up the share price by Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / N Korea in grip of 'collapsists' and 'gradualists': Some new (and some old) delights for Pyongyang watchers NORTH KOREA is on the brink of collapse. The 81-year-old president Kim Il-sung, who has ruled the country since 1945, is dying. His son and heir, Mr Kim Jong-il, has been severely injured in a car crash. There is unrest in the army. A group of high-ranking military officers have been executed for plotting a coup. Meanwhile, food riots are sweeping the country as a hungry populace faces the threat of starvation. That is what is happening in North Korea according to the rumours and reports that have circulated in Seoul this summer. But many of these same stories have been heard for the past decade and the latest spate of reports are either unconfirmed or have proved to be false. For example President Kim and his son were certainly not bedridden when they appeared at a ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Korean War armistice recently. Sources of information on North Korea are scanty: the country's media, diplomats based in the capital Pyongyang, the occasional defector, and foreign travellers, mainly ethnic Koreans who are allowed to visit relatives. 'North Korea is a great black hole in terms of information and people like to fill it with their own wishful thoughts,' said Mr Michael Breen, a consultant on North Korea for Seoul-based Merit Communications. 'Anti-communists look for signs of imminent collapse, while South Korean officials, who prefer a gradual approach to unification, search for evidence of stability in the north.' The difference in interpretation also extends to North Korea watchers, who are divided into two camps: 'collapsists' who foresee the swift downfall of North Korea, and 'gradualists' who believe that the country can survive if pragmatic economic reforms are introduced soon. 'We know the economic situation in North Korea is serious,' said Mr Tae Hwan Ok, research director for the Research Institute for National Unification. 'But there is little reliable information to know what is really happening there.' There are few doubts that the North Korean economy is deteriorating after more than a decade of stagnant growth. A drastic cut in economic aid, including vital oil supplies, from China and Russia, has caused an energy shortage and greatly reduced industrial production. South Korea's central bank estimates that the North Korean economy contracted by 7.6 per cent in 1992 for a third consecutive year of decline, after a 3.7 per cent drop in 1990 and a 5.2 per cent drop in 1991. Adding to the economic problems is a shortfall in grain production, the result of bad weather and a lack of fertilisers and pesticides as the energy-strapped petrochemical industry fails to meet demand. There have been persistent rumours of food riots in the country since 1991, although none has been confirmed by reliable sources, according to South Korean officials. There has been speculation that spreading food riots may be the reason why North Korea has tightened restrictions on foreigners travelling to the country since May. Pyongyang, for example, reduced sailings this summer of a passenger ship that carries Korean-Japanese visitors between Niigata, Japan and Chongjin, North Korea. It said yesterday that regular sailings would be resumed next week. However, said on analyst, 'food shortages would more likely occur in early spring as stocks become depleted after the main fall harvest rather than during the summer when other food products are available'. Instead, the travel restrictions may be related to North Korea's dispute with the international community over the inspection of its nuclear facilities, he said. 'The North Koreans don't want foreigners prying around at such a sensitive time.' Most North Korea watchers believe, however, that there have been isolated raids on local grain depots and food supply trucks by hungry citizens. 'Our assessment is that public loyalty to Kim Il-sung remains firm despite the economic problems,' said Mr Ok. 'We see no indication of a revolution brewing from the bottom up.' If a food riot took on anti-government overtones, it would be quickly crushed, he added. However, the Korean peninsula is expected to suffer a poor grain harvest this autumn because of a cool summer, resulting in a dwindling food supply for North Korea by early 1994. A sign of trouble at the top was offered this week by a North Korean defector, a 30-year-old army lieutenant, who claimed that a group of military officers were executed last December for planning a military coup. There have been similar rumours of coup attempts in 1986, 1991 and 1992, although there has been no evidence to support the claims. 'He's not lying, but he appears to repeating rumours he heard in the barracks room,' said Mr Breen, who said such stories are one of the attractions of analysing North Korea. 'The beauty of North Korea watching is that it allows your imagination to roam.'</p>

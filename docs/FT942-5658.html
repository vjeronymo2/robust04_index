			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Executive volunteers Sir, Companies such as Tesco, Royal Mail, National Power, Unilever and The Body Shop would all confirm the value of volunteering by managers: it enriches their skills and extends their talents. It need not, however, be constrained through 'lack of time' ('Managers volunteer surplus expertise', May 30). NatWest managers give a lunch hour a week to tutor pupils in Islington schools, Coopers and Lybrand and the London Stock Exchange build stronger teams by tackling tree planting on an inner-city farm or building flower beds in Tower Hamlets on one Saturday a year. The article calls for a brokering service: if it is needed, it is available now. CSV has more than 3,000 projects nationwide awaiting employee volun-teers.

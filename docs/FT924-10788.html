			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sir Leon Brittan joins row over capital standards - IOSCO Conference SIR Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, yesterday became involved in the growing row between financial regulators over capital requirements for banks and securities firms. Sir Leon criticised remarks which Mr Richard Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, had made in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday. Mr Breeden had warned that a recently-adopted EC capital adequacy directive (or CAD) was unsafe. Sir Leon denied this last night: 'It is certainly not as some have claimed unsafe.' In a further attack on Mr Breeden's refusal to agree to Iosco's proposal for a common international capital standard, Sir Leon said: 'In today's global markets, no single national regulator . . . can expect to impose their system on everyone else'. Mr Breeden was also criticised by Mr Andrew Large, the chairman of the UK's Securities and Investments Board, who said he did not think it was proper for Mr Breeden to cast aspersions against the capital standards of other countries. His remarks were made after an emergency meeting of Iosco's technical committee, which was called to discuss the widening gulf between the SEC and other securities regulators on a new international standard which would establish a minimum capital level to be maintained by securities firms. Some regulators had been hopeful that three years of negotiations on the capital standard might be close to conclusion. They had not been aware of Mr Breeden's fundamental objections, they said. However, the SEC said last night it was baffled by the reaction of other regulators: 'We have been consistent for three years', an official said. No agreement is possible without the consent of the SEC, since it is regulator of the world's biggest securities market in the US. The dispute between the SEC and other regulators centres on the amount of capital which securities firms should hold to cover the risk of losses on equity portfolios. The SEC wants a securities firms to maintain a high minimum capital level, along the lines of rules in force in the US. The SIB wants a formula which would encourage securities firms to hedge their equity portfolios by using netting techniques. The SIB believes that netting - in its simplest form offsetting a holding of shares with a matching contract to sell other shares - reduces the risks faced by securities firms. It argues that the SEC's proposed amendments to the Iosco draft standard would discourage securities firms from using netting techniques. Mr Jean Saint-Geours, chairman of France's Commission des Operations de Bourse, who takes over as head of Iosco's technical committee tomorrow, suggested a new approach to capital adequacy discussions which could allow different capital rules to apply to shares from different countries.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 4 May carries the "Details" program  hosted by Nikolay Svanidze. Svanidze is speaking to Viktor  Vasilyevich Ilyushin, President Yeltsin's adviser, on the work  of the Presidential Council -- the president's personal think  tank.    Ilyushin says experts for the Presidential Council are  normally recruited on an ad hoc basis, usually to give expert  advice on a specific problem. They are drawn from a wide range  of specialists who are well-known in their field of expertise  and are politically loyal to the president.    [Ilyushin] "It is assumed that even when the experts invited  to discuss a certain issue have opposite points of view on a  given subject, they are not in opposition to the president  himself. For example, you remember there was a well-known expert  on Yevgeniy Kiselev's `Itogi' program -- Yuriy Baturin. There  was also Georgiy Satarov. Both of them are now the president's  aides."    Ilyushin says the Presidential Council does not meet on a  regular basis. "At the beginning, the question of regular  meetings was raised by members of the Presidential Council. We  tried to do this, but after a while, arrived at the conclusion  that this is an outmoded way to work. We should meet only when  the president needs our advice. One knows Boris Nikolayevich  [Yeltsin]: If he has already decided something, it will be  difficult to make him change his mind, although not always  impossible."    Asked why it is so difficult for Russian journalists to get  an exclusive interview with Yeltsin, whereas several were  recently given to foreign media, Ilyushin says perhaps this has  something to do with the president's personal preferences.  Yeltsin does often answers journalists' questions nevertheless,  and the recent interviews with foreign agencies were connected  with the publication of Yeltsin's latest book.    Svanidze rounds up the program by saying that due to the  nature of his work, Viktor Ilyushin is a man who knows a lot and  says very little and this is why he has been working with and  has enjoyed the confidence of the president for such a long time.</p>

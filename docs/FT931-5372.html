			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Tokyo hit by trade policy wrangle AN intense bureaucratic fight is under way in Tokyo over Japan's trade policy and the extent to which the economy should be stimulated to increase demand for imports. This comes as Japan's current account surplus rose 82.9 per cent in January from the year before to Dollars 5.21bn. The figures, published yesterday, will intensify pressure on Japan to boost its domestic economy to cut its trade surplus. The steep rise in the surplus comes as Tokyo is attempting to formulate its trade policy towards the US before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, visits Washington next month. The surplus is likely to expand further before Mr Miyazawa's visit as the US economy sucks in Japanese exports and the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar boosts their value in dollar terms. The dollar closed at an all-time low in Tokyo yesterday of Y116.47. A Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey published yesterday found that 84 per cent of major companies were being hit by the yen's appreciation, while 60 per cent said they would have to take streamlining measures if the yen continued to rise in the next few weeks. Unadjusted, January's trade surplus, which excludes services, expanded by 18 per cent to Dollars 7.03bn, mainly because modest growth in exports was combined with the continuing slump in Japanese demand for imports. Exports in January rose to Dollars 23.67bn from Dollars 23.39bn a year before, while imports dropped to Dollars 16.64bn from Dollars 17.43bn. The January figures mean that the aggregate current account surplus in the first 10 months of the fiscal year ending this March stands at Dollars 95.44bn, already more than the record surplus of Dollars 94.1bn recorded in 1986. The aggregate trade surplus for the first 10 months of the financial year was Dollars 108.27bn, a 22.6 per cent rise on the same period last year.</p>

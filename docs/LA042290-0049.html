			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES ART: IS IT A (WORLD) CLASS ACT?  </P> <P> George Santayana once said, "Most people think that genius is as common as  cheese, whereas it is as rare as love." Christopher Knight's "Is L.A. a  World-Class Art City?" (April 8) was well intentioned and made some good points  but didn't bite the real bullet.  </P> <P> The trouble is that he confuses art success with institutional and commercial  success. Nothing could be farther apart. Art is simply much harder to do than  you think.  </P> <P> You can't (and never will) have a real art city, center, movement, whatever, if  you persist in calling second-class art first-class art. It's as simple as  that.  </P> <P> What passes as first-class art is mainly halfhearted, half-understood,  half-achieved art efforts that have been puffed up by culturally illiterate  taste makers; these pass off the second-rate goods largely to perpetuate their  authority and to ingratiate themselves with a possibly more ignorant collector  class whose interest it is to call it all art so that they can make power plays  with their money and social networks (including museums).  </P> <P> The thing that has made New York an art town is not the money, the hype, the  hoke, the museums, but the continuing existence of a relatively few artists who  aspire to serious achievement. The rest is a media success.  </P> <P> Marcel Duchamp (influential but himself somewhere between a second- and a  third-rate artist) held that when times were bad for art, the real artists  would go underground. That's where most of them are now -- but the promoters  and the puffers-up will never discover it.  </P> <P> LOUIS FINKELSTEIN  </P> <P> (A visiting New Yorker)  </P> <P> Temecula, Calif.  </P></p>

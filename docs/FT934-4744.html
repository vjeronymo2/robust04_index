			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Argyll to write down its stores Food retail group Argyll warned yesterday its profits would be reduced by about Pounds 40m this year by its decision to start depreciating its store values. The move could knock tens of millions of pounds off other food retailers' earnings. Argyll, which owns the Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost chains, also admitted price competition was putting pressure on its gross profit margin, and had persuaded it to cut capital spending this year from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m. Its announcement came as it reported a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 217.3m. Stripping out Pounds 2.1m property profits, the figures were at the lower end of expectations, and the shares slid 23p to 256p. Argyll's decision to depreciate buildings over 40 years, and review its depreciation policy on fixtures and fittings, followed growing pressure from the City. Fears about sustainability of margins and returns on capital had raised the question of whether superstore assets should be depreciated over their useful lives. Analysts had warned that food retailers might otherwise be forced to make big one-off write-downs. If Argyll's main competitors decide to follow suit, their larger property portfolios mean they could suffer from even bigger depreciation charges. Analysts suggested J Sainsbury's earnings could be reduced by as much as Pounds 60m or Pounds 70m, and Tesco's by about Pounds 70m, if they adopted Argyll's policy. Tesco has hinted privately it may follow Argyll, but Sainsbury has consistently denied any need to depreciate its superstores. 'It doesn't really matter whether the others follow suit,' said Mr Frank Davidson, analyst at James Capel. 'All investors now, when looking at the earnings of Tesco and Sainsbury, will work out what they would have been on Argyll's devaluation basis.' Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, insisted Argyll could withstand growing price competition by exploiting its scale, efficiency and the strength of its own label. In spite of the price pressure, the operating margin at the main Safeway chain increased in the first half from 7.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, and market share from 5.6 per cent to 5.9 per cent.

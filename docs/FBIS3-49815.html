			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 15 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat  commander General Ante Roso said on Saturday [15 January] he had  ordered his troops to bomb, if neccesary, the explosives factory  in Vitez which has been the target of fierce Moslem attacks in  the pasts few days. Vowing not to allow the enemy to take  control of the factory, General Roso said in a statement  broadcast on Zagreb television that the Moslems were fiercely  attacking Vitez and Novi Travnik, but that the local Croat  troops were successfully yielding [as received] to the pressure.    Commenting on the situation in central Bosnia, he said the  fiercest Croat-Moslem fighting had been reported in the Lasva  river valley.    The Bosnian Croat commander also said he had not accepted or  signed any ceasefire at the latest round of talks with Bosnian  Moslem commander Rasim Delic, noting that comprehensive  political documents were needed for such an agreement.

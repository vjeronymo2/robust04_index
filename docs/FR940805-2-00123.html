The Revenue Bonds will be issued to refinance the costs of certain pollution control and/or sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at Georgia Power's facilities located in Burke County. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Revenue Bonds will bear an interest rate equal to 6.375% per annum, which may be convertible to a rate that fluctuates in accordance with a specified prime or base rate or rates or may be determined pursuant to certain remarketing or auction procedures. The Authority has entered into underwriting arrangements pursuant to which the underwriters will purchase the Revenue Bonds from the Authority at a purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. Georgia Power will pay the underwriting fee, which is equal to 1.498% of the aggregate principal amount of the Revenue Bonds. Such arrangements will result in a true interest cost to Georgia Power of 6.489% per annum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Revenue Bonds will mature on August 1, 2024 and may, if it is deemed advisable for purposes of marketability, be entitled to the benefit of a mandatory redemption sinking fund calculated to retire a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Revenue Bonds prior to maturity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the Agreement, the Authority will lend to Georgia Power the proceeds of the sale of the Revenue Bonds. Under the Agreement, Georgia Power will pay the Authority amounts at times and in amounts which shall correspond to the payments with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the related Revenue Bonds whenever and in whatever manner the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, upon redemption or declaration or otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proceeds from the sale of the Revenue Bonds will be deposited with a trustee (``Trustee'') under an indenture to be entered into between the Authority and the Trustee, pursuant to which such Revenue Bonds are to be issued and secured. Also, the Agreement will provide for the assignment to the Trustee of the Authority's interest in, and of the monies receivable by the Authority under, the Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgia Power may be required to purchase any of the Revenue Bonds, or any of the Revenue Bonds may be subject to mandatory redemption, at any time if the interest thereon is determined to be subject to federal income tax. Also in the event of taxability, interest on those Revenue Bonds may be effectively converted to a higher rate, and Georgia Power also may be required to indemnify the bondholders against any other additions to interest, penalties and additions to tax. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Georgia Power currently has outstanding certain first mortgage bonds issued under an indenture dated as of March 1, 1941 between Georgia Power and Chemical Bank, as trustee, as supplemented and amended (``Mortgage''). In order to obtain the benefit of ratings for the Revenue Bonds equivalent to the rating of these mortgage bonds, Georgia Power will deliver to the Trustee a series of first mortgage bonds, to be issued under the Mortgage, as collateral for its obligations to the Authority related to the Revenue Bonds (``Collateral Bonds''). The aggregate principal amount of such Collateral Bonds would be equal to either: (1) the principal amount of the related Revenue Bonds, if the Collateral Bonds are interest-bearing; or (2) the sum of such principal amount of those Revenue Bonds plus interest payments thereon for a specified period, if the Collateral Bonds are not interest-bearing. The Collateral Bonds will mature on the maturity date of the Revenue Bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proceeds from the sale of the Revenue Bonds will be applied by Georgia Power to the redemption of $126.725 million principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia), 12% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), Third Series 1984.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

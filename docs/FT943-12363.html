			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Kobe Steel plans Chinese venture Kobe Steel, the Japanese steel and construction equipment maker, has agreed with Chengdu Engineering Machinery Group of China to set up a joint venture company to manufacture and market construction machinery in China. The agreement, to be signed today, marks the first joint venture involving a Japanese company making construction machinery in China. The joint venture, Kobelco Chengdu Machinery, will initially be capitalised at Dollars 1m, with Kobe Steel and Chengdu Engineering Machinery each taking a 45 per cent equity stake. Shinso Corporation, a trading company affiliated with Kobe Steel, and Itochu, the Japanese trading company, will also own 5 per cent each. Kobelco Chengdu Machinery will initially make, market and service 50 units of hydraulic excavators and other types of Kobe Steel's construction machinery. Full-scale production is expected to begin after June 1996, when the partners will consider expansion of production facilities and equipment to make 1,000 units and target annual sales of Y10bn (Dollars 101m). The joint venture is likely to be the only one in the construction machinery sector in the rapidly growing southwestern and northwestern regions for some time, as China's Ministry of Machinery Industry has no other plans to authorise similar tie-ups, Kobe Steel said. China is tightening rules on setting up foreign joint ventures with the aim of protecting state assets, guaranteeing payment of capital and cracking down on sham companies, Reuter reports from Beijing. The China Securities newspaper said state companies seeking ventures with foreign companies must report their assets to the state-owned Assets Management Bureau. The new measures also aim to halt delays in paying up joint venture capital.</p>

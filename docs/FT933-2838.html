			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Czech glass maker in first FRN launch THE CZECH Republic's nascent domestic bond market took another step in its development yesterday with the launch of the first issue of floating rate notes (FRNs) by a corporate borrower, writes Antonia Sharpe. Glavunion, the flat glass manufacturer which is 67 per cent owned by Glaverbel of Belgium, raised Kcs350m (Dollars 13m) through an offering of four-year FRNs. The notes carry a semi-annual coupon equivalent to 40 basis points over the Prague interbank offered rate, which currently stands at 12 7/8 per cent. Glavunion, which last year became the first Czech company to issue medium-term bonds in the domestic market, will use the proceeds of the offering to finance its Kcs2.6bn investment programme. The notes were placed with Czech banks and other financial institutions, said an official at lead manager CSFB.</p>

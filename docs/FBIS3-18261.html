			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "DeT": "Aviation Negotiations Without Result"] </F>   [Text] Washington -- The German-American aviation  negotiations in Washington have collapsed. After two weeks of  negotiations, the German delegation left without having achieved  a result. Therefore, the planned alliance between Lufthansa and  the largest U.S. carrier, United Airlines, continues to be  blocked.    The talks were supposed to complete the elementary agreement  achieved in September. However, the U.S. Administration made  use of some technical gaps to torpedo the agreement. Until the  very last moment, the delegation from the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT) demanded that U.S. airlines once again  receive unlimited access to the German market. Lufthansa rights  in the United States, on the other hand, were to be restricted.    Before the departure, the Federal Government once again  offered comprehensive concessions to the U.S. side, among others  in the field of the so-called third-country code sharing as well  as regarding the number of permissible weekly frequencies. A  U.S. response has not yet been received. Thus, the conditions  of the elementary agreement remain valid, which results in  disadvantages for both sides. Lufthansa now cannot cooperate  with United. However, the Americans also have their hands tied:  The number of weekly flights that Northwest wants to offer  together with KLM from the United States via Amsterdam to  Germany is limited to 140. In addition, only one U.S. airline  may offer code sharing flights with a third-country airline  beyond the FRG. In addition, the weekly frequencies across the  North Atlantic will be frozen at the level of last October.    A leading airline lobbyist in Washington said that "we are  all losers in this situation." The decisive point for the  unsatisfactory result was the influence of Delta Airline  lobbyists in Washington. Via a complaint, Delta had demanded  more rights for its own dispatching at Frankfurt airport. If  these rights are not granted, the entire agreement should become  pointless, it was argued.  <H5>  Disadvantage for Lufthansa </H5>   For Lufthansa, which sees the cooperation agreement as an  important building block on its path toward recovery, this limbo  is particularly critical. The German state airline expects  code-sharing across the North Atlantic to provide it with many  times the additional revenues that it would lose in European  business as a result of concessions to the Americans. DOT  circles speak of up to 1 billion German marks. United Airlines  is also disappointed about the collapse of the talks. A  spokesman said in Washington that "the American attitude was  intolerable right down to the last minute and violates the  spirit of free trade."</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Cardoso further ahead of rivals Brazil's former finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has pulled further ahead in the presidential election race, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The poll, one of the largest yet carried out and published by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, suggested Mr Cardoso was far enough ahead of his rivals to win outright in the first round of voting in October without a second round run-off in November. The poll, which backs others published in recent days, gives Mr Cardoso the support of 43 per cent of the electorate. This compares with only 23 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party (PT). Mr Cardoso's rise in popularity is almost entirely due to optimism over the Real, the country's new currency, which was introduced on July 1 and has led to sharply lower inflation. Mr Cardoso negotiated the currency and other measures through Congress, before resigning as finance minister to run for president. Since the Real's launch, his support has more than doubled from 21 per cent. Support for Mr da Silva, universally known as Lula, has fallen during the same period from 38 per cent. Mr da Silva's advisers hope his share of the vote has now stabilised and they can renew their attack on Mr Cardoso. But there is concern in the PT that the election will be over in the first round. Under Brazil's rules, the first round winner becomes president if he polls more than his combined rivals. According to the latest poll, Mr Cardoso would win in the first round because Mr da Silva and the other challengers have a combined vote of only 38 per cent. This is the first time Mr Cardoso's lead over his combined competition has exceeded the poll's margin of error of 2 per cent. Mr Cardoso's rise has led to heady sessions on Sao Paulo's stock market. The Bovespa index made its seventh successive advance on Monday and has increased nearly 16 per cent in the last week. World Stock Markets, Page 27</p>

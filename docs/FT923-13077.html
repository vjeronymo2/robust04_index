			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Charming words as a reasonable couple divorces JUST ONCE in a while, on rare occasions, the theatrical bear pit that is the House of the Commons transforms itself into something akin to the real world. The natural hyperbole of party politics falls away and a gust of reality cuts the fuggy atmosphere of stale rhetoric that hangs like a pall of cigar smoke across the chamber. There were no clues before prime minister's questions yesterday that this miracle was about to occur. But the knowledge that this was the last session, after a run of nine years, at which Mr Neil Kinnock would sit on Labour's front benches as opposition leader had created an air of anticipation. When he rose to a resounding cheer from his own backbenches, Mr Kinnock's tone was not hectoring but considered. Did the prime minister recall his election promise that a Tory victory would provide the spark for recovery, he asked. Where was it? Mr Major postponed his reply to offer a tribute. Thanking his opponent for support in times of crisis, he said: 'I am very pleased to have the opportunity to thank you for that and to do so publicly and with warmth.' The disarming tone was followed by a calm reiteration of the government's determination to keep pressure on inflation as its highest priority. As the house fell silent, Mr Kinnock caught the mood, thanking the prime minister for his words and stating that it had been a great honour to serve the country. 'I know that this is a vocation which you share and I hope that the country generally and the people in it can achieve greater success in the future.' Returning to his official duties, Mr Kinnock warned that government economic strategy had 'all of the features of the slump in the 1930s.' 'For the sake of our country, you should now recognise that to continue with those same policies will not bring durable or sustainable recovery and certainly will not bring a country 'at ease with itself'.' At a volume barely above that of a drawing-room conversation, the prime minister politely demurred. Sustainable recovery, he said, could only be based on sustainable growth and low inflation. Like a reasonable couple involved in a painful divorce, the two agreed to disagree. Later, it emerged that Downing Street had privately suggested to Mr Kinnock's office on Monday that he 'bowl a slow one'. In character to the last, the leader of the opposition had formally declined - then done so. It was all too civilised to be true. In October, normal service will be resumed.</p>

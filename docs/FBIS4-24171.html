			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, </F> commander of Operation Turquoise, by correspondent Patrick  Poivre d'Arvor in Goma, Zaire -- live]    [Text] [D'Arvor] With us is General Jean-Claude Lafourcade,  who heads Operation Turquoise, that is, the whole of this French  operation in Rwanda. We get the impression that the first stage  of your operation is first and foremost, a diplomatic one: You  have tried to convince the people you met that you were coming  with good intentions.    [Lafourcade] Listen, we have begun to carry out the mission  entrusted to us by the United Nations, the mission that is to  put an end to the massacres in Rwanda, and we are also setting  up a system that, as you can see, is a large-scale one. It will  take a few days to set up this system, but we did not want to  wait until we went to Rwanda to go on the first reconnaissance  missions to refugee camps and start showing our faces in order  to put an end to the massacres. I believe that this mission has  been going well so far.    [D'Arvor] Do you intend to go further, for instance, as far  as Kigali?    [Lafourcade] My UN mandate--that is, Resolution 929--does  not  require me to go to Kigali. My mandate is to put an end to the  massacres by using force if necessary against those  troublemakers who carried out all those crimes. I am starting  by discovering refugee camps. We are seeing what is what there  so that humanitarian organizations can see what the situation is  like....    [D'Arvor, interrupting] If need be, could you evacuate them?    [Lafourcade] For the time being, there has not been any talk  of evacuation at my level, but humanitarian organizations in the  background are going to take care of this problem, and we have  in our force a unit that is dealing with this problem, together  with the humanitarian organizations.    [D'Arvor] It is obvious that your mission is to be the link  until the arrival of the UN troops. Is your mandate--the  precise mandate of the French forces--really going to end at the  end of July, as has been said, or as the prime minister has said?    [Lafourcade] You know that some foreign countries are  currently willing to take part in this UN force which will be  called UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] II. In the  mandate that I have received from the United Nations--that  France has received from the United Nations--there was a delay  spanning about two months. I do not know how this increase has  come about, but I think that, together with General  Dallaire--who is in Kigali and is currently the commander of the  UNAMIR I force--we will organize the hand over of the baton.    [D'Arvor] Thank you very much, General Lafourcade.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Thing" program] </F>   [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets has  expressed satisfaction with the progress made to establish the  international association RosCuba, which consists of Russian and  Cuban enterprises. During a meeting in Moscow with Leonel Soto,  vice president of the Council of Ministers, Soskovets praised  the signing of the statutes of the joint enterprise, which set  the required legal basis for the operations of the organization.    A Cuban delegation spokesman said Soskovets believes that  the  creation of the RosCuba association is an important step in the  opening of solid possibilities of economic and trade cooperation  between both nations.    Lionel Soto described the quest for trade mechanisms beyond  that of state structures as positive. Soskovets and Soto agreed  in praising the fulfillment of the accords signed on 24 December  when both signed the document forming the association. Soskovets  and Soto also discussed the possibility of completing the  construction of a nuclear plant in Cienfuegos by creating a  joint enterprise.</p>

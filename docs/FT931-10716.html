			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trimming fat for the food industry - A man who makes his living selling food for thought VISITORS TO Verner Wheelock's office come face to face with a large, grumpy-looking gorilla staring from a poster. 'Try telling him fruit 'n' veg are for wimps,' the legend says. Since 1990, Wheelock has run a small company which earns most of its income advising big food suppliers how to dish up healthier nourishment. In 1990, he left Bradford university - where he was a lecturer in the department of science and society and head of its food policy research unit - to make his living in the private sector. In particular, Wheelock is grappling with the government's recently-published targets for cutting the fat content of the sticky bun and pork pie diet of the average Briton. This would lower the UK's chronic incidence of heart disease. 'Unless there is a positive drive on the part of the food industry, I don't think we'll get there,' he says. 'Food companies have had a fairly rigid viewpoint that dietary recommendations don't really have any impact on them, that it's none of their business, and that it's up to individuals to choose. But their mental block is gradually being eroded.' Wheelock, 54, does not spend all his time worrying about fat. 'I see my function as operating somewhere between technology and science on the one hand, and marketing and public relations on the other, with food safety and healthy eating as specialist interests. 'I'm basically in the information business,' he says. 'I understand nutrition issues but I also understand how the food industry works. That is a difference to most academics, who do not understand the pressures and constraints on industry.' He says his role is to provide 'input, some factual information, interpretation and insight.' He says food companies often are too insular and too short of staff to monitor legislation and trends. Verner Wheelock Associates was set up in 1990. It has a yearly turnover of Pounds 140,000, with Pounds 100,000 coming from fees. A handful of companies, including McDonald's, the Danish Bacon and Meat Council and Marlow Foods, an ICI subsidiary, pay fixed retainers. Training seminars on food hygiene bring in Pounds 25,000, and conferences on food safety and legislation Pounds 10,000. Wheelock publishes a ten-issues-a-year magazine, Food Policy Update, which attracts a further Pounds 10,000. His three-room premises in Bradford cost just Pounds 5,000 a year to rent. When he set up his business, Wheelock chose to form a co-partnership with a well-established group, Moy Park, a Northern Ireland food maker. Moy Park injected more than half of the Pounds 20,000 start-up capital, retains a majority interest in the company, and has two people on Wheelock Associates' board. Wheelock says this relationship has provided invaluable aid in managing day-to-day finances. Moy Park does not interfere with its work, and all reports Wheelock prepares for other companies remain confidential. He had fancied running his own business for years and took the chance offered by the university's early retirement package to realise the ambition. He concedes that the food scares of the late 1980s - eggs, listeria, a few outbreaks of botulism - were a 'bonus' for his business. They pushed the government into introducing the Food Safety Act in 1991; this included many proposals made in the mid-1980s but shelved by ministers. 'Food wasn't a political issue then.' A white paper on the health of England (there are separate ones for other parts of the UK) calls for reductions in total fat in the average diet by 12 per cent, and by 35 per cent for saturated fat. The government wants to cut the death rate from heart disease and related illnesses in people under 60 by 40 per cent by the end of the century. Wheelock says some companies are responding. He lists Heinz, Nestle and Tesco, the supermarket chain. A recent survey said the basic McDonald's 'burger had the least fat of 'burgers tested. 'There used to be 4.5 per cent lard in McDonald's buns but now it is 3 per cent vegetable oil.' The wider issue of health and the food industry is Wheelock's most fruitful area. Cases of food poisoning rose through the 1980s from 10,000 to 30,000 and, in spite of the furore of the late '80s, have jumped by another 50 per cent since 1988. But Wheelock views some worries with scepticism. 'One in two deaths are due to diseases of the heart and arteries - yet, we worry about listeria and additives. I mean, who has died from additives?' He believes the thrust of the government's proposals on healthy eating are sound. But he insists that moves towards healthy eating are hindered by the growth of what has been termed Britain's 'underclass'. Wheelock says: 'It is a big problem for the rest of society. A family's over-riding consideration is often getting enough food to fill bellies. It is often the food part of their budget that is necessarily squeezed. Cheap food that provides bulk is high in fat and sugars.' He is interested in the whole food chain. 'There has been a shift in the balance of power away from agriculture and food manufacturing towards retailers and consumers.' Even so, 'farmers remain producer rather than consumer orientated. The EC acts as a form of insulation that prevents them from being exposed to the market. In the long run, that will make it worse for them.'

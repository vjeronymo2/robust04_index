			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: A VICTORY FOR THE MUMBLERS  </P> <P> The event rated only a small story in the paper: "Effort to Limit City  Officials to Two Terms Abandoned."  </P> <P> Yet, it was an intriguing bit of news. A group of activists fell short of  obtaining enough signatures to place a two-term Los Angeles City Charter  amendment before the voters in November. The failure didn't make sense. The  ballot's always loaded with confusing, and often useless, measures. In a time  of public outrage with City Hall, this particular proposal looked as if it  should have been an electoral winner.  </P> <P> I found the reason for its failure in Sacramento. There, the Legislature last  year -- quietly -- enacted a law that effectively wiped out the term-limit  campaign.  </P> <P> First, I've got to explain the law. In the past, to place a proposed charter  amendment on a city ballot, you needed enough signatures on petitions to equal  15% of the vote cast for governor in the last election. In Los Angeles, that  amounts to 108,301 signatures.  </P> <P> The new law changed that. It required 15% of all registered voters. Since  gubernatorial voter turnouts are lower than voter registration, the bill had  the effect of increasing the number of required signatures. In Los Angeles, it  almost doubled to 205,448 signatures.  </P> <P> The leaders of the L.A. term limit didn't learn about the change until they  began circulating petitions. They continued the effort, but realized they'd  never make 205,000 in time to make the November ballot. Last week, they gave  up. Knowledgeable in Los Angeles in politics, they'd been stymied in Sacramento  by one of the oldest tricks in the legislative business -- mumbling a bill  through the Legislature.  </P> <P> You mumble when you want to sneak through something that wouldn't stand public  scrutiny. You employ technical, sometimes impenetrable, language. The summary  that accompanies each bill is vague and misleading. In explaining the bill to  fellow lawmakers, you mumble that it makes "technical changes," or "eliminates  obsolete language." Colleagues, with thousands of bills before them, usually  take the explanation at face value and vote aye.  </P> <P> I first encountered the phenomenon in the early 1960s when I was covering the  state Assembly for the Associated Press. Tom Arden, a reporter for the  Sacramento Bee, and I shared the job of sorting and digesting the many bills  introduced each day. We received carbon copies of a brief summary of each bill  -- scores of them on busy days. The summaries were often written in the most  incomprehensible bureaucratese. If authors were skillful or lucky, nobody would  notice the legislation and they'd be able to mumble it into law.  </P> <P> Any time a suspected crook introduced something unintelligible, we'd check it  out. That was time-consuming. For instance, we inquired about anything dealing  with liquor, horse racing or oil. I'm sure we missed many a lemon.  </P> <P> When the Legislature went full-time in 1968, it went in for more disclosure.  Committee consultants, the legislative counsel and the legislative analyst all  prepared thorough analyses of each bill. These were safeguards intended to  prevent the old-time sneakiness.  </P> <P> But they underestimated the power of mumblers, as the L.A. two-term limit  people found out.  </P> <P> The specifics of their downfall began with a seemingly sensible proposal from  the League of California Cities, an organization of mayors and city council  members. Laws governing local elections were scattered through the lawbook. The  league proposed putting them all in the elections code.  </P> <P> The league said it merely wanted to simplify the law. So did the legislator who  introduced the bill on behalf of the league, Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San  Diego). A mumble here, a mumble there, and it sailed into law.  </P> <P> That it created an obstacle for city initiatives, the law's proponents said,  was an unintended consequence. "It wasn't a conspiracy," Chacon said. "Lots of  times, when legislation is enacted, we don't know the consequences."  </P> <P> There's room, though, for a more skeptical analysis. A skeptic might wonder if  there are mayors and city council members who wouldn't mind a third or fourth  term. A skeptic, too, might wonder if there aren't some state lawmakers who  would rather nip in the bud any movement toward a two-term limit.  </P> <P> Despite all the money the Legislature spends on staff members, no analysis of  the bill mentioned the far-reaching change. And there was no debate. Chacon  placed the bill on the "consent calendar," a list of presumably routine  legislation.  </P> <P> "It was passed on consent in both houses under false colors," protested Sen.  Quentin L. Kopp, whose district includes San Francisco, another city where the  bill interfered with a term-limit initiative. Kopp is trying to make San  Francisco exempt from the new requirement, but Brown and Chacon have his bill  bottled up in Chacon's committee.  </P> <P> Mumble. Mumble. Mumble.  </P></p>

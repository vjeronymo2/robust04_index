			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL AND HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> The spirit of fairness that your editorial demonstrates is an inspiration and  hope to millions of Jews, Christians, Muslims and others representing  mainstream America. Our tears should not discriminate, and when out of the  victims of the Holocaust emerge the aggressors and the perpetrators of yet  another holocaust we should stand for justice.  </P> <P> The burning question is perhaps America -- rather than Israel -- and human  rights, for it is America's military aid and the billions of U.S. money that  fueled the Israeli government's actions. America can -- in various ways -- tip  the balance in favor of human rights and a just peace.  </P> <P> H. HATHOUT  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

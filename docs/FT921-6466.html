			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: Good vibrations in Birmingham, but who will help Rhondda? - Michael Cassell travels westwards on his pre-election trip around the country WORKERS stream from the Peugeot-Talbot works at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, where the god of higher productivity has just demanded shorter tea-breaks, to hear their car radios announce that Britain has the lowest strike rate in Europe. 'Hardly surprising, given the state the country's in,' retorts Duncan Simpson, divisional organiser for the AEU engineering union. A former convener at the Coventry plant when Chrysler was the boss and a show of hands emptied the place faster than the fire alarm, Simpson does not praise the Tories for the nation's strike performance. 'What workers are going to stick their necks out now? It doesn't mean it's all sweetness and light.' The truce, however, is not just because of the long shadow of unemployment. There is an underlying consensus in the modern world of industrial relations, where corners are still hard fought but where studied realism takes precedence over gut reaction. Simpson concedes some ground: 'I don't want to see pre-strike ballots go. They were intended to help the employer but have often strengthened our negotiating position as well. We think more strategically. The law made us. 'The days of wildcat strikes and wildcat management have gone. There is a more disciplined approach to labour relations and better communications all round. That's welcome.' But while Simpson still sees the last decade as generally harmful for a unionised workforce down from 12m to 8m, Tom Cannon praises a decade which put trade unions in their place. Cannon is managing director of BSG Group, selling everything from cars to aircraft lavatory cubicles from its headquarters at Yardley, close to Birmingham's centre. Like many of the city's businessmen, the 1980s were kind to him. He earns a high salary which Labour intends to cut, and lives in desirable Dorridge, a seriously wealthy neighbourhood sprinkled with incongruous Brummie accents. To Cannon, Mrs Thatcher and her labour laws were unalloyed good news. 'She displayed an extraordinary, single-minded determination to break the power of organised labour. She handed back to management the right to manage. She also read the riot act to management, much of which was feudalistic and asked for trouble.' Cannon also believes people's pride in their own abilities has been restored. 'They realise the only way to get money is by working for it and not by queuing up at the post office counter.' He says there was far too much easy credit in the 1980s. 'Lots got their fingers burned but they've learned the lesson and won't repeat the same mistakes again.' Some never succumbed to the seductive blandishments of the money-lenders, says Amrik Sahota, chairman of the Institute of Asian Businesses. 'My members' attitudes towards debt have not changed. Few ever contemplate spending more than they can afford.' Sahota says the 1980s were good for Asian entrepreneurs but he is irritated that the advances made by the Asian business community are underestimated. 'People still think of us as just running the corner shop but we have member companies in steel and construction with annual turnovers above Pounds 25m.' The Punjabi Paradise in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, a shabby, unchanging part of Birmingham overlooked by the commercial and artistic renaissance at its core, will need to shift a lot of baltis with black-eyed beans to compete with that. Don Harriman, an electrician from nearby Shirley - 'home of Mandy Rice Davies' - is buying Friday-night dinner for his family. 'Eating out is part of our life now, even if it's cheap and cheerful,' he says. Harriman says his family have 'moved on and up' and he won't be voting Labour because he suspects they might stop him going any further. A lot of people like the Harrimans are doing things they never dreamed about a decade ago. Shirley Hamilton runs her own high-tech business on Aston Science Park. A former Midlands Businesswoman of the Year, she bit the entrepreneurial bullet in 1984 and set up Tech-ni-Plant, a surface treatment specialist with customers worldwide. She has eight staff, a fast, red sports saloon and has already made it to a Downing Street reception. 'I always expected to be an employee. But conditions were created which made it easier for businesses to start. British industry remains, however, very half-hearted in its attitude to innovation and new technology.' Dr Carl Chinn, two years on the dole before picking up his Pounds 40-a-week enterprise allowance as a self-employed historian, says many people made a great deal of headway in the 1980s. With his broad, Black Country twang and matey warmth, he is now Birmingham University's community historian. A chirpy Chinn dismisses talk of the 'selfish' decade: 'If you want to think of owning your own home and car and treating your family to holidays and meals out as selfish, then you can. But it was really a period in which many working-class people achieved what had previously been denied them.' He recognises there were many losers. 'The 1980s will be compared to the 30s. For people in work they were good, but those at the bottom suffered.' Some of that suffering, heightened rather than healed during the last decade, is most obvious a couple of hours' drive away, beyond the Brecon Beacons. In the Welsh valleys a sense of alienation thrives. Antagonism towards Westminster and the priorities and policies it spawns still runs as deep as the old Lewis Merthyr pit. 'Mrs Thatcher did for south Wales what Stalin did for Russia,' says Graham Davies, a Welsh coalfields community campaigner not prone to understatement. The pits which once warmed the world and employed more than a  1/4 m men have all but gone. The last lump of coal from the last pit in the Rhondda Valley was mined more than a year ago and mines like Maerdy and Ynysybwl are props in a heritage industry employing more people than there are miners. The Treforest School of Mines has changed its rather pointless name. Davies says the people of the valleys had their jobs, pride and confidence removed by 'market forces which had no interest in providing something in their place'. The sense of waste, he stresses, is destructive. Canon Bill Morgan, Merthyr Tydfil's new rector, takes time off from arranging Amanda Kelleher's wedding to suggest his job at least is secure. 'I'm all right. Priests are a scarce commodity and there's no shortage of work in places like this.' He likens the position of local people to families suffering a bereavement. 'There are high levels of unhappiness, tension, frustration and anger. If I failed to take a bereavement seriously, I would be shown the door. The government can expect the same fate.' Morgan says that, faced with traumatic change, local authorities had demonstrated all the ingenuity, inventiveness and courageousness which Mrs Thatcher so admired 'but she was hell-bent on clobbering them'. Since Mr Major's arrival, he says, the plight of south Wales has deteriorated further. But there is rebirth as well as death. Scarred hillsides are going and the 'black diamond' of the Rhondda is again turning green, courtesy of the Welsh Development Agency, which last year helped to attract Pounds 860m of inward investment to the country. Even so, valley towns like Merthyr Tydfil, where Keir Hardie cut his teeth as the first Labour MP, find it hard to attract the sexy, Japanese investors moving in along the coast. Through Treherbert, Treorchy and Tonypandy, settlements of miners' cottages, nonconformist chapels and workmen's institutes fight to keep up with change. Here at least, the battle between old and new Britain seems like an unequal struggle. At the Treherbert discount furniture centre, Alun Parry, a former miner who now drives daily to work in Cardiff, wants to replace the bed he was born in 52 years ago. 'The bottom fell out. Bit like this place really. I can buy another bed but can anyone get this place moving again?' Other articles in this series: Monday, Skye; Tuesday, Newcastle upon Tyne; Wednesday, Lincolnshire.

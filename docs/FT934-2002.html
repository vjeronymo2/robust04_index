			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Sea power generator will be installed A Pounds 3m wave energy machine is to be installed off the Caithness coast next year. The Osprey, a full-scale 2MW prototype, is designed to generate 'clean, safe power' in a wide variety of off-shore sites. 'This is the first wave power device that can be mass-manufactured,' said Mr Allan Thomson, managing director of Applied Research and Technology, the Inverness-based engineering company developing Osprey. Osprey will be installed close to AEA Technology's Dounreay nuclear plant and be linked to the electrical grid by power lines installed for the Dounreay Fast Reactor which is due to close next year. It is a partially submerged bell-shaped device containing a column of water. As the water rises and falls, it pushes air through a turbine. The project is backed by the European Union, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, British Steel, GEC Alsthom, Scottish Hydro-Electric and AEA Technology.</p>

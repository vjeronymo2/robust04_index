			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Walesa moves to regain initiative after press attack PRESIDENT Lech Walesa moved swiftly yesterday to regain the political initiative after an unprecedented attack in the widely-read Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. Mr Walesa dismissed the article, which described him as out of his depth and surrounded by incompetent advisers. He called it 'a base and low thing done by low people'. His response came amid growing uncertainty about the stability of the centre-right government of Premier Jan Olszewski. The president hinted last night that he was considering a non-party government of experts. 'It becomes more and more evident that I will have to form an extra-party cabinet to solve problems,' he said on television. 'I don't want to replace Olszewski, but democracy has to be effective,' he said, adding that he planned to consult the prime minister about his involvement in the process of government-building. Last night the government faced a vital vote in parliament on a motion to reimburse pensioners and public servants for pensions and incomes cut last year. If passed, the bill would overturn this year's budget calculations and could force the government's resignation. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, appealed to parliament 'to use its common sense' on the decision and warned that the repayments due could go as high as Zl 60,000bn (Dollars 4bn) if voted through, 'marking a catastrophe for the government's financial situation'. The debate came the day after the collapse of seven weeks of talks with opposition parties on broadening the right-of-centre minority coalition in preparation for tackling tough budgetary measures. In denying that he was becoming politically isolated, Mr Walesa gave strong support to his closest aide, Mr Mieczyslaw Wachowski, who was criticised in the newspaper for protecting former communists in the armed forces and the security apparatus. He described his aide as 'one of the best people who took the blame for everything that went wrong'. In spite of the president's bravado, the situation is dismaying political observers in Warsaw. The Rzeczpospolita newspaper warned: 'We could find ourselves without a government, without parliament, with a president stripped of all authority and an unstable army.' Earlier, Mr Walesa met briefly Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the leader of the Democratic Union and the spokesman for the three opposition parties which decided this week not to accept the terms offered by Mr Olszewski for entering government. He also met Mr Leszek Moczulski, the head of the populist KPN party and conceivably a potential coalition partner for the present government.</p>

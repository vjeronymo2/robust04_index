			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Post Office workforce to fall by 16,000 in five years THE Post Office said yesterday it would reduce its workforce by more than 16,000 over the next five years, in the biggest reduction to date. The move to scale down the corporation comes only weeks before the government is expected to announce its conclusion of the review of the Post Office's structure, which may lead to privatisation. Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office's recently appointed chief executive, denied that the planned job losses had anything to do with the government's future plans for the corporation. He said the Post Office wanted to set in motion a 'virtuous spiral' of greater efficiency, improved services and low prices. However, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'It is also a dire warning of things to come if the government's so-called review of the Post Office leads to privatisation.' The Post Office said it intended to reduce its 200,000 strong workforce by voluntary measures. An official said 7,000 job losses last year were achieved with the agreement of the workforce. About 15,000 jobs will disappear from Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, with a further 1,200 from Post Office Counters, which handles social security payments and sell post office stationery. In London, where the Post Office has suffered more severely in the recession, 2,100 jobs will go next year, leading to a total reduction of around 5,300 by March 1996. Mr Cockburn said the Royal Mail job cuts were designed to increase efficiency and secure the organisation's future. The job cuts at Counters were aimed at driving out red tape, he said. 'What this is about is rationalising the overhead area to drive out red tape and bureaucracy. It doesn't affect the number of post offices. That network will be maintained.' The number of Counters' administrative offices will be cut from 32 to seven. The Welsh administrative office will be merged with one of the English centres, but the Post Office will maintain its Welsh headquarters in Cardiff. The Parcelforce division has already gone through a major rationalisation programme. The Post Office does not expect any 'dramatic' job losses in that business. Mr Cockburn said that the Post Office was planning on a growth rate in mail deliveries of about 8 per cent or 9 per cent over the next five years.</p>

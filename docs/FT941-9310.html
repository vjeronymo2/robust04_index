			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (2): Quango with a beady eye  -The role of the Housing Corporation Many leading property developers have fallen victim to the housing market's biggest slump in recent memory. Yet housing associations have weathered the recession without a single casualty and have been building record numbers of new homes. Much of the credit for this record lies with the Housing Corporation, the quango that regulates more than 2,200 registered housing associations. It keeps a watchful eye over associations' finances, protecting the interests of the taxpayer and the institutional investors who provide their funds. This involves scrutiny of an enormous range of associations, from the tiny Stephen Hutchen's Charity Trust with six homes at Paul in Cornwall to the giant North British Housing Association which has more than 25,000 homes across Britain. The Corporation is also responsible for allocating government grant to housing associations in England, and for encouraging them to make it go as far as possible. Last year, it distributed Pounds 2.3bn of grant, which associations topped up with Pounds 627m of private investment to provide a record number of more than 62,000 homes. The Corporation has been promoting housing associations for 30 years, funding and regulating them since 1974. But it has achieved a new prominence with the funnelling of almost all public housing investment through associations and the need to attract an increasing share of their finance from the capital markets. This higher profile has led to warnings that the Corporation's role in implementing government housing policy could be at odds with its regulatory role of ensuring that associations remain in good financial health. On the one hand, the Corporation must squeeze associations' finances to increase the number of homes provided from a shrinking government grant. This forces associations to push rents up to levels which many tenants find hard to pay, increase borrowing and use older stock as security for new loans. On the other hand, the Corporation must ensure that associations do not take risks with the substantial amounts of government money they receive. The financial failure of a large or medium-sized association would be an acute embarrassment to the movement and could bring down ministerial wrath. More important, a failure would drain institutional investors' confidence in housing associations, making it harder to raise the funds needed to top up the government grant. Since 1988, the capital markets have invested more than Pounds 4bn in associations, and a similar amount is likely to be needed over the next three years. The man who must resolve these conflicting pressures is Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Corporation since 1991. He brings to the job an unusual combination of public and private sector experience. After leaving Oxford in 1967, he joined the old Ministry of Housing as a fast-stream entrant, progressing up the career ladder to assistant secretary level. His time as a civil servant included spells in ministerial private offices and a secondment to the Central Policy Review Staff, the Whitehall thinktank abolished by Mrs Thatcher in 1983. But in 1985, Mayer left the civil service to spend six years with N M Rothschild, the UK merchant bank. By the time of his move to the Housing Corporation in 1991, he had become managing director (administration and finance) of Rothschild Asset Management. This combination of experience has proved invaluable as the budget for housing associations has come under pressure from the Treasury. Mayer knows how to operate in Whitehall where he must fight his corner in the annual public expenditure battle. But he has also been able to act as an advocate for housing associations in the City, persuading the institutions to invest increasing amounts to make up at least some of the loss of grant. 'The existing lenders in the market are very happy with their investments in housing associations,' he says. 'But I want to broaden the investor base which is still curiously restricted. 'With my Rothschild's experience, I see good investment opportunities in associations which are asset-based and can increase their rental income without getting into elasticity problems. A private sector lender is not going to lose money investing in housing associations.' Mayer's priority has been to make far-reaching changes in the Corporation's regulatory procedures in order to improve the confidence of investors in the movement. One important step is the introduction of PLC-type accounts from April. 'Traditional housing association accounts were unintelligible except for the cognoscenti,' he says. 'PLC accounting will make associations much more transparent for the new investor.' The emphasis on regulation has switched from day-to-day monitoring of associations to the collection and analysis of financial and management information. All associations involved in development now complete quarterly financial returns providing information on cash flow, gearing and interest cover. 'We are putting much more emphasis on the financial health of housing associations, their management and the control exercised by their committees,' says Mayer. 'Since 1988, associations have grown into major risk-taking businesses, using financial and treasury techniques appropriate to plcs. They need the expertise and techniques to exercise the responsibility.' And it is the Corporation's success in selling housing associations to the capital markets that is the key to stretching taxpayers' money in public housing, says Mayer. 'In 1989-90, we were getting 2,000 homes for rent from every Pounds 100m of taxpayers' money. This year, we're getting over 3,000 homes - a huge improvement in value for money.' Mayer concedes that this has been achieved partly because of lower construction costs, which have dropped markedly since 1988. Lower interest rates have also helped by reducing the cost of borrowing the higher proportion of finance needed to build each new home. But he also says that the lower grant rates imposed by the government have encouraged associations to become more competitive in bidding for a share of public funds. They are making better use of their existing assets, putting up rents on existing homes to finance the building of new ones and using older stock as collateral for loans. This, says Mayer, has been achieved without undermining their financial wellbeing. 'The movement has survived the worst property market since the war. On a book of more than Pounds 2bn raised for development, there are bad debts of under Pounds 12m - a record that is better than any other sector of the property market.' This record reflects the wisdom of keeping the regulatory role under the same roof as the allocation of government grant, Mayer believes. 'If we are allocating public funds to housing associations, we have an interest in protecting the interests of the taxpayer and the private sector lenders who make the government grant go further. This can be done only if we make sure that associations are well-run and financially healthy.' Powerful backing for retaining the two roles under one roof came last year when the Commons environment select committee recommended that the Corporation should continue to exercise both functions. Nonetheless, the Corporation is only as good as its last decision, says Mayer. 'There is no room for complacency,' he adds. 'I can't guarantee that an association won't take a bad business decision - any more than I can do the same for a private sector company. 'My aim is to ensure that we have the earliest possible warning of any problems so that we can work with the association to get out of them.' Achieving that aim while continuing to squeeze the maximum number of homes out of a diminishing government grant is likely to tax all the skills that Mayer has acquired in his diverse career.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLAND'S 20 BIGGEST HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank      Housing Association                   Units owned*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    1      North British                                23128    2      Anchor                                       22834    3      North                                        22032    4      Merseyside Improved                          15268    5      Sutton HT                                    14421    6      Peabody Foundation FD                        12378    7      Sanctuary                                    12330    8      Broomleigh                                   12265    9      Guinness Trust                               11787   10      London &amp; Quadrant HT                         11649   11      Royal British Legion                         11502   12      Northern Counties                            11163   13      Bradford &amp; Northern                           9164   14      Hanover                                       8581   15      Focus                                         8294   16      Notting Hill                                  8232   17      West Berkshire                                8116   18      Circle 33                                     7649   19      Bedfordshire Pilgrim                          7611   20      Liverpool HT                                  7594  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * as at March, 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCE: The Housing Corporation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Cocoa market in better heart THE COCOA market ended the week in good heart after negotiations on a new international market agreement ended in Geneva yesterday with delegates expressing mild optimism about the prospects for accord between producing and consuming members being reached at the next round of talks in November. No attempt was made to disguise the paucity of concrete progress at the three-week session of the International Cocoa Organisation, which was meeting under the auspices of the UN Committee on Trade and Development. At the final session, producer and consumer delegates highlighted differences over price support targets, limits on amounts withheld from the market and financing. But there appeared to be a feeling that the way had been prepared for more positive progress. 'In the next round of talks on November 2-13, it should be possible to complete our work and have an agreement which is acceptable to both producers and consumers,' said Mr Jan van Sluisveld, the consumer spokesman. Market reaction to such limited progress was understandably muted - the September delivery cocoa price at the London Futures and Options Exchange rose Pounds 13 yesterday to Pounds 612 a tonne. But that was up Pounds 13 on the week and Pounds 57 above Tuesday's low in a continuation of last week's setback. The rally had initially owed more to the absence of producer selling than to buying interest, and it was fed by the triggering of stop-loss selling orders. In the background, however, was concern over a strike by Ghanaian cocoa workers and dry weather in Cote d'Ivoire, the biggest producer. At the London Metal Exchange, all base metals contracts were ahead on the week until most suffered setbacks yesterday. But aluminium defied a further large rise in exchange warehouse stocks to move on to a 3 1/2 -month high with an Dollars 11.50 rise to Dollars 1,337.50 in the cash position, up Dollars 28 on the week. Dealers said yesterday's rise resulted mainly from speculative activity, fuelled by the operation of stop-loss buying orders. Zinc had a volatile week after being unsettled by Monday's announcement that the London Metal Exchange was again monitoring the market closely because of concern about a developing technical supply squeeze. The cash price fluctuated in a Dollars 40 range a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,340.50 a tonne, down Dollars 9 on the day and up Dollars 2 on the week. The mid-week rise to Dollars 1,362.50 a tonne led to increased pressure for the LME take action to head off the squeeze, as it did in similar circumstances last month. On that occasion it set a limit on the one-day 'backwardation' (cash premium) but so far the renewed squeeze has not moved the market out of the normal 'contango' situation, where the cash price is at a discount to forward positions. The present squeeze, like the last, has been attributed to producer support operations, which some traders allege are 'concerted'. Signs of a developing supply squeeze also lifted prices on the lead market, where the cash position reached a 12-month peak of Pounds 348.50 a tonne. This was linked to nervousness about the expiry of the labour contract at Cominco's Trail smelter in Canada at the end of September. Reports of Chinese buying were also supporting the lead market in mid-week. By yesterday's close the cash price had retreated to Pounds 342 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 17.50 up on the week. Last week's sell-off in the tin market continued on Monday, when the cash price dipped to Dollars 6,710 a tonne, as reports from Kuala Lumpur that the Chinese had sold as much as 5,000 tonnes following the preceding run up continued to affect sentiment. But later talk of Chinese shipment delay's contributed to a strong rally that left the cash position Dollars 197.50 up on the week at Dollars 7,015 a tonne, despite being trimmed by Dollars 105 a tonne yesterday. The platinum market ended a hectic week little changed. Concern over the South African situation pushed it up to Dollars 390.75 a troy ounce at one stage, but that faded in mid-week and the downward reaction was accelerated by the announcement of the invention of another palladium-based car exhaust catalyst, although the threat to platinum's dominant share of the catalyst market was played down. The price dipped to Dollars 377.25 an ounce but at yesterday's fixing was back to Dollars 38035 an ounce, down Dollars 3.15 on the week.  ------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium  +10,225 to 1,321,550 Copper      -1,850 to   255,975 Lead        +2,050 to   147,200 Nickel      +1,350 to    27,636 Zinc        +2,175 to   338,725 Tin           +275 to    14,655  ------------------------------------</p>

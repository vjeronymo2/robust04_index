			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Irene So and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] The appointment of a former United Democrat (UDHK),  Lau Kong-wah, to China's advisory body was criticized as a  further step to isolate the party whose previous attempts to  communicate with Beijing officials have been turned down.  Describing the appointment as a "united front tactic", chairman  Martin Lee Chu-ming said: "It shows the Chinese Government is  continuing to isolate the UDHK in building up a united front by  recruiting more democrats as advisers."    Mr Lau, a member of the Sha Tin District Board and Regional  Council, resigned from the party one year ago because he was  dissatisfied with the lack of communication between the central  and district levels of the party. Mr Lau would not say whether  his former membership of the UDHK was related to the appointment.    Mr Lee dismissed the suggestions that some UDHK members  might  follow suit and leave the party in order to join the united  front. "Even if China wants to appoint UDHK members in future,  our central standing committee may not approve it," Mr Lee said.    The newly-appointed advisers yesterday rejected suggestions  that their acceptance of China's offer meant they were shifting  to the pro-China camp. Many appointees said the need to improve  communications with the mainland because of the deadlock over  the territory's political development had prompted them to take  up the posts.    Hang Seng Bank chairman Sir Quo-wei Lee, formerly an  Executive Councillor said there was a need to reflect the views  of Hong Kong people. Sir Quo-wei, who dismissed the suggestion  that he was shifting to the pro-China camp politically, added:  "It is not necessarily anti-British to become a Hong Kong  affairs adviser."    Another appointee, the vice-chancellor of the Hong Kong City  Polytechnic, Patrick Cheng Yiu-chung, said he believed there was  no difference serving advisory groups under British rule and  those under China's. "I have served on numerous advisory  committees set up by the Hong Kong Government in the past 10  years or so. My students protested that they were only  decorative bodies to mislead the public, but I still took the  posts as long as I could achieve something. I really do not see  any difference between helping the British Government and the  Chinese Government," he said. Mr Cheng said it was difficult  for the two countries to cooperate over political issues and  more preparation should be laid in other areas of the transition.    Another appointee, former chairman of the Law Society Donald  Yap, said there was a pressing need to communicate with China.  But he said he had yet to formulate his own views on subjects  such as the composition of the Court of Final Appeal. The legal  profession has expressed strong opposition towards the  Sino-British agreement on the court. As for the jailing in  China of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang, Mr Yap said Beijing should  either give more details about the case or explain why it could  not.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVENUE-RAISING TAX PLAN UNVEILED BY ROSTENKOWSKI  </P> <P> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) on Tuesday  laid out his own road map for raising $5.3 billion in additional revenue next  year, proposing among other things to hit pipe smokers and tobacco chewers.  </P> <P> His plan also calls for a continuation of current taxes on airline tickets and  telephone bills, for limits on a variety of corporate tax breaks and for a  higher ceiling on Social Security taxes.  </P> <P> The package, which meets the budget target established by Congress earlier this  year, contained few surprises.  </P> <P> Lawmakers on the tax-writing committee are not expected to make major changes  in Rostenkowski's specific proposals. However, they are likely to recommend  tackling such other issues as expanding child-care tax benefits, reducing the  surtax that is scheduled to pay for Medicare coverage for catastrophic  illnesses and cutting taxes on capital gains. Although Rostenkowski said that  he hopes to complete action this week, the debate is expected to continue into  next week and possibly longer.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski's proposal contains almost no changes directly affecting  individuals.  </P> <P> One of the few that would affect individuals would sharply boost the tax on  pipe tobacco, snuff and chewing tobacco. Another would raise the current  $48,000 ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax by roughly $1,000 above  the normal annual inflationary increase. That action would add an estimated  $1.1 billion to Social Security taxes paid by affluent workers when fully  implemented in fiscal 1991. But benefits would also increase for retirees,  eventually costing the government more in outlays than the revenue gained from  the change.  </P> <P> The plan also calls for extending the 3% tax on telephone calls for at least  one more year, but few lawmakers expect that the tax will be allowed to expire.  Similarly, current law would cut in half various aviation taxes, including  levies on tickets, fuel and cargo shipments. Rostenkowski's proposal would keep  the taxes at their present levels for another year.  </P> <P> As he had proposed earlier, Rostenkowski took aim at the increasingly popular  corporate practice of establishing employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, to  help ward off hostile takeovers.  </P> <P> The plan to eliminate the existing 50% exclusion for interest payments used to  finance ESOPs is the biggest revenue generator in the package. It would add an  estimated $1.27 billion in revenue for fiscal 1990, which begins on Oct. 1, and  $10.18 billion over the next five years.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski's ESOP proposal, which he recommended be retroactive to June 7,  could affect both Xerox Corp. and Delta Airlines, which both proposed ESOPs on  Monday as part of their own defenses against potential takeovers. Although  Xerox said it did not think legislation would affect its ESOP plan, the company  would need a special exemption to avoid the proposed measure.  </P> <P> Also hitting ESOPs was another Rostenkowski recommendation that would repeal a  deduction allowed employers for certain dividends on securities held by an  employee stock plan. That would raise $368 million next year and $3 billion  over five years.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration also had recommended keeping the airline and telephone  taxes and suggested roughly $500 million in minor corporate tax measures,  contending that none of its proposals violate President Bush's "no new taxes"  pledge. The Administration, however, may oppose Rostenkowski's proposal to  impose higher taxes on pipe smokers and snuff users and a plan to limit tax  deductions on Third World bank loans, committee aides said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Committed to $5.3 Billion'  </P> <P> Rostenkowski's proposal, which would raise an estimated $31.9 billion over the  next five years, does not include any revenues to maintain a number of popular  tax credits that are supposed to expire this year, such as those for low-income  housing, mortgage bonds and corporate research and development.  </P> <P> "If my colleagues want to do anything to raise revenues (to extend expiring tax  breaks), that's up to them," Rostenkowski told reporters. "I'm just committed  to the $5.3 billion."  </P> <P> Rostenkowski, as expected, did not include any proposal to change the capital  gains tax. However, the Bush Administration is expected to press the committee  to lower the tax on profits from investment in stocks, bonds and similar  assets.  </P></p>

PSCO has estimated that it will require nine or ten additional employees to provide Tulsa with the Services. For the five year period 1994&hyph;1998, PCSO expects that the average annual revenues from the Services will be about $534,000 and the average cost thereof_based on annual bills of $534,000_will be about $493,000. Other Oklahoma cities have expressed an interest in the Services through PSCO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PSCO first proposes to conclude a contract with Tulsa. Second, PSCO proposes to market the Services to other non-affiliate companies within six months thereafter through PSCO employees responsible for customer service, community relations, and business development as well as through printed materials. PSO will market the Services tailored to meet the customer requirements of non-affiliate companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Applicants state that revenues and expenses from the Services, which will be non-utility activities, will be accounted for in accordance with accepted principles and will conform to the FERC Uniform System of Accounts, 18 CFR part 101. The Applicants state they believe that the Services can be provided with margins that would provide them with positive cash flows. The Applicants state that the Services would not be provided to non-affiliate companies for less than cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dai Huanzhong [2071 3562 1813], Governor, </F> Beijing Huaxun [5478 6061] Communications Development Corp (and  participant in the aforementioned KEJI RIBAO Symposium): ``A  Development Leap Appropriate to National Conditions'']    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Our hopes [from the issues  discussed at the KEJI RIBAO Symposium] are as follows: first,  the State needs to devote a higher degree of its attention and  resources to building an information infrastructure and to  prepare in advance for public opinion--the arguments in this  area are not yet sufficiently clear; second, we urge the State  Planning Commission, the SSTC, and other authorities from now on  to stress planning, organize expert groups in relevant  disciplines, and conduct some early experiments. Finally, for  the present moment, if there is to be [effective] market  competition, the State should adopt a unified plan to establish  a work sequence that in orderly fashion is introduced into the  market mechanisms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report prepared by the Czech Statistical Office Department </F> of Prices Statistics and Foreign Trade: "Foreign Trade Turnover  Has Increased in the First Quarter"]    [Text] During the first quarter of 1994, the Czech  Republic's foreign trade generated a surplus balance of trade,  and the changes in the territorial structure and the structure  of imports and exports according to the individual categories of  goods continued.    The territorial structure changed, in particular, as a  consequence of trading with the Slovak Republic, where, during  the first three months of 1994, the tendency toward a gradual  decline in mutual trade began to manifest itself. The measures  adopted by the Slovak Government, which consisted of introducing  an import surcharge and tightening legislative and technical  conditions for imports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak  Republic, were reflected in a reduction in mutual turnover. In  imports, the proportion of mineral fuels, lubricants, and  related materials increased, while the proportion of machinery  and means of transportation declined. In exports, the  proportion of various finished products increased, while the  proportion of machinery and means of transportation declined.    The overall foreign trade turnover in the first quarter of  1994, compared with the same period of last year, increased by  4.8 percent; of this, imports rose by 15.9 percent, but exports  fell by 4.3 percent. The value of overall imports amounted to  83.3 billion korunas [Kc] and was Kc11.5 billion higher than in  the first three months of 1993. The overall value of exports  amounted to Kc85 billion, which was Kc3.8 billion less. The  balance of trade ended with a surplus of Kc1.7 billion.    From the territorial point of view, states with an advanced  market economy took a 60.8-percent share in overall foreign  trade turnover (European Union [EU] states--42.8 percent and  members of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] 12.3  percent). The Slovak Republic took a 15.2-percent share, the  countries of the former Soviet Union 10.3 percent, developing  countries 7.3 percent, European states with a transitional  economy (excluding the countries of the former USSR) 5.6  percent, and states with a state trading system 0.8 percent.    In trade with the Slovak Republic, the value of imports in  the first quarter amounted to Kc12.5 billion, which was Kc2.5  billion less than in the same period of last year, and the value  of exports amounted to Kc13.2 billion--that is, Kc6.6 billion  less. Imports declined to 83.4 percent of the level of the  first quarter of 1993, and exports declined to 66.5 percent.  The balance of trade had a surplus of Kc0.7 billion. Ties  established within the former CSFR, when a substantial part of  the exchange of goods was accounted for by complementary  shipments, are still being reflected in the mutual exchange of  goods. However, they are becoming gradually weaker. In the  mutual exchange of raw and processed materials and goods,  industrial goods were predominant, with a 37-percent share of  overall imports and a 31-percent share of overall exports, while  machinery and means of transportation had a 20-percent share of  overall imports and a 26-percent share of overall exports.    Imports from states with an advanced market economy in the  first quarter of 1994, compared with the previous year, rose by  23.3 percent, and exports to these states rose by 12.2 percent.  The rise in imports, compared with the same period of last  year, amounted to Kc9.2 billion, and the rise in exports  amounted to Kc5.9 billion. The balance of trade had a surplus of  Kc5.2 billion. The trade surplus with EU countries amounted to  Kc4.4 billion and with the EFTA member states to Kc1.3 billion.  The most important trading partner from these countries was the  Federal Republic of Germany, with a 26.1-percent share of the  Czech Republic's overall foreign trade turnover. It was  followed by Austria (8.6 percent) and Italy (4.8 percent). In  imports from states with an advanced market economy, machinery  and means of transportation were predominant (42 percent of all  of the goods and materials imported); in exports, industrial  goods were predominant, with a 30-percent share of overall  exports. Czech trade with OECD states flourished; imports from  these countries during the first quarter amounted to Kc48.6  billion, and, compared with the same period of last year, had  increased by 23 percent; exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion and  had increased by 13.8 percent. The balance of trade had a  deficit of Kc6.3 billion.    Imports from developing countries increased by 28.4 percent,  and, compared with the first three months of 1993, exports to  these regions increased by 28.8 percent; the balance of trade  ended with a surplus of Kc3.4 billion. Machinery and means of  transportation accounted for 37 percent of imports, and  foodstuffs and live animals accounted for 32 percent.  Industrial goods accounted for 59 percent of exports and  machinery, and means of transportation accounted for 29 percent.  The so-called Asian Tigers--Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea,  Singapore, and Malaysia--have become interesting trading  partners. These countries had only a 4.4-percent share of  overall Czech foreign trade turnover, but the exchange of goods  with them is increasing dynamically; imports rose by 44.3  percent and exports by 71.4 percent.    In trade with the European states with a transitional  economy, excluding the former Soviet Union, imports rose by 32.7  percent and exports declined by 10.5 percent. The balance of  trade achieved a surplus of Kc0.6 billion. The largest trading  partner from this group was Poland, with a 2.9-percent share of  overall foreign trade turnover; it was followed by Hungary,  whose share amounted to 1.5 percent. Industrial goods, with a  32-percent share of overall exports, and machinery and means of  transportation, with a 21-percent share, made up the bulk of  goods exported from the Czech Republic to these countries.    The surplus generated in trade with states with a state  trading system--the DPRK, Laos, China, Cuba, Vietnam, and  Mongolia--amounted to Kc0.3 billion. The volume of imports from  these states was 44.2 percent higher than in the first quarter  of 1993; of course, exports declined to a mere fifth of the  level during the same period of the previous year. This  development was a result of the equally large decline in the  value of exports to China. The dominant items in overall  imports were various finished products (almost 50 percent); in  exports, they were machinery and means of transportation (82  percent).    Imports from the former Soviet Union increased by 25.1  percent; however, exports declined to 80.3 percent of the level  of the first three months of 1993. The balance of trade deficit  amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner from  this group of countries was Russia with a 13.8-percent share of  overall imports; however, it had only a 3.2-percent share of  overall exports. In the structure of imports according to the  categories of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and  related materials were predominant because oil and natural gas  come into this category. The share of this category of goods in  overall imports was 78 percent. The largest goods category in  exports was machinery and means of transportation, which had  more than a 35-percent share of overall exports.    In the structure of imports according to the categories of  goods, in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same  period of last year, the share of imports of mineral fuels,  lubricants, and related materials rose by 1.5 points to 15.5  percent of overall imports. During the first three months of  1994, 1.7 million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes in the same  period of the previous year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of  natural gas (1.7 billion cubic meters) were imported. The share  of imports of various finished products increased by 0.9 points  to 11.1 percent, and the share of chemicals and related products  increased by 1.6 points to 12.9 percent. The share of imports  of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points  to 30.3 percent, and the share of industrial goods declined by  1.6 points to 15.7 percent. During the first quarter of 1994,  compared with the same period of last year, imports in all  categories of goods increased, apart from the beverages and  tobacco categories.    The structure of exports according to the categories of  goods  in the first three months of 1994 was, compared with the same  period of last year, characterized by an increase in the share  of exports of various finished products by 3.0 points to 15.2  percent of overall exports. On the other hand, the share of  exports of machinery and means of transportation declined by 2.4  points to 23.7 percent. The share of exports of the most  significant items, 31.8 percent of which were accounted for by  industrial goods, declined slightly. Compared with the first  three months of 1993, exports in all categories declined, with  the exception of the raw-materials category, excluding fuels and  raw materials for the food industry and the various finished  goods category.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Boost to job schemes is proposed EMPLOYEES' National Insurance Contributions should be increased by about 50p per week to finance large-scale temporary work programmes for the long-term unemployed, says Full Employment UK, the independent policy consultancy. The government is considering new initiatives for the unemployed, including the long-term jobless being required to undertake some form of temporary work in return for higher benefit. Full Employment UK, which estimates the cost of such a new programme at more than Pounds 600m a year, says increased National Insurance contributions should become the centrepiece of a new long-term insurance policy for everyone in work. The consultancy says this would acknowledge the reality that employers can find themselves forced to lay off some of their most skilled employees.</p>

The proposal was put forward by Armenian permanent  representative in Moscow, Felix Mamikonyan. He said it was  naive to expect that the 170,000 Nagorno-Karabakh people would  win over the 7 Mn Azerbaijani nation.    Zolyan repeated that a resolution was adopted by the  Armenian  Supreme Soviet on July 8, 1992, in accordance with which Armenia  would recognize no document in which Nagorno-Karabakh is  mentioned as an integral part of Azerbaijan.    Zolyan stressed that the will of the Nagorno-Karabakh people  must be the decisive point when settling this issue. He pointed  out that the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic had  been proclaimed through a nation-wide referendum.    Baku refuses to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.    Zolyan spoke for the continuation of negotiations between  the  Azerbaijani and Karabakh leadership to search for a political  settlement in the region.</p>

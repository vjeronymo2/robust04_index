			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (9): Shortage of labour poses problems for the planners - Industrial development THE technocrats who run Singapore tend to wince at the merest suggestion that theirs is a planned economy. But they do admit to worrying intensely about the future. When Singapore became independent in 1965, per capita gross national product was just Dollars 600. The government had to become involved in building up industry simply to create jobs in what had hitherto been largely a trading economy. The government is still heavily involved, when per capita GNP has risen to Dollars 12,000, the second highest in Asia after Japan. Singapore's industrialand commercial development is inspired by planners, who manage to exude simultaneously a belief in the magic of the market and in what Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, calls 'pointing the economy' in the right direction. The direction chosen for the 1990's involves a rapid move away from labour intensive manufacturing into high-technology industry. Equally important is the provision of world-class telecommunications, financial and transport services so that the country can remain a beach-head for multinational companies operating in the Asia-Pacific region. The aim is to respond to what is increasingly seen as Singapore's over-riding problem - a shortage of labour which helped push average monthly earnings up by 9.4 per cent last year. This is a rate which, if sustained,could rapidly erode Singapore's competitive edge. The government is reluctant to offset the labour shortage by stepping up permits for low-paid foreign workers. Instead its approach has four main strands which dominate its thinking on future economic development. These are: The transfer of labour intensive manufacturing abroad, a process which is being encouraged both through tax breaks and the official promotion by Singapore of duty free industrial facilities in the neighbouring Indonesian island of Batam. The development of up-market niche industries, for example in bio-technology. The development of the service sector to make Singapore even more attractive as a regional headquartersfor multinationals. Here the emphasis is not only on infrastructure but also ona secure and professional regulatory environment. A push to maximise the use of high-technology in raising productivity and improving the infrastructure. This involves forcing both educational standards and research and development. It is an important ingredient in the marketing of Singapore as a services centre. With more than 13,500 km of optical fibres installed in a country about the size of the Isle of Wight, Singapore is one of the most densely wired cities in the world. Western leaders, used to trotting out an endless litany of apologies for the level of unemployment in their countries, would probably give theirback teeth for Singapore's problems. Yet, the labour shortage is a real constraint. Success in dealing with it while preserving real growth in living standards is by no means assured. On paper the proposed tripartite collaboration known as the 'golden triangle' makes a lot of sense. It is designed to spread labour-intensive manufacturing into the bordering Malaysian state of Johorand Indonesia's Batam Island while still permitting the use of Singaporean infrastructure in the form of its port and telecommunications. However, wagesare already rising in Johor and, apart from a rudimentary road system, Batam has almost no infrastructure of its own. Sumitomo Electric Industries is producing wire harnesses for Toyota cars there, and Thomson Consumer Electronics is making parts for television sets and video recorders, but by Singapore standards they are very low-tech operations. It remains to be seen when and whether Batamindo, the Singapore/Indonesian venture promoting the main industrial park on the island will reach the critical mass needed to tempt a broad range of multinational investors and make a real dent in Singapore's labour shortage. Even though the manufacturing sector accounts for barely a quarter of Singapore's annual economic growth (compared with a share of 40 per cent for financial and business services) Singaporean officials say the economy needs a domestic manufacturing base. Yet domestic manufacturing remains heavily biased towards electronics. Though growing rapidly, the newer products such as pharmaceuticals which Singapore is now pushing, still constitute only a tiny part of industrial output. Moreover, Singapore is heavily dependent on overseas capital. Foreign inflows accounted for 89 per cent of last year's total of SDollars 2.5bnmanufacturing investment last year, and of that, the US accounted for SDollars 1.1bn. There is a growing awareness that Singapore needs to offset this dependency by persuading its own indigenous companies to develop closer economic ties within the region. With its current account balance of payments surplus, Singapore can readily afford to become a sizeable foreign investor in its own right, but with much of its surplus cash effectively controlled by the government, there are formidable obstacles in the way. Not only does Singapore have totread carefully to avoid offending its less affluent neighbours. The direct andindirect involvement of the government in much of domestic industry makes expansion abroad harder. Ideally the government should now stand back and let business get on with it. Senior ministers and officials say it intends to do so increasingly, but this will be a delicate task as, taken to its logical conclusion, it would involve a considerable dilution of power in Singapore's fundamentally authoritarian society. The methodical way in which the government has programmed and regulated the economy has discouraged local entrepreneurs and made for a business community that appears strangely risk averse. Unlike Hong Kong,Singapore cannot boast the buccaneering spirit of a Shanghainese emigre community. Its home-grown tycoons are few and far between. The strongest enterprise culture resides in the foreign multinationals and, paradoxically, in the government, and that is not necessarily about to change. 'If you want to set up a Dollars 2 company and turn a fast buck, you proably want to set up in Hong Kong rather than here,' says Mr Lee Hsien Loong, trade and industry minister. Government companies, he adds, 'give their competitors quite a run for their money.' The country's future success will depend in no small measure on the ability of its civil servants and planners to continue their astonishing record for picking and promoting winners.</p>

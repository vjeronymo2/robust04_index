			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Golyayev] </F>   [Text] Rome March 12 TASS -- Israel and the PLO have made a  political decision -- they will resume negotiations. However,  this decision is directly linked to the adoption of a U.N.  resolution on the el-Khalil tragedy, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said upon the completion of his working visit to  the Middle East.    The minister was to make a brief stopover in Rome last  night,  but did not do so on weather conditions. His plane made a short  landing in Genoa.    According to the reports of ANSA news agency, the minister  summed up the first results of his Israeli visit, where he had a  series of intensive consultations with Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and the Tunisian  visit, where he met PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat.    In the opinion of Kozyrev, Israel and the PLO "showed an  example of political responsibility and courage by deciding to  resume the dialogue". It is necessary that the U.N. Security  Council shows the same responsibility and adopts a resolution to  denounce the events in el-Khalil in the immediate future, said  Kozyrev.    If the political aspect of the problem is settled, there  will  only technical details left. "So, the sooner the Security  Council adopts the resolution the better," he said.    As for the place and date of resumed negotiations and the  level of delegations, they will be fixed by the interested  sides. "We will accept any their decision to the effect and if  requested are ready to offer assistance," said the Russian  foreign minister.    Kozyrev described as "very inspiring" the Israeli-PLO  decision and said "it was more dramatic for Yasir 'Arafat". As  for Kozyrev's negotiations with the PLO leader, they "were  sincere and constructive".    Kozyrev said he plans to meet U.S. State Secretary Warren  Christopher in Vladivostok on his way to Russia from China in  order to discuss "their possible assistance to the Mideast  negotiations at the current stage as the process co-sponsors".</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bletchley Motor 63% ahead BLETCHLEY MOTOR lifted turnover 17 per cent and saw a surge in pre-tax profit of 63 per cent in 1992. Turnover rose from Pounds 60.2m to Pounds 70.4m and profit worked through to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 753,000). With earnings per share at 19.6p (15.3p) the dividend is raised from 8.2p to 8.8p, with a final of 4.4p. Commenting on the current year Mr David Dunn, chairman, said the performance in the first quarter had continued on from 1992, with profit-ability ahead of budget. Mr Dunn said the contract hire division continued to grow and there was a recovery in fleet sales. In the private sector an increase in sales volume of nearly new vehicles more than compensated for the reduction in new sales.</p>

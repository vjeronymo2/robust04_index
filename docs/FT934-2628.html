			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The route to a European constitution Sir, Edward Mortimer's article on 'A pill to beat MF' (December 8) merits praise. He discusses the proposal for a European constitution elaborated by distinguished scholars and politicians. He mentions that this proposal is disapproved of from within the European Commission. We may suppose that the Commission envisages presenting its own draft for the 1996 discussions on a Union constitution. One of the reasons the Maastricht Treaty has encountered so much opposition in quite a number of countries may be found in the fact that it was influenced by the Commission's selfish interests to extend the jurisdiction and the powers of the EU and, hereby, its bureaucracy. Europe can flourish only under a constitution which makes citizens understand that specific responsibilities have been transferred to the Union, because united political action is necessary. Nobody would understand that powers and more and more financial resources are handed over to Brussels only in order that the Union and its institutions may thrive. Such a constitution cannot, or must not, be drafted by those who want to act for the Union and who may be eager to have their own importance buttressed. Nor may it be created by those who, not unlike former central committees, claim the knowledge of what is good for Europe and its citizens. That is why any serious proposal from outside the European institutions merits attention. There is a presumption that it is dictated by less selfish bureaucratic interests and that it is more in accordance with the interests of European citizens. Mr Mortimer, quite correctly, makes us aware of that. Ernst Steindorff, professor of law, Hofbrunnstrasse 25, 81479 Munich, Germany</p>

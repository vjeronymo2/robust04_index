			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source from the command of the Armed  Forces of the Democratic Repubic of Yemen [DRY] commented on the  statements made by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and broadcast by Sanaa  radio, which were given out to foreign media, which reported  that his forces were currently advancing on Hadramawt to mop up  what he described as the last pockets of the gang of apostasy  and secession.    The source commented: We are disgusted to hear in these  statements what does not fatten or satisfy hunger [Koranic  verse]. We inform the public that the war being fought in our  country today enters its second month, and that the forces of  the DRY are steadfast, delivering successive blows against the  forces of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on all fronts.    The source said battles are currently being fought in  Shabwah  Governorate, hundreds of kilometres away from the Governorate of  Hadramawt, which 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih only dreams of reaching.  This he can do only if his forces can burrow underground until  they get to Hadramawt. The source stressed that the masses of  the Shabwah Governorate and our Armed Forces are supported by  the masses of the Ma'rib Governorate, and that between them they  are delivering successive blows against the forces of 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and are forcing them into retreat and surrender.</p>

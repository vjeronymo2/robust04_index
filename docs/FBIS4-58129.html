			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has announced his  ministry has decided to reconsider all measures pertaining to  the arrival of West Bankers and Gazans in the country. He said  all Interior Ministry organizations will apply new measures in  this regard as of the day after tomorrow, Sunday [1 May].    Hammad made these remarks during a tour of the al-Husayn  Bridge this morning. During his tour, he inspected the  reception halls for arrivals and departures. He also listened  to the requests of arrivals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Hammad added: Pursuant to the instructions of His Majesty  King Husayn, and in light of the inspirational and culturally  significant statements made by His Highness Crown Prince Hasan  last week on the need to reconsider the regulations issued by  the Interior Ministry with regard to the residence of West  Bankers and Gazans in Jordan, the Interior Ministry has decided  to thoroughly reconsider all measures and regulations issued by  the Interior Ministry in this regard. The new measures will  facilitate things for arrivals.    The interior minister said all the measures enforced thus  far  were intended to firmly promote the steadfastness of the  kinsfolk in the occupied territories, safeguard Jordan's  national security, and thwart the implementation of displacement  schemes the Israeli occupation troops sought to carry out.    Hammad went on to say: The Interior Ministry has enforced  the old regulations pertaining to the residence and transit of  West Bankers and Gazans within the context of Jordan's firm  pan-Arab outlook vis-a-vis the kinsfolk and brothers. Jordan,  which was careful to keep the bridges with the occupied  territories open since 1967, has contributed to maintaining  pan-Arab cohesion and deepening the pan-Arab sentiments of the  kinsfolk, who are holding out in the occupied Palestinian Arab  territories, although this policy was the object of criticism by  some parties in the past.    Hammad said: Jordan, which is proud of its Hashemite  leadership, has striven to promote the spirit of Arab  renaissance and sought to make Jordan an exemplary homeland that  embraces pan-Arab sentiments, and that inspires others with its  ideas, instead of exporting them, as His Highness Crown Prince  Hasan has noted.    Jordan's historical ties with the kinsfolk in our occupied  homeland have always required the best formula and best way to  mitigate the agonies brought about by the occupation.    Hammad added: Given the fact that the reasons that prompted  the Interior Ministry to issue its old regulations are about to  become a thing of the past, and since the Palestinian brothers  are about to realize their aspirations, the Interior Ministry,  in implementation of directives issued by His Majesty King  Husayn, will revoke these regulations. Besides, it will strive  to reconsider the regulations governing the renewal of the  passports carried by West Bankers and Gazans. It will also  introduce the system of cards [not further identified]. This  will allow for the movement of students across the bridges to  further their education. The ministry will later announce  additional measures in this regard. The Interior Ministry will  thoroughly examine the usefulness of using cards. The new  regulations will take effect as of the day after tomorrow,  Sunday.    Salamah Hammad began his tour this morning by chairing a  meeting at the Bridges Administration Office. The meeting was  attended by the officials concerned. The interior minister  informed them of the new regulations. He was also briefed on  the measures the Bridges Administration Office will enforce this  summer.    During the meeting, Colonel 'Abd-al-Salam al-Ja'afirah,  director of the Bridge Security Centers, said the bridges will  remain open for 18 hours every day, and that there will be a  chance to make reservations ahead of the actual crossing time,  to ease the burdens placed on citizens. He said the number of  reservation offices in all the governorates will be increased.    The minister of interior also inspected the new reception  hall, which has room for 600 passengers. He also met with  departures and listened to their remarks. He received several  arrivals, including a delegation of Gazans that came to offer  condolences on the death of the late Queen Zayn al-Sharaf.</p>

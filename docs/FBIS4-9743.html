			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gala Marcela Pena and Raimundo Alvarado] </F>   [Text] Cienaga, Magdalena Department--What should have been  a blessing for Cienaga--some of the best land in the world for  cash crops such as bananas and African palms, ports capable of  serving the large-scale mining industry, a variety of climates  thanks to the Sierra Nevada, and an enviable geographic  position--is turning out to be a curse.    Not only is this area plagued with the factors of violence  that have hit the whole country--subversives with an urban wing,  paramilitarism, drug trafficking, hired gunmen, land piracy, and  family feuds--but municipal and departmental authorities are  literally paralyzed by the lack of resources for carrying out  social programs to deal with the poverty that is overwhelming  the residents of the department capital (some 100,000) and of  the 30 districts or hamlets (70,000).    Along the highway between Cienaga and Santa Marta, drivers  are waylaid and robbed about 10 times a week; and since the  1960's, the Sierra Nevada, which encompasses Cienaga, has been a  center for the cultivation of marijuana, and more recently, coca  and poppies. These activities, as is always the case, have led  to violence.    This situation prompted the inspector general of the Army,  General Juan Salcedo Lora, to say about three weeks ago that  "this is one of the most troubled areas in the country."    The municipal jurisdiction has a paltry annual budget of 5  billion pesos. It has no capacity to contract debts, and is  running a deficit of 1.2 billion pesos.    Mayor Victor Dangond Noguera, in view of this difficult  plight, is calling for a societal response. "It is not just a  problem of armed individuals," he says, "it is a question of  investment, of state presence, of absolute abandonment."    In general, public efforts in this department have borne  little fruit. Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal blames the national  government. He says that all local residents see is the work of  foundations set up by some banana growers and marketers, who  have invested about 750 million pesos in recent years and have  brought in additional state investment amounting to 450 million  pesos to improve essential services and housing in towns such as  Varela, Orihueca, and Rio Frio. But these are mere bandaids in  the face of needs that require an estimated 35 billion pesos in  investments.    In Pinedo's view, "Cienaga is going through one of its worst  moments because of subversion and common crime, but above all  because of a widespread moral crisis. Every day we see how crime  is proliferating."    And the director of the local office of the Administrative  Department of Security (DAS), Mario Mejia, observes that many  crimes are not connected, but are isolated incidents. In  particular, those committed against political leaders--five have  been murdered in the last four months--have caused the most  anxiety. The council feels so threatened that it does not meet.    In Cienaga and the rural area surrounding it, nine people  are  killed every 10 days. The victims are landowners,  administrators, agronomists, workers, civic leaders, people  passing through the area, and of course, the members of the 10  crime rings known to be operating throughout the region. The  latter tend to have their headquarters here, particularly in the  El Polvorin neighborhood, where it is very difficult to get a  taxi driver to help you find an address.    Other personal and property crimes have proliferated, as  well. In the capital, even the tavern on the town square was  closed down for lack of customers. In Cienaga people now go to  bed early.    Fear means that the law of silence prevails, and few believe  that the authorities really investigate crimes, since there is  so much impunity. The fear is so widespread that officials of  the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor General's Office refuse  to go to the banana-growing region for any activities unless  they are guaranteed adequate protection, and that protection  must become "more and more adequate."    The commander of the Army's First Division, General Rodolfo  Torrado Quintero, whose office is only 15 kilometers from the  area, demanded greater cooperation so that his 800 men and some  200 police officers could operate more effectively. "We are  willing to do our duty. But we can do nothing if people do not  cooperate, report crimes, or provide information. Without  cooperation we can accomplish practically nothing," he says.    Even the Catholic Church is losing ground in the area, which  covers some 112,000 hectares, 18,000 of which consist of banana  plantations, because new Protestant sects are displacing it in  all of these areas of misery and despair. The population has  skyrocketed in these places over the last three years, due to  the highly publicized boom and the cotton crisis. But the boom  was neutralized by the European Economic Community's  restrictions and by Hurricane Brett last August.    The only health clinics are in Rio Frio, Orihueca, El  Reposo,  and Guacamayal, and the doctors come every two weeks. These are  the only towns with schools, as well.    None of the streets or roads are paved, and communication  between towns is limited. To serve 70,000 people there is only  one telephone in the entire area of Orihueca.    On a tour of the region, not a single police officer was to  be seen, but soldiers were seen patrolling (the Cordova  Battalion is based in the town of Santa Rosalia). They must deal  with about 300 guerrillas of the Coordinating Committee, who  camp in the most rugged parts of the Sierra Nevada and come down  to fish in these troubled waters. According to Governor Pinedo,  "We are becoming more like Uraba each day."  <H5>  [Box, p 9c] </H5> <H5>  Little Has Been Done </H5>   National Planning took the lead in promulgating the Social  Action Plan for the Banana Region (Pasban), which earmarked 2.6  billion pesos for projects in the 30 banana-growing towns, to be  carried out by the two private foundations that operate here  (Fundeban and Fundauniban), the municipal jurisdiction of  Cienaga, the Agrarian Fund, Findeter, and the community.    The Pasban was supposed to be implemented over a two-year  period beginning in June 1992. But since the state  agencies--with the exception of the Agrarian Fund--have not come  through, most of the burden has fallen on the shoulders of the  two foundations. Moreover, they have had to carry out the  procedures that municipal and departmental authorities were  supposed to transact with the national agencies, because  National Planning also abandoned them.    Sixty-nine small construction and renovation projects have  been completed under the auspices of the Pasban at health  clinics, schools, electrification facilities, cemeteries,  chapels, aqueducts, and playing fields. The investment amounts  to approximately 1.2 billion pesos.    The Solidarity and Social Emergency Fund (Foses) has just  pledged with Fundauniban to contribute 208 million pesos for  aqueducts in La Gran Via, Reposo-Aguja, El Salon, Soplador, and  Palomar.  <H5>  [Box, p 9c] </H5> <H5>  Murders Prompt Work Stoppage Yesterday </H5>   Yesterday, to protest the murder of five members of the  Trade  Union of Workers in the Agriculture Industry (Sintrainagro),  banana workers stopped cutting and packing the fruit in the  Magdalena banana region and blocked the road from Cienaga to  Fundacion.    The killings occurred at the entrance to the La Ceiba  plantation, owned by the Compania Frutera de Sevilla, in La  Esquina Caliente in the district of La Gran Via (Cienaga). The  victims were Juan Jose Tapias Hernandez, 39; Jairo Francisco  Villa, 35; Auden Quintero Plata, 38; Jose Antonio Torres Zuniga,  25; and Robinson Caballero, 41.    At 0530, 10 armed men in a red Daihatsu jeep with tinted  windows stopped a group of laborers who were traveling in a  "gondola" (a cart pulled by a tractor or an ox). "They had Galil  rifles, submachineguns, and 9 mm. pistols. They called the  workers by name, referring to a list they had, and then they  shot them," stated a witness.    When news of the killings spread, residents of Varela and  Santa Rosalia (where the victims lived) gathered and began  burning tires, painting the slogan "Down with the `Paras'" on  cars, and demanding justice.    The general secretary of Sintrainagro, Alfonso Maiguel  Guerrero, was murdered in his home on 14 February.    Yesterday's work stoppage affected some 65 plantations, and  forced a temporary halt in exports.    Magdalena Governor Miguel Pinedo Vidal sent a letter to  President Cesar Gaviria urging him to give attention to "this  area, which is practically becoming another Uraba."    According to Pinedo, "Two developments have disturbed the  communities in this department: The first was tropical storm  Brett, which flattened 6,000 hectares, and you did not even  bother to send a message of solidarity."    The second is the violence that has brought tension to an  area "that used to be peaceful in other times. Today it is  gripped by murder, extortion, and blackmail by organized crime  and all kinds of other criminals."</p>

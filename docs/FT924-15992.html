			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Iraq in plea to UN for Dollars 4bn oil sales IRAQ last night sought United Nations approval to sell Dollars 4bn of oil and oil products over six months with the proceeds going into an escrow account for food, medicines and other essential civilian needs. Addressing the UN General Assembly, Mr Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, the Iraqi foreign minister, said the Security Council could choose the countries where these items might be bought, 'according to normal commercial practices'. Iraq was ready to donate 5 per cent of the funds raised to the Red Cross and Red Crescent for relief efforts in Somalia, Bosnia Hercegovina and elsewhere. The Security Council last year approved the sale of Dollars 1.06bn of Iraqi oil for humanitarian needs, to compensate victims of the invasion of Kuwait and meet some of the costs implementing UN resolutions. But after intensive negotiations Iraqi officials and UN representatives failed to agree on terms. Mr al-Sahaf said this was because 'humiliating preconditions' were imposed. The new offer, which seems hardly likely to be acceptable, was made after he denounced efforts now under way by the Security Council to authorise the seizure of about Dollars 1bn of Iraqi oil assets abroad, mostly in the US.</p>

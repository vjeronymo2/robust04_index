			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo finalising plans to cede part of Renault stake Volvo, the Swedish motor group, is understood to be finalising plans to cede almost half its 20 per cent stake in Renault as a precursor to the French company's privatisation. Renault, commenting on a report in yesterday's Le Figaro newspaper, confirmed it was approaching the end of talks with Volvo over the dismantling of their cross-shareholding agreement following the decision late last year by the Swedish group's shareholders to block the merger of the two companies. However, it said the final details of the deal had not been agreed, including how many Renault shares Volvo would sell. 'We both want to find a way of ending what's left of the old agreement,' Renault said 'Discussions are continuing.' An amicable divorce from Volvo is seen as an essential component of the French government's plans to float a large part of its 80 per cent holding in the motor group. If Renault is privatised before November 30 - which looks unlikely - Volvo has agreed to swap a 12 per cent stake in Renault for that company's 45 per cent holding in Volvo Trucks. If the privatisation takes place after that date, the Swedish company has the option of buying back the Volvo Trucks stake for FFr4.5bn (Dollars 830m) and disposing of its own Renault stake separately. The French government is expected shortly to announce whether Renault or the Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance group will be the next candidate in its state asset sale programme. AGF's management has lobbied hard for a speedy privatisation. But the consensus among analysts is that Renault is likely to go first, provided the government can clarify the Volvo issue. Many observers expect an announcement to be made over the next few days as Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has just received the official valuations of Renault. The motor group is believed to be worth between FFr40bn and FFr44bn but, given the fragile state of the French stock market, the authorities would be expected to pitch the price of an eventual issue at the lower end of that range. Volvo declined to comment on the French press report. However, it noted that if Renault was valued at more than FFr37.5bn it would be more advantageous for it to sell its Renault shares separately than to agree to the fixed exchange.</p>

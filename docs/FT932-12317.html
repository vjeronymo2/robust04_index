			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Fujimori deploys psychology against rebels: Peru's pacification policy is bearing fruit AN overnight bus ride through the wild Andean mountains west of Ayacucho, traditional bastion of Peru's Maoist Sendero Luminoso guerrillas, is a memorable but probably inadvisable experience. Apart from the state of the roads, it is unnerving to be stopped and ordered to descend by a 12-year-old vigilante brandishing a loaded Winchester. Nine months ago no foreigner would have contemplated such a trip. The fact that it is now possible indicates that President Alberto Fujimori's pacification policy is bearing the fruit he has doggedly promised since his early months in office. In his speech to the nation on the anniversary of last April's institutional coup - when he dissolved congress and suspended the constitution - Mr Fujimori used recent successes in the battle against terrorism as the prime justification for the controversial move, which provoked international community criticism and the freezing of aid. 'The major achievement of the period has been the life sentences passed on Abimael Guzman and Victor Polay (leaders of guerrilla groups Sendero Luminoso and MRTA),' he said. 'Now the fiercest terrorism in the west is being defeated, without bathing the country in blood and without indiscriminate repression.' The Ayacucho area, where 13 years ago Sendero declared war on the Peruvian state, is under the command of Gen Ronaldo Rueda. He also served there in 1987. 'There's been a tremendous change,' he says. 'Although there are a few (guerrilla) columns still bothering us, we now have Sendero on the run.' He claims that tough army action in past years combined with today's less repressive approach has convinced the bulk of Sendero collaborators to switch camp and support the state instead. 'In this new scheme, the rondas have played a decisive role,' he says. Rondas, or peasant self-defence groups, sprang up spontaneously in the area when remote communities decided that they must defend themselves rather than rely on the army. Initially, their arms were pitchforks and machetes. For the past two years, however, in areas like Ayacucho, they have been given hunting rifles and basic military training. Armed peasants now play a big part in controlling roads and gathering information on guerrilla movements. They frequently take part in joint patrols alongside the regular army. Forty miles from Ayacucho lies Huanta, another area dominated by Sendero until a year or so ago. Here too army and ronderos parade noisily together on Sunday mornings to show locals who now has the upper hand. Paradoxically, the black-shirted goose-stepping ronderos look more martial than their military collegues, relaxed in sky-blue T-shirts. As part of its psychological battle for the hearts and minds of the local peasantry, the Huanta detachment recently formed a military band. It has been swamped by invitations to perform at remote rural celebrations - Commandante Max Salazar calls it 'my most effective counter-subversive weapon'. The Ayacucho batallion now spends up to 80 per cent of its time 'winning over the population', according to Gen Rueda. So-called 'civic action' includes road repairs, handouts of staple foodstuffs, the provision of basic medical and dental care and the free services of an army barber. Much the same tactics are employed in the capital's shanty-towns. Police and army sweeps have become a regular feature of life for the poor of Lima's 'red zones'. But house-to-house searches and wholesale detentions of those without identity documents are accepted with little or no protest. Gen Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the joint chiefs of staff, claims that, since receiving enhanced powers, the security forces have captured 2,500 so-called terrorists. Well over a hundred have been sentenced to life prison terms. Under emergency decrees, the Fujimori government last year re-defined the crime of terrorism as 'treason to the fatherland'. Those accused are tried by special military tribunals before unidentified, hooded judges. The idea is both to speed up Peru's ponderously slow legal system and free judges from the threat of reprisals. Both objectives appear to have been successful, although at the expense of transparency and, probably, impartiality in the administration of justice. While life imprisonment is currently the maximum sentence for convicted terrorists, Mr Fujimori and prominent members of his ruling majority party would like to see the death penalty reinstated. Several Peruvian jurists have already suggested ways in which capital punishment could be applied retroactively to certain terrorist leaders already behind bars. Whether Mr Guzman ends his days in his specially-constructed high-security prison or some legal pretext is found to speed his demise, he appears finally to have lost the almost magical hold he once enjoyed over his followers. For a former colleague at Ayacucho's San Cristobal university, the final blow to Mr Guzman's credibility came when he was paraded in a cage before the press. 'We couldn't believe it,' he said. 'His speech was a disaster, so out-of-date and riddled with old-fashioned dogma. We just laughed at him - it was then the myth collapsed.' But, despite some encouraging signs that Peru is moving towards pacification, the war is not yet over. Selective Sendero attacks continue in all corners of Peru leaving over a thousand dead in the past six months.</p>

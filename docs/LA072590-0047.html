			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURES;  </P> <P> AD LINKS LIQUOR TAX TO LOTTERY PROMISES  </P> <P> Hoping to capitalize on voter skepticism about campaign promises, alcoholic  beverage interests began Tuesday spending $1 million on television advertising  that attempts to link a beer, wine and liquor tax hike proposal with pledges  made in the successful 1984 effort to pass a state lottery.  </P> <P> In one advertisement, a teacher looks into the camera and says, "Remember those  promises about all that lottery money for schools? I wonder where it all went.  Well, now they're at it again with this foolish proposition."  </P> <P> The lottery reference appears in one of three commercials that Taxpayers for  Common Sense, an industry-funded organization, began airing statewide as part  of a television advertising campaign to defeat Proposition 134. The proposal --  called the "nickel-a-drink tax" by its supporters -- would impose stiff new  taxes on the industry and earmark revenue from them for programs relating to  the treatment and prevention of alcohol and drug abuse. The industry is  supporting another ballot measure, Proposition 126, which would impose a  smaller tax and let the Legislature determine how the revenue would be spent.  </P> <P> Rick Manter, the organization's executive director, said the ads will run for  two to four weeks, depending on how "well they wear."  </P> <P> "Political commercials wear out real fast," he said.  </P> <P> Supporters of Proposition 134, who read transcripts of the new commercials,  labeled them "misleading," complaining that they erroneously suggest that most  of the tax revenue would not go to alcohol-related programs as promised by the  nickel-a-drink campaign.  </P> <P> "It (the revenue) all goes to a variety of programs carefully chosen by the  people most concerned about alcohol abuse," said Rusty Selix, legislative  representative for the California Council of Community Mental Health Agencies  and an author of the proposal.  </P> <P> Manter said the ads hope to take advantage of what political consultants  believe is a general perception that the California Lottery has not solved the  funding crisis in the schools as voters expected. At least 34% of lottery  revenues automatically go to education, but they cover only about 3% of school  costs.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do with the commercial is to fold what is really a great  skepticism over the promises made by promoters of initiatives with the reality  that often followed them," Manter said.  </P> <P> To get its message across, Manter acknowledged, the alcoholic beverage industry  will be able to outspend its opponents by millions of dollars. Taxpayers for  Common Sense has already reported collecting $10.7 million and is expected to  show an additional $2 million in reports to be filed next week.  </P> <P> Manter said most of the money will be spent on television and radio advertising  that will be aired between now and the November election.  </P> <P> He said the campaign is starting its television advertising early so it won't  be confused with other political advertising, particularly in the gubernatorial  race between Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> "We're trying to get ahead and communicate a couple of messages very simply and  clearly before the clutter starts," he said.  </P> <P> John Jervis, a public relations consultant for Taxpayers for Common Sense, said  viewers tend to become confused about who is saying what when they have to see  a succession of political advertisements.  </P> <P> "It's a much better sell if you're next door to a General Motors ad than if  you're . . . sandwiched by Feinstein and Wilson," he said.  </P></p>

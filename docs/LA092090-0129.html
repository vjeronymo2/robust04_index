Process on low speed about 5 seconds.  </P> <P> With blender running, add butter in slow, steady stream until blender blades  are covered. Then increase speed to high and slowly add remaining butter and  cooked wine mixture. Makes about 1 cup.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Several years ago a recipe for Peach Ping was printed in The Times.

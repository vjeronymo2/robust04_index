			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Queens Moat valuations Sir, The Lex column's comment on the Queens Moat House issue (November 2) fairly draws attention to the case for a review of valuation procedures. I agree. I said so publicly in July and then put in hand a special review under the chairmanship of Michael Mallinson, formerly property director of Prudential Portfolio Managers. This brings together both valuers and their clients, to ensure that the service is properly tuned to market needs. The question of companies publishing their valuation criteria is an important element in this. The review team welcomes evidence from any quarter, recognising the importance of a dialogue with our customers on these important issues. In putting this in hand, I have made no instant judgment on any individual set of valuations. In the current controversy, the chairman of our assets valuation standards committee has - as you report - asked for sight of the relevant valuation certificates.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by reporter Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601) from </F> New York on 7 June: "Jiang Qisheng Was Detained by Police for  Investigation After Visiting Ding Zilin"]    [Text] Jiang Qisheng, former graduate student of the  Chinese People's University and executive member of the student  delegation to the dialogue with the government, was "kidnapped"  by public security personnel on 28 May on campus after visiting  Ding Zilin, an associate professor at the university, and made a  humanitarian donation of money to the families of the victims of  the 4 June Incident. After continuous inquiries by his wife  Zhang Hong, the Public Security Sub-bureau of Beijing's Xicheng  District finally admitted that Jiang Qisheng was "under  detention for investigation."    According to Xiang Xiaoji, a responsible person of the  former  student delegation to the dialogue who is now living in New  York, Zhang Hong, who is working with the Shoudu Teacher's  University, asked the authorities why Jiang Qisheng had been  "detained for investigation" but the public security authorities  refused to give an answer. After Zhang Hong's repeated  requests, on 3 June, the Xicheng Public Security Sub-bureau  allowed her to take some clothes to No 3 Detention Center in  Beijing's Qinghe Longgang, but she was not allowed to bring  Jiang a quilt to prevent him from committing suicide. Only then  did Zhang Hong know where her husband was detained.    Jiang Qisheng was born in Changshu, Jiangsu. He was enrolled  in the Chinese People's University in 1988 as a doctorate  candidate in the Department of Philosophy. In the prodemocracy  movement in 1989, together with Xiang Xiaoji and Shen Tong,  Jiang Qisheng became one of the executive members of the student  delegation to the dialogue and one of the executive members of  the Autonomous Student Council in the Chinese People's  University. He also managed the "Voice of Beijing" broadcast  station. After the 4 June Incident, Jiang Qisheng was jailed in  Beijing's Qincheng Prison and was released on 7 February 1991.    After his release, Jiang Qisheng continued his theoretical  research and also helped Ding Zilin, who lost her son in the 4  June Incident, in visiting families of other victims and to  distribute the donation money to them. Thus, he was traced by  the security personnel. On 5 April, he was openly beaten up by  the security personnel. Jiang did not give in and demanded that  those who used violence against him make a written apology to  him; otherwise, he would take legal action against them in order  to safeguard his personal freedom and dignity.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Controversy crackles over the airwaves: Gary Mead on arguments about how the BBC is being managed MR David Mellor, the minister responsible for the BBC, said this year that he wished to see a wide-ranging debate about its future in advance of a green paper on the corporation's future, due to be published this autumn. Last week his wish was granted with a vengeance. On Monday Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist and former controller of BBC2, accused the government and the BBC of planning cost-cutting - not officially substantiated - which amounted to 'suicide' or 'castration'. On Friday Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4 and former controller of BBC1, attacked both the corporation's governors and senior management. He accused them of 'brutalising' the corporation by a 'pseudo-Leninist style of management' whose approach to the government was characterised by 'appeasement'. Sandwiched by such attacks were suggestions that the BBC is facing its own October Revolution. Among the rumours abounding were: National radio networks 2 and 5 are to be axed. Executives in both radio and television will soon be sacked Sir Michael Checkland, the current director-general, is to step down several months early to make way for Mr John Birt, his designated successor. The BBC yesterday described such suggestions as 'wild speculations'. Both Sir David and Mr Grade argued that their criticisms were inspired by a desire to defend the BBC. Their anxiety is shared by current and former BBC senior personnel. One described the condition of current management as that of 'unholy confusion'. Lord Nicholas Gordon Lennox, a BBC governor, took the highly unusual step at the weekend of publicly defending both governors and management. 'I simply do not recognise the picture painted by Michael Grade,' he said. He spoke of the governors' 'inflexible intention to maintain everything that we believe is best about the BBC'. Underlying the sound and fury is gathering concern about the role of a public-service broadcasting body and its funding in an era of squeezed government finances and expanded competition from commercial television. In May this year Mr Birt, BBC deputy director-general, won agreement from the governors to redefine programme output and take it slightly up market. That aim - to ensure the BBC provides something unique and does not compete head-on with ITV and satellite channels - must be balanced with the governors' determination that the BBC is not turned into an elitist ghetto. Cutting across the debate about the content and style of BBC programming is the question of the corporation's funding, currently by means of a compulsory fee levied on all owners of television sets. The green paper may contain clues to funding changes, in the context of considering the larger issue of the basis for renewal of the BBC's charter by the end of 1996.</p>

Should the proposal be approved, CNE Chairman Dr.  Brazao Mazula will get a subsidy twice the monthly salary of the  president of the Republic. [passage omitted]    The following is the subsidy proposal the CNE has presented  to the president of the Republic:     -  CNE chairman: 8,000 contos [1 conto equals 1,000 meticals]  (114 times the minimum national wage);    -  deputy CNE chairman: 7,400 contos;    -  members: 6,000 contos.    For the Provincial Election Commissions:     -  chairmen: 4,500 contos;    -  deputy chairmen: 3,400 contos.

The representation budgets of the prime minister and of  the president of the Republic have no fixed limits; the Finance  Ministry ascribes a sum in accordance with the average expenses  of previous years.

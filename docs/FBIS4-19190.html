			<p>BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, France April 14 (A.A.) -- The  Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (COE) on  Wednesday [13 April] called for the retraction of accusations  against six Turkish parliamentarians from the Democracy (DEP)  Party, which led to the lifting of their immunity and their  detention.    The Assembly said any investigation against the deputies  should be pursued "without keeping them in detention."    The report was prepared by Dutch MP Eric Jurgens.    Esat Kiratlioglu, member of the Parliamentarian Assembly's  Turkish group said at the COE meeting that Turkey's problem was  not with Kurds but with the separatist terrorist organization.    He also accused the COE's motion author of not asking for  the  opinion of Turkish MP's during his recent contacts there,  stressing the fact that there are 120 MP's there [not further  specified] and some ministers in the Turkish Cabinet are of  Kurdish origin.    British Member of Parliament Brian Smith gave examples from  his country and said that the MP who would defend the IRA could  in the same way lose his seat at Parliament.    Norwegian MP Johann Berg for his part said European  parliamentarians are using every platform to attack Turkey and  there are many important errors in Jurgens' report.    Swiss parliamentarian Petra Fluckiger called attention to  the  activities of the terrorist organization in Turkey, stressing  the COE should make a very thorough analysis when evaluating the  situation.    The Turkish parliamentarian group at the COE published a  communique in which they strongly criticized and condemned the  report, underlining the fact that this decision is of a quality  that will encourage terrorism.</p>

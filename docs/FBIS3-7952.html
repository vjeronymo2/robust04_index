According to him, the arms plant achieved quite  extraordinary  growth last year in the volume of the sales of its products:  growth of 140 percent, compared with 1992, which amounts to  almost Kc940 million. Director Janeba said that the biggest  customer last year (and will also be this year) was the Turkish  Police Force, which purchased CZ 75 pistols. The Lithuanian  Interior Ministry is another major foreign partner. "So far,  the Czech Armed Forces have not made a binding order for our  products; nevertheless, we anticipate that they will become an  important partner when the concept for their armament has been  drafted," said Janeba. The Austrian companies A. Kind and  Sarnitz, the German Frankonia company, and a series of other  companies from France, the United States, Israel, Poland, and  Hungary are among the arms plant's most important partners in  the civilian market. According to the commercial director, in  1994 the Czech Arms Plant will be oriented, from the point of  view of exports, toward the arms markets in Turkey and the  United States. The plant's most sought-after products include  the CZ 75 pistols and the CZ 85 9-mm Luger pistol, whose price  on the U.S. market, for example, is approximately $500.    "According to the trends in the price of its shares, the  Czech Arms Plant is one of the better valued engineering  enterprises, so it will be interesting for the second wave of  coupon privatization," says Janeba. The nominal value of a  single Czech Arms Plant share rose to Kc3,885 at the most recent  session of the stock market on 17 February. The company was  privatized to a considerable extent in the first wave; of  course, there are still 22.5 percent of the shares left for the  second wave. These shares are owned by the National Property  Fund.</p>

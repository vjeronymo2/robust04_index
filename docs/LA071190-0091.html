			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBS BATTLE KENYA POLICE IN RURAL AREAS; 18 DEAD  </P> <P> Stone-throwing mobs battled Kenyan riot police in rural areas Tuesday, and  President Daniel Arap Moi blamed the anti-government riots on "hooligans and  drug addicts." Eighteen people have been killed in four days of violence.  </P> <P> Nairobi, the scene of widespread violence over the weekend, appeared calm.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday that it is advising American  citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Kenya because of anti-government  protests.  </P> <P> The wave of violence followed last week's detentions of Kenya's most prominent  supporters of political pluralism. Five of them have been officially detained  under public security statutes that allow them to be held without charge  indefinitely.  </P> <P> Kenya, a one-party state, has long been considered one of Africa's most stable  and successful nations. Since early this year, however, Moi has come under  increasing pressure to allow a multi-party system.  </P> <P> Clashes between stone-throwing mobs and armed security forces were reported  Tuesday in and around the towns of Kiambu, Nyeri and Githunguri, all north of  Nairobi, where riot troops fired on suspected demonstrators.  </P> <P> Violence also was reported in Kangemi and Kawangware, two sprawling, low-income  neighborhoods on Nairobi's western edge.  </P> <P> Some of the residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were  beaten by police, who then robbed them of money and valuables. The situation in  both neighborhoods appeared to have calmed by evening.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Moi's office said 15 people had been killed and 61 wounded in  the disturbances, which began Saturday when police used tear gas and guns to  halt a pro-democracy rally.  </P> <P> At least three of 10 deaths confirmed independently were not included in the  government breakdown. The government did not name those killed, and it was not  immediately clear if the other seven deaths confirmed independently were in the  official figure.  </P> <P> Moi, in comments to Kenyan troops back from U.N. peacekeeping duty in Namibia,  blamed the riots on "hooligans and drug addicts" and said his government would  continue hunting down instigators of the violence.  </P> <P> The comments, his first public mention of the violence, followed a government  order Monday empowering police to use whatever force necessary to quell the  disturbances.  </P> <P> Moi has vehemently rejected the idea of political pluralism. He says that  because there are about 40 tribes in Kenya, a multi-party system would result  in tribal-based parties leading to ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare.  </P></p>

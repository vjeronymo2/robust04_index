			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Delic's ragged army - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) When a coalition of Moslem-Croat forces appeared to have scored stunning gains against the Bosnian Serbs, just two months ago, it seemed that General Rasim Delic had fulfilled his pledge to turn the tide of the war in Bosnia. However, the taste of victory was short-lived. Delic's Bosnian government forces were pushed back in a Serb counter-offensive backed by artillery and aircraft. Since his appointment as commander of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army in June 1993, Delic has been hard-pressed to change the fortunes of his out-gunned army. The 45-year-old general has launched two big offensives which have cost territory and lives. Last summer, he tried to link up two Bosnian enclaves. He dispatched 8,000 men, backed by fewer than 10 artillery pieces, according to UN commanders. A bold offensive in northern Bosnia resulted in a humiliating press conference in which Delic had to admit that his forces had walked into a Serb trap. Delic is one of a handful of ranking officers in the Bosnian Army to have completed the commanders' training course, obligatory for making the rank of general in the old Yugoslav Peoples' Army. He was trained as an artillery specialist. It is one of the cruel ironies of the war that the artillery man finds himself commanding an army without artillery. He blames the UN arms embargo for the failure of his forces to break the Serb grip. Delic was still in the JNA when war broke out in Bosnia. It remains a closely guarded secret how - already under suspicion for being Moslem - the then Colonel Delic managed to desert his command in the JNA barracks to join the improvised Bosnian territorial defence. From his logistics unit in Visoko, to the north of Sarajevo, he co-ordinated the arming of his fledgling forces. Former JNA comrades remember him as a 'pro-Yugoslav' soldier, a compliment considering that he now leads the enemy. Delic is credited for patching up the alliance between Croat and Moslems, who were at war when he assumed command of the Bosnian army. The new federation so far has paid off, helping him to open weapons channels through Croatia. As commander, his first task was to root out criminals in his ragged armed forces. Many of the initial front-line defenders of Sarajevo, who roamed the city press-ganging Serbs to dig trenches and terrorising the population at large, were arrested. A few of the most notorious gangsters were 'shot while trying to escape'. He then set about trying to build a real army. Unlike his Serb counterpart, Delic has made it clear that he obeys political directives. The portly general is often seen strolling with his wife along the streets of Sarajevo. This does not go unnoticed by the inhabitants, who are keenly aware that most political and military leaders long ago sent their families to safer destinations outside Bosnia. In spite of his unsuccessful campaign to re-capture Serb-held territory, Delic has vowed to free a string of towns. His native town of Celic remains a key Bosnian-government stronghold in the north. While pledging that his army is 'stronger every day', Delic occasionally reveals that the odds are against his army. Asked recently why he did not 'take back Bosnia to the Drina', the river on the frontier with Serbia. He snapped back: 'With what?'</p>

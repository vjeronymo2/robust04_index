			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Tax break plan for Russian investors ALL capital investment in Russia, foreign as well as domestic, may become exempt from tax. Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the Russian parliamentary commission on taxation, budget and prices, told the Interfax news agency he was asking parliament and the Russian government to amend the country's law on profits to exempt capital investment from taxation. His statement follows strenuous protests by Russia's enterprise managers. They and Moscow business leaders met last Thursday to tell Mr Gavril Popov, Moscow's mayor, that business activity would decline unless taxes were reduced. Under current law, businesses must pay 32 per cent profit tax - while those enterprises earning hard currency must exchange 40 per cent of it at half of the current market rate. Meanwhile, at separate meetings of Russian and Ukrainian business people, the policies of the new governments of these states were denounced as anti-capitalist and the breaking of links between the republics was blamed for catastrophic drops in production. Russian President Boris Yeltsin is likely to address the parliament this week on the economic situation - after meeting a barrage of complaints over high prices during a trip last week to the Urals and Volga regions. Prices have risen by up to 15 times in Russia and in other republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States, while shops have remained bare, stimulating protest demonstrations organised by neo-Communist hardliners in Moscow and St Petersburg and other cities yesterday. In Ukraine, the parliament has demanded the resignation of the government because of 'incompetence' in freeing prices, while municipal councils in eastern Ukraine, where most ethnic Russians live, are holding emergency meetings. At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities are being squeezed by the new capitalists demanding lower taxes. Associations bringing together business people, exchange managers and brokers have written to parliament protesting against a draft bill which would, they say, result in trading enterprises and exchanges paying a 65 per cent tax. A gathering on Saturday of Russia's big enterprise managers under the leadership of the called on the state governments to end the 'artificial' trade barriers blamed for destroying production. Mr Yeltsin told the gathering that privatisation would be limited 'for the present', with no plans for a 'forced privatisation' of big enterprises. Tass news agency reported last night that Commonwealth leaders will meet in Minsk on January 24 to discuss economic issues, including the pace of economic reform.</p>

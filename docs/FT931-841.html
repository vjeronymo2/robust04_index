			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Shares yield ground The FT-SE 100 index looks set to finish the first quarter of 1993 roughly where it began. Given the mixed bag of company results, that seems a reasonable outcome. Although the CBI struck an optimistic note this week, any sharp improvement in earnings may be some time coming. The comfort is that low interest rates are drawing cash into shares. Yesterday's figures showed Pounds 590m flowing into unit trusts in February, the lion's share ending up in UK equities. With the yield on savings accounts so low, private investors are understandably looking for income from alternative investments. Having seen the tax credit on dividends shaved by the chancellor, pension funds are equally more interested than usual in yield. The accountants have also done their bit to sharpen the focus. Thanks to the new-style cash flow statement, companies' ability to pay dividends is easier to pin down, even though earnings figures are more volatile. Yet investor concentration on yield may imply a cap on share prices. The market has shied away from pushing the yield on the All-Share index below 4 per cent. Smaller stocks have continued to outpace big international shares. But the cash flow of smaller companies might be expected to suffer most in the early stages of recovery. That may limit their ability to raise dividends. There is also the relative attraction of gilts to consider. With Pounds 3bn long-dated bonds to be auctioned next Wednesday and yields creeping up towards 8.5 per cent, competition for funds can only increase.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Peugeot relents on lobby group PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, has ended its three year boycott of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Acea) and has decided to join the industry's main lobbying group in Europe. Peugeot has been isolated in the European motor industry since late 1990, when Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive, refused to join the new lobbying group in a disagreement over voting rights. Mr Calvet, the most vociferous opponent of Japanese car imports in Europe, had insisted the association should operate with the principle of unanimous decision-making, but the rest of the industry had refused to grant the French carmaker a right of veto. It is understood Peugeot has now decided to join Acea partly out of concern that it might become isolated from future pan-European research and development projects in the motor industry. The industry is about to form the European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCAR) in order to enhance the scope of European R&amp;D collaboration.</p>

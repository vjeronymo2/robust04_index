			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FREEWAYS CALLED RELATIVELY SAFE;  </P> <P> DESIGN: EXPERTS FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ELEVATED HIGHWAYS. BUT  WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS, PILLARS AND COLUMNS APPEAR TO BE THE SYSTEM'S WEAK LINK.  </P> <P> Unlike in the Bay Area, where a double-deck freeway became a single tier in  Tuesday's massive temblor, there are few places in Orange County where ribbons  of concrete overlap and leave the roads vulnerable to collapse during a major  earthquake, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But while most of Orange County's older freeway overpasses and other elevated  structures have been retrofitted to minimize possible earthquake damage, the  modifications will not be complete for about three more years, state highway  officials said.  </P> <P> Frank Weidler, Caltrans deputy director for construction, operations and  permits in Orange County, said the work remaining to be done involves  reinforcement of the pillars or columns that support the concrete spans.  </P> <P> It is that part of the structure -- the support pillars -- that appeared to  have failed in the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway -- I-880 -- in Oakland, where  more than 200 people are believed to have been crushed. The mile-long section  of the Nimitz Freeway that collapsed was double-decked and the upper level fell  onto the cars traveling on the lower level.  </P> <P> "On balance, I feel fairly comfortable" about the safety of elevated freeway  structures in Orange County, Weidler said. "I feel pretty good about what we  have down here. . . . We have no viaducts, no double-decked structures --  nothing where there's a roadway up for a prolonged length."  </P> <P> Weidler said, however, there are 488 bridges and overpasses in Orange County.  </P> <P> "We do have some freeway-to-freeway overpasses and connectors," he said. But he  added that the modifications "are moving forward."  </P> <P> Weidler said the county's largest interchange is between the cities of Santa  Ana and Orange where three freeways come together -- the Santa Ana, the Orange  and the Garden Grove.  </P> <P> There are more than a dozen ramps connecting the three freeways, many winding  like spaghetti under, over and around the others.  </P> <P> The other major interchanges Weidler identified were the San Diego Freeway  connections to the Santa Ana Freeway near El Toro and to the Newport Freeway  near Tustin.  </P> <P> Since the San Francisco and Bay Area earthquake, county officials also said  Wednesday that they will be reviewing the earthquake protection built into  several street bridges that pass over the Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> Bill Zaun, the county's director of public works, said there are 11 older  bridges in particular that will be reinspected to be certain they are properly  supported.  </P> <P> He said the county has built 21 bridges over the river in the last 40 years, 16  of which were done before more stringent earthquake construction standards were  required in 1971.  </P> <P> Five of the 16 older bridges have since been retrofitted with additional  support for earthquakes. He said he was uncertain whether the others lacked the  support or did not require it, but he added that those bridges would be  reviewed.  </P> <P> He said he could not identify which 11 are to be reinspected.  </P> <P> Caltrans' Weidler said almost all of the county's freeways were built before  the standards changed in 1971 and so most had to be retrofitted. He said the  first phase -- which required the spans to be fitted more securely to the  pillars -- has been completed.  </P> <P> The second phase involves reinforcing the pillars.  </P> <P> The other considerations for damage to freeways in an earthquake include the  type of soil in which the structure is anchored and the location of the nearest  fault.  </P> <P> In a study prepared by local authorities about the effects of a major  earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood fault that extends through Orange County,  officials concluded that the greatest damage would be done to the freeways  nearest the coast -- the Pacific Coast and Coast highways and the San Diego  Freeway.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Freeway, it said, should "provide an alternative north-south  corridor east of the zone of high-intensity shaking." It also said there should  be "numerous alternative surface streets which can be used to bypass damaged  portions of freeways."  </P></p>

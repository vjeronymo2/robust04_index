			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irshad Ahmed Haqani: "Can Madam Bhutto Roll Back </F> Nuclear Program?"]    [Text] At a press conference, opposition leader Nawaz  Sharif expressed his opinion about the deplorable incident that  happened during the general elections in Lahore. Many  conflicting reports were published about this conference.  According to one report, he said that he did not want to  unsettle the government, and that he wanted to support the  present democratic process. Another report states that he said  he wanted to establish a coalition of as many political parties  as possible to establish a front against the present government,  and will do anything to remove this government. According to  this report, he also said that the government's invitation to  him to hold talks is a deception and a spurious suggestion. He  did not consider the government sincere about this. He further  said that the alleged attack on him was part of the government's  conspiracy against him. He mentioned Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto's name, accusing her of this attack. Mr. Sharif's younger  brother, Shehbaz Sharif, also spoke in the same tone. He went as  far as saying that Aasif Ali Zardari, the prime minister's  husband, stayed at the Chamba House the last time he visited  Lahore. At that time, plans were made to attack Nawaz Sharif.  The Sharif brothers refused to accept the attack on Nawaz Sharif  as an accident, and declared that there was a major conspiracy  behind it. The fact is that Nawaz Sharif received some  complaints from his election workers about the polling station  at Dyal Singh College. He went to investigate the complaint on  site. His supporters and bodyguards fired some shots in the air,  and when Mr. Nawaz Sharif arrived, the workers associated with  the MSF [Muslim Students Federation] and the Muslim League (J)  fired some shots. There was an exchange of fire between them and  Nawaz Sharif's bodyguards. As I mentioned in my column  yesterday, the statement of a senior police officer present  there is very important in this context. He said that this  incident did not appear to be planned; it was an incident that  turned into a crisis, and firing was exchanged. According to  him, it was totally wrong and deplorable to call it a conspiracy  to murder Nawaz Sharif. Trying to accuse Aasif Zardari or Madam  Benazir Bhutto is making a mountain out of a molehill, and is an  outrageous act. Nawaz Sharif was upset about the Thursday  incident, which is understandable. However, saying that the  proposal to hold talks, which was made before this incident, is  a deception, a fraud, or a lure only shows that he has no  intention of participating in the proposed talks.    Nawaz Sharif says that Madam Bhutto froze the nuclear  program  during her last administration, and he fears that she will roll  back the program now. Can a well-informed man like Nawaz Sharif,  who has been prime minister of this country for two and one-half  years, say with confidence that a prime minister has ever been  so powerful as to decide to freeze the nuclear program? During  her last administration, the military and the president did not  take Madam Bhutto into confidence, and she has complained  herself that the nuclear program was accelerated one step in the  spring of 1990 without her knowledge. Against this background,  is it possible that Madam Bhutto could freeze the nuclear  program on her own? Mian Nawaz Sharif knows well that this is  not possible. The fact is that General Ziaul Haq and Ishaq Khan  had been in total control of the nuclear program after Zulfikar  Ali Bhutto. After the position of prime minister was recreated,  it had no control over the nuclear program. All the major  decisions made about the nuclear program were based on the  military and the president's agreements. Madam Bhutto's mention  of freezing the program at the July 1990 level means that the  people who were in power made this decision. Benazir alone could  not have made this decision. Nawaz Sharif and his advisers are  still making noise about Madam Bhutto rolling back the nuclear  program, or that she will do so. We would like to ask these  esteemed persons if they honestly believe that Madam Bhutto,  even if she wants to, can roll back the nuclear program. There  is only one answer to this question, and that is in the  negative. The nuclear program in Pakistan is controlled and  supervised jointly by the top leaders. If the prime minister  wants, she cannot make such a decision on her own. I would like  to explain this issue a little further. No step can be taken on  the nuclear program without the approval and satisfaction of the  armed forces. Therefore, the propaganda and noise that Madam  Bhutto is ignoring national interests and is rolling back the  nuclear program is totally baseless, meaningless, and  incomprehensible. The Pakistani people should ignore the noise  and tumult raised by the opposition and should not worry. Any  decision made about this will be made with everyone's advice and  with the nation's interests in mind. The decision to freeze the  program was also a joint one. That is why Nawaz Sharif could not  inform the nation about it being frozen, and nor could he make a  decision to reverse this freeze. In his press conference in  Islamabad, he said that he received the program when it was  already frozen, and that what he did was in the interests of the  nation. It is clear that the statements issued by Special  Assistant Chowdhery Nisar Ali, Chairman of the Senate Wasim  Sajjad, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs Akram Zaki, and  Secretary of Foreign Affairs Sheharyar Khan in the United  States, and the assurances they gave, were all based on the  collective decisions. Muin Qureshi has also mentioned putting a  cap on the nuclear program, which also reflects cooperative  decisions. Pakistan's nuclear program is presently where the  joint decision of our leaders wanted it to be. Any future  decisions will also reflect the agreement of all. Nawaz Sharif  and his associates said during the 1988 and 1990 elections that  Madam Bhutto will sacrifice national interests over the Kashmir  and the nuclear program. They are repeating this again. But  their claims are baseless and contrary to common sense. It is  against the government of Pakistan's government, and their  purpose is just to have some cheap propaganda. It does not  reflect sagacity or a mature viewpoint. Continuing it is not in  the interests of our country. The opposition has the right to  criticize the government, but not at the cost of our national  interests. They should, of course, criticize the internal  policies of Madam Bhutto, make them look bad and unsuccessful.  However, they should not try to make the issues that were  decided by common agreement, suspect or questionable. This will  not help our country, and it will not help them either.</p>

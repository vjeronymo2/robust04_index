			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by Wang Man-na (3769 2581 1226): </F> "Hainan To Build China's Longest Undersea Tunnel"]    [Text] Hainan recently gained State Council approval for  the development of the mainland's first train-ferry service  between Haikou and Zhanjiang which will connect transportation  between Hainan and the interior. In addition, Hainan also plans  to build China's longest undersea tunnel. A British undersea  tunnel corporation is now holding talks with the province on  investing in the undersea tunnel, which is similar to the one  that runs across the English Channel.    Sun Lijun, deputy secretary general of the Hainan  Government,  disclosed to this reporter yesterday that the State Council  recently gave its approval for Hainan to lay out a plan for the  train-ferry from Hainan to the interior. There were two  original schemes for the project: The first one runs from  Haikou to Guangdong's Haian, while the second runs from Hainan's  Yangpu to Guangxi's Beihai. There were two schemes because  Hainan could not reach agreement with Guangdong at first.  Guangdong was not willing to invest in the building of the  railway from Haian to Zhanjiang. As a result, Hainan had to  make a second choice. Nevertheless, the length from Haikou to  Hainan is only 18 nautical miles, while that from Yangpu to  Beihai is 80 nautical miles. To connect Hainan's railway with  the interior network through the sea ferry to Guangdong, Hainan  eventually made a compromise and was willing to invest in the  Haian- Zhanjiang railway in Guangdong and give up the second  option.    Sun said that the sea ferry will be divided into three  stages: The first will be the 18.6-nautical-mile railway ferry  from Haikou to Haian; the second will be the 430-km railway from  Sanya to Haikou; and the third will be the 160-km railway from  Guangdong's Haian to Zhanjiang. A feasibility study currently  is being conducted, and it is estimated that total investment in  the sea ferry (not including railway construction) will reach $1  billion. Construction of the Sanya-Haikou railway, which will  take four years to complete, has already begun.    Gu Yuanyang, deputy director of the Hainan Economic  Cooperation Department, also disclosed to LIEN HO PAO that  Hainan plans to build an undersea tunnel from Haikou to Haian so  as to connect Hainan's transportation network with that of the  mainland.    Total investment in the undersea tunnel is estimated to  exceed 6 billion yuan. After completing the undersea tunnel  across the English Channel, the British undersea tunnel  corporation intends to move the available equipment to Hainan  and participate in the project, which will help reduce the  investment cost.    As Hainan's undersea tunnel is 18.6 nautical miles long and  is China's longest undersea tunnel, Hainan hopes that the  British corporation will build the tunnel like the one they did  across the English Channel. The talks are still under way.  Feasibility studies and plans have not yet been made. It is  estimated that the project will start after 9 years and  construction will last 15 years.    As the tunnel is to be located at a deep valley, Gu Yuanyang  said, we will encounter technical difficulties in the  construction. Hainan and the British corporation now are  studying ways to build a bridge in the deep valley so that  vehicles can use pass through the tunnel on this bridge under  the sea.</p>

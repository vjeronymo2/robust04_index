			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 250 PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN;  </P> <P> IRVINE CO. URGED TO TURN CANYON INTO A 'CENTRAL PARK'  </P> <P> More than 250 opponents of a proposed planned community at the mouth of Laguna  Canyon packed a public meeting Wednesday night, urging Irvine Co. officials to  turn the 2,150-acre rolling countryside into a "Central Park of Orange County."  </P> <P> Irvine Co. executives and county officials scheduled the 7 p.m. study session  at El Morro Elementary School on Coast Highway in Laguna Beach to explain to  the public the findings of an environmental impact report on the proposed  Laguna Laurel Planned Community.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. first proposed the 3,200-home upscale community in 1981 and is  in the final stages of the lengthy permit process.  </P> <P> This week, Irvine Co. officials distributed a mailer to Laguna Beach residents  to counter strong criticism of the project, which would be built in the Laguna  Greenbelt area. The pamphlet was titled, "Laguna Laurel, a gift that preserves  the canyon."  </P> <P> Before the Wednesday night session, Laguna Beach city officials and local  environmentalists ridiculed the pamphlet, saying it was "deceptive and  misleading."  </P> <P> "I'm afraid if we accept this gift from the Irvine Co., it will turn into a  Trojan horse," said Councilwoman Lida Lenney.  </P> <P> Mayor Robert F. Gentry agreed, saying: "If that's a gift for the city of Laguna  Beach, I'll send it back unopened. We don't want it. We don't need it, and the  people of Orange County don't need it either."  </P> <P> Gentry and others suggested that the Irvine Co. move all development in the  Laguna Laurel project area to the Irvine Spectrum, a development under way near  the convergence of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways.  </P> <P> Foes of the project charge that any construction would upset the  environmentally sensitive Laguna Greenbelt area, a swath of undeveloped crests  and valleys that act as a buffer zone between Laguna Beach and the rest of the  county.  </P> <P> City officials and leaders of the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and Laguna  Greenbelt Inc. say that county officials have long ignored residents' pleas to  reject the plan.  </P> <P> The Wednesday night meeting was the culmination of a series of demonstrations  against the project.  </P> <P> After spending a week picketing in front of the Newport Beach home of Irvine  Co. Chairman Donald Bren, opponents moved picket lines to Laguna Canyon Road  this week. They argue that the proposed site is a valuable natural resource for  Orange County residents and should be preserved as a wildlife refuge.  </P> <P> During Wednesday night's meeting, however, Irvine Co. consultants and county  officials explained the results of a recently released environmental impact  report, which outlines 136 ways to lessen the impact of the development on the  rural countryside.  </P> <P> Two public hearings, tentatively set for November, will be held by the Orange  County Planning Commission, Irvine Co. project director Carol Hoffman said.  </P> <P> If the Orange County Board of Supervisors approves the project, construction  could begin by the fall of 1990, Hoffman said.  </P> <P> The project would include a shopping center, an 18-hole golf course and  recreational and park areas, and would be close to the Spectrum, a commercial,  office and industrial development.  </P> <P> In an interview before the meeting, Hoffman accused opponents of "creating the  illusion" that the company is insensitive to environmental issues. Hoffman  defended the pamphlet, which claims that more than two-thirds of the wooded,  hilly canyon area that stretches almost to the San Diego Freeway would be  preserved as open space.  </P> <P> "Laguna Laurel is the result of years of careful planning, public hearings and  extensive community comment," the pamphlet says.  </P> <P> "The gift of land will help complete a 23-square-mile public greenbelt" around  Laguna Beach, according to the pamphlet, which was printed on recycled paper.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's study session, Irvine officials said the initial plan has  been changed so that all housing would be built in the northernmost section of  the project area, which is bounded on the north and west by Irvine, on the  south by Crystal Cove State Park and Laguna Beach, and on the east by Leisure  World.  </P> <P> The project also encompasses Laguna Lakes, a three-lake system that will be  donated to the county for a regional park, according to Irvine Co. documents.  </P> <P> The pamphlet also says Laguna Canyon Road will be widened as a result of the  project, making the canyon route safer for motorists.  </P> <P> In response, Laguna Beach City Council members unanimously approved a plan  Tuesday night to pay for the production of pamphlets critical of the project by  Laguna Greenbelt Inc. Those pamphlets will be mailed to residents of Laguna  Beach, Irvine, Leisure World and Laguna Hills, City Clerk Verna L. Rollinger  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN AGREES TO BACK BAN ON ASSAULT GUNS  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown abandoned his holdout Monday and endorsed an  agreement reached with Gov. George Deukmejian to make California the first  state to outlaw military-style combat guns.  </P> <P> The Speaker's decision to support the agreement appeared to pave the way for  enactment by next week of the far-reaching ban on semiautomatic weapons that  police say are favored by drug traffickers and other criminals.  </P> <P> Last week, the San Francisco Democrat abruptly put the brakes on the compromise  reached with Deukmejian by Senate leader David A. Roberti and Assemblyman Mike  Roos, both Los Angeles Democrats. Brown voiced concern that the agreement might  weaken penalties for failure to register legally acquired assault firearms.  </P> <P> But Brown said Monday that he had studied the compromise during the weekend and  termed himself "absolutely" satisfied that the penalties, although softened  somewhat, were still stiff.  </P> <P> "I'll support the bill," Brown said.  </P> <P> Starting next Jan. 1, the proposal would make it against the law to import,  manufacture, sell, lend, trade, advertise for sale and possess without a  special permit about 60 military-style semiautomatic rifles, pistols and  shotguns.  </P> <P> Current owners of legally acquired firearms that would appear on the banned  list -- including AK-47s, Uzis and AR-15s -- could keep those weapons if they  registered them with the state Department of Justice and obtained a permit.  They would have until 1991 to do so.  </P> <P> Under the initial proposal, failure to register would be either a misdemeanor  or a felony, depending on the discretion of a court judge. However, Deukmejian  objected that these criminal penalties were too harsh, particularly upon an  otherwise law-abiding gun owner who refused or merely neglected to register the  gun.  </P> <P> He demanded that the first offense be punishable as an infraction, such as a  traffic ticket.  </P> <P> Under the agreement reached by Deukmejian, Roos and Roberti, the proposed  misdemeanor or felony penalties for failure to register a legally acquired  assault weapon would be made a "major infraction" carrying a mandatory fine of  at least $350 for the first offense. For a second violation, the punishment  would be a misdemeanor or a felony.  </P> <P> For those who do not own a lawfully obtained firearm, illegal possession of a  banned assault gun would be a felony, punishable by four to eight years in  prison.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also opposed a provision of the Roberti-Roos legislation aimed at  outlawing facsimile assault weapons not listed in the bill. Subsequently, the  two sides negotiated a compromise that would allow a Superior Court judge to  outlaw such guns on a case-by-case challenge.  </P> <P> Roberti said that top law enforcement officials and neighborhood organizations  -- especially those in Los Angeles County, where heavily armed gangs regularly  engage in urban warfare -- made their support for the compromise known to Brown  during the weekend.  </P> <P> Roberti said he believes the infraction penalty for first-time offenders who  fail to register their assault guns would be even more effective than facing  prosecution on a misdemeanor or felony charge. He noted that many judges  probably would be reluctant to impose a criminal punishment for failure to  register and probably would levy only a token fine.  </P> <P> The compromise, however, would require the judge to impose the minimum fine of  $350 and order that the gun be registered.  </P> <P> The Senate already has passed and sent Roberti's bill to Deukmejian, who said  he would delay signing it until the bill containing the penalty compromise  reaches him. The compromise amendments will be carried by Roos.  </P> <P> Plans call for the compromise to be inserted into the Roos bill in a  Senate-Assembly conference committee, whose report then will be subject to  approval by both houses. The Senate is expected to approve the new version  easily, but the legislation could face a tougher fight in the Assembly, which  is more vulnerable to lobbying by the National Rifle Assn.  </P></p>

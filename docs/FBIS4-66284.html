			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhuo (3769 3820), the "Saisi" Institute for </F> Economic and Social Development, Guangdong: "How To Resolve the  Contradiction Between Rural Modernization and the System of  Household Land Contracting--Nanhai County in Guangdong Province  Establishes New System of Rural Land Proprietary Rights"]    [Text] New Contradiction Attacts Much Attention    On their intensified efforts at reform and opening to the  outside world, some coastal regions of China are facing the  following new situation in their pursuit of agricultural  modernization: While they aim at the "four transformations" in  agriculture--agricultural modernization, agricultural  industrialization, urbanization of villages, integration of town  and countryside--demand has arisen to effect an overall  rearrangement, a more rational utilization, and unified planning  with regard to all land. This, as a consequence, is conflicting  with the output-related responsibility system. In a reform  experiment in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, it had become  quite clear that a rational resolution of this new contradiction  is only possible with a reform and remolding of the system of  proprietary rights to land in the rural areas, comprising a  shift from the land subcontracting system to a system of  "investment responsibility" [tou bao]. In the new system of  proprietary land rights at Nanhai's reform experiment the  property right of land was split into land ownership and  corporate proprietary right to land, and the ownership right  would then be returned to the peasants, while the corporate  proprietary land right would be held by an economic organization  in a cooperative land-shareholding system, thus forming a  double-tier structure of the proprietary rights to land, where  the ownership of land is dispersed and is integrated with a  socially more acceptable distribution of the land resource. This  is not privatization of land, but a process of discarding the  useless and maintaining the useful in the system of proprietary  land rights of the traditional collective economy, with its too  high a degree of public ownership. It is a newly structured  system of land proprietary rights of the rural cooperative  economy on a shareholding basis, marked by land being brought in  as shares.    A Cooperative Land-Shareholding System    The reform and remolding of the proprietary rights in the  rural areas thus consist in establishing a cooperative  land-shareholding system. In concrete terms, it is the  conversion of land into shares, the resulting entity then being  quantified per person according to their ages and according to  the quality of the land. In planning the conversion of land to  shares, reference may be made to the land tax evaluation or to  the pricing of land according to its operational returns. This  cooperative land-shareholding system separates the value  substance of land ownership from the use value substance of the  corporate proprietary right of the enterprise. This kind of a  separation can resolve the contradiction between the future  reversion of land ownership to the peasants and the intended  overall land arrangements, the more rational utilization of  land, and unified planning with regard to land. It will  accurately resolve the contradiction between the modernization  of the rural areas--the division of all land, with  administrative districts as units, into basic agricultural land  preservation districts, industrial development districts, and  commercial and residential districts--and the system of  proprietary rights to land. At the same time, the system of  dispersed land responsibilities will be transformed in a  well-ordered manner into an "investment responsibility" system.  Implementing the cooperative land-shareholding system is a  second reform of breakthrough dimensions in the rural areas, as  it replaces the proprietary system of land holdings in the  traditional collective economy and follows on the output-related  household responsibility system. The difference between the  present reform breakthrough and the first breakthrough is that  the first reform breakthrough only went as far as the  output-related household responsibility system. Indicative of it  was that its precondition was the preservation of the original  proprietary system of land holdings in the traditional  collective economy, as the proprietary right to land was divided  into ownership and use right, and the land was then distributed  by the land owner, the former collective-economy organization,  equally according to the head-count of contracting peasants,  while no fundamental reform was effected in the proprietary  system of land holdings of the collective economy. Indicative of  the present reform breakthrough in the rural areas, however, is  the creation of a new proprietary system of land holdings, while  preserving the useful and discarding the useless in the  proprietary system of land holdings of the traditional  collective economy. With the cooperative land-shareholding  system as breakthrough point, the cooperative shareholding  system is being promoted all over the rural area. An assessment  is being made of the entire assets of the primary, secondary,  and tertiary industries in the former collective economy, and  total value of assets will be converted into shares, the shares  then allocated to persons, and share certificates will be  issued. It will be stipulated at the same time that no  withdrawal of shares will be permitted, a fact that will help  maintain stability in the operation of assets in the cooperative  shareholding economy. Distribution of income in the cooperative  shareholding economy shall be preceded by payment of taxes and  deductions for public welfare funds and public accumulation  funds, whereupon dividends shall be paid according to the number  of shares held. This is a socialist cooperative  land-shareholding system with Chinese characteristics.    Step By Step Implementation    The reform experiment at Nanhai has made it clear that the  shift from the output-related household responsibility system to  the land-holding target model of the cooperative  land-shareholding system must be accomplished in two steps: The  first step shall accomplish the transitional model of the  proprietary land right, while the second step shall achieve the  target model of proprietary land right.    It means that during the first step of Nanhai's cooperative  land-shareholding system, there has to be set up first a  transitional model of proprietary land right by "unremunerated  allocation of shares, and by actual dividends paid on nominal  shares." The term "nominal shares" is to signify that these  "land-shares" cannot be passed on as inheritance, cannot be  transferred or pawned. The term "actual dividends" comprises two  meanings: one is that dividends are paid according to number of  shares, and the other is that when aggregate dividends reach the  value of the land-shares (in some places set at 14,000 yuan per  mu, in other places at 20,000 yuan), the stockholders' rights  automatically end, but not so the right to dividends, which are  then joined to the basic share and continue. The unremunerated  allocation of shares is conducted according to the ages of the  peasants and according to the quality of the land. I inspected  an economic cooperative operating on shareholding basis at  Xianan, Pingzhou township, and saw that their statute  prescribed: 1 share for every person below 16 years of age, 2  shares for persons between 17 and 35, and 3 shares for every  person of 35 and over. They had completely broken away from the  proportions of land held under the former responsibility system,  so there was no problem about contracted land use rights  affecting the share holdings. As to communes holding different  amounts of land, conversion of the value into shares was done  according to the actual holdings of each commune, so there was  no more any problem of egalitarianism and indiscriminate  transfer of resources of the "communal production" mode.    The second step in implementing the cooperative  land-shareholding system at Nanhai would then be the target  model for proprietary land rights, namely "remunerated taking-up  of shares and actual dividends paid on actual shares." The  so-called "remunerated taking-up of shares" is the counterpart  to the "unremunerated allocation of shares." The land use rights  contracted for by the peasants was then actually already bought  back by the enterprise entity of the cooperative economy, using  the accumulated dividends. It was for this reason proclaimed  that the shareholders' rights from the unremunerated allocation  of shares had ended, and that the peasants thereafter were again  allowed to buy back land ownership by way of remunerated  taking-up of shares, making the peasants' land ownership their  share contribution; this, then, is the "remunerated taking-up of  shares." This procession from unremunerated allocation to  payments of dividends according to number of shares, and again  to remunerated taking-up of shares, amounts in actual fact to  giving back the land ownership to the peasants without  remuneration. This, then, is the essence of Nanhai's experiences  with the cooperative land-shareholding system. Nanhai  implemented the system in two steps. First, it gave the peasants  land dividends to strengthen the peasants economically, enabling  them to take up remunerated shares, and this remunerated  taking-up of shares will also convey to the peasants the idea of  truly possessing ownership of the land. The "actual shares" part  in the mentioned "actual dividends paid on actual shares" is the  counterpart to the "nominal shares" in the mentioned "actual  dividends on nominal shares." While it was not permitted to  transfer, pawn or inherit "nominal shares," the present "actual  shares" can be transferred, pawned, or inherited, but withdrawal  of shares is not permitted. However, two things must be watched  out for when allowing the peasants "remunerated taking-up of  shares," namely, one, in consideration of the particular  character of the socialist cooperative economy, provisions must  be made as to the proper qualification of persons taking up land  shares, and, two, considering the fact that land is a means of  production without reproductive ability, and considering also  the particular character of the socialist cooperative economy,  it must not be permitted that a small group of people become  prominent by controlling large amounts of land shares; a ceiling  must therefore be prescribed for the amount of remunerated  shares that peasants may take up.    Will It Lead to Privatization of Land?    Nanhai's new rural land-holding system is a two-tiered  structure of proprietary rights to land. At one level the land  ownership is given to the peasants, and the peasants are owners  of the land. At the other level, the peasants use the land as  share contributions and thereby create the corporate proprietary  rights of the cooperative enterprise operating on the  shareholding system. The system of which they adopt useful  elements and discard useless elements is the land-holding system  of the traditional collective economy. The system that they  newly create is the land-holding system of the cooperative  economy. The objective is to use the land-holding system of the  cooperative economy to replace the land-holding system of the  traditional collective economy with its too large a degree of  public ownership. There is essentially no question here of  changing the collectivization of land into a privatization of  land.    Looking at the target model of the rural land-holding  system,  we see that the next step in promoting a well-standardized  cooperative land-shareholding system has, as its precondition,  acknowledgment of land ownership by the peasants. Without this  precondition, there can also not be any cooperative  land-shareholding system. Whether we honestly acknowledge land  ownership by the peasants or do so only hypocritically will  determine whether the land property ownership of the peasants  will indeed be respected and protected.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 May, [Democratic Leftist Movement] Congressman  Henry Pease demanded that President Alberto Fujimori "take his  hands off the Armed Forces, and refrain from politicizing them"  to promote his campaign for reelection, as this greatly harms  the country.    On 18 May, he announced he will insist on his demand for an  explanation of what happened at the settlement of Querecotillo  in Piura, where Peruvian Army General Raul Diez, commander of  the 1st Infantry Division [as published], reportedly got  involved in an impassioned public harangue in favor of Fujimori.    Pease commented that this is not an isolated case, as there  are several proofs attesting to the government's move in that  direction, as evinced by the persecution and punishment of  retired members of the military who have criticized his  administration.    "I am going to insist on my request. The defense minister  must explain what has happened. The entire country is awaiting  a response to this request," he said, in an angry tone. He went  on to say that rather than request that sanctions be applied  against the military who go out canvassing for votes, he  demanded explanations. "The entire country, and especially the  Querotillo settlement, deserves an explanation of what has  happened," he said.    Pease further stated that the rules of the game ought to be  clear in the next election campaign, and that events such as  this one should not occur as they inflict much damage to the  country. "It is not incumbent upon the Armed Forces to compete  with political parties, as they should abstain from  participating in the process. That is not their function," he  noted.    He also criticized the ruling party for defeating the motion  to summon the defense minister to Congress to brief it on what  has happened. "The majority decided not to summon him because  they do not want to do anything that may imply they are  controlling the government. This is why they voted down the  request that the foreign minister appear before Congress to  explain the censorship that the president enforced on a foreign  correspondent," he remarked.    Pease recalled that Fujimori himself ordered the erasure of  some images that had been filmed by a journalist when he visited  Yanamayo penitentiary in Puno. "What international prestige are  we talking about when press freedom is restricted in such a way?  It is preposterous, as that is censorship," he exclaimed.    Concerning National Tax Administration Superintendency  superintendent's unexpected resignation, Pease noted that this  type of state agency must maintain good administration in order  to prevent maladjustments.    Pease noted that this unexpected replacement may represent a  political maneuver to reassign a good professional like Sandro  Fuentes to another area, where he may be required for the  electoral campaign. Pease pointed out: "The management of  governmental administration must not become involved in  political maneuvering. It is necessary to take the country into  account, and not to have basic aspects in Peru's life become  involved in political chicanery."</p>

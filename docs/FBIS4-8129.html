			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a statement by Milan Martic, president of the </F> republic of Serb Krajina, on the NATO air strike on Serbian  positions near Gorazde, from Knin; date not given; monitored in  progress]    [Text] ...the leadership of the republic of Serbian  Krajina [RSK] is deeply embittered by the unparalleled precedent  created by NATO forces under the auspices of the United Nations  by bombing Serbian positions in the Srpska republic without any  announcement or valid reason.    We protest resolutely against such an impertinent action  that  undermines the root of all efforts to resolve the crisis on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia in a peaceful way, the  statement emphasizes and then stresses:    The attack of NATO forces against the republic of Serbian  Krajina [as heard] further diminished the trust of the Serbian  people in the international community, which has been minimal  even so far due to its partisan and biased attitude in the past.  With such an act of aggression, the international community has  declared war on the Serbian people, and is, with the threat of  the NATO war machinery, trying to force it, in this way, to  embrace immediately the solutions that are in the interest of  the other two warring sides and to its detriment.    At the end of the statement issued in light of the NATO  attack on Serbian positions in the vicinity of Gorazde, RSK  President Milan Martic points out:    The people and the RSK leadership once again give their  unreserved support to our brothers in the Srpska republic in  their efforts to defend their country and their freedom, won  with blood. The responsibility for all possible consequences  that can, due to the bombing of the Srpska republic, further  (?undermine) the course of the peace process on the territories  of the former Yugoslavia will be borne by the perpetrators of  this hasty act.    At the same time, we warn the responsible international  factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to resolve  its future political status through pressures, regardless of  where they might come from.    This is all from Knin for the time being -- a statement by  RSK President Milan Martic in light of the NATO attack.</p>

He told Chinese and foreign reporters that he had  discussions  with Chinese leaders on bilateral ties, regional and  international issues.    The two sides also exchanged views on Japan providing new  government loans to China after 1995, he added.    He said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa takes the  Japan- China relations as one of the pillars of the Japanese  Government's foreign policy.    In the coming years, he said, the Japanese Government will  make such relations more forward-looking and more beneficial to  the world.    Meanwhile, Japan will continue to support China's reform and  open policy, because the policy is of great importance to China,  to the neighboring countries and even to the whole world, he  said.    To ensure continuous growth of the Sino-Japanese economic  cooperation and trade, he said, the two sides have agreed to  make more efforts in improving the environment for the economic  activities.    He described China's drive to build a socialist market  economy as a "gigantic, historic experiment," and expressed the  hope that it will succeed.    On the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula, he said that  Japan and China are in complete agreement that there should be  no nuclear weapons in the peninsula.    The participation in international cooperation by Korea, a  member of the international community, is very important to  Korea itself and to Northeast Asia as well, he stressed.    The two sides have also confirmed that they will, proceeding  from their respective positions, make efforts to ensure that the  northern part of Korea will accept the IAEA's [International  Atomic Energy Agency] inspection and that the North-South  dialogue will move forward.    He said that China, now the world's eleventh largest trading  power, should regain its seat in the GATT, and Japan will  continue to support China's endeavors.</p>

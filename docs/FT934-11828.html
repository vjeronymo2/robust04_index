			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology: Rewards for the scientists - ICL's career structure for technical staff which keeps pace with managerial posts A CREATIVE scientist's cartoon image has wild, flying hair, dishevelled clothing and a manic stare - in short, a 'boffin' who ignores company protocol, overrides management decisions and cannot comprehend the word consensus. Try to promote him (never her) to manager and the chances are that it will end in tears. A caricature it may be, but there is a growing recognition in some European high-technology companies that scientists and engineers are a prime resource and that the management structure should be altered so that such employees can be rewarded for the quality of their research, rather than how many staff they control, or their skill at managing a budget. Such is the case at ICL, the London-headquartered computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan. 'In some cases quite good people were trying to turn themselves into managers so that they could advance their careers,' says Andrew Boswell, technical director of ICL. 'But the main benefit they brought to the business was technical.' In 1990, after 10 years of informal arrangements, ICL introduced its technical career structure, a 'road map', as Boswell calls it, to show junior staff how they can develop their technical skills. 'When I talk to new recruits it is one of the things they mention. They can decide quite specifically what will determine their advancement within the company.' Paul Watson, for example, joined ICL's West Gorton, Manchester, development team three-and-a-half years ago after conducting joint research with ICL while a lecturer at Manchester University. The research on parallel processing computers (where numerous streams of information are processed simultaneously) culminated in last week's launch of the Goldrush computer. Improved salary aside, ICL's technical career structure was the big attraction for Watson. 'I could see there were people very high up in the company who were doing purely research. They had no line management responsibilities.' The complexities of introducing such technical development schemes in large and unwieldy organisations has meant that other companies are only just beginning to follow ICL's lead. Telecommunicaions company BT began to roll out its professional career paths scheme this July. 'The aim is to support the career development needs for technical and specialist staff,' explains Penelope Johnson, management development manager. Johnson believes the scheme will prove useful in maintaining specialists' enthusiasm and innovative thinking within the growing demand for 'flatter' organisations, where sideways rather than upwards moves become commonplace. At ICL the structure, which applies to 3,000 development staff in the UK and some of the 2,000 who work for the company overseas, outlines job levels from technicians to the most senior engineers. Each grade has a range of salary levels allocated to it which are equivalent to management salary levels. Every job has a specific job description mapped into the career structure and salary scales are published. For the more senior engineers, promotion takes the form of review panels, with emphasis being placed on a technical audit of a person's work. Promotion can mean a move to another job or can involve continued development in a project. Those progressing up the promotional ladder are expected to take more responsibility for the design on which their team is working, or might have to demonstrate their ability to work with, for example, the marketing department. 'The difference between senior levels and junior levels is that senior-level jobs call for a higher degree of technical strategic contribution,' says Boswell. For those who reach the top, ICL is generous with its titular rewards. Ten employees have been dubbed ICL fellows, the technical elite of the company. Another 25 have been given the title of 'distinguished engineers', a scheme introduced in April. A further 15 will be appointed shortly and eventually there will 100 employees with the title. The title is all the honour boasts - there is no cash reward. But says David Brain, manager for human resources development at ICL, the title is what the distinguished engineers want. 'At that level most engineers, in my experience, appreciate the recognition of their engineering skills rather than an extra Pounds 2,000 or Pounds 3,000.' The distinguished engineer scheme has had a two-fold purpose: as well as rewarding staff it has helped ICL bind together its engineering community as the various divisions in the company become autonomous. Distinguished engineers are expected to meet regularly to discuss developments and exchange ideas. 'Our whole business success depends on our engineering and our ability to innovate,' says Boswell. 'Unless we find ways of sharing information we will have difficulty staying ahead.' Peter Wharton, chief engineer and an ICL fellow, believes the technical career scheme has been successful in acknowledging the value of the technical staff. 'There are a lot of clever people around and we have made them realise that they are of value. Very good programmers can stay as very good programmers. The structure enables that.' Wharton also believes that the structure has helped to retain skilled staff. 'We've kept together and developed some very good and strong design teams. We've protected them from the pressures of a big company. They might otherwise have gone into a small company where they are able to be more innovative.' Promoting the culture of a small, innovative company in a multinational organisation is an extraordinarily difficult task, says Bill Baxter, consultant in the product development division at Cambridge Consultants (CCL), where the bread-and-butter work is product development and consultancy for outside customers. Baxter has done consultancy work with the consumer electronics arm of Philips, the Dutch group, in Leuven, Belgium and the Singapore government to help them change the culture in which research is carried out and so increase enthusiasm and productivity. 'People come to us and say, essentially: 'Why can't our developers behave a bit more like your developers?',' says Baxter. He believes that because most R&amp;D work is project-based, that should form the basis of the promotion structure. 'It makes sense to organise people so that their interests and loyalties are centred around their project, not their boss. If an employee thinks that licking up to his boss will get him a pay rise, that is what he'll do.' CCL has implemented its own project-centred structure which means that when an employee's work is assessed, it is done so by his or her managers, peers and juniors, as well as by the project's customer. It is these responses which influence a person's career progression, says Baxter. 'And they know it.' Baxter believes that altering structures can have positive effects. 'One of the things I learnt in Singapore is that you can influence the culture by changing the structure.'</p>

Exports to Mainland China totaled U.S.$12.728 billion while  imports from the mainland totaled U.S.$1.103 billion, the  statistics showed.    Hong Kong customs tallies, however, showed cross-strait  trade  last year totaled only U.S.$8.689 billion, up 17.31 percent from  a year earlier. They showed Taiwan exports to the mainland  growing 20.63 percent to U.S.$7.585 billion, and its imports  from the mainland growing 1.38 percent to U.S.$1.104 billion.    Whichever statistics are used, they indicate that the  mainland fever of a few years ago has slowed, a BOFT official  said, noting that the annual growth rate of exports to the  mainland a few years ago was above 40 percent.    The BOFT and Hong Kong customs figures are different, the  official said, because Hong Kong only counts Taiwan exports that  pass through customs checks, and not the ones that are simply in  transit to the mainland.</p>

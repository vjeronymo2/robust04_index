			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PENINSULA CITIES URGED TO COOPERATE ON HEAVY TRUCKS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes City Manager Dennis McDuffie has called for a regional  approach to controlling trucks on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in an effort to  resolve a squabble that erupted when two cities there initiated ordinances  banning heavy trucks on some major streets.  </P> <P> In letters presented last week at a meeting of staff members from the four  peninsula cities, McDuffie suggested that heavy trucks be confined to  designated truck routes and that Hawthorne Boulevard be declared a truck route  serving the peninsula. He also proposed that the minimum weight limit in truck  ban ordinances passed by Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates be  increased from 6,000 pounds to at least 10,000 pounds. That would ensure that  the ordinances apply to large trucks, not "standard contractors' work  vehicles," he said.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates City Manager Ray Taylor said traffic engineers from the  four cities will analyze McDuffie's suggestions from "a traffic safety and  engineering point of view" and identify routes that could handle heavy trucks.  The engineers will report Sept. 12 to the city staff group, which has met twice  since the truck fracas erupted. Besides Rancho Palos Verdes and the two cities  that have initiated truck bans, Rolling Hills and Los Angeles County are  participating in the group.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Rancho Palos Verdes protested Palos Verdes Estates' ban on  trucks exceeding 6,000 pounds, contending that motorists could be cited for  operating vehicles such as pickup trucks, motor homes and limousines that  exceed that weight.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates officials responded that the ban, which is already in  effect, was aimed at large dirt-hauling trucks, not private vehicles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Torrance Mayor Critical  </P> <P> A similar ban, applying to portions of Palos Verdes Drive North and three other  streets, was enacted later by Rolling Hills Estates and takes effect Sept. 5.  In imposing the bans, both cities contended that heavy trucks posed safety  hazards and could damage fragile streets.  </P> <P> Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert has criticized both truck bans because they will  route more traffic onto Torrance streets.  </P> <P> Other suggestions by McDuffie include:  </P> <P> * Joint maintenance of Hawthorne Boulevard by the peninsula cities and the  county if it is designated a truck route.  </P> <P> * Requiring all large construction projects to specify and maintain a  transportation route to and from building sites.  </P> <P> * Permitting trucks to use Palos Verdes Drive North in Rolling Hills Estates  for trips to and from Chandler's Palos Verdes Sand &amp; Gravel, which operates  a dump and a ready-mix concrete plant on the east side of Rolling Hills  Estates.  </P> <P> Criticizing the truck ban on Palos Verdes Drive North, McDuffie said Rolling  Hills Estates failed to consider the difficulty trucks have in turning right  onto Pacific Coast Highway from Hawthorne Boulevard in Torrance because of the  acute angle of the intersection. "This will make a trip from Rancho Palos  Verdes to Chandler's very difficult," he said.  </P> <P> (The Rolling Hills Estates truck ban exempts heavy trucks using Palos Verdes  Drive North within the city, but only until June 30. The exemption was granted  to permit Chandler to complete work pouring concrete for the new Peninsula  Center Post Office. The company and the post office site are within the city.)  </P> <P> McDuffie also said that within Palos Verdes Estates, Palos Verdes Drive West  and Palos Verdes Drive North "can easily handle" truck traffic without a safety  problem. Reacting to contentions of Palos Verdes Estates officials that much of  their truck traffic comes from Rancho Palos Verdes, McDuffie said traffic  counts by his staff have shown that truckers use Rancho Palos Verdes streets to  get to the southeastern portion of Palos Verdes Estates.  </P> <P> Richard Malcolm, Palos Verdes Estates' interim city manager, said he is not  contesting McDuffie's statement. "Our concern is about safety in our community  and constant damage that major heavy trucks make on the roads, wherever they  come from," he said.  </P> <P> Although Palos Verdes Drive West and North through Palos Verdes Estates and  Rolling Hills Estates are major peninsula roads, both cities say they are  essentially residential streets that were not built to withstand heavy loads.  </P> <P> In addition to McDuffie's proposals, the peninsula cities staff group is  considering several other suggestions made by Rolling Hills Estates. They  include a program to alert the trucking industry about restricted routes,  cooperative truck enforcement on the peninsula that would include standardized  signs, and construction of truck escape routes to improve safety on the  Crenshaw Boulevard hill.  </P></p>

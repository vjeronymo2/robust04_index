			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP REVIEW / MIKE REILLEY;  </P> <P> NEWFIELD FEELS HEAT OF DRAFT  </P> <P> Baseball scouts have compared Marc Newfield to Cincinnati Reds slugger Eric  Davis.  </P> <P> And if the projections of Baseball America magazine hold true, Newfield and  Davis could someday be teammates.  </P> <P> Baseball America projects the Marina High School first baseman as the No. 8  pick in today's amateur draft, and the Reds own the seventh pick.  </P> <P> "They say I have the same stance as Davis does and I approach the plate the  same way he does," said Newfield, 6 feet 4, 205 pounds. "They say my swing  looks like (Darryl) Strawberry's."  </P> <P> Does he mind the comparisons?  </P> <P> "No, I kind of like that," Newfield said. "It's great be compared to a pro  player."  </P> <P> By this afternoon, he could be one.  </P> <P> Scouts have assured Newfield that he will be drafted in the first round. The  only question left is how much of a signing bonus he'll get.  </P> <P> Newfield has been recruited by Arizona State, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State  Long Beach and the University of the Pacific, but says he will probably attend  a junior college if he doesn't turn professional.  </P> <P> Junior college players are eligible for the draft after one season while  players at four-year colleges must stay in school at least three years.  </P> <P> "I'll probably go to Rancho Santiago or Golden West," said Newfield, who has a  2.5 grade-point average but said he scored 690 points on his first attempt at  the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 10 points shy of the NCAA requirement for  freshman eligibility. "I'll probably play there a year and then sign (with a  pro team) or transfer to a bigger school."  </P> <P> If he decides to play professional baseball, Newfield can't sign a contract.  He's only 17 and will need his parents, Richard and Dee, to sign for him.  </P> <P> "It all depends on the money and stuff, and what my parents think," Newfield  said. "They'll have a lot to do with it."  </P> <P> Newfield said he has no minimum for a signing bonus, although he is almost  guaranteed a six-figure signing bonus if he's taken in the first round. The  smallest bonus for a first-rounder last year was $120,000.  </P> <P> "We're going to wait and see what first and second picks get and base my bonus  on that," Newfield said. "I have no set amount. It'll be whatever they (club)  think I'm worth."  </P> <P> This weekend has been a busy one for Newfield, a senior first baseman. He was  one for four and scored twice Saturday in the Vikings' 6-4 victory over Diamond  Bar in the Southern Section 5-A championship game.  </P> <P> Newfield, a designated hitter who moved to first base last summer, said scouts  told him he will move to the outfield in the pros.  </P> <P> Newfield, who hit .481 with four homers and 37 hits during the regular season,  has been named the California Player of the Year by Scholastic Coach Magazine.  He's one of 46 state winners who are eligible to be named the Gatorade Circle  of Champions National Player of the Year.  </P> <P> Baseball America lists Newfield as the third-best power hitter in high school  behind Tony Clark of El Cajon Christian and Adam Hyzdu of Moeller High in  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Newfield's stock has risen quickly even though he hit only four home runs in  the regular season, six fewer than last year. He wasn't even rated in Baseball  America's preseason list, but was the magazine's best high school first baseman  by midseason.  </P> <P> Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said Newfield's statistics this season are deceiving.  Pitchers are more wary of Newfield's reputation this season, and give him few  pitches he can hit.  </P> <P> Newfield, who bats right-handed, led the county in home runs last season with  10 and was expected to challenge the county record of 12. Instead, that honor  went to Fullerton High junior D.C. Olsen, who had 13.  </P> <P> Still, news of Newfield's hitting has spread. As many as 30 scouts have lined  the backstop at Marina games and practices. Newfield has a collection of their  business cards on his dresser in his Huntington Beach home.  </P> <P> Because the Phillies own the No. 3 pick in the draft, a Philadelphia newspaper  has charted his progress the last few weeks. Reporters from Detroit papers have  interviewed him, wondering if the Tigers will draft him with the second  selection.  </P> <P> The team that has shown the most interest is the Seattle Mariners, who have the  sixth pick.  </P> <P> Renfrow has said the attention and pressure have bothered Newfield. The once  easy-going player now gets nervous before games.  </P> <P> "It's been real fun," Newfield said. "I've been enjoying it, but it has been  pretty hectic, too."  </P> <P> Volleyball is the fastest-growing sport in the Southern Section, and it appears  to be growing too fast for some.  </P> <P> Consider what happened at the Southern Section 4-A finals May 26 at Marina High  School.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 fans waiting for the start of the 4-A game between Edison and Mira  Costa stood outside for more than an hour while the 3-A game between Brentwood  and Arcadia went five games.  </P> <P> Marina's gym seats 2,500, but it was filled to capacity with fans for the 3-A  game and early arrivals for the 4-A game.  </P> <P> The 3-A match started at 5:30 p.m., but pushed the 4-A title game past its  scheduled start of 7:30 by an hour and a half. The mob of fans were let inside  after the 3-A game was finished and the Arcadia and Brentwood fans had gone.  </P> <P> Edison Coach Brian Rofer said the finals "weren't very well organized."  </P> <P> "The sport's getting bigger and the players are getting better, (but) the  administration is not keeping up with it," Rofer said. "The CIF did the best it  could, but someone needs to step in there and do something."  </P> <P> One idea would be to move the event to a larger arena, which Southern Section  officials say they haven't considered in the past because crowds weren't as  large. The volleyball finals have been held at the Marina or Westminster High  gyms for the past several years.  </P> <P> Words not to be minced: Saddleback distance runner Robby Price has a 4.5  cumulative grade-point average and was a National Merit Scholarship finalist.  But perhaps the reason Price was chosen over nearly 600 applicants to be the  CIF Southern Section Scholar Athlete of the Year lies in his essay, "The Value  of Participation in High School Athletics."  </P> <P> An excerpt:  </P> <P> "Sports teach the establishment of long term goals, an outlook toward  investment in the future, and instill an orientation toward delayed  gratification," wrote Price. "These attitudes transcend merely athletic  parameters, and apply to virtually every facet of life. . . .  </P> <P> "Perseverance becomes the modus operandi of every effort, be it the acquisition  of knowledge through education, faith through devotion, or financial security  through personal management. Sports mold the universally relevant behavioral  characteristics that are prerequisite to success, to victory in life. . . . "  </P> <P> California Team Communications, which publishes Cal-Hi Sports Weekly and  California Football and California Basketball magazines, has gone out of  business. The publication has run weekly polls and updates on high school  sports since 1979.  </P> <P> Prep notes  </P> <P> Tickets for the "Fabulous 44" boys' and girls' state all-star game, scheduled  for June 24 in UC Irvine's Bren Center, go on sale today at all Ticketron  outlets and the Bren Center box office. The game features All-Americans Ed  O'Bannon of Artesia High and Lisa Leslie of Morningside. Tickets are priced at  $8 and $6. . . .

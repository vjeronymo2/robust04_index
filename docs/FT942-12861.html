			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Clouds on banks' horizon - An extraordinarily profitable market faces a harsher climate Although it is hard to tell, given the lack of disclosure of basic financial information by many of its 175 banks, Hong Kong heads towards 1997 with the satisfaction of being world's most profitable banking market. The question is whether that will continue, or is the colony heading for a fall? The huge profitability of commercial banking in Hong Kong became obvious on the London stock market last year as earnings from Hong Kong and the rest of the Asia Pacific made HSBC Holdings the second most valuable company in the FTSE-100, and the most valuable bank in the world outside Japan. Yet as the new year started, there were growing signs of nervousness among banking regulators - as well as investors - that banks were taking excessive risks to generate earnings. Their exposure to both commercial and residential property lending was increasingly an object of concern. Hong Kong is an extraordinarily profitable market for commercial banking. Banks commonly generate post-tax returns on equity approaching 30 per cent a year compared to the mid-teens for the best banks in the OECD, while maintaining very strong capital ratios and liquid balance sheets. There are a number of reasons for the colony's attractions for commercial banks: Hong Kong has maintained a consistently high growth rate for the past three years, achieving 6.4 per cent GDP growth in 1993. This has been matched by a surging demand for loans among both consumers and companies, with total bank loans outstanding growing by 13.5 per cent in the year to last September. Overall price inflation of 8.5 per cent last year was driven by strong inflation of asset prices. Banks making mortgage loans have been comforted not only by full employment, but a steady rise in the value of assets. This has contributed to very low bad debts - around 0.2 per cent of advances. Because of the lack of a developed bond market, there is relatively little 'disintermediation' of banks by companies borrowing money directly on capital markets. 'Companies have no other source of financing. It is a choice of equity or loans,' says Mr Stephen Li, a banking analyst at Jardine Fleming. Hong Kong is a a trade centre for the fast-growing Asia Pacific region, and is also strongly linked to China. There is enormous demand for loans within China, and trade finance transactions - including foreign exchange dealing - can be very profitable for banks with relatively little credit risk. Banks have managed to maintain a relatively generous spread between interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits partly because of the so-called 'cartel' - or interest rate agreement - run by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, which sets rates of HKDollars deposits of below HKDollars 500,000. The demand for loans is boosted by negative real interest rates as a result of the peg between the US and Hong Kong dollars. The assumed undervaluation of the HK dollar means the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must keep interest rates artificially low to prevent excessive demand for the currency. These factors have combined to generate enormous earnings for banks without their having to follow OECD banks in trying to raise non-interest income through selling products such as life insurance to personal customers. Ratios of non-interest to interest income are commonly below 25 per cent. Yet this apparently perfect banking climate leads to its own concerns. Many compare Hong Kong in the 1990s with industrialised countries in the 1980s whose banks generated large profits only to be savagely caught out by recession, rapid asset price deflation and escalating bad debts. 'There are plenty of examples of other banking systems coming to grief, and you cannot rule out that happening in Hong Kong,' says Mr David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority with responsibility for banking supervision. Mr Carse has tried to persuade banks to be cautious over both residential and commercial property lending. The banks agreed a mortgage loan cap of 70 per cent of the value of property in 1991, and it is now virtually impossible to get more than a 50 per cent mortgage on luxury flats. All banks proclaim the virtues of their own approach to risk, varying from barring some categories of lending to being selective about borrowers. Mr David Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia, says the bank scrutinises borrowers carefully and will not lend for the purchase of land. Even if Hong Kong avoids the crashes which have afflicted other banking markets, earnings cannot keep growing at the same rate. Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director of Hongkong Bank - the HSBC Holdings subsidiary - says loan growth will slow as banks curtail property lending. He says the Hongkong Bank has set itself a lower growth target for 1994. 'I would not like to see loan growth sustained apart from anything else. I would be worried that if loans grew as fast as before, there would not be enough capital retention to justify the risk,' says Mr Selway-Swift. Banks also face competitive threats over deposits. The Hong Kong Consumer Council dealt a serious blow to the interest rate agreement in February when it published a report arguing that the arrangement cost consumers in the colony about HKDollars 5bn a year in forgone interest on HK dollar deposits. The government intends to respond to the report within six months. Though it regards the agreement as a useful monetary lever in maintaining the peg with the US dollar, there is little doubt that the interest rate agreement has not much more than a medium-term future in Hong Kong. This raises the possibility of a gradual erosion of the banks' interest margins as they compete for deposits. Some banks say that they will have to introduce charges to compensate, while others argue that abolition could encourage risky lending to cover higher funding costs. The final cloud on the horizon of the Hong Kong banks is that they are facing pressure to abandon a large amount - if not all of - their traditional secrecy over balance sheets and sources of profits. A working party of the monetary authority has proposed increased disclosure from next year. Even without pressure from shareholders and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, banks would probably be forced into greater disclosure by the demands of ratings agencies. As they carry out more international business, they have to demonstrate their strength as financial counterparties. On the face of it, there could hardly be stronger banks with which to deal than some of the Hong Kong ones. Yet even as they celebrate their place at the top of the world ranking for profitability and capital strength, they face ominous signs of a less easy environment to come.</p>

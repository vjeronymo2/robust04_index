			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Friday that she will ask Gov. George Deukmejian for  about $31 million to combat the city's crime and drug problem when she,  Councilwoman Gloria McColl and Police Chief Bob Burgreen meet with the governor  Tuesday.  </P> <P> At an afternoon news conference, McColl said the city's top priority will be to  request $12 million to fund a 200-bed pre-arraignment jail for three years. The  jail is envisioned as a privately operated facility aimed at incarcerating the  more than 100 misdemeanor arrestees who are now cited and released each day  because of jail crowding.  </P> <P> The city also will ask for money to hire more police officers for special  anti-gang and drug details, and to fund youth diversion programs.  </P> <P> In May, O'Connor declared that drug- and gang-related shootings had created a  "state of emergency" in San Diego's inner city. The council asked Deukmejian  for $34 million from the state's newly discovered $2.5-billion surplus to help  quell the violence.  </P> <P> Deukmejian formally rebuffed the request in June, but not before his press  secretary questioned whether O'Connor's unusual gambit was a publicity stunt.  </P> <P> O'Connor was flanked by McColl, Burgreen and Councilman Ed Struiksma, members  of the "emergency council" created after the state-of-emergency declaration, at  the news conference. O'Connor denied that the event was staged to generate  publicity for McColl and Struiksma, incumbents who face reelection primaries  Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Perot accuses Bush of dirty tricks campaign MR ROSS Perot yesterday bluntly accused President George Bush of orchestrating a 'Republican dirty tricks committee' designed to discredit his independent candidacy for the presidency. Recent accusations against him would 'make Hitler's propaganda chief proud,' Mr Perot said, adding that Mr Bush's anger over reports that the Texan billionaire had investigated the president's family was 'a total act.' The president, he said, was 'in charge of the whole process.' Mr Perot's extraordinary tirade was vented in a television interview yesterday morning, to be supplemented by a later news conference. Both events had been hurriedly arranged to allow him to respond to a series of recent reports that he had authorised investigations of the private lives of public figures, including the Bush family. He claimed that the spate of stories had come out now because the White House thought he would announce his candidacy on his birthday, on Saturday, and wanted to 'redefine' his personality. 'The good news is that this will hurt them, and hurt them badly, because the American people are just furious with this little theatre programme they run in Washington,' he said. Mr Perot's campaign telephone banks were reverberating with public anger, he claimed. Mr Perot's personal antipathy towards the president has never been a secret, though he insisted yesterday he only had the 'warmest, kindest feelings' towards Mr Bush and his family. He cited a 1986 letter from Mr Bush to thank him for having brought to his attention rumours that Mr Bush's sons might have been involved in the Iran-Contra affair. But this disclaimer paled into insignificance when compared with the rest of his remarks. It also drew a barbed response from Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, who said the letter had been written at a time when Mr Bush considered Mr Perot a friend. 'I think he (Mr Perot) has taken care of that now.' The president himself, in a TV interview to be aired this week, described the reports of Mr Perot's investigations of his family as 'beyond the pale,' adding: 'Leave my kids alone, I say'. Governor Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic party candidate, said Mr Bush was right in this. More generally, Mr Perot has been under attack from left and right for alleged disregard of civil liberties. His advisers had concluded that he could not ignore all these charges and still maintain his populist campaign for the White House. Mr Perot did not deny yesterday that he had ordered private investigations on occasion, in the course of his business dealings and as part of his crusade to identify Americans missing in action or held as prisoners of war in Indochina. He also conceded that he had his lawyers look into an oil lease transaction in Texas alleged to have benefitted one of Mr Bush's oldest associates. This, he said, was because he was considering buying a parcel of the land involved. 'If you look at my whole life,' he declared. 'I have meticulously followed the law. Anybody that knows me or knows anything about me would understand that I would never even consider violating the great principles this country is founded on. This is nothing but politics at its worst and lowest.'</p>

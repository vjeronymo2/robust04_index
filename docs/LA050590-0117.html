			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO CALLS U.S. CHARGES AGAINST OFFICIAL UNPROVEN;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: PROSECUTORS' ACCUSATIONS THAT POLICE CHIEF WAS INVOLVED IN CAMARENA  MURDER  </P> <P> Allegations by U.S. prosecutors that the current Mexico City police chief  attended a meeting to plan the 1985 murder of an American drug enforcement  agent are "irresponsible" and "unproven," the Mexican government charged  Friday.  </P> <P> Mexican officials said the accusation against Police Chief Javier Garcia  Paniagua would further strain U.S.-Mexican relations, which suffered a setback  last month with the abduction from Guadalajara to the United States of a  Mexican doctor charged in connection with the murder.  </P> <P> Garcia, one-time president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, has  not been indicted in the February, 1985, torture and murder of U.S. drug agent  Enrique S. Camarena. But federal prosecutors in Los Angeles asserted in a court  memorandum that Garcia attended a meeting of 10 traffickers and Mexican law  enforcement officials in Guadalajara in October, 1984, at which they determined  that "something would have to be done" about Camarena.  </P> <P> The Mexico City police chief is a member of an old-line political family from  Guadalajara -- his father was a defense minister -- and is the only person  mentioned in connection with the case who currently holds a government post.  </P> <P> At different times, he has been a federal senator, minister of labor, minister  of agrarian reform and commander of the now-defunct federal security police,  several of whose members have been implicated in drug trafficking, murder and  other crimes. He was once considered a likely successor to President Jose Lopez  Portillo.  </P> <P> "It is worrisome and irresponsible to put out information, which is probably  even generated by drug traffickers, to stain the names of Mexican officials and  citizens without any proof or evidence," the Mexican attorney general's office  asserted in a statement issued Friday. "This irresponsible attitude, on the  part of those who issue these versions and those who disseminate them, reduces  the effectiveness of the fight against drug trafficking."  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Enrique Alvarez del Castillo issued the statement upon his return  from Santa Fe, N.M., where he met with his U.S. counterpart, Dick Thornburgh,  to discuss bilateral drug enforcement relations and the April 2 kidnaping of  Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain from Guadalajara.  </P> <P> The Mexican attorney general was "not satisfied" with Thornburgh's explanation  of the kidnaping, said a source close to Alvarez del Castillo.  </P> <P> Thornburgh reportedly told Alvarez del Castillo that the doctor's kidnaping and  clandestine transfer to the United States was the idea of Mexican authorities.  Mexican officials charge that the Drug Enforcement Administration arranged the  abduction, and they have issued an arrest warrant for a Los Angeles-based DEA  informant who admitted to organizing the operation. The doctor was flown across  the border to El Paso, where he was arrested by DEA agents, and is now awaiting  trial in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A source in the attorney general's office said the U.S. government is now  accusing Garcia "to make it look like they are doing something to fight drug  trafficking. They don't know what else to do. Next, they'll be charging my  grandmother."  </P> <P> The Mexican official, who declined to be identified, said the allegations  against Garcia would "renew tensions" between drug enforcement agencies from  the two countries.  </P> <P> "Where's the proof?" asked the source. "They should put forward the proof if  they are going to make these charges."  </P> <P> On the U.S. side, there have been accusations that Mexican authorities have  engaged in a cover-up in the Camarena case, but Alvarez del Castillo has  maintained that all those involved have been brought to justice.  </P></p>

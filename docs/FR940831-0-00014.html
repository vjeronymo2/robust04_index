This amendment requires additional inspections and provides optional terminating action for those inspections. This amendment is prompted by additional reports of defects found on links that are required to be inspected by the existing AD's. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;130&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

These AD's require inspections to determine the serial numbers and to detect defects in the upper and lower lock links on the nose landing gear (NLG), and rework or replacement of any defective link found. Both actions were prompted by a report of cracking and subsequent failure of an upper lock link on the center landing gear (CLG) on a McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplane; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cracking and failure were attributed to forging defects in the lock links.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CLG lower lock links, NLG upper lock links, and NLG lower lock links are similar in design to CLG upper lock links and are manufactured by the same forging supplier; therefore, these lock links may have the same forging defects. These lock links also may be installed on Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. Consequently, AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;17 was issued to address the lock links installed on Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure of the lock links on the CLG would result in collapse of the CLG; collapse of the CLG does not present an unsafe condition. Cracking and subsequent failure of the NLG lock links, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the NLG, which could reduce controllability of the airplane during takeoff or landing. The actions required by AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;01 and AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;17 are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of those AD's, the FAA has received reports of two additional defective lock links with three cracks that have been attributed to forging defects. These defective lock links were found on the NLG's on Model DC&hyph;10 and MD&hyph;11 series airplanes during accomplishment of the inspections required by the existing AD's. Subsequently, the FAA has determined that defects in the lock links may exist as a result of improperly accomplished fluorescent penetrant inspections of the entire lock link during manufacturing. After manufacture of a lock link, its material is etched and a fluorescent penetrant inspection is performed to detect forging defects. The fluorescent penetrant inspections accomplished on the affected lock links were performed without accomplishment of the etching process. Forging defects in these lock links could result in eventual failure of the lock link and subsequent collapse of the NLG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

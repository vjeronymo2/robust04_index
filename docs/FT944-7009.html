			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Morita resigns as chairman of Sony Mr Akio Morita, one of Japan's most unconventional yet highly regarded businessmen, yesterday resigned his post as chairman of Sony for health reasons. Mr Morita, aged 73, who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage he suffered a year ago, becomes honorary chairman and Mr Masaru Ibuka, with whom he co-founded Sony, will become chief adviser. Mr Norio Ohga remains president and chief executive officer. The post of chairman has not been filled. While Mr Morita's resignation was generally expected after his absence from the company's day-to-day business since last November, the news 'was a shock to everyone' at the consumer electronics company, a company official said. 'Employees who are in their middle years have great trust in Mr Morita, who is regarded as a kind of god - although it is rather odd to describe him in those terms,' a Sony official commented. But it is not just Sony that is losing a leader. Mr Morita is one of Japan's last remaining symbols of its spectacular rise from a war-devastated country to the world's second largest economy. He ranks with the likes of Mr Konnosuke Matsushita, founder of the world's largest consumer electronics company, and Mr Shoichiro Honda, who started the motor company carrying his name, for his contribution to the country's post-war success. The company he co-founded grew from a small appliance repair shop in the wreckage of post-war Japan to a global enterprise with annual sales of almost Y4,000bn (Dollars 40.63bn). It also acquired two symbols of US cultural heritage - the former CBS records and the Columbia movie studios. While Mr Ibuka was the engineering genius behind Sony and established the company's reputation as the standard-bearer for high quality consumer electronics, Mr Morita is credited with building Sony into an international operation, earning it a reputation for bringing out one hit product after another, from Trinitron colour TVs to the Walkman portable cassette and CD players. His international outlook took Sony into overseas markets and led to the company setting up production outside Japan years before globalisation became a trend among Japanese manufacturers. He spent three years living in the US at a time when few Japanese corporate executives ventured to live outside the country. He has also been behind the early appointment of foreign nationals to executive posts at Sony's overseas companies and in his later years spent much of his time representing the Japanese business establishment at home and abroad. The personable Mr Morita, who is said to have related comfortably to Sony employees regardless of rank, has also been seen as the inspirational force with the ability to pull the ranks together in a common cause. Unlike the Sony which Mr Morita, together with Mr Ibuka and later with Mr Ohga, was able to guide by virtue of his forceful yet charismatic character, the company is now an unwieldy organisation suffering the pitfalls of over-extension. Last week, the company said that as a result of poor performance at Sony Pictures, formerly Columbia, it would write Y265bn off the value of its films arm. The write-off, which came after substantial investments in the Hollywood studio under its former head and a dismal year at the box office, resulted in a Y309.5bn interim net loss. 'The era in which the company can be led by two people is over,' says one Sony official. To cope with its enlarged operations, Sony earlier this year restructured the group's activities into eight group and division units, each headed by a company president. The aim is to give greater autonomy and enable them to be more market responsive. Mr Morita's departure also comes at a time when Japan's consumer electronics industry is under great pressure. The yen's sharp appreciation against leading currencies, the saturation of the domestic consumer electronics market and the changes in consumer electronics, computing and communications, are threatening the status, if not the survival, of some of Japan's most successful companies. Mr Morita, an active business ambassador for Japan in his role as chairman of the Japan-US Business Council, will be missed for the role he played in promoting understanding with the west and in representing the Japanese point of view to western business leaders who often misunderstood Japanese reticence. His outspokenness and unorthodox views have won him some critics in Japan, but many more supporters overseas and among Japan's more progressive-minded businessmen and public officials. Mr Morita, for example, has advocated shorter working hours and better pay for Japanese workers, much to the annoyance of many employers, and called for greater liberalisation of Japanese markets. Such views, and his cosmopolitan manner, have won him admiration as the antithesis of the dull, blue-suited, conservative Japanese business executive. Although his forthright manner was at times used against him, he was always widely respected and admired for his ability to say what many thought but were afraid to express. As he steps out of the limelight of corporate Japan, the country has embarked on a path towards greater deregulation and become more outspoken in defending its views. Many would agree that the change owes much to the efforts of Mr Morita.</p>

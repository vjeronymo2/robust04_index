			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / European road link plan widened The Department of Transport has added 17 new sections of road to the British part of a controversial Europe-wide network intended to improve communications within the European Union. Many of the roads in England, Wales and Scotland added to the trans-European road network (Tern) are linked with ports. The original Tern network was only agreed last October but prompted protests from some towns which felt they had been neglected and from other communities fearful that inclusion in the list would lead to an upgrading of local roads and large increases in traffic. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the revised list had been drawn up following consultation with local highway authorities, freight transport groups and environmental organisations. The list will be put to the European Commission and the Council of Ministers for their final approval. Tern consists of nationally and internationally important routes which the EU wants to identify as a preparation for future transport needs. Pan-European networks are also planned for rail, water transport, telecommunications and energy. The government and the EU have said that inclusion in the Tern list does not mean that roads will necessarily be upgraded. But the commission is keen to improve cross-border links and is looking at ways of raising finance for them. Among roads to be added to the network in England are the M27 between Southampton and Portsmouth, the M62 and M58 between Liverpool and the M6, the A120 between the A12 near Colchester and Harwich, and the A20 between Folkestone and Dover. Others include the M25 between junctions 3 and 5 and the eastern section of the M42. In Scotland the A77 between Ayr and Stranraer, the M8/A8 Glasgow to Greenock and the A82/A87 from Glasgow to Uig on Skye have been added. In Wales additions include the A477 between St Clears and Pembroke Dock and the A465/A40 Heads of the Valleys route from the M4 near Swansea to Raglan.</p>

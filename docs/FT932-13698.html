			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: The uncut Jumpers Sir, In his review of 'Arcadia', Malcolm Rutherford unwittingly perpetuates a myth about Jumpers ('Order and chaos in Arcadia', April 15). I owed a lot to Kenneth Tynan, and profited from his scrutiny, but it is quite untrue that he cut the play by an hour during rehearsal, unilaterally or otherwise, or needed to. At a working dinner after the first preview, Tynan, the director Peter Wood, and I discussed cuts and I shortened the play's coda by about 10 minutes. The main casualty, incidentally, was Tarzan, played by Alan Mitchell, who is Jellaby in Arcadia. Tom Stoppard, Iver Grove, Iver, Buckinghamshire</p>

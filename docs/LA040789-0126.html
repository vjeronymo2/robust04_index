			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kraft Ordered to Halt Cheese Ads: A Federal Trade Commission judge ordered  Kraft Inc. to stop misrepresenting the nutrient content of its cheese slices,  ruling the company "falsely advertised" that they contain as much calcium as 5  ounces of milk and more calcium than most imitation slices. The judge said a  3/4 ounce slice of Kraft Singles has 70% of the calcium of 5 ounces of whole  milk and less than 68.2% of the calcium of 5 ounces of low-fat or skim milk.  Parker also ruled that virtually all imitation cheese slices contain the same  amount of calcium as Kraft Singles.  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Collor on offensive over brother's claims PRESIDENT Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil yesterday apologised to the nation for the crisis caused by allegations of corruption and drug abuse levelled against him by his younger brother. In a nationwide television and radio address Mr Collor said he was apologising for the 'outcry caused by the insensitive and false declarations of my brother Pedro'. Appearing pale and tense, he said: 'I've come to the conclusion that, however painful it may be for me and my family, I cannot leave the country without answers, without knowing the truth. As president my personal feelings must be sacrificed because Brazil comes above all.' The Brazilian Congress was still voting yesterday evening on whether to open a parliamentary inquiry into the accusations against Mr Collor and Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the businessman whom Mr Pedro Collor alleges operates as the president's 'front-man'. The Democratic Movement party (PMDB), Brazil's largest party, announced it would vote in favour of such a probe. An inquiry could delay consideration of important economic projects. The financial markets continued to fall yesterday morning, with the main Sao Paulo exchange dropping 5.5 per cent after a poll by the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper showed that a majority believes the accusations. Of those polled, 43 per cent called for the president's dismissal. The latest inflation indices also suggested that inflation is heating up and is expected to reach 22.5 per cent this month. However, by lunchtime the markets seemed to have calmed, encouraged by the president ruling out the possibility of resigning or impeachment and by his apparent decision to move on to the offensive by launching a police inquiry and legal proceedings against his brother for 'moral damage'. After the afternoon recovery the Sao Paulo index ended the day just 0.3 per cent down. The attorney-general has called on Mr Pedro Collor to present immediate proof of his allegations and to hand over a video tape on which he elaborates the charges.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy: "`Rostselmash' Is Not </F> Producing Combines"]    [Text] Industry in Rostov, the largest industrial center  on the Don, has been practically paralyzed. Since the start of  the year not a single combine has been produced by the  "Rostselmash" Joint-Stock Company, the flagship of national  agricultural machine-building. At the same time there are no  crowds of unemployed people on the city streets.    The reason is that the firm's directors are trying by every  possible means to preserve jobs, thereby creating hidden  unemployment, which has exceeded 5 percent in the city. At the  same time official unemployment stands at less than half a  percent. Of course, this policy prevents a social explosion,  but at the same time it also hampers structural restructuring of  the economy and the flow of cadres into spheres where they can  be more profitably used. Many people believe that the reserves  of this policy have been exhausted, and when the real  bankruptcies of cumbersome monsters begin, the number of people  wending their way to the employment service will increase by an  order of magnitude. Are they ready for this?    "We are ready," I was told at Rostov City Employment Center.  "We have more than 150 specialists and all our work stations are  computerized. Over 100 computers link Rostov City Employment  Center with eight rayon employment centers, and with the  imminent introduction of modems these will be linked in a single  information network. This will make it easier for the  unemployed to find work."    A number of strong service departments have been formed  within the center. The main one aims to facilitate job  placement and employment support. Since the start of this year,  half of the 5,000 people who have come to this department have  found work. This is not a bad result in the present  circumstances. Unemployment benefit is also issued here, and is  received by approximately 1,500 people.    But the most important aspect, the center believes, is the  accelerated creation of new jobs and an active policy on the  labor market. Over 2 billion rubles have already been earmarked  for this since the start of the year. Of these, 100 million  have been received by the "Bearing Plant" Joint-Stock Company,  where they have started assembling KamAZ trucks using Volga  components. They have already returned the money.</p>

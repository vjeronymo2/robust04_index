			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome helped by drug sales WELLCOME was the best performer of the day among FT-SE 100 stocks in heavy trading. Investor enthusiasm was triggered by the company's interim results. In particular, the sales of virus drug Zovirax reminded the market that it should not see the company as dependent on Aids treatment Retrovir. Analysts raised their forecasts for full year profits and reiterated buy recommendations. BZW pointed out the company's increased margins, adding that they are still below Glaxo's. County NatWest raised its full year profits estimate from Pounds 345m to Pounds 370m, saying that 'Wellcome is likely to be among the fastest growing FT-SE stocks in earnings terms over the next few years'. Wellcome shares ended at the day's high of 582p for an advance of 63. Turnover reached 6.1m. T &amp; N cash call The second cash call by automotive component and engineering group T &amp; N in just over a year surprised the market. It was perceived as opportunist, and not necessitated by the current level of gearing, which is generally seen as not being too high. The upshot was a fall of 11 in the shares to 163p. T &amp; N proposes to raise Pounds 119m through a rights issue, having called on shareholders in March of last year for Pounds 130m. Further job losses were also announced and the Pounds 7m cost of the rationalisation caused analysts to lower both profits and earnings per share (eps) forecasts. County NatWest now expects eps of 12.4p, down from 14.2p. Allied-Lyons lower Some of the speculative froth on Allied-Lyons shares yesterday was blown away by reports that US brewer Anheuser-Busch, one of three rumoured predators, was not interested in acquiring the UK group. Short-term operators saw this as a signal to realise profits and reinvest in less volatile equity leaders. The resulting sales allowed marketmakers to balance short book positions and the Allied share price slipped to close 12 down on the session at 561p. Trading volume was high at 5.4m shares traded. Allied is expected to report lower annual profits on May 14 owing to foreign exchange losses of Pounds 150m. Confirmation is also awaited of the early retirement of both the chairman and chief executive. BOC lost 5 to 565p as Mr Alastair Nisbet of UBS Philips &amp; Drew changed his recommendation on the stock from buy to hold and cut his profits forecast for the current year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 335m. He blamed currency movements, the recession in Canada and recent poor results from US chemicals companies for his decisions. British Gas recovered 2 to 238p on heavy turnover of 10m as some broking firms took the view that the underperformance of Gas shares both before and following the acceptance of the Ofgas tariff proposals had gone far enough. The exploration success in the Gulf of Mexico continued to drive the oil majors higher, with BP a further 6 up at 357p on 6m. Shell lagged behind, closing only 2 firmer at 527p, restrained by more hefty selling from overseas. Turnover in Shell was 6.5m. The market continued to ponder the chances of Elf and Enterprise engaging in a joint venture to acquire Occidental's North Sea assets, and then indulging in an assets swap which would involve Enterprise acquiring Elf's 25 per cent stake in the UK oil group. County NatWest, which regards Enterprise as 'good value', said it thought such a deal unlikely because it would create a large ACT (advance corporation tax) problem for Enterprise. Kleinwort Benson believed a swap 'might occur', adding that 'if so, Enterprise will be a better balanced company but its share price will be lower'. Enterprise improved 2 to 561p. Water shares extended their rally for much of the day but came off the best levels just before the close, when a series of big trades at prices well below market levels flashed up on the Seaq delayed ticker. The late business was thought to have represented more unravelling of the Water Package units, a trend much in evidence in recent weeks as the market has taken on board the implications of the cessation of trading in the Package on July 12. The late deals included a line of 1.6m Thames Water, traded at 313p (Thames closed 11 higher at 320p), and a 1.7m line of North West, traded at 296p (the stock ended 12 stronger at 305p). Earlier in the day a block of 1.7m South West Water went through the market at 306p; South West settled a net 4 up at 303p. The Water Package, where turnover reached the equivalent of 5m of the underlying shares, picked up 98 to Pounds 3068. Much of the improvement in sentiment in the sector has been attributed to switching out of stocks such as British Gas into the waters. And water share prices are now thought to discount a poor performance by the Conservatives in yesterday's local elections. Hoare Govett issued a note on the entire utilities area, highlighting the exposure to political, regulatory and environmental risks. County NatWest, however, pointed out that the performance of the water issues in April was not as grim as daily price movements implied. Over the month the sector index showed a marginal rise while the equity market was broadly unchanged. County said that the run-up to an autumn general election should be smooth; at current levels the sector is looking oversold. There was strong activity in the banks, where switching operations and straight buying, both domestic and overseas, was sharply focused on NatWest, which advanced 11 to 340p on heavy volume. Lloyds also saw big turnover but the shares underperformed, ending only 2 up on the session at 337p. The fall-out from Allied-Lyons brought the good run in Bass to a halt and the stock closed 17 easier at 982p. Grand Metropolitan, on the other hand, warmed to dollar influences and rose 9 to 821p, while clearance of a line of stock overhanging the market put Guinness up 10 to 918p. The latter is James Capel's star buy for May. Ratners fell 12 1/2 to 165 1/2 p as reports began to filter back from analysts visiting its US operations. The suggestion was that US sales had not picked up as strongly as had been hoped following the end of the Gulf war. Turnover in Tesco swelled to 22m shares as the company bought 7.3m for its employee profit sharing scheme. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew paid institutions 297p per share and Tesco closed 9 higher at 296p. Kwik Save rose 5 to 592p on indications that Aldi, the German discount supermarket group, may now be looking towards markets in eastern Germany, rather than the UK, where it recently established a foothold. A two-way pull developed in Asda, which added 1 1/2 at 122 1/2 p on 11m, as some institutions continued to reduce their holdings following the profits downgrades and reports of weak trading. Other investors were buyers on the basis of the shares' recent underperformance. Argyll rose 11 to 316p on signs of switching from Tesco. Several broking houses lowered profits forecasts for automotive components group GKN and this exerted pressure on the shares, which weakened 6 to 361p. Bletchley Motor, the multi-franchised distributor, went 10 higher to 90p on a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson. Analyst Mr Jeremy Allen said the shares were standing at a 'significant discount' to the sector average, have a high yield of over 13 per cent and an attractive asset backing of 205p per share. Coats Viyella was well supported, and as the price rose so the values of its all-paper and mixture of cash and shares offers for Tootal were enhanced. Coats settled 6 higher at 148p and Tootal a penny firmer at 85p. The recent run in Flexello Castors &amp; Wheels was abruptly reversed by the warning that the interim results would be significantly worse than those of last year. To strengthen the company's financial and commercial position, discussions are taking place which might lead to an offer being made. The shares finished 12 down at 97p. Land Securities retreated 10 to 519p on 2.2m on worries that it may report a larger than expected fall in net asset value in its final results due later this month. Some brokers have already lowered their forecasts to around 685p per share, against 867p last time. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (122).

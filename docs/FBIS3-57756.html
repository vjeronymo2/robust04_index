Our correspondent Aleksandr Knyazev reports.    [Knyazev] The three ministers have signed a protocol on the  results of their meeting, which states that full mutual  understanding on all issues discussed was achieved. Among these  issues are the joint use of the installations and facilities  inherited by the sovereign armies from the USSR Armed Forces.  In particular, Lieutenant General Akhmedov, the Uzbek defense  minister, reported that a decision has finally been found on the  use of two training grounds.    The training ground of the Airborne Assault Forces deployed  in Andizhan Oblast of Uzbekistan is situated on the territory of  Osh Oblast in Kyrgyzstan, and the training center of the  Osh-based Motorized Mountain Rifle Division is situated near  Andizhan. The regularly-held training exercises of the Uzbek  airborne assault forces were often causing serious problems in  the relations between the two neighboring republics. Similar  problems exist with Kazakhstan.    The ministers have also discussed mutual interaction in the  field of arms and equipment supplies, the training of officers  and specialists, military transport, and other issues. It was  noted that military cooperation between the three countries is  not aimed at creating a separate military alliance, but will be  carried out within the framework of the CIS Collective Security  Treaty of which these three republics are members.</p>

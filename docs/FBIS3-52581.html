			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Taba talks will resume next week since Israel  and the PLO have bridged most of the gaps in their positions.  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz is in the studio with  the details:    Several words separate Israel and the PLO and are holding up  the official announcement on the resumption of the Taba talks.  Most of the work has, in fact, already been done and has  enabled official political sources in Jerusalem to say today  that the deliberations will be renewed next week, and only the  day still has to be decided. The telephone dialogue between  Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th has so far led to the following  outcome: The Taba talks will discuss the Cairo understandings  and the Declaration of Principles.    The PLO is pleased because it refers to understandings and  no  longer talks about the Cairo agreement or document. Israel is  satisfied because it is based on the Cairo Liaison Committee and  not on the Oslo or Versailles talks, as demanded by the PLO.  Israel is also pleased about something else; Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin said several times recently that Yasir 'Arafat's  recent demands are deviations from the Oslo documents. The  contacts are due to continue this evening. Foreign Minister  Peres is due to talk on the telephone again with Nabil Sha'th.  Peres also spoke with 'Arafat's special adviser Dr. Ahmad  al-Tibi several times today.    Correspondent Ya'aqov Balsenboim reports on Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the Meqorot company today:    [Begin recording] [Balsenboim] Rabin was the guest of the  Meqorot company which inaugurated Jerusalem's fourth water  pipeline, but he could not avoid journalists' questions about  the crisis in the peace talks. The first question put to him  was when would the Taba talks resume:    [Rabin] I hope that they will be resumed when a suitable  basis is found, if there is agreement on what was achieved in  Cairo. If there is no agreement then everything is open.    [Balsenboim] The prime minister added that if the Cairo  agreement is not approved by Tunis then we are also not bound by  what was agreed upon.    [Rabin] It is true that it was known beforehand that any  agreement reached in Cairo depends on the approval of the  leaderships in Tunis and Jerusalem. No approval was apparently  received in Tunis for some of the things achieved in Cairo. If  this is the case, then from our standpoint, things said in Cairo  do not have to be approved by us.    [Balsenboim] Asked about a possible meeting with 'Arafat,  Rabin said it is more important to reach agreement on the  Gaza-Jericho First agreement.    [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage such a meeting is  the issue. The aim is to find real answers to permit us to  implement the commitment to the Declaration of Principles, to  translate it into a detailed Gaza-Jericho First agreement.  Implementation will not start before we reach such an agreement.    [Balsenboim] To conclude, Rabin added that independent  contributions by ministers and Knesset members to the  negotiations are superfluous.    [Rabin] I think that at this stage, it is preferable to  leave the negotiations to those who have to handle them and  independent contributions are superfluous. [end recording]</p>

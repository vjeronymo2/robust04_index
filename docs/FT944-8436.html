			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds that beat the building societies - Regular incomes, second of a series There are many ultra-cautious investors who need a guaranteed income but want to preserve capital. The two products examined here - pensioners' guaranteed income bonds from National Savings, and guaranteed income bonds sold by insurance companies - can provide a higher monthly income than variable-rate building society accounts. The income is fixed for five years for pensioners' bonds and three to five years for most of the insurance company bonds. At the end of the guarantee period, you get your original capital back - but its real value will have fallen because of inflation. To counteract this, those with long-term income needs should protect their capital against inflation by investing in equities as well. Those who need short-term income might be interested in a guaranteed income bond. But they should remember: National Savings products do not pay commission to advisers, so this could influence recommendations. But the insurance company bonds pay commission of between 1 and 2 per cent of the lump sum investment. National Savings products are backed by the government, but insurance company bonds are sold mainly by the smaller life offices. Your guarantee is only as solid as the company backing it, so be on the alert for unknown companies offering high rates. If a company goes to the wall, only 90 per cent of your money is covered by the Policyholders Protection Act of 1975. The level of income on guaranteed bonds is determined by underlying money market interest rate movements. Clearly, the aim is to fix a deal before rates start to fall - but are you confident you can predict the direction they will take when the experts consistently get it wrong? These are short-term products, but you will be penalised if you withdraw money early. With pensioners' bonds, you must give 60 days' notice of withdrawal; during this period, you get no interest. Insurance companies have similar penalties. While rarely disclosed and virtually impossible to calculate, they are likely to be punitive. Tax status This is a crucial factor. The income from pensioners' bonds is paid gross but the income from the insurance guaranteed bonds is deemed to be paid net of basic-rate tax. In theory, this should make the former a clear winner for non-taxpayers, but the slightly higher income available on the insurance bonds can offset this tax advantage. Depending on rates at the time, non-taxpayers should consider both products. Pensioners' bonds are not attractive for taxpayers, who should choose insurance bonds if rates are good. Income level Rates for pensioners' bonds do not change often and the income level is the same for any investment between Pounds 500 and Pounds 20,000. Insurance bond rates change frequently and also vary according to the provider, the term and the amount invested. The top rate of 8 per cent net quoted in the fact-file applies to five-year terms where the investment is Pounds 10,000 or more. Tips from the experts Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private client banking and asset management group, was particularly concerned about the erosion of the underlying capital associated with these products, and the gamble on interest rates. 'Investors could be better off shopping around for the best building society rates and sticking to a maximum notice period of one month,' he said. 'Guaranteed income bonds are sensible only if you have fixed income and known capital liabilities. Very few people are in this position.' Andrew Jones, a partner with The David Aaron Partnership, an independent adviser, added: 'With these guaranteed products the investor and his adviser have to make a decision based on future interest rate movements. 'We believe the 8 per cent now offered by the insurance guaranteed income bonds represents good value. 'But if you think a Labour government will be elected in two years and that interest rates will rise, you might decide to keep your money in a variable-rate building society account and hope to lock into better guaranteed rates later.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TWO OPTIONS FOR SAFETY-FIRST INVESTORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pensioners guaranteed income bonds Recent net income or yield: Non-taxpayers:                  7.5% 25% taxpayers:                 5.62% 40% taxpayers:                  4.5% Key facts: Minimum age 65, minimum investment Pounds 500, maximum            Pounds 20,000.

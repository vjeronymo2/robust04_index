ANA encourages the for-profit corporations to assist the villages in developing applications and to participate as subcontractors in a project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project (e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the project and the Tribe's understanding that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E.

The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied through other Federal funding sources, provided the source relates to the ANA project, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance funds, through the Department of Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.

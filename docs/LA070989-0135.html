			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL SEEKS NEW LEADER, MORE STABILITY  </P> <P> For the fourth time in three years, the Fair Housing Council of the San  Fernando Valley is looking for an executive director, and some say the ongoing  turmoil is undermining its efforts to battle housing discrimination.  </P> <P> The council, one of the oldest such civil rights agencies in Southern  California, fired its executive director in May for incompetence. The council's  previous director was fired in August, only five months after taking the  position, for uttering a remark interpreted as anti-Semitic. Before that, the  position was vacant for nine months after the departure of a director who held  the position for less than a year.  </P> <P> Partly as a result of the staff turnover, the Fair Housing Congress of Southern  California, an umbrella organization that distributes city and county grants to  the six housing councils in Los Angeles County, in August placed the Valley  council on probation and began monitoring its performance. Marcella Brown, the  congress's executive director, said the probationary status would continue  indefinitely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Staff Turnover  </P> <P> Brown said the number of housing discrimination complaints investigated by the  council has not dropped significantly as a result of the mostly volunteer  organization's problems, including frequent bookkeeping errors, overly  ambitious fund-raising goals and rapid staff turnover.  </P> <P> But the number of council investigations resulting in complaints filed with  state or federal fair housing agencies or in private lawsuits fell from 20 two  years ago to six last year. Brown said the congress also began to hear from  clients who said they were unable to get the Valley council to pursue their  discrimination complaints.  </P> <P> In November, the council hired Juan Solis, an experienced housing coordinator,  and the investigative activity began to pick up, according to council and  congress representatives. The number of formal complaints filed rose to 15  during the fiscal year that ended June 30.  </P> <P> "There is a tremendous amount of housing discrimination in the Valley," said  Mary Lee, president of the congress's board of directors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Shift  </P> <P> The nature of complaints in the Valley has shifted somewhat from racial  discrimination and discrimination against children to denial of housing based  on prospective tenants' religion or national origin, Solis said. He said a  growing number of Arabic and Latino people are complaining about housing  denials.  </P> <P> Brown said the housing congress became concerned last year when the Valley  council's performance began to falter after many years as the most aggressive  in the city. "The council did go from being one of the top councils in the city  to not being one of the top councils, and that is why they are on probation,"  she said.  </P> <P> But Holly Azzari, president of the council's board of directors, said she does  not believe that the apparent revolving door for executive directors has hurt  the agency's ability to investigate discrimination complaints.  </P> <P> "The reality is that we have gone through three executive directors and it  doesn't enhance our reputation, but the other reality is that we are doing just  fine," Azzari said. "While there may have been problems last year, there aren't  any now and we are feeling very positively."  </P> <P> The councils find and train volunteers to serve as undercover checkers, who  attempt to buy or rent housing from sellers or landlords suspected of  discrimination. In recent years, the councils have investigated a variety of  other tenant-landlord disputes, a responsibility that some believe is  stretching their resources too thin. The San Fernando Valley council covers an  area from Glendale and Burbank on the east to the Ventura County line. Its  territory stretches north to Palmdale and includes the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> Lee said the San Fernando Valley council continues to meet the terms of its  contract with the congress. The council's outreach efforts and its handling of  complaints have satisfied contract minimums.  </P> <P> But, she said, the congress's board of directors feared that the Valley  council's performance was declining.  </P> <P> "That's why we're monitoring so closely," she said. "Our staff is going to make  sure they aren't so low that they can't" satisfy their contract terms. "We  don't want to run that risk. We want the community to be able to get the  service it needs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Sources  </P> <P> The congress this year will provide about $110,000 to the Valley council from  contracts it has with the city and county. The Valley council will need to  raise about $20,000 from private sources.  </P> <P> Janet Sohm, the congress's assistant director, said that in the past the Valley  council has set unrealistic fund-raising goals and then fallen short. Last  year, the council wrote a budget that required raising nearly $80,000 from  outside sources.  </P> <P> When former executive director Richard L. Levin was fired in May, Azzari said  he had been an ineffective fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Brown and Lee at the housing congress said the vacancy is particularly  inopportune. They said the congress is negotiating a new contract with the city  of Los Angeles to cover the 1989-90 fiscal year. Although a budget and a  contract for the San Fernando Valley council have been submitted, they have not  been approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> If the City Council requests additional information from the Valley council, it  will be difficult to supply it, which may hold up approval of grants for the  entire city, Lee said.  </P> <P> Clearly, "the best thing for them would be to get good staff up and running,"  Lee said.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Nowlin III, a council director who heads the search committee for a  new executive director, said the present problems are forcing board members to  function as day-to-day managers.  </P> <P> He said finding the right person to fill the job, which pays between $27,000  and $33,000 a year, is critical.  </P> <P> "It's critical because with an efficient, proficient executive director, the  board can be about the business of identifying the priorities for combatting  discrimination in housing," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Committee  </P> <P> The search committee has written a job description more specific than those in  the past, placed ads and begun reviewing applications, he said. A selection is  expected by September.  </P> <P> The executive director manages the council's office, administers its programs  and contracts, and acts as its chief fund-raiser, Azzari said. Although Solis  has been effective as a housing coordinator, Azzari said, he has never  expressed interest in the executive director's job.  </P> <P> She said the council's dismal record in hiring competent leadership is a  coincidence that she cannot explain.  </P> <P> "I've been involved in the selection of each of the three, and I've been  pleased with each of them," she said. "And then some unexpected large  deficiency appeared. We obviously have not done a good enough job in our  screening or we would not have made these mistakes."  </P></p>

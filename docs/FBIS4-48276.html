			<p>BFN     [Text] A convoy of government Army vehicles and of some  cars belonging to UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] from  Gitarama which was heading for Kigali, recently found itself  within shooting range of the Rwanda Patriotic Army [RPA].  However, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] would like to state  the following: Since a section of the Kigali-Gitarama road fell  under the control of the RPA, the latter swiftly informed UNAMIR  about it. Second, the convoy that was scared off by shots fired  by the RPA included vehicles belonging to the Rwanda Government  Army and to UNAMIR. Let us also recall that the same government  Army has confiscated several UNAMIR cars, using them at its own  discretion. This is witnessed by the fact that the blue berets'  vehicles were recovered [words indistinct] in the hands of the  RPA. In addition, UNAMIR has in fact reported the confiscation  of vehicles by the government (?Army) to the RPF. [passage  indistinct]</p>

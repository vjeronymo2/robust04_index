			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / French bank base rates rise France's leading commercial banks yesterday reversed the downward trend in interest rates by announcing the first increase in bank base rates since December 1992. Credit Commercial de France led the field by raising its base rate to 7.95 per cent from 7.7 per cent. Other big banks then followed suit, including Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale. Analysts interpreted the increase as an attempt to offset the pressure on the banks' profitability, which has been depressed by the continuing problems of the property market, by recent rises in money market rates and by the banks' poor performances in the bond and equity markets. 'What we're seeing is an attempt by the banks to protect their margins,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief French economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'They'd have probably liked to have raised base rates sooner, but waited to see if there would be a recovery in bonds. There hasn't been.' The increase in base rates flies in the face of the Balladur government's economic policy and of the stable interest rate stance adopted by the newly independent Bank of France. Paribas said that it did not expect yesterday's move to affect the central bank's future strategy. However, there was concern among observers about the impact of the increase on the cost of credit and hence on the prospects for France's still fragile economic recovery. 'It is unusual for banks to raise the cost of credit so early in an upswing,' said Mr Potts. 'The critical question is whether this is the beginning of a trend.'

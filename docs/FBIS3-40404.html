			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Pierre Rajot: "Regulation And </F> Standardization Of Biotechnology"]    [Text] The application of European regulations in France  completes an arsenal of already well-established measures.  Cooperation and reflection are required to see this complex  work, covering laws, procedures, and standards, through to a  successful conclusion. We will take an overview of the  situation.    The three European directives issued in 1990 required the  implementation in France of new legislative, regulatory, and  standardizing measures and, in certain cases, modifications and  additions to the existing set of measures designed to protect  man and the environment from biological risks.    For them to be included in French law, the authorities  judged  that directive 90/679 on worker protection could be applied in  the context of a major addition to the Code du Travail [Work  Code], and that directives 90/219 and 90/220 should be applied  by a law adopted by parliament and enacted on 13 July 1992. The  European Community moreover required that a set of 56 standards  accompany the application of the directives to cover genetic  engineering (90/219 and 90/220).    In this article we will therefore examine the situation of  these three aspects: work regulation, the law on biotechnology,  and European standardization.  <H5>  Work Regulation </H5>   Directive 90/679 is thus to be applied in France through the  Work Code which will receive a major new section. Very soon, a  decree will create "a section seven to the first chapter of  section two of book two of the Work Code" entitled "Prevention  of Biological Risk." After the definition of certain terms and  the classification of biological agents into four groups -- the  first containing agents that are not dangerous for man and the  other three grouping dangerous agents by degrees of harmfulness  -- the decree will provide, in subsection two, general rules for  the assessment and prevention of biological risk. Subsection  three will stress the requirement for training and dissemination  of information. Subsection four will list provisions specific to  certain activities (medical, funeral, and veterinary  establishments, medical biology laboratories, industrial  processes using pathogenic biological agents, etc.). Lastly,  subsection five will deal with the medical monitoring of exposed  personnel and the duties of the work medical service. This  decree should come into effect before the end of 1993.  <H5>  The Law of 13 July 1993 </H5>   This law is intended to regulate research, training,  development, production and marketing operations relating to  genetically manipulated microorganisms and organisms (GMM's and  GMO's). It is based on existing structures which it further  strengthens: the genetic engineering commission, charged with  establishing the danger criteria for genetic constructions,  assessing projects, and prescribing confinement measures; and  the commission for the study and dissemination of the products  of biomolecular engineering, termed biomolecular engineering  products, which is charged with studying each specific R&amp;D  project and project stage operating in an unconfined  environment, and which issues an opinion prior to the marketing  of the product.    Both commissions send their opinions to their parent  ministries, the government ministers being the only authority  empowered to authorize and prescribe safety provisions or to  refuse an R&amp;D operation.    The two decrees formalizing and defining the missions of  these two commissions were published in the Official Journal  [OJ] on 30 January and 24 February 1993. The two orders  detailing their respective contents were also published in the  OJ on 9 February and 22 May 1993. The commissions will continue  to examine all dossiers submitted to them, as they have been  since 1975 and 1986 respectively. In addition, the law  distinguishes training and R&amp;D work from production and  marketing operations.  <H5>  Research And Development </H5>   The decree of 27 March 1993 stipulates that R&amp;D units  and  study projects, whether public or private, must be approved by  the research ministry after the genetic engineering commission  has given its opinion. Operations already underway must have  been submitted for approval by way of a form drawn up by the  order of 9 June 1993 which must have been sent in before the  limit date given in the above-mentioned decree, i.e. 27  September 1993. Theoretically, all operations already underway  that have not been indicated by this date are illegal and fall  into the new operations category. New operations, before any  work can begin, must request approval on the basis of a dossier  which must follow the guidelines laid out in an as-yet  unpublished decree. It is hoped that this legal vacuum that has  existed since 27 September 1993 will be quickly filled.  <H5>  Production </H5>   The law states that the production of GMM's and GMO's will  be  regulated by the law of 1976 relative to installations  classified for reasons of environmental protection. No decree  or order has yet been published, since the insertion of this new  section into this law poses a number of problems which could  have repercussions for the whole industry.    For the time being, the administrative control of production  starting with genetically manipulated micro-organisms is done  according to heading 58 paragraph 11 of the list of classified  installations.  <H5>  Marketing </H5>   In this case, too, the vertical, sectorial marketing  regulations (agricultural products, human or veterinary medical  products, etc.) are being or will be progressively altered. A  regulatory measure should gather up those subjects that are not  covered by any vertical regulation.    This, then, is a brief summary of the current situation of a  regulation that is progressively being inserted into structures  that -- fortunately -- already exist. We can only hope that the  internal discussions currently underway lead us to solutions  enabling the safe, problem-free, non-delayed, and effective  application of the new biological technologies, based on the in  vitro manipulation of DNA and which are grouped together under  the heading of biotechnologies.  <H5>  Standardization </H5>   Well before this avalanche of Community and national  regulations -- under the direct auspices of the chairman of the  interministerial group for chemical products attached to the  prime minister's office and the ministry of industry -- France  had already begun to implement several tens of standards.    For public and private operators, the application of these  standards -- which can be revised depending on the development  of knowledge and in consultation with the commissions on genetic  engineering and biomolecular engineering -- has enabled France  to make quite spectacular strides in biotechnology, and in  complete safety.    In the field of agriculture alone, for example, between 1986  and 1992 France was able to set up more than 150 on-site  experimental projects, behind the United States which had begun  some 300 experiments out of a total of 600 being conducted  worldwide.    In the context of its own standardization policy, the  European Community wanted to push ahead with the establishment  of standards on a European scale. A more theoretical and less  pragmatic discussion than that made several years earlier in  France led to a 54-standard project being devised along the  themes taken up in certain chapters of the French Standards  text, without encompassing all of them. This is partly  explained by the lack of experience in this area of certain  European partners and by the speed with which the project had to  be set up. Nevertheless, AFNOR (the French standards  association), which has established a considerable lead in this  area, and with the backing of the national interprofessional  bio-industry organization (Organibio), asked the European  Committee for Standardization [CEN] to form a technical  committee, TC 233 biotechnology, which it would coordinate.  Moreover, the CEN obtained an EC mandate (from Directorate  General Three) to finance much of this work.    After the inevitable delay while an effective body was set  up, the program is now developing in acceptable conditions. It  is hoped that the great majority of national biotechnology  experts will cooperate by making constructive comments on the  documents being drawn up in the various international working  groups set up to produce the first draft.    This has been a rapid and perhaps tedious overview of the  current state of biotechnology regulations and standardization  in France and in Europe.    In such a wide field of application -- ranging from  agriculture to genetic therapy and from basic research to  marketing -- it is a long and arduous process to take everyone's  point of view into consideration. The important thing, however,  must surely be that we are seeing, for the first time in  scientific history, safety discussions taking priority over  industrial application.    There is a potential risk associated with biotechnology,  very  well defined by Professor Royer in his 1981 report commissioned  by the industry ministry. Only by the pragmatic study permitted  by the intelligent application of regulations and standards can  we further our knowledge of this potential risk and either  confirm it or disprove it. Advances in developing this  knowledge can only be made using a progressive approach,  structured between safety barriers, permitting dialogue only  between operators and members of independent socio-scientific  commissions, and subject to secrecy in the discussions.</p>

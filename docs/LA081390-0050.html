			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FDA OKS CLINICAL TRIALS OF SALIVA-BASED AIDS TEST  </P> <P> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week approved national clinical  trials of a saliva-based AIDS diagnostic test, according to Epitope Inc., the  company that developed the test.  </P> <P> It is the first widespread testing of a saliva-based procedure to detect the  presence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.  </P> <P> AIDS tests now detect HIV antibodies in blood serum, exposing health care  workers to potential HIV infection.  </P> <P> Testing of about 4,000 people began immediately at five U.S. medical centers.  If successful, the test will be used in hospitals and clinics. Eventually the  potential exists for an in-home AIDS test, much like the pregnancy tests now  sold over the counter in U.S. drugstores.  </P> <P> The device consists of a cotton-like pad impregnated with a preservative that  "absorbs antibodies." The pad, which projects from a handle that is shaped much  like a bent toothbrush, is held in the mouth between the gums and cheek for  about two minutes. The pad then is sealed in a tube and sent to a laboratory.  </P></p>

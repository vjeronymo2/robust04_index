			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pemex seeks to borrow Dollars 1.1bn Petroleos Mexicanos is seeking to borrow Dollars 1.1bn from banks around the world in what amounts to the first big syndicated bank financing for a Mexican borrower since the country shook the international banking system in 1982 by ceasing to service its foreign debt. Some foreign banks have already extended large loans to Mexican borrowers since the country agreed a debt reduction deal with its foreign creditors. Such deals, however, have been in the form of so-called 'club' transactions, involving small numbers of banks, and have not involved attempts at attracting broad support in the bank lending markets. The Pemex deal, which falls into three parts, will be used in part to refinance a Dollars 1.5bn trade-related bank credit which dates back to 1979. That facility was not part of the country's debt-reduction plan. J. P. Morgan has fully underwritten a Dollars 500m, two-year trade-related facility, while Industrial Bank of Japan is acting as agent to a similar Dollars 300m deal to be syndicated in Japan. BankAmerica is agent to a further Dollars 300m, one-year deal to back-up Pemex's commercial paper programmes. Banks in some countries are still subject to central bank regulations requiring them to set aside reserves against earlier loans to Mexico. However, bankers involved in the Pemex deal said that such regulations would not prevent banks lending new money. Pemex, like many other Latin American borrowers, has been active in the international bond markets for some time, and on Tuesday launched floating rate note issues to raise Dollars 400m. The switch to bank finance represented a long-planned move to diversify its borrowing, rather than a reaction to the mark-down of emerging market issuers in the fixed-rate bond markets since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in early February, one banker involved in the deal said.</p>

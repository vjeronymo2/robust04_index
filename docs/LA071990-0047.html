			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> 100 HELP IN CLEANUP EFFORT  </P> <P> About 100 local volunteers are participating in an effort to clean up Caltrans  property around the Hollywood Freeway, which they say has become a sanctuary  for transients and drug dealers.  </P> <P> Starting last weekend and continuing through today, the volunteers are helping  employees of the state transportation agency clear away huge amounts of  overgrown brush from the land, around and under the Cahuenga on-ramp to the  southbound Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> The brush had become living quarters for transients and a haven for drug  dealers to conduct their business, harass neighbors and avoid Los Angeles  Police Department scrutiny because the area is owned by the state, project  coordinator Sharyn Romano said.  </P> <P> Also helping were representatives of the city-sponsored Clean and Green  conservation project, Romano said.  </P> <P> The cleanup effort was sponsored by the Holly Park Place neighborhood group and  the Holly Drivers Neighborhood Watch, said Romano, who belongs to both area  groups.  </P></p>

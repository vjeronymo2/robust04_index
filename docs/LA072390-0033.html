			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DOWN-HOME, FAR-OUT SUNSET JUNCTION STREET FAIR  </P> <P> In a city not exactly known for tight-knit neighborhoods, Silver Lake stands  out for its semblance of community. So it was no surprise that the 10th annual  Sunset Junction Street Fair held there this weekend had the feel of an  old-fashioned, small-town festival: two-bit carnival rides, corn on the cob,  local merchants and artisans hawking their wares, and local musicians  entertaining the leisurely strollers.  </P> <P> This is Silver Lake, though, so the event had its own distinct, new-fashioned  character. Instead of a cake walk there were sign-ups for the AIDS Walk; among  the wares on display were crystals and handcuffs; and among the musicians were  the earthy-rock likes of Dave Alvin and John Doe.  </P> <P> But even the lesser-known musical acts served to reflect more than adequately  the culturally diverse community. At one point on a hot Saturday afternoon one  of two music stages hosted a Janis Joplin imitator (whose thrift-store fashions  mirrored the recycled clothing being offered at several stores within spitting  distance), while at the other end of the four-block fair Arco Iris played what  could be described as Latin-tinged crystal music.  </P> <P> Later "Janis" was succeeded by the Mustangs, a spirited all-female country-rock  group, while Arco Iris was followed by the Blue Shadows, a rocking blues group  that has gained a following as the house band at Hollywood's King King club.  All that was missing was the livestock competition. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

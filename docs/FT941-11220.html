			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Consumer group in window deals row A consumer group linked to two men facing directors' disqualification proceedings has become embroiled in acontroversy over a collapsed window installation company. Guardian Windows, a Hampshire-based company, went into liquidation this week owing an estimated Pounds 6m to 6,000 creditors. Mr Ivor Gershfield - general manager of the consumer group The Householders Association - and his son Aaron, who was a director of THA, are facing court action on Monday following the launch of disqualification proceedings by the Department of Trade and Industry in December. The DTI action arises from the Gershfields' involvement with City &amp; Westminster, the finance house which collapsed in 1991. The action is taken under Section 6 of the Directors Disqualification Act, which penalises directors for unfit conduct or serving on the boards of insolvent companies. THA had provided bonded guarantees to thousands of customers of Guardian Windows, which ran an unusual promotional scheme to increase sales. More than 1,300 angry creditors attended a meeting this week, called by insolvency firm Fanshawe Lofts. They attacked THA for accepting subscriptions to its bonded guarantee scheme when the plan did not cover promotional contracts. Guardian customers signed promotional contracts which provided a number of windows for a deposit of Pounds 1,299. The company waived payments after the deposit for the purchase of windows up to Pounds 4,000. If the customer introduced a second contract to Guardian - an average-sized house needed at least two contracts to replace all the windows - thedeposit would be refunded. Guardian collapsed with at least 1,500 contracts outstanding. THA has offered to install the windows for the difference between Pounds 1,299 and Pounds 4,000, even though that would not have originally been paid. The deposits are not covered under the scheme after three months.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: South Korean securities houses target City A FLOOD of South Korean securities houses opened offices in London last year, hoping to capture international investor interest in their country's equities and equity-related instruments now that the Korean stock market has opened up to direct foreign investment, writes Sara Webb. Six of the 18 securities houses to open offices in London last year were South Korean, according to an annual survey, New Foreign Securities Houses in London 1991, produced by Noel Alexander Associates, the banking consultancy. The six are Daewoo Securities, Daeyu Securities, Daishin International, Hyundai Securities, Korea Development Securities, and Ssangyong Securities. 'South Korean houses have come to London so that they will be well-placed to sell Korean equities, convertibles and global depositary receipts to international investors,' said Noel Alexander Associates. While 18 houses opened in London, nine firms left the City. The net increase in the number of foreign houses setting up in London last year was the highest since 1987. The nine which left were Kansallis Gota Securities, Levesque Beaubion Geoffnon, Litcorp, Mark Petrotrade Futures, O'Connor Securities, Potts West Trumbull, Shire Trust, UI Holding, and V. Berg &amp; Sons.</p>

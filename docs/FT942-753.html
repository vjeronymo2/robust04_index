			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Dobson backs rail union's claim Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, yesterday moved Labour close to outright public support for the series of one-day rail strikes mounted by the RMT transport union. Mr Dobson told the RMT annual conference in Liverpool that the signalmen at the heart of the dispute 'think they have been swindled; they are right.' He added: 'The government has been demanding that Labour should condemn the strike. We refuse to condemn it. Workers who are being swindled out of their wages have a fundamental human right to withdraw their labour.' Mr Dobson was careful not to express explicit support for the strikes, which have brought most of the rail network to a standstill on the past two Wednesdays. But he said Labour would 'continue to support the signal workers' claim . . . not as some fix or favour. They will get our support because their claim is just.' Mr Dobson's comments point to a stronger line in support of the strikes by shadow ministers, who have hitherto sought to avoid being too closely identified with the strikes. Labour MPs have been heartened by indications that many rail travellers blame the strikes on government interference in negotiations between RMT and Railtrack, the state-owned infrastructure company. Mr Dobson also said Labour would 'reverse the break-up and privatisation of the railways, and bring the system, the whole system, back under public ownership and control.' His comments strengthened Labour's commitment to renationalisation, which has previously been restricted to those parts of the network still in state ownership. Renationalisation of the 'whole system' would be expensive if it meant purchasing train operating companies sold to the private sector before the next general election. But Labour officials said Mr Dobson's pledge was subject to the shadow cabinet's agreement that all spending promises would depend on available resources. Mr Dobson accused the government of prolonging the dispute, and claimed that a settlement could be financed from the millions of pounds being 'squandered' on privatisation. 'For years, signalling staff have contributed massive improvements in productivity - accepting new technology and the changes in working practices that go with it,' he said. For two years, RMT negotiators had been told that an agreement rewarding the signallers for past productivity gains would be concluded when Railtrack took over track and signalling responsibilities in April. Mr Dobson claimed that a settlement rewarding signalmen for productivity gains would not breach the government's public sector pay policy, set out by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in September.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / P&amp;G sues bank over big loss on derivatives Procter &amp; Gamble has filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust seeking damages of more than Dollars 130m (Pounds 80m) over a derivative contract that caused a big loss at the US consumer products giant. The legal action is the second against the bank over losses stemming from derivatives. In its lawsuit, P&amp;G claimed the bank did not 'accurately and fully' disclose information about the derivatives contract. It is claiming Dollars 130m in compensatory damages, and an unspecified amount of punitive damages. 'Bankers Trust called themselves the experts and encouraged Procter &amp; Gamble to enter into a transaction we never would have accepted had it been fully and accurately presented,' Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said. He added: 'There is a notion that end users of derivatives must be held accountable for what they buy. We agree completely, but only if the terms and risks are fully and accurately disclosed.' The most successful and ambitious of the US banks in the derivatives sector before the turmoil that hit markets earlier this year, Bankers Trust was sued last month by Gibson Greetings over losses of Dollars 20m it sustained on derivatives bought from the bank. Derivatives are instruments whose value is at least partly based on some underlying asset or market. The P&amp;G suit stems from an interest rate swap contract, under which P&amp;G and the bank had agreed to exchange payments in the future based on the interest rates prevailing at the time. The scale of the payments made by each side would be based on the difference between the yield on five-year and 30-year US government bond. Bankers Trust retorted that its actions had been 'legal, proper and appropriate', adding that P&amp;G knowingly took a risk on the direction of US interest rates, after extensive discussions between the two sides about the risks involved. P&amp;G maintains it entered the contract as part of its normal practice of using derivatives to reduce exposure to interest-rate changes. The value of the contract plummeted in early February, when US interest rates were increased for the first time in four years. P&amp;G terminated the transaction, leading in part to after-tax losses of Dollars 102m it reported in April.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Observer: The chips are down A university campus is an unlikely place to decide the future of a big multinational. But Canada's McCain brothers, controllers of the potato-chip and frozen-food company which bears their name, have hired the University of New Brunswick's conference centre to sort out a dispute over who should succeed them as chief executive. The McCains and their lawyers have booked the entire centre, which includes 11 meeting rooms and a 166-seat auditorium. The arbitration - being heard by a New Brunswick judge - has already been under way for a month and is likely to continue for at least another week or two. Whoever loses is expected to appeal. Proceedings are secret. But it's understood that among the parade of business-star witnesses will be that well known Mr Fix-it, Sir Graham Day, ex-chairman of British Aerospace, Rover, Cadbury Schweppes, PowerGen, British Shipbuilders etc, etc. . . Day, who has 'retired' to an office in a local Halifax law firm, declines to say whose side he takes, though he knows both Harrison and Wallace well. But since Wallace is said to have closed his case last week, it looks like Day will be speaking up for Harrison who is trying to fight off his younger brother's efforts either to split McCain's in two or buy the rest of the family's shares. Either way, someone's going to get frozen out.</p>

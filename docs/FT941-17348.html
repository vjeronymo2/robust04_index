			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Record sales for mobile phone groups The UK's two leading mobile telephone operators reported more than 120,000 net new connections in December, easily the highest monthly total since the launch of cellular networks in the mid-1980s. Vodafone, the largest operator, reported a net increase of 52,500 in December, taking its total to more than 1m. Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, reported a net increase of 68,700, taking its total to 906,000. Cellnet added more connections in December than during the whole of 1992. Vodafone and Cellnet together made a net addition of nearly 750,000 new subscribers during last year, taking the total number of UK cellular subscribers, including Mercury One-2-One, the third network, to nearly 2m. Cellnet yesterday launched a digital cellular network operating to the pan-European GSM standard (global system for mobile communications). It competes with a similar service started by Vodafone last autumn.</p>

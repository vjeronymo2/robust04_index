			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland warns on profits Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers yesterday reported a 30 per cent rise in first-half profits. However, a warning from the publishing, printing and retailing group about prospects for the second half left the shares 22p lower at 483p. The company said the start to the second half had been disappointing and it did not expect to achieve the same results as in the comparable period. Sales in the 26 weeks to September 26 rose from Pounds 48m to Pounds 52.3m. After reduced interest payable of Pounds 43,000 (Pounds 296,000) pre-tax profits came out at Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 2.6m). In the year to March 28 1992 profits decreased to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 5.28m) after redundancy costs. Acquisitions helped lift publishing revenue in the first half by 9 per cent to Pounds 24.6m; without their contribution the increase was only 3 per cent. The opening of another three stores brought the number of One Stop Community Stores to 72, which contributed Pounds 800,000 to profits. The interim dividend is raised to 2.84p (2.73p) on earnings per share of 20.2p (14.4p).</p>

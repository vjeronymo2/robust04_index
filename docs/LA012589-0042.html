			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY CITY JUMPS PAST LA JOLLA, HAS SHARE OF FIRST  </P> <P> Take a football player and a long jumper and throw in an opponent that files  its intensity away at halftime, and you have a tie for first place in the City  Western League boys' basketball race.  </P> <P> That's about the way it happened Tuesday when host University City (13-6, 3-1)  came back from a 13-point halftime deficit to clip La Jolla (11-6, 3-1) in  overtime, 65-58.  </P> <P> The football player is Darnes Taylor. He's big, strong and, by his own  admission, not at home on the court.  </P> <P> "Everybody knows I'm not a basketball player," he said. "So I just go out there  and try to get everybody fired up."  </P> <P> Taylor missed most of the first half after taking an elbow to the nose. While  he was being attended to in the locker room, University City was foundering on  the court. Taylor came back in the second half and scored all eight of his  points, giving his team the leadership it needed and providing the means for La  Jolla to fall flat on its first league loss.  </P> <P> But the day truly belonged to the long jumper, Jerome Price, who stands at  6-feet 1-inch but plays as if he's 6-7 or 6-8 because of tremendous vertical  leap.  </P> <P> Price missed Friday's game against USDHS to participate in the Sunkist  Invitational Track meet in Los Angeles. He won the high school division with a  long jump of 23-6. University City lost to USDHS, 70-60.  </P> <P> A reporter at the meet told Price the bad news.  </P> <P> "(He) told me that we lost, and I was mad," Price said.  </P> <P> Tuesday, he made up for it. With University City trailing by nine, Price hit  two consecutive jump shots in the third quarter to help his team inch closer.  Minutes later, he hit a 15-footer from the left side to cut it to 42-40, La  Jolla. He then scored seven points in the fourth quarter to send the game into  overtime.  </P> <P> In overtime, University City took charge and won easily. Price scored five of  University City's nine overtime points and finished as the game's leading  scorer with 28.  </P> <P> "It's a whole different world when he's in there," University City Coach Tom  Medigovich said.  </P> <P> Medigovich thought about that last week when he considered dropping Price from  the team for missing the basketball game.  </P> <P> "I was not too thrilled at all," Medigovich said. "I made the decision that if  I kicked him off the team, I was going to do the team harm."  </P> <P> La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth questioned his team's ability to concentrate after  taking a lead. Twice while ahead in the final minutes of the game, La Jolla  missed the front end of a 1-and-1 to give University City its opportunities.  </P> <P> "I think it was totally a mental letdown," Eveleth said. "We've done it two or  three games in a row and today it came back to haunt us." DON PATTERSONValley's  Debbie Duhaney and Sarah Mease scored 18 points apiece. Mt. Miguel improved to  4-14, 2-4. El Cajon Valley dropped to 7-9, 2-3. City Western League Mission Bay  44, USDHS 43 -- For USDHS, Amy Seidlinger hit back-to-back 3-pointers to pull  the Dons' to within one, but Mission Bay (12-7, 4-0) held on for the victory  and overtook USDHS (9-5, 3-1) for first in the league. Cristina Willis, the  county's fifth-leading scorer, had a game-high 26 points for Mission Bay.  University outscored Mission Bay, 18-4, in the fourth quarter. Nonleague  Santana 63, Monte Vista 35 -- Stephanie Thompson scored a game-high 24 points  to lead Santana (15-2, 4-0). Rebecca Aase, Tammy Vates and Kim Olson added 10  apiece.  </P></p>

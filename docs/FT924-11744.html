			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Trade war with EC nears as US threatens Dollars 1bn sanctions TOP US officials met at the White House last night to consider imposing penal tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) of European Community food exports annually following the breakdown on Wednesday of talks in Brussels aimed at settling a two-year farm trade dispute. A decision to impose sanctions could trigger a tit-for-tat trade subsidy war between the US and the EC. It could also jeopardise six years of multilateral negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aimed at liberalising world trade. A senior US administration official said the meeting, chaired by President George Bush, was considering retaliation in the oilseeds dispute. 'There is a feeling that we have been stymied,' the official said. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said in Brussels last night that the result of the Washington meeting would determine the fate of the Gatt round. 'This has to be wrapped up within hours,' he said. He was due to speak to Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, before the meeting, in the hope of relaunching efforts to secure a deal and staving off the US retaliation package. Mr MacSharry said the EC would 'have no alternative but to counter-retaliate' if Washington introduced its punitive tariffs. 'The trade war will be on,' he added. 'It's easy to start one, but it will be very difficult to stop it. I don't want one. Nobody should want one. Co-operation, consultation and negotiation is what we should be doing.' He said he and his colleagues were waiting for the US to resume the negotiations. According to senior European Commission officials, Mr MacSharry intended to clarify with Mr Madigan what is the EC's 'bottom line'. News that the talks had broken down on Wednesday night between Mr Joe O'Mara, a senior US farm trade negotiator, and Mr Guy Legras, his EC counterpart, drew conflicting responses from EC capitals and Washington. Even as Mr O'Mara was flying back to Washington, having walked out of talks in which the US claims the EC backtracked on issues thought to have been settled just a week ago, EC officials contradicted reports that negotiations had broken down. Leaders in other capitals were less sanguine. 'In view of the very substantial progress achieved in recent days, the German government would consider it irresponsible if the negotiations broke down,' said Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister. 'We expect the EC Commission to do everything to achieve a result in the negotiations.' Mr Mollemann said a failure of the talks would be economically dangerous. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, rejected a French assertion that a conclusion to talks on Gatt might now be several months away whatever the result of next month's US presidential election. Responding to comments by Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, Mr Major said: 'I could not disagree more strongly with that view.'

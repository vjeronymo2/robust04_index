			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: Let your pension buy an office - In a Nutshell The pension industry may be under siege, with the Securities and Investments Board estimating that more than three quarters of people who took out personal pensions since 1988 were given 'inadequate advice'. But there is at least one benefit available that may have been largely ignored. According to Personal Pension Management, part of Provident Life, businessmen and women can use their own pension funds to buy an office for their businesses. Their businesses then pay a 'rent' to the pension plan, rather than to a landlord. The property is sold on retirement and any profit is put into the pension. These so-called Self-Invested Personal Pension Plans (SIPPs) are little known, partly because they are not attractive sales for pension salesmen working on commission. But they can produce substantial savings for groups of individuals, such as partners in the same firm, PPM says. Personal Pension Management: 0722 414888.</p>

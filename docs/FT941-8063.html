			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / IG Metall to limit its fire in wage battle: Stoppage next month will expand across north Germany unless deal reached IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, is set to begin strike action in the north German state of Lower Saxony on March 7. Union leaders said yesterday the strike would start there if, as they expected, this was agreed in a local ballot of workers. If the walkout fails to force employers to agree to union demands within two weeks, the strike will be broadened through northern Germany, Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall chairman, threatened. Despite the confrontational stance, Germany's biggest union was at pains to spell out it had no wish to drive companies to the wall in the country's severe recession. The choice of Lower Saxony was designed to minimise the impact of the strike on industry, Mr Zwickel explained. 'We want to avoid massive social conflict,' he added. The strike will initially affect only 90,000 workers at 230 companies. If it spreads to Hamburg, Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein, a further 170,000 workers at 380 businesses will be involved. The numbers are small compared to the 1m metalworkers in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south-west, traditionally an area where strikes have started in order to have maximum impact. Moreover, the union stressed it wanted to avoid disruptive knock-on effects and would steer clear of sectors worst hit by the current downturn. 'In order to keep the conflict within boundaries, we will at first call out strikes at companies where there will be no knock-on effect in the metal and electrical industries,' Mr Zwickel said. Companies in the troubled car components sector, of which there are many in Lower Saxony, will not be affected by the strike call. Nor will financially troubled companies in other sectors be targeted, the union said. The strike will have no impact on Volkswagen, the car group based in Lower Saxony: its workers are covered by a separate agreement with the union. The stoppage seems aimed at financially stable companies, primarily in machine tools. Union members will be balloted between March 1 and 3. The decision to postpone further strike action until two weeks after the beginning of a strike in Lower Saxony shows the union's desire to avoid conflict, Mr Zwickel argued. 'It is up to the employers to decide whether the strike remains within boundaries or whether it becomes a full-scale conflict,' he declared. IG Metall's tactics seem designed to put pressure on the Gesamtmetall employers' association to reach a compromise in the pay talks, which broke down after both sides had made significant concessions. The union has already stepped back from its initial claim for wage rises of up to 6 per cent, while employers have relented in their calls to abolish holiday bonuses. The dispute now centres on how employees should be paid for working flexible hours.</p>

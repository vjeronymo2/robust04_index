			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 30 May--Russia and the strategic  offensive forces of the United States and Great Britain have  taken effective step to create a higher nuclear threshold in the  world, Lieutenant General Viktor Yesin, head of the operations  directorate of the main staff of the Russian strategic missile  forces, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. In his opinion,  the retargeting of missiles at deserted sea areas, carried out  under existing agreements, will not diminish the combat  readiness of Russia's nuclear forces. [passage omitted]    Gen. Yesin said that all retargeting operations had been  completed within agreed deadlines and that they guarantee, as  envisaged in the agreements, a reduction of the nuclear danger  worldwide. In his words, this act of goodwill and mutual trust  does not free the strategic missile forces from the obligation  to defend the motherland and to maintain strategic stability on  the planet.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As a European Union [EU] communique on the  Ukrainian elections says, the EU with pleasure and enthusiasm  assumes that the elections were free and legal. This has been  confirmed by observers' reports, in which they praise the  organizational efforts. The EU expects that the election results  will allow Ukraine to continue political and economic reforms.  The EU has voiced concern over increasing tensions in the  Crimea. It fully supports Ukraine's territorial integrity,  according to the UN Charter and the principles of the CSCE Final  Act.</p>

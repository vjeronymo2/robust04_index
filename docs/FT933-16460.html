			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Insignificant Seven: Peter Norman on what to expect from the G7 summit in Tokyo It's July and the leaders of the most powerful industrial nations are packing their bags for one of the fixtures of the summer calendar: the Group of Seven economic summit which starts in Tokyo on Wednesday. With the G7 countries suffering from slow growth or recession, unemployment heading towards 36m in the industrialised world, and protectionist pressures growing by the day, a visitor from another planet might suppose that next week's three-day gathering of leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada would be of considerable significance. Sadly, the reverse is likely to be true. The G7 leaders are a sorry bunch. The host, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, is a lame duck who lost a no confidence vote last month and faces a general election on July 18. All his fellow summiteers are preoccupied with problems at home, and are unpopular. The same is broadly true of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who joins the seven after the G7 conference ends on Friday, except that he would no doubt happily trade his domestic problems for all those faced by his G7 colleagues. Nor are spirits high in the European Community delegation which will participate in the summit's economic discussions. The Japanese government will spend an estimated Dollars 8m to Dollars 10m on the summit and is taking it very seriously, since the G7 is the only multinational grouping in which Japan's leader can shine. Yet its determination to make a good showing raises the following uestions: Who attends? The G7 leaders, their foreign and finance ministers, and the European Community, represented this year by two Commission vice-presidents and the prime minister of Belgium, which holds the EC's rotating presidency. Mr Yeltsin joins on a 'G7 plus one' basis to make clear that Russia is separate from the main group. This year, there is one notable absentee, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, who has probably realised that he has nothing to lose and perhaps much to gain by steering clear of the event. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, will be absent because of illness. The summiteers will be supported by small armies of officials and the talks will attract about 4,250 reporters out of a total cast of 11,400 media folk. Why do they bother? Largely habit. This year's summit will be the 19th since the former French president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, decided to invite the leaders of the US, West Germany, Japan and Britain for a 'fireside chat' in the chateau of Rambouillet in 1975 to discuss economic problems following the first oil price shock. Since then, the summits have ballooned to include political and foreign issues which form the subject of a political declaration, issued on the penultimate day of the talks. The economic discussions are the basis of a communique issued at the meeting's end. Summits are also grandiose media events, although leaders now realise that there are not many votes in televised conspicuous consumption during recession. There will be a strong 'get to know you' flavour about this meeting. It is President Bill Clinton's first G7 summit, while the Italian and Canadian prime ministers have assumed power since his inauguration. France's veteran Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, will head a delegation from the centre-right government that took office in March. What's on the agenda? The main economic issues are world growth (or the lack of it) and unemployment; trade, focusing on the stalled Uruguay Round of liberalisation talks, and help for Russia. The political discussions will focus on regional conflicts such as Bosnia and Cambodia, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and strengthening the role of the United Nations. The latter two issues concern Japan, which is fearful of North Korea developing nuclear weapons and wants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. What can we expect? Few concrete decisions. In time-honoured fashion, the summit has been preceded by a downgrading of expectations. Following a US initiative, the G7 is trying to reach agreement in Tokyo on an extensive tariff-cutting package to give new impetus to the Uruguay Round talks. But progress on 'market access' has been slow in preparatory 'Quad' talks (involving the US, EC, Japan and Canada) and hopes are dwindling of a breakthrough when Quad negotiators meet in Tokyo on Tuesday. The G7 leaders hope to build on the support package agreed by their foreign and finance ministers with the Russians in April. The summit has been preceded by some useful progress: this week the International Monetary Fund approved a Dollars 1.5bn loan for Russia from a new 'systemic transformation facility'. The G7 will probably back a fund to assist Russian privatisation, which the US says could total Dollars 2bn. Mr Yeltsin can expect strong political backing, reflecting a G7 wish to involve Russia more closely in managing the problems of the post-cold war world. But the US's trading partners have rejected as impractical a US plan to set a common 3 per cent growth target for the G7 countries. Germany's interest rate cuts this week will mitigate but not terminate criticism of the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy. Japan will come under pressure, from the US in particular, to expand its economy and open its markets to reduce its huge trade surplus. But despite Mr Miyazawa's recent parliamentary defeat, Japan's government has so far been resolute in resisting what it considers pressure for 'managed trade' and in insisting that it can do no more to boost its economy beyond the fiscal stimulus packages of last August and April this year. Have summits ever achieved anything useful? Rarely. The law of diminishing returns has been been operating with a vengeance as summit after summit has vainly tried to give the Uruguay Round a 'push'. The 1988 Toronto summit agreed to ease the debt burden of the poorest developing countries. The first and last big summit agreement was in 1978 in Bonn when a co-ordinated growth package was agreed. It failed soon afterwards amid recriminations. Does it matter if Tokyo fails? It is doubtful whether the Uruguay Round could survive a total failure to make progress in next week's talks. If the summit ends in recrimination, some G7 leaders will call for a radical pruning or even an end to this annual ritual. Defenders of G7 summitry have always argued that the talks, though often inconclusive, have kept protectionism at bay. If Tokyo lives up to the worst expectations, they will not even be able to say that.</p>

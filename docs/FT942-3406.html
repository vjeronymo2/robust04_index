			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / CAA partly to blame for error The failure of the Civil Aviation Authority to implement recommended changes in lighting systems at London's Gatwick airport was yesterday held partly responsible for an incident last year when an airliner mistakenly landed on a taxiway. The crew of an Air Malta Boeing 737 with 101 people on board misinterpreted ground lights operating during a night landing and touched down on a parallel taxiway instead of the stand-by runway. Disaster was avoided because the taxiway was empty. A report published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport says the mistake, which was principally attributed to pilot error, provided grounds for 'serious concern'. It calls for a second review of Gatwick's lighting systems.</p>

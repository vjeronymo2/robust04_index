			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Greenalls buys hotel and country club from receivers for Pounds 10.3m GREENALLS Group, which operates the De Vere hotel chain, has bought the Belton Woods hotel and country club in Grantham, Lincolnshire, for Pounds 10.3m. The acquisition, from administrative receivers KPMG Peat Marwick, of the 96-bedroom hotel and 36-hole golf complex brings the number of leisure resort hotels in the De Vere chain to three. It already owns The Belfry and Mottram Hall in Cheshire. De Vere, which operates 25 hotels, plans to concentrate on golfing, business and conference hotels. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls' chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our experience shows that the demand from both business and leisure for golf-related four star hotels is growing.' The group opened a new hotel in Swindon earlier this year and recently opened a Pounds 10m extension to the Grand Hotel in Brighton. Profits from the group's hotel operations declined by 11 per cent to Pounds 6m in the half-year to March. However, last year the division contributed Pounds 15.58m - 20 per cent of the group's operating profits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 17 (XINHUA) -- China has made  significant progress in commercializing, industrializing and  internationalizing the country's high and new technologies since  the country started the "Torch Plan" five years ago.    The "Torch Plan", which was approved by the State Council in  1988, is now being implemented in the country's 120 high and new  technology development zones, which have been set up either by  local governments or the central government.    According to officials from the State Commission of Science  and Technology, the major technologies being developed in the  high-tech development zones are new materials, biotechnology,  electronics and information, integration of machinery and  electricity, high- efficient new energies and energy-saving  technology and environmental protection technology.    Last year the country's high and new technology development  zones had a total income of 57.3 billion yuan from their  technology, industries and trade, while their exports reached  0.73 billion us dollars.    Of the 10,000 high-tech enterprises, which employ 700,000  people in the development zones, 106 have an annual output value  of more than 100 million yuan.    In addition, foreign businesses and joint ventures in the  high- tech development zones now number more than 4,000.    For example, Beijing New Technology Industry Development and  Experimental Zone, which was established six years ago, now has  112 high-tech firms each of whose total income from technology,  industry and trade has reached 10 million yuan.    In 1993, the total income of the development zone's  technology, industry, and trade exceeded 10 billion yuan. Over  200 products from the zone were exported to more than 20  countries and regions, earning 70 million U.S. dollars.    At the moment, a number of new enterprises with advanced  technologies, scale-production, good potential market, and  qualified employees are emerging and growing rapidly in China's  high-tech development zones.    Some high technologies, such as optical fibre communications  and electronic information, have grown into major industries,  the first in Wuhan and the latter in Beijing development zone.    "To develop China's high-technology industry, we must  chiefly  rely on our own efforts and technology advantages while bringing  the country's new and high technology products to the  international market," said Huang Qitao, vice-minister of the  State Commission of Science and Technology.    Recently, the State Commission of Science and Technology, in  cooperation with overseas financial organizations, set up "China  torch plan new high technology industry investment foundation,"  which is expected to provide a fund of at least 120 million U.S.  dollars.    According to Huang, by the year 2000 the sales and exports  of  new and high technologies of China will account for about 15  percent of the country's GNP and its total exports respectively.</p>

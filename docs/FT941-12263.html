			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Keeping an eye on the weather To make an educated guess on the direction of US share prices this week, investors are advised to check the North American weather forecast. With a fresh Arctic blast on the horizon, the US economy suddenly seems vulnerable, at least temporarily, just as the initial readings on its first-quarter performance are trickling into a snow-bound Wall Street. Memories of the economy's deep freeze in the first months of last year, after a buoyant fourth quarter, are lingering. 'Weather, after all, was the first explanation used to justify last year's early stall,' says Mr Robert Barbera, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Few analysts expect any more than a brief downturn this year. However, a weather-induced slowdown could influence the financial markets. Record-setting cold weather in the east, combined with the devastation of the California earthquake, has put sales of cars, industrial production and construction on ice over the past fortnight. The extent of the damage may begin to surface today with the Chicago Purchasing Managers index of manufacturing activity. It will offer a preview of tomorrow's national survey, a closely watched measure of future economic strength. However, the direct impact of the weather on economic activity is less important to the stock markets than its indirect influence over monetary policy. In view of the recent natural calamities, will the Federal Reserve decide a shift to tighter money is warranted when its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets for the first time this year on Thursday and Friday? That question has assumed greater urgency with last week's news of a 5.9 per cent jump in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, more than a half point better than the consensus forecast. 'Unfortunately, nature seems determined to deny the Fed the accurate and timely information required' to make a well-considered decision, say Mr David Resler and Ms Carol Stone, economists at Nomura Securities International in New York. Be that as it may, most Wall Street analysts believe the FOMC will hold its fire - rain, sleet or shine - especially after reading beyond the headline GDP figure. The data also included a surprisingly tame 1.3 per cent increase in the implicit price deflator, a good gauge of inflation. As a result, stocks resumed their forward march late last week after consolidating in the first two trading sessions, when unease over technical conditions began to catch up with the market. On Thursday, the biggest one-day rise in the rate-sensitive Dow Jones Utility Average, viewed as market harbinger, put the blue-chip barometer back on track. The Dow industrials finished at 3,945.43, a second consecutive record. Is a sanguine mood justified? The market is sure to be listening attentively to today's Congressional testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, for any hints about the FOMC's thinking. His words could well bring warmth and reassurance.</p>

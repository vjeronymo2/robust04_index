			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Hardy Oil &amp; Gas calls for Pounds 27.6m HARDY OIL &amp; Gas, the exploration company demerged from Trafalgar House, yesterday launched a 1-for-4 rights issue of 17.8m shares to raise about Pounds 27.6m. Shareholders will be offered new shares at 160p apiece to enable the group to invest in further exploration. The cash call was accompanied with an up-beat profit forecast for the year to March 31. Group profit after tax is expected to almost double to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 5.1m), after taking into account estimated Petroleum Revenue Tax credits of Pounds 4m. However, the recent fall in oil prices forced the group to warn that the current year's trading profits might be 'adversely affected', despite hedging two thirds of its oil production. Analysts believe profits could fall by up to Pounds 7m. Hardy's share price - after an initial fall of 10p - recovered to end the day 5p down at 192p. Earlier this month the company announced its most significant gas find in the North Sea, 150 miles east of Aberdeen, since joining the stock market two years ago. It has also announced discoveries of potential significance in the US, Canada and the Netherlands, while building up a portfolio of exploration acreage, with stakes in noted oil-bearing regions such as the Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia. Mr Peter Elwes, chief executive, said he wanted to build on the recent discoveries. The rights issue was an exercise 'in cash flow management.' It would help fund the exploration which would generate the group's income. He also hoped it would help reduce borrowing, although he added that since the group's debt was all project-related he was not under any pressure to tap the equity market for cash. Hardy's share of the development of the Ravenspurn North gas field and the acquisition of an interest in the producing Harriet oil field in Australia have been financed largely by bank loans. By the end of last month some Pounds 35.4m had been borrowed. Mr Elwes hoped the contribution to profits from the sale of gas - particularly from Ravenspurn, which is priced in sterling and not subject to short-term price fluctuations - would do much to offset the instability of the oil price. To finance acquisitions and drilling in North America the company has arranged an Dollars 80m (Pounds 46.8m) credit facility. At the end of March it had borrowed Dollars 53.2m of this amount.</p>

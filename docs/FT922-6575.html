			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dobson Park dips 5% MR ALAN WATKINS, the former chief executive of Hawker Siddeley who resigned after BTR won control of the company in November, has become a non-executive director at Dobson Park Industries. The announcement came yesterday as the industrial electronics and mining equipment group announced a slight fall of 4.6 per cent in pre-tax profits for the six months ended March 28 from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 6.2m, and a maintained interim dividend of 1.9p. Earnings slipped from 3.52p to 3.32p. Mr Alan Kaye, chairman and chief executive, will relinquish the role of chief executive from May 25, continuing as full-time chairman. This ends a temporary combination of the two jobs following the retirement of the former chairman, Mr Gordon Marshall, in October. Mr Kaye, who has been chief executive for nearly eight years, will be replaced by Mr Oliver Chapple, the current deputy chief executive, who joined the company from T&amp;N last September. Mr Watkins' appointment is his first of any significance since he left Hawker, but it was expected he would receive several offers from British industry where his knowledge of manufacturing and product strategy could be put to use. Dobson Park has been diversifying away from its traditional mining equipment business in the past five years into industrial electronics, serving industries such as aerospace. Mr Kaye said Mr Watkins' experience at Hawker, and previously as managing director of Lucas Aerospace, would help the company with its future strategy and acquisitions. He described the latest profits at Dobson Park, struck on turnover of Pounds 98.8m (Pounds 114.2m), as 'satisfactory' in the context of a difficult market situation. Industrial electronics increased profitability compared with the second half of 1991, due mainly to cost savings and new products, but profits of Pounds 2.57m were still lower than the Pounds 3.4m recorded a year earlier. Mining equipment profits rose from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 3.03m, in spite of continuing contraction in demand from British Coal. This was more than offset by substantial overseas contracts, a good performance from the US-based conveyor company and the effects of rationalisation in the UK. In December the group announced a radical restructuring of the division because of forthcoming changes in the UK coal mining industry, and is withdrawing from its high-volume product areas. Mr Kaye said there had been some recent signs of recovery in certain markets, particularly the US.</p>

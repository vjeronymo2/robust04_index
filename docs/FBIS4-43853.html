			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gungor Mengi: "To Be a Prime Minister"] </F>   [Text] The newspaper reports on the real estate owned by  the Ciller family in the United States have once again placed  the question of Prime Minister Ciller's wealth on Turkey's  agenda. That is unfortunate for Turkey.... Arguments should not  be based on the wealth of the prime minister, who makes  important decisions for the country. The people must trust  Ciller, who has called on them to make sacrifices. However, the  existing realities make that impossible.    The Ciller family owns a shopping center with 30 shops in  the  United States. That center has 24 donums of empty land near it.  She also owns a 120-room hotel, an 18-unit apartment building,  and a four-bedroom house...    Some time ago Ciller described the United States as her  "second homeland." If the reports on the property she owns in  that country are true, then the people will believe that the  United States is her first homeland. How can the people rally  around such a leader? Ciller has not channeled her savings into  her own country. However, she has urged the citizens to trust  her. How can people do so? Will foreign investors not ask her  why she has urged them to invest in Turkey when she has made  investments in the United States? Will the local investors not  ask her why she has urged them to invest in southeastern Turkey  when she has made investments in the United States?    Disclosing the source of its wealth is not the Ciller  family's only obligation. It also has to transfer its assets to  Turkey. It has to join its fate with that of the people it  rules. Otherwise, it is impossible to be a prime minister .</p>

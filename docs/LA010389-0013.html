			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A DARK LOOK AT LIFE ON THE HOME FRONT  </P> <P> Breaking and Entering by Joy Williams (Vintage Contemporaries /Random House:  $6.95; 251 pages)  </P> <P>  With her two earlier novels -- "State of Grace" (1973) and "The Changling"  (1978) -- Joy Williams has come to be known as a writer talented in creating  surreal, dreamlike worlds corresponding to the mental states of  child-preoccupied women. The first one was a pregnant woman named Kate in shock  from the accidental death of her husband; the second, Pearl, was subject to  alcoholic and paedophobic hallucinations.  </P> <P> And now with the publication of "Breaking and Entering," a third has been added  to the Williams collection of mothers-gone-mad. This is Liberty, a young woman  first introduced in a short story called "Breakfast," part of a volume of  stories, "Taking Care," published in 1982. She is a pretty, though gloomy,  young woman unable to speak for herself, married to Willie who talks for her,  making up stories about his wife for the amusement of whoever will listen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Secret Lives  </P> <P> But with the expansion of story to novel, the plot has thickened, so that  Liberty's inability to talk, we learn, stems from much more than simple  reticence. She is a woman of secret lives created by Willie's honed skills of  breaking into other people's houses and living there for short periods of time,  a habit acquired after they are banished from the house of their parents at the  early age of 15 because of Liberty's pregnancy and their failed attempt at a  joint suicide.  </P> <P> Liberty's subsequent stay in a psych ward and her life upon release with Willie  leave her somewhat unsure of her status as real person. She tends to believe  that they are living beyond their own deaths, as she finds herself walking  through locked doors and occupying others' spaces. And Willie seems to have  taken up the occupation of saint, occasionally saving people from death by  physical intercession.  </P> <P> Sick green ocean tides come and go, carrying Liberty and Willie off to affluent  beach houses, then back to their own dilapidated rent-house in a working-class  neighborhood. The children from both sides of town are in states of desertion  because of disrupted households and low priorities given to parenthood. Liberty  baby-sits the 7-year-old bed-wetting Teddy who is wired to an alarm and a  rubber sheet at night and kept busy by his father's unfaithful girlfriend,  Janiella, during the day with an unending schedule of extracurricular  activities in order to keep him out of the house.  </P> <P> Dread, Despair and Sorrow stalk through the sumptuously appointed villas as  well as the low-income houses like apocalyptic specters, and the public schools  have become battlefields in a time of dark revelation as Liberty finds written  between the lines of a mimeo sheet about drugs from Teddy's school: "The  principal had misspelled absorption. The school had faulty wiring, daily  tornado drills, and nervous German shepherds with names like Kong and Goforit  prowling the corridors seeking illegal substances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awkward Metaphors  </P> <P> They had banned "The Little Lame Prince" from the library, had a nurse who  spanked children in the infirmary, and had turned off the drinking fountains  because there was salt-water infusion in the wells. A teacher had just been  attacked in a room where children were dutifully growing radishes in egg  cartons and making cameras out of Quaker Oats boxes. There wasn't time for  spelling."  </P> <P> Williams' preoccupation with the enigmas of time clogs her own generally smooth  running prose in places, creating awkward metaphors that even a wraith like  Liberty would be hard put to perform, as when "the moments of the past are  stones behind her, over which she stumbles forward." And, just as Liberty is  accused at one point of making an object of her life, so Williams is more  interested at times in making symbols of her characters than developing the  subtle contrarinesses that make fictional beings come alive.  </P> <P> But by and large, Williams' quick juxtapositions of telling detail draw the  reader into the story's otherwise murky undertow. And Teddy becomes one of the  more engaging children of modern fiction whose devotion to the egg he is  assigned to carry with him in his human sexuality class for a week, though a  futile effort in terms of actually making it hatch into something, makes him  the real hero in an otherwise motherless world.  </P> <P> The rivers of death and self-destruction are difficult to explore. But great  poets and prophets have not refused the challenge of the plunge, and our  literature is richer for it. Dante brought his note pad with him on his barge  ride down the river; Lethe and Jeremiah walked the streets of the City of Death  at daylight predicting its fall. And so Williams, in the good company of these  literary predecessors, continues with maturity and growing power to voice a  dark vision -- the reflection of life on the home front gone loveless and sour,  reminding us that the hour of Now is upon ourselves and our children, and all  is not well.  </P> <P> Taylor is the author of "Afoot in a Field of Men," a collection of stories  published by Atlantic Monthly Press.  </P></p>

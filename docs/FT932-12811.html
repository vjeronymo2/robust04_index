			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Search for greater security gets under way / A look at the questions the City must answer if it is to strengthen its protection against further terrorist attacks SHOULD there be more police on the streets to enforce parking restrictions and check on suspicious vehicles? Following the bomb attack last year in St Mary Axe, the Corporation of London increased the number of police officers by 40 at a cost of Pounds 1.5m. The extra cost was borne mainly by the big financial institutions which bear the burden of the corporation's Pounds 700m annual budget. The corporation likes to claim that a bomb discovered in Stoke Newington, north of the City, before last year's Lord Mayor's Show, did not end up being left in the City as a result of the heavy police presence. But this alone cannot stop bomb attacks - and didn't last weekend. In Northern Ireland, a large police presence and additional troops have not prevented bomb attacks. Should there be more regular checks on vehicles which are circulating in London? The police would like to carry out more checks at irregular intervals in order to wrongfoot potential terrorists. They are seeking more powers to do so but feel that their powers of detention on suspicion are restrained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. There is a specific restriction against the police setting up permanent road blocks to check vehicles. The police themselves worry about the potential of turning areas of the mainland into new versions of Ulster, which would be considered a victory by the IRA. Are there other ways of regulating traffic flow in the City? Three streets in the City have been turned into pedestrian precincts, and plans to pedestrianise other areas are likely to be hastened. Some back streets have already been closed off since last year's bomb - Throgmorton Street, for instance, which runs behind the Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. This, and moves to discourage the use of private cars, could lead to a concentration of commercial vehicles on to main thoroughfares, reducing the areas that need to be policed. Are the City's buildings adequately protected against bomb blasts? Short of rebuilding offices with reinforced concrete of the kind that might be used in a nuclear fall-out shelter, no material is available that can protect a building which is next to a bomb blast. Some City buildings gain some protection through the use of laminated glass with special frames, plastic film on windows or protective curtains, or mobile laminated fibreglass mat screens. These can minimise the risk of injury by flying glass by about 95 per cent and reduce the potential damage to equipment. The costs involved could be reduced if additional security were built in at an early construction phase rather than as a replacement. To fit out a 30ft by 20ft reception area in a City office with laminated glass can cost about Pounds 750,000. Is there adequate co-ordination of security strategies between the police and businesses operating in the City? Some security advisers think not. The problem is that companies tend to devise their own security policies without co-ordinating with each other and do not have serious forward planning on the issue. The corporation says that some businesses did get together with their neighbours to co-ordinate their security after last year's bomb, although it has not attempted to co-ordinate or encourage such action. Could private businesses be doing more to guard against terrorist acts? Police say yes - increased vigilance by company security staff, and better co-ordination with police. At least one large commercial establishment has been working closely with its private security advisers to monitor vehicles. Would increased use of video cameras help? Videos, together with additional technology capable of enhancing wide-angle images, can be used to provide evidence on the culprits of a bomb but do not necessarily guarantee prevention. There are about two dozen cameras in use to monitor traffic on the City's main streets, although few of these are linked to video recorders. The corporation said it would consider extending the use of cameras. Is the City more vulnerable than other financial centres? It is, not so much because it is less protected, but because the IRA is better organised and better resourced than any other terrorist organisation. Terrorist attacks on the European mainland are not on the scale they were in the 1970s and rarely involve destruction of property. Nonetheless in Frankfurt the Bundesbank has barriers supervised by armed police while businesspeople and bankers are known to be protected by personal bodyguards. Some senior executives use private lifts and work in offices without windows. In New York co-ordination of anti-terrorist policing under the FBI did not prevent the recent bomb at the World Trade Center. One of the main criticisms launched at anti-terrorism measures in the UK is that the security forces are too fragmented.</p>

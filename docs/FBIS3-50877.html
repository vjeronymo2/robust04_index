Indians and  peasants arriving in San Cristobal are being placed in a relief  shelter called Don Bosco. The National Human Rights Commission  has asked the San Cristobal Municipal Government and the state  and federal governments to set up shelters immediately. It is  expected that more families will arrive in San Cristobal during  Friday evening and Saturday.    In Tuxtla Gutierrez, near Chapa de Corso, military  checkpoints supported by the Federal Highway Patrol have  increased their search of vehicles. Schools in San Cristobal de  las Casas and other cities near the war zone are still  paralyzed. Mexican Army vehicles have started leaving San  Cristobal to take supplies to the war zone. The supplies will  be distributed in affected towns, which are calling for water  and food in order to survive.    In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, 14 detainees  were turned over to the Attorney General's Office. Also in  Tuxtla, at least 48 bodies were exhumed from San Marcos cemetery  vaults. The bodies were considerably decayed. Rubber gloves  and face masks were found at the cemetery as well as numbers  that had been assigned to the bodies.    Combat between the Army and the armed groups occurs  primarily  during the evening and morning. Trucks with vegetables  circulated between San Cristobal de las Casas and Tuxtla  Gutierrez on Friday. The Indian communities in Chiapas Heights  are the primary vegetable suppliers for the state capital and  San Cristobal. The only way to San Cristobal de las Casas is  through Tuxtla. There is no other way, because the other  highways are closed and the war zone is isolated.</p>

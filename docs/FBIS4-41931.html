			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty -- It seems that one of the Supreme Soviet's  plenary meetings soon will get down to ratifying the agreement  with the Russian Federation on the lease of the Baykonur  cosmodrome. A group of its deputies is speaking in favor of  this. According to information received from confidential  sources, a considerable number of deputies have been persuaded  to this effect.    It seems that the government of Kazakhstan is willing to  meet  them halfway on this issue. At least, Prime Minister  Tereshchenko in his recent speech at the Supreme Soviet session  could not justify dragging out ratification of this important  agreement by a number of officials. He has promised to submit  it for consideration by the deputies not later than the  beginning of this week [as received].    However, the agreement, which was signed by the two  countries  during the official visit to Russia by President Nazarbayev at  the end of March, has not yet been implemented. The term of  three months, which has been allocated by governments of both  countries for its finalizing, expires tomorrow. A lot of work  is needed in drafting its final text and signing the agreement  on the lease of the space site.    It is also important that after the accord on Baykonur was  reached at high level between Kazakhstan and Russia, attempts  were made to revise some of its main provisions. For example,  several letters have been received by the relevant government  commission from the Leninsk city administration and the city  soviet. The letters said that the principles of the agreement  contradict the wishes of local citizens. Therefore, Leninsk  should be singled out as a separate administrative and  territorial unit subordinate to Kazakhstan.    Those deputies who favor speedy ratification believe that  such a stance does not accord with the Republic's basic  interests. The space site and the town Leninsk make up a single  body and they should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the  Russian Federation as such. This has been secured by the Moscow  agreement.    We should mention here an article by Tarbya Sarabekova,  secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Committee for Economic Reform,  who used to work as the chairman of the Committee for State  Property of Leninsk. Published in the latest issue of PANORAMA  weekly, it says: "Kazakhstan owns Baykonur but it does not have  an intellectual property for it, scientific and technical staff,  or plants for the production of space equipment. All of them  belong mainly to Russia. Therefore, we are facing now the  problem of not losing it forever and turning it into an open  space museum, which would not last long. It will take three  months for it to be covered with sand. The space site is  located in a desert area, with moving barkhans. If Russia  leaves it, then there will not be any reason to work there and  they will not be anyone to do the job. The space site will  eventually die."    Sarabekova believes that "leasing the Baykonur space site  and its infrastructure accords with the basic interests of  Kazakhstan." The Republic has no money for its maintainance. It  does not have its own space industry, qualified personnel, or  design centers. The agreement will provide us with the chance  to gradually accumulate these things. If this chance is not  used then Kazakhstan would not be able to make a  scientific-technological breakthrough in the near future.</p>

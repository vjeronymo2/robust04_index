			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Technology: Life after linseed Waste straw left over from farmers' linseed harvest could be put to use making biodegradable matting for soaking up oil spills. This was one finding from a project to investigate industrial uses for fibre crops. The Pounds 1.9m Fibrelin project, co-ordinated by the Silsoe Research Institute in Bedford, is looking at new ways of using the straw which is normally discarded after the harvest of the bright blue linseed crop. The crop is grown for its oilseed which is used in animal feed and industrial processes. 'It will add significant value for farmers by creating a new market for another part of the crop,' says David Bruce, project co-ordinator. The government is partly funding the three-year project to find non-food applications for farm crops. Demand for natural fibres from the fashion industry is currently high, but Bruce is looking at more stable industrial markets for their long-term potential. The linseed fibres can be made into non-woven textiles for use in matting such as carpet underlay. Biodegradable mats can also be used to stop erosion on newly-disturbed soil, eventually decaying and leaving no residue. It is the absorbency of the matting that makes it suitable for soaking up oil spills. Bruce says the National Rivers Authority is looking at the potential of the fibre mats for use in pollution control. A decorticator machine which separates and combs out the fibres from the linseed straw will enable commercial production of the mats. The machine, to be in use by September, also separates the central woody core which can then be used to make boarding. The Fibrelin project comprises five industrial companies and five research institutes. It is also investigating the potential of other crops such as nettles.</p>

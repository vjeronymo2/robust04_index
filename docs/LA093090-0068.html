			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OVERDRIVE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE;  </P> <P> JUMP START; JAPAN COMES TO THE HEARTLAND BY DAVID GELSANLITER (FARRAR, STRAUS  &amp; GIROUX: $19.95; 214 PP.)  </P> <P> In the beginning of "Jump Start," David Gelsanliter raises a series of  questions. Among them: Are the Japanese saving the American auto industry and  "restoring our faith in the American worker," and will American labor be able  to organize Japanese plants in the United State?  </P> <P> To find the answers, Gelsanliter looks at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky.,  the Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and Honda's factory in Marysville, Ohio.  </P> <P> Choosing three stories was the author's first mistake. He correctly focuses on  the economic cost, such as tax breaks that small towns accord in luring the  Japanese -- or any employer. But he gets bogged down in reciting mind-numbing  details of the negotiations between local communities and the Japanese  companies.  </P> <P> The author, whose background is primarily in newspaper management, obviously is  enamored of the Japanese and their system of kaizen (continuous improvement).  In Japan, he says, "workers arrive early and stay late." We learn that American  auto workers can only accomplish 80% of what Japanese auto workers, dashing  around the plant, can do in the same time.  </P> <P> Gelsanliter clearly thinks all this is good. Well, is it really? He makes no  mention of the growing discontent among Japanese workers over the exhausting  pace of work and their quality of life. Such absences undermine the book's  authority and credibility.  </P> <P> The author says the success of "Japanese auto makers in the United States will  depend on how well they can blend their culture with ours." Yet this book is  too superficial to give the reader a feel for either culture, Japanese or  American working class, except in the most stereotypical manner -- the Japanese  work hard; American workers are lazy. American workers speak only briefly and  generally to reinforce the author's contention that they love working under the  Japanese management system.  </P> <P> The book's central failing, however, is that Gelsanliter does not capture the  pulse of any of the three plants he writes about. "Quality circles," a central  component of the vaunted Japanese tema concept in which workers discuss  problems, is explained in one sentence. Gelsanliter recognizes the quickening  pace on the assembly line but gives short shrift to the extensive evidence of  severe injuries and trauma at the Nissan and Honda plants.  </P> <P> So when the author concludes that "another generation is finding better jobs in  the auto industry without having to leave home," he has not made his case and  he is simply wrong.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (28): Advanced technology lifts desktop publishing systems - DTP, new software products for a maturing market INNOVATIVE software producers are giving a lift to the maturing market for desktop publishing systems. Publishers of larger magazines and newspapers may once have only considered buying, say, a dedicated newspaper production system from one of the leading suppliers, such as Atex or Systems Integrators (SII) of the US, or N. D. Comtec, a division of Norsk Data of Norway. However, publications across Europe and the US are produced on Apple Macintosh's range, for example, using standard or enhanced software packages from Quark (X-Press) or Aldus (PageMaker), which started life as suppliers of desktop publishing software. These advanced software products operate on the standard DTP 'platforms,' such as IBM's PC, the Mac or other computers that can be bought 'off the shelf' to produce a wide range of magazines and newspapers. The Spanish newspaper, El Sol, in Madrid is just one example of a large circulation daily paper produced on a Mac system, using software from Quark X-Press. 'Many of the most innovative of these newspaper and magazine software systems are produced in the UK - they achieve great results on what, initially, were desktop platforms,' says Ms Laurel Brunner of Seybold, the independent information resource group for publishing technology.* Among these new UK software systems which operate on the Mac are those from DPS Typecraft; Talbot of Bournemouth, and QED of Cheltenham. Meanwhile, across the DTP industry, the Dollars 1.83bn European market is the biggest in the world, and set to continue growing as technology has brought 500 years of graphic communications techniques to the computer industry. Sales of Dollars 3.9bn are forecast by 1994 - by then, there will more than 97,000 new desktop publishing installations up-and-running in Europe, with at least 18,000 of them located in this country, according to a report from Frost and Sullivan, the leading market research group.** But the rate of growth is likely to slow after 1992, as software and scanning input devices take an increasing share of sales from hardware and new DTP systems. While most DTP software programmes are English-based, companies such as Apple and Adobe have tackled the language problem, with increasing sales in non-English speaking countries. Several leading Arabic newspapers and magazines are prepared in London on Apple Mac systems using Diwan software. They include such daily broadsheet newspapers as Sharq al-Awsat, Al-Hayat and Sawt al-Kuwait which are produced in London and transmitted electronically to the Middle East for printing. Because a large proportion of software comes from the US, many packages are English-based, and the UK is - and will remain - the largest market in Europe for DTP installations, with sales reaching Dollars 737m in 1994. A typical DTP system includes a personal computer, a high resolution monitor; a 'mouse' or other hand-controlled digitiser for positioning text and graphics; plus software for word processing, graphics and page-composition; and a laser printer. DTP systems, which may or may not be networked, are generally at the low end of a larger market for electronic publishing systems. Colour continues to be a big topic in the DTP world - as systems move on from basic monochrome to colour, the biggest issue is how users can achieve colour-tone consistency across various computer screens, proof printers and presses - a facility which is especially important to advertising agencies, for example. Innovation abounds in all areas of the market, with higher performance PCs and new software packages. For example, the processing speed of Postscript, the page-description language from Adobe, has been significantly enhanced in the past year as somputer speeds have increased. Vendors of proprietory hardware for professional publishing systems are also 'porting' software on to the Macintosh platform. Apple has announced a new operating system, called System 7, which give a new environment for many applications, particularly publishing. One of these new enhancements is called 'Publish and Subscribe' which allows users on a DTP network to call up 'live' material, such as text, artwork or up-to-the-minute price lists. In the European market for DT systems, analysts expect an upsurge in demand in a number of application areas, particularly the production of magazines, advertising literature and public consumption information. Scanning - and particularly the input of higher definition with greater grey-scale and colour - is expected to push up the cost of scanners and attendant software. Sales of core hardware, personal computers and printers in Europe could be worth almost Dollars 1.3bn by 1994. *The Seybold Report, Eastbourne, (0323 410561) **European Market for Desktop Publishing: Frost and Sullivan, London; Dollars 3,800; 071 730 3438.</p>

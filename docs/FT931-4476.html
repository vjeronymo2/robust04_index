			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Yeltsin faced with threat of figurehead presidency THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies yesterday agreed a draft resolution to be debated today which would confine President Boris Yeltsin to a largely ceremonial office. Mr Yeltsin, who sat through the noisy emergency session of the congress, was prevented from speaking. But he told reporters as he left he intended to speak today, and would again demand a referendum on the division of powers. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, set the tone of the Congress in an opening address which deplored the continuing efforts to push through radical reforms in the absence of any sign of economic revival. He accused Mr Yeltsin's government of 'artificial and cynical moves to destabilise the situation and even involve the army and the interior and security forces in politics'. The climax of a day of bitter debate was the production of two contradictory draft resolutions, one produced by the leadership of the Congress, the other by the president. The first, approved by the Congress's drafting commission late yesterday, says that the parliament should 'draft proposals on giving the president the status of a head of state'. The ambiguous phrasing appears to mean that he would be a figurehead president on the German model, deprived of the right to choose a government or issue decrees. At the same time, the parliament must 'decide in more detail the powers of the Council of Ministers as a body of executive power'  -an apparent invitation to parliament to control the government. The referendum on the division of powers, agreed to by the Seventh Congress in December, would be cancelled and any future such referendum made impossible. Articles of the constitution frozen in December - including one under which the president could be forced to resign by the parliament if he performed 'unconstitutional acts' - would be reinstated. This resolution was drawn up after a speech by Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the parliament's first deputy chairman, which proclaimed that Congress was constitutionally superior to the president. However, the Congress's drafting commission rejected Mr Yeltsin's resolution, a repeat of an earlier motion rejected last week by the smaller Supreme Soviet, that would free the government to pursue radical economic changes. It would put the central bank, with state banks and state property agencies, under government management, but with residual parliamentary control. Mr Yeltsin's supporters stormed out of the committee meeting after the president's resolution was rejected, Itar-Tass news agency said. In turning down the motion, conservatives appeared to undercut attempts by a joint commission from the Congress and the presidency to forge a composite resolution. Today's session was widely expected to have to choose between two philosophies of power. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, warned last night of a 'potential tragedy' if the Congress continued to oppose economic reforms. IMF backs reformers, Page 2</p>

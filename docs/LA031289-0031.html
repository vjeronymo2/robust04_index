			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ITALIAN COUNTRY  </P> <P> BY CATHERINE SABINO (Clarkson N. Potter, Inc.; 1988)  </P> <P> FROM THE RURAL areas of Tuscany and Umbria to the Mediterranean coast, from the  villas of the northern lake regions to the Alps, it is evident that the Italian  countryside is full of charm and beauty. "Italian Country" is a colorful,  seasonal photographic tour of elegant villas, sun-filled coastal retreats,  Alpine chalets, rustic farmhouses, even a converted abbey, where la dolce vita  is apparent in everything from furnishings to regional food specialties. It's  interesting to note how architectural and decorating styles vary among regions.  The book ends with a valuable region-by-region travel guide that includes a  directory of home-rental agencies, hotels, restaurants and antique and  specialty shops, useful to those planning to vacation in rural Italy. ($35)  Virginia Gray  </P></p>

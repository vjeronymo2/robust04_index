The move will further  enhance the Indochinese country's integration into the  six-member grouping. Already Vietnam has been accorded observer  status to ASEAN meetings. Efforts are underway to increase its  participation in ASEAN's activities leading to full membership.  This was agreed upon by the grouping's six members at the ASEAN  ministerial meeting in Singapore last July.    American embargo on Vietnam is now history, thus setting the  stage for expanded economic growth and investment. This augurs  well for the speedy inclusion of Vietnam into ASEAN. ASEAN will  do well, to speak things aloud. The grouping's own future has  gone by leaps and bounds. Indeed, it is rapidly becoming the  nucleus of Asian unity, the hub around which an increasing  number of regional entities have been erected. Economic  benefit, aside from membership in ASEAN will confer on it  respectability in the international community. After all, the  people have suffered wars and destruction for far too long. It  is about time to take the rewards of peace with the accompanying  economic development. Among factors in favor of the country in  its ability to join up is that it has a market economy in the  making. It is now already in place. With these, the country is  poised to contributing much to the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA.  But membership is not automatic. Hanoi will have to work hard  toward making its economic and political systems more compatible  with its neighbors. If Vietnam shows genuine interest in  adopting the grouping's broader principles, including pluralist  politics and market economy, it should be made a member too.  The member countries have agreed that the country should be  given financial and technical aid to help its economic progress.    A remarkable feature of ASEAN is that it is truly flexible  and accommodating. The observer status remains deliberately  undefined. Cambodia has been accorded special guest status.  This has reflected the extent to which ASEAN can prime itself  in order to accommodate political sensitivity in its dealings  with third countries. Even without membership, Vietnam still  has a lot to gain. This is because ASEAN can effectively  cooperate with countries without having to formalize its  relationship yet. This also goes for Laos and Cambodia. A  widening of ASEAN from six to nine will refurbish its image  internationally. At the same time, it will strengthen its  bargaining position with its dialogue partners. Membership in  ASEAN has represented a tempting proposition for all the  Indochinese countries. Most importantly, the inclusion will  ensure greater geopolitical stability and defuse regional  tension. It will also be the catalyst for members to focus on  economic pursuits with renewed vigor.</p>

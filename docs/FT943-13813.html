			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Arts: A near perfect operetta - Siren Song Dave is a sailor - a nice boy, innocent, a bit lonely on shipboard. In a magazine, he sees a letter: 'Diana, 20, from Southampton, would like to correspond . . .' He writes to her earnestly and gets a warm reply. Things proceed swimmingly. Soon they are exchanging gifts and plans for their future, though unfortunately Diana has a persistent illness - throat? chest? lungs? - which frustrates their intended meetings. Time and again, he finds her friendly brother Jonathan waiting at the quayside instead, full of apologies and bonhomie . . . Here I apologise for going no further. As produced at London's Almeida Theatre by Ian McDiarmid with much ingenuity, Siren Song seems a near-perfect little operetta, or musical comedy, and one doesn't want to know too much beforehand. The original idea came from a novel by Gordon Honeycombe, and before that (I believe) from real life. Nick Dear made a libretto of it, wry, dry and extremely neat. The equally professional Jonathan Dove has set it to easy, singable music, backed by minimalist figurations but essentially in neo-Impressionist mode: imagine Ravel's 'Une Barque sur l'ocean' ACT'e' stretched gently over 80 minutes. The denouement ACT1st'e' might have been explored in painful depth, but Dove has preferred to leave well enough alone; our thoughts can fill out the situation. It is not easy to guess what the future of Siren Song might be. Too long for a curtain-raiser, but it is a natural curtain-raiser; best to see it now in this bright staging, and not worry about where it could go next. Fresh-faced, fresh-voiced Niall Morris makes an ideal Dave (and surely, one of these days, a West Side Story hero too). Tertia Sefton-Green sings Diana meltingly, and Omar Ebrahim has a whale of a time with sleek, evasive Jonathan. Smaller roles are filled to the same standard; Paul McGrath is the judicious conductor. This is delightful summer fare, in a single act that seems shorter than it really is. Last performances tomorrow, Friday and Saturday; whether before a lateish dinner or after an early one, Siren Song would be equally tasty as an amuse-gueule or a bonne bouche.</p>

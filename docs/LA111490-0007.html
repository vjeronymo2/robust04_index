			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HULL GETS BACK ON TRACK FOR BLUES  </P> <P> The Quebec Nordiques knew they were in for trouble. Hockey's hottest scorer  failed to get a goal in his previous two games.  </P> <P> Brett Hull scored twice, including the tiebreaker with 74 seconds to play  Tuesday night at St. Louis and the Blues won, 4-2.  </P> <P> It was the 11th consecutive loss for the Nordiques, who outplayed Montreal  Sunday night but lost in overtime.  </P> <P> In this game they battled the Norris Division leaders to the wire.  </P> <P> But, with overtime looming, Hull knocked in the rebound after goalie Ron  Tugnutt stopped Rod Brind'Amour's shot. Rich Sutter added an empty-net goal  with 15 seconds left.  </P> <P> Hull had to control a wobbly puck on his fifth game-winning goal of the season  and ended up with a sharp-angled shot as he skated close to the goal line.  </P> <P> "I wasn't looking anywhere," he said. "I just knew (Tugnutt) was down and I had  to get the puck up. I was running out of room."  </P> <P> Hull has 19 goals in 18 games and the Blues are off to their best start ever  (13-4-1).  </P> <P> Still, the Blues said they didn't play well much of the game. Hull said the  Blues' ineffective five-on-three advantage for more than a minute in the third  period was "the worst I've ever seen. You've got to expect the best in every  team, and we just took them lightly."  </P> <P> The Blues are 11-1-1 since Oct. 14. And the are 6-1-1 on their home ice.  </P> <P> New Jersey 6, Montreal 3 -- Dave Maley and John MacLean scored 44 seconds apart  in the middle of the third period at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> The victory ended the Devils' three-game losing streak and left them only six  points out offirst place in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> It was only the Devils' second victory in their last eight games against the  Canadiens, who missed a chance to regain first place in the Adams Division.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 1, Philadelphia 1 -- In a tYpically tough battle between  Patrick Division contenders at Philadelphia, the Flyers dominated, but couldn't  win.  </P> <P> After both teams scored in the second period, the Flyers did almost all the  threatening. In the last 25 minutes, the Flyers outshot the Rangers, 14-5.  </P> <P> Flyer goalie Pete Peeters has yielded only one goal in the last 135 minutes.  </P> <P> The Flyers learned that Tim Kerr, their all-time leading goal-scorer will  undergo knee surgery Friday.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Minnesota 1 -- Goalie Frank Pietrangelo emerged from the  Penguins' doghouse with a spectacular performance at Bloomington, Minn.  </P> <P> Pietrangelo, benched for two games after an indifferent performance, stopped 42  shots to help the Penguins win despite being outshot, 43-23.  </P> <P> Brian Bellows beat Pietrangelo in the second period, but the Penguins improved  to 6-2-1 in their last nine games.

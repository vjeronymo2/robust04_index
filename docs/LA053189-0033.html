			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONG KONG MOVES 350 VIETNAM REFUGEES TO BARREN ISLAND  </P> <P> The government of Hong Kong, saying its resources for housing Vietnamese "boat  people" have been overwhelmed, moved 350 men, women and children Tuesday to an  island with only basic rations and no shelter.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese, the latest of the 2,300 "boat people" who have arrived in the  British colony over the past three days, were taken by police launch and left  under guard on Tai A Chau, the main island in the Soko group, about 18 miles  southwest of Hong Kong Island.  </P> <P> "They will be provided with food and water, but we are not able to provide them  with shelter," said government refugee coordinator Mike Hanson.  </P> <P> "We simply have no accommodation left. I think it is important that people in  the camps and in the northern part of Vietnam understand that we have no  accommodation for 'boat people,' " Hanson said.  </P> <P> Hanson said any new arrivals would be towed out to the Sokos if their boats  were seaworthy but would have the option of continuing their voyage if they  wished.  </P> <P> The Sokos, among Hong Kong's 236 islands, are inhabited by only one elderly  Chinese couple. There is no running water and no facilities except for a  run-down former school.  </P> <P> There are now nearly 38,000 Vietnamese "boat people" jammed into Hong Kong's  camps, prisons and detention centers.  </P> <P> About 24,000 of them are regarded as illegal immigrants. They are ones who  arrived since last June, when Hong Kong introduced a policy that classifies  incoming "boat people" as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless  they can prove they are genuine refugees fleeing political persecution.  </P></p>

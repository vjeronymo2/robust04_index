			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor A. Har'el Fish: "Eretz Yisra'el and </F> the Question of Preserving Life"]    [Text] The religious community in all its diversity is  split on the issue of its duty regarding Eretz Yisra'el in these  days of historical decisions on which depend the future of the  people and the state. In truth, the disagreement on this subject  is not between the parties: the NRP [National Religious Party],  Shas [Torrah Observing Sephardim], Degel Hatora, and Agudat  Yisra'el, rather it is more correct to say that it exists within  each of these parties. In each of them, there are at least two  schools of thought that are opposed on this subject. Often, the  split passes even within the religious family unit, when the son  (or the father) believes that peace as a high Jewish value is  preferred over all else, and that this is what is on the agenda,  and the father (or the son) is convinced with all his heart and  his soul that there is no holier duty today than the duty to  ensure the territorial integrity of the country as it is now  held by us. Such a disagreement on principles is, perhaps,  legitimate.    Everyone can bring evidence from our forefathers to  strengthen his position, and the things are known. At the time  of one crisis, it was said of Abraham "and he mustered his  retainers" and then he smote the four kings; and on another  occasion he made an alliance with Avimelekh, King of the  Philistines, over the division of the country; Jacob, our  father, struggled all night with Esau's man and overcame him,  but in other circumstances castigated Shim'on and Levy for the  deed against Shechem. I do not seek first of all to establish  which way suits the situation to which we are now subject, even  though I have a clear opinion on the subject. I seek to argue  against posing the question as an ordinary Halakhic question of  what is permissible and what is forbidden, which can be resolved  with the customary tools.    In fact, both of the schools of thought rely on Halakhic  arguments. The "hawkish" school of thought links the question  with a positive commandment (according to the Ramban's system)  "to inherit the land" and with the injunction against  transferring ownership over the land of Yisra'el to foreigners.  And the conclusion is that one must not relinquish portions of  Eretz Yisra'el that returned to us in one way or another, and on  the basis of these commandments, the State of Israel must  continue to maintain its rule over all areas of the country that  were conquered miraculously in the Six-Day War. The "dovish"  school of thought does not deny the validity of the two  aforementioned commandments, but the rabbis of this school do  not view themselves as authorized to conclude from them a clear  military or political conclusion, on account of the calculation  of "the sanctity of life," which, as is known, supersedes all  the commandments of the Torah except regarding the shedding of  blood, incest, and idolatry, about which we were warned, "be  killed and do not transgress." As for the transfer of the  ownership over areas of Eretz-Yisra'el to foreigners the rule of  the sanctity of life applies, that is, "transgress and do not be  killed." Moreover, if the subject is "the sanctity of life of  the community," that is, a danger to the entire people or a  large part of it due to the observance of the commandment, then  of course the Torah does not require of us such a price to hold  on to all of Eretz-Yisra'el and to prevent the transfer of this  or that area to foreign owners.    According to this school of thought, only one question  remains: who will determine whether in our situation today there  is a fear for "the sanctity of life of the community" that must  bring us to a withdrawal? And the answer is that on this the  various experts will decide, experts on politics and experts in  military matters, and according to the teaching that they tell  us, we will act. If they decide to relinquish, we will  relinquish, and if they decide to stand firm, we shall stand. To  what is this similar? To a sick person for whom the Shabbat must  be desecrated. The doctor determines whether the law of "the  sanctity of life" applies to his illness or not. Military men  and politicians are, as it were, the doctors of our situation.  <H5>  Between a Verdict and a Torah Opinion </H5>   I present these views in general terms as they have been  understood among the broad religious public and without going  into all of the Halakhic details (and without going into the  difference between "a verdict" and "a Torah opinion," which, of  course, is important), and my question is: what is the nature of  this disagreement? From the Torah-religious viewpoint, has the  question been posed properly? Do the rules of this legal debate  indeed apply to the problem at hand?    First, let us ask the "hawkish" school of thought. Is there  really a complete correspondence between the subject of the sale  of lands and the transfer of the ownership over them to  foreigners, which is a simple, ordinary question, and the  defense or the relinquishing of areas of the homeland, which is  an existential-national question? It seems that in the time of  monarchy in Israel such fateful questions were handed over to  the decision of the king, who was to consult about it with the  High Priest and with the Sanhedrin according to the "decision of  the Urim" (see Numbers 27:21, and see Tractate  Yoma, page 73). And such matters do not belong to the  regular Halakhic level, but are instead much more serious. If  the Sanhedrin decides on war, it decides on life and death, on  existence, and its decision is definitely liable to result in a  heavy price in human life. And if the Sanhedrin decides in the  decision of the Urim on "withdrawal" at a certain moment of  danger, it does not appear that such a decision transgresses the  ordinary injunction against selling lands and transferring the  ownership to foreigners.    In short, there are two levels here, one  governmental-existential, and the other legal-Halakhic, and an  emphasis on the legal-Halakhic aspect weakens the arguments of  the "hawkish" school of thought in the eyes of many, both  religious and secular, who do not regard our big political  question today as an affair that belongs to the ordinary sphere  of what is allowed and what is forbidden, regarding which one  may ask a learned question and act according to the Halakha laid  down in the Shulkhan Arukh or in the "Yad Hahazaka."    Here, as was said, is the weak side of the "hawkish" school,  but the great advantage of the members of this school of thought  is that they view the question of Eretz Yisra'el and its  protection as mainly a religious question. A question  that must not be removed from the realm of faith and abandoned  to ordinary politicians, and ordinary military men. Even though  we said that questions of this kind belong to a level called  "the decision of the Urim," that, too, is an institution among  the institutions of the Torah and belief, where the calculations  are not solely political. While this institution does not exist  in our time, this does not mean that the approach is invalid,  that the principle of "the decision of the Urim" is invalid for  the Jew who believes in the Torah and the Prophets. This Jew  feels in the nature of things that his faith obligates him  precisely on the fateful questions of today, and that the trust  in Hashem [God], who is the savior and redeemer of Israel, is a  foundation that must be reflected in practical decisions and in  political and military moods. And here is expressed not only a  legitimate religious calculation, but even the main points of  his belief.    The "dovish" side in the disagreement starts, as it were,  with the assumption that here there is no ordinary Halakhic  problem, and as it is connected with political-military  calculations, it hands over the operational responsibility to  "experts" in this matter. But, in fact, the Halakhic calculation  is narrower for them than it is for the "hawks." For them, the  whole matter is reduced to the question of "the sanctity of  life," that is, the legal permission that is given to violate  injunctions for the sake of saving lives. And it may be asked:  does the Halakhic mechanism of "the sanctity of life" apply to  the question at hand? Is the question whether to withdraw from  Jerusalem and the cities of Judaea really on the same plane as  the question whether to violate or not to violate the Shabbat  for a seriously ill person?! Should not the question of "the  sanctity of life" have been kept in mind by, for example, the  rebels of the Warsaw Ghetto when they decided what they decided,  or by the defenders of Kfar 'Etzyon during the War of  Liberation? If we pose the problems in that manner, we will  arrive at absurdities. Perhaps it would turn out that Mattityahu  and his sons should not have risen up against the Greeks, and  that during the siege of Jerusalem in the time of Hizkiyahu, the  King, they should have surrendered to Sennacherib and not  endangered the life of the nation by a stubborn stand for their  independence! It is clear that here we have again arrived at the  sphere called "the decision of the Urim," or, more correctly,  the commandment to martyrdom, where the mechanism of "the  sanctity of life" does not apply in its ordinary form.  <H5>  The Sanctity of Life and the Sanctity of the Life of the </H5> Nation    There is no doubt that this aspect of the problem was not  obscured to the rabbis, including the luminaries of the  generation who studied it and determined here the foundation of  "the sanctity of life of the nation." They know well that on  fateful questions the Jewish people always puts its life at  stake "for our people and for the cities of our Lord," and that  the path of redemption is also the dangerous path. If that is  the case, why are they not ready to relate to the question of  Eretz Yisra'el and its borders today as such a question, a  question of faith, that is, a religious-creedal challenge of the  highest order? And why do they not come out with the traditional  call: "Be strong and let us get stronger for our people and for  the cities of our Lord"? Their answer will surely be that the  whole matter of "the decision of the Urim" is simply not  customary today, as it depends upon institutions such as the  Temple, the Sanhedrin, and the High Priests, that do not now  exist. And for that reason, the religious leadership has no  status in decisions in the political sphere.    Such an answer, as I have formulated it, seems logical. It  is  correct that we do not have a Sanhedrin and there is also no  chance that this institution will soon reappear. But the answer  is nevertheless evasive, and cannot satisfy the believing public  that lives the events of today. We must first of all ask, who  are "the diplomatic and military experts" who are to be relied  upon in the present crisis? One division of statesmen and  military men will tell us that the great danger to our existence  will come if we do not withdraw from Jerusalem and from Judaea  and Samaria. A different division of military men and statesmen,  no less honorable and impressive, will tell us that the danger  of extinction lies in wait for us precisely if we give in to the  pressures and withdraw from the territories. So, who are the  right experts whose opinion we are to accept? If we examine the  qualifications of the various "experts," we shall see that there  is not and it is not possible for there to be a scientific and  objective approach such as in the case of the doctor and the  sick person. Everyone brings to the question under discussion  his ideological baggage. The men of the left determine their  position according to their outlook, which--if we formulate it  briefly--is peace and brotherhood with the Arabs as a supreme  goal. The men of the right determine their position according to  their ideological position, which gives preference to national  honor and independence. The chasm yawns on either side of the  thin rope upon which we tread. One tells us to step in this  direction, and one tells us to step in that direction--each one  according to his ideological considerations. Because the  situation is exactly a situation of astonishing uncertainty  regarding the results of either step, but, nevertheless, we are  not exempt from the obligation to decide.    Is it precisely in this situation that the voice of the  basic  Jewish faith will be silenced? Must the great ones of the Torah  close their eyes in this situation and pass the decision to the  would-be "experts", that is, to the men of the secular  parties---who, in the final analysis, will make a determination  according to their ideological considerations? Will only the  place of the faithful Jews be empty when these great questions  are decided? I would be surprised!    The transfer of the decision to experts also means ignoring  the way that decisions are made in a democratic society. Here  there is no king or ruler that is all-powerful. The citizen must  participate in the decision. He bears responsibility for the  future of the nation--a responsibility that he cannot shift to  experts. Or, if you will, we are all "experts." What is under  discussion is an international and military situation whose main  components are known to all of us. We all feel the dangers, and  we shall all pay the price of mistaken judgements. And, if we  speak in more concrete terms, some of the religious parties that  are sitting today in the Knesset are known to have tremendous,  and even decisive, influence over the course of diplomatic  affairs. I refer mainly to Shas, but also to Agudat Yisra'el.  Even though they are not for the moment sitting in the  government, it is clear to everyone that in the given  parliamentary situation, the coalition is not capable of  functioning and implementing its withdrawal plan without the  support (or, at least, their nonopposition) of the many members  of Knesset from these parties. This means that they and their  leaders have an unprecedented responsibility for the fate of the  people and of the state.  <H5>  To Fulfill the Religious-Jewish Faith </H5>   Can it be that in such a situation they will shift their  responsibility over to "experts"? What is this like? It is like  the question whether to accept or not to accept the opinion of  the 10 spies who asserted that it was not possible to conquer  the country and to hold it. These were without a doubt the first  "experts" of that generation. Not only that as a matter of  course they were chosen for their public qualifications and  their defense knowledge, but their status as experts was  strengthened after they had travelled through the land and  examined it thoroughly for forty days! There is also no doubt  that the data that they gave on the security-military situation,  about the difficulties, and about the character of the natives,  had a foundation. It was only that their conclusions were  mistaken due to a lack of faith and trust in Hashem. As  Yehoshu'a Bin Nun and Caleb Ben Yefune asserted afterwards.  Yehoshu'a and Caleb did not deny the data that their colleagues  had provided. They rejected only their conclusions, and insisted  that the decision making had to take into account also the  factor of trust in Hashem and of fear of Hashem: "If Hashem  wants us and he will bring us to this country and will give it  to us!"    It is clear that we must today, as believing Jews, be guided  by our ideological considerations, and among these the great  principle of "Hashem is with us, do not be afraid." If all the  men of the secular parties bring their ideological baggage, we  can take into account the foundations of the Torah and the  faith, and it is even our duty to do that. Because it was for  that that the representatives of the religious parties were  elected by their voters. Their representatives were not elected  in order to decide according to the weltanschauung of Karl Marx,  and not even according to the position of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.  Rather it is their duty to fulfill their religious-Jewish belief  in the everyday life of the state, including the great questions  of foreign affairs and defense, and, perhaps, first and foremost  regarding those questions. Because among them, "security" can  never be just security, rather security with a double meaning.    And if nevertheless the esteemed rabbis who stand at the  head  of these parties prefer to evade their responsibility and to  hand it over to others--that is, to "defense experts"--there  will be no avoiding the conclusion that they are not ready to  ascribe a religious significance to the great redemptions of our  times, including the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. They  are not ready to see in these events "a way to pass to  redemption," something that requires us to take a stand on the  diplomatic questions. This approach is reminiscent of the  approach of some of the Torah greats in Eastern Europe at the  beginning of Zionism, who were not willing to view the Zionist  Movement and the beginning of the renaissance in Eretz Yisra'el  as "a way to pass to redemption." And for that reason, they  actually abandoned the whole matter of the return to Zion to the  hands of the secular camp. This comparison is depressing and  unfortunate. In retrospect, it may be determined today that the  reservation of the chiefs of "Agudat Yisra'el" from the year of  5672 [1912] until World War II did not exactly bring a  blessing to the people of Israel. And, therefore, it is to be  hoped that in the end, Shas will not repeat the same tragic  mistake of the early days of Zionism.    If we have learned to hear the voice of the Lord of Israel  speaking to us from the tempest of history, let us not today  seal our ears and behave as if there is no religious  significance to the great events of our times, including the  ingathering of the exiles in tremendous proportions, and  including our return to Jerusalem, to the cities of Judaea, to  the Temple Mount, and to the Western Wall. Here there is no fata  morgana, rather a revolution in the life of our people. Our eyes  see voices, and our eyes see the pillar of fire that lights up  the night for us. If we do not respond as a religious public to  this great challenge, it is as if we were agreeing with the  haters of Israel who assert that the Torah and its scholars  belong to the past, and that we do not have a part in the future  of the nation. And to such a version, the vast majority of the  religious public will not lend its hand.</p>

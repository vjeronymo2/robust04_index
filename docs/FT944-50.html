			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (2): Make sure your plan is a portable one - As competition increases, more than 40 life offices may go out of business Recent research by the consultants and actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested that at least 40 of more than 100 life offices currently trading were likely to disappear by the end of the century. This would be a direct result of the new disclosure requirements and the consequent competition to reduce charges. The same report said that only 10 per cent of existing offices are cost effective, and added: 'The remainder, mostly traditional life offices, are leaving themselves open to attack by the new, lower-cost, simple-savings providers.' For 'traditional' read old-style mutual. Mutuals are life offices that do not have shareholders but instead distribute profits to members, unlike the proprietary offices that are quoted on the stock exchange and can call on shareholders for extra cash. Some of the mutuals have proved less than adept at modernising their product range. Others are so small that they cannot afford the investment in marketing and information technology necessary to survive. The long arm of the Department of Trade and Industry will ensure that the rationalisation process takes the form of a series of takeovers and mergers, not insolvencies. The DTI closely monitors the solvency of insurance companies through the annual returns. A DTI spokesman said: 'It is unlikely we would let the solvency position of an insurance company get to the stage where it was in dire straits. If a company appeared to be getting into difficulties, we would try to encourage a takeover or merger. We would certainly try to avoid an insolvency. This would harm the insurance industry's image and would not be in the best interests of policyholders.' In the unlikely event of a life office insolvency, investors would be protected by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 and receive 90 per cent of the value of their plans at the time the company crashed. In addition to the small life offices, Bacon &amp; Woodrow identified two further 'at risk' categories. These were the subsidiaries of foreign companies and the broad-based, medium-sized life offices that try to be all things to all men - and in practice do nothing very well. Two recognisable groups emerge as survivors - the bancassurers, which produce their own products to sell through their extensive high-street branch networks, and life offices that concentrate on specialist products sold through independent advisers. In theory a rationalisation of life offices should be welcomed. Currently, over 100 insurance companies produce life and pensions products, the majority of which depend totally, or to a great extent, on their direct-sales force to sell their products. If the high chargers and poor performers go to the wall, then the blood-letting will leave behind a healthier financial services industry. Unfortunately, in many cases the criteria for survival will not be based on excellence but on commercial muscle. The streamlined insurance sector is likely therefore to be dominated by the giants, most of which sell the bulk, if not all, of their products through company representatives. If you plan to take out a long-term pension or life assurance-linked investment, your adviser should look for a provider that is likely to be around in 10 to 20 years' time when your policy matures. Consulting actuaries AKG carried out research into life assurance and pension providers' backgrounds. Managing director Nick Anderton said: 'Investors and their advisers should examine, among other factors, a company's ownership, its size, its backing, its relative position in the market, and the way it distributes its products. The last point may be important in terms of distribution costs, and hence the charges. Careful analysis of the provider's background should avoid turning the selection process into a lottery.' However, if inadvertently you do invest with a life office that subsequently is taken over, what assurances do you have that your fund will continue to be well managed? One theory is that a fund closed to new business following takeover should do well, because it does not bear any new business costs. For this reason, some advisers are thought to be recommending funds on the assumption that the provider will be taken over. Their logic has merit and may well prove to be accurate where the takeover was a result of synergy rather than impecuniosity. But bear in mind that, if you were originally sold a poor investment, an acquiring company is under no obligation to reduce excessive charges or remove high early-termination penalties. The best way to avoid storing up future problems for yourself is to make sure your personal pension is genuinely flexible and portable. If it is, you should be able to transfer out at any time without penalty, and your adviser should not take a fresh chunk of commission on the transfer in to the new provider.</p>

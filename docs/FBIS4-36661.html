			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sanaa, June 11 (AFP) -- Northern warplanes  Saturday bombed the airport in the city where southern leader  'Ali Salim al- Bid is based, a military spokesman said here  after a third ceasefire in Yemen's civil war collapsed.    The attack on al-Mukalla, the first air raid on an airport  to  be announced by Sanaa since war broke out five weeks ago,  "caused heavy damage to the airport and warplanes" based there,  the spokesman said without elaborating.    There was no immediate confirmation of the raid which came  hours before southern officials expected UN peace envoy Lakhdar  Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla.    Yemen's northern President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih called a  second ceasefire for Thursday during talks with Brahimi in  Sanaa, and then declared another truce for midnight Friday.    All ceasefires, including one declared here on Monday, have  collapsed with north and south blaming each other.    Northern artillery meanwhile fired about six shells that  landed near the airport in Aden, 300 kilometers (180 miles) to  the west of al-Mukalla, and other neighborhoods, starting fires  and damaging homes, southern officials said.    Officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said 18 civilians  were wounded.    Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden  as  rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12  miles) away -- evidence of the collapse of the ceasefire called  by the north for midnight (2100 GMT) Friday.    Southern officials said that northern warplanes also tried  to  hit the refinery in Little Aden.    Aid workers said offices of an Athens-based company working  at the refinery, the Consolidated Contractors Company, was hit  and set ablaze, but there were no casualties as the offices were  empty.    The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden  and vital for the south's armed forces, was hit last Sunday in  northern air raids, and six oil storage tanks were set ablaze.    Earlier, northern army units had halted their bombardment of  Aden and nearby villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said.    Running water was restored to some neighborhoods after  repairs were made to part of the pumping station that was  shelled last week, city officials said. [passage omitted]    Southern officials said on Aden television late Friday that  they had recaptured almost all of the eastern oil-producing  Shabwah province from northern forces after several days of  heavy fighting.    UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, arrived  Saturday  in the Saudi city of Jeddah from Amman after holding talks  earlier this week in Sanaa as part of a peace mission. He also  aims to meet southern leaders.    In Sanaa, a government official met with a UN mission  seeking  to organize relief for victims of the war, the official northern  news agency SABA' said.    In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said  one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety guarantees  before unloading emergency medical supplies for war wounded.</p>

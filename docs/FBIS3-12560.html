			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa emphasized today that the  situation in the occupied Arab territories remains dangerous and  demanded that matters be brought under control in line with  international law and in accordance with Israel's responsibility  as an occupying power.    The foreign minister said that consultations are under way  at  the UN Security Council to issue a resolution about the Hebron  massacre. He noted the need to prevent a recurrence of such a  hideous incident by disarming the settlers in the Hebron area.    He added: If the settlers are going to have weapons for  self-defense, the Palestinians must be given the same right. If  the occupying power protects both the settlers and the  Palestinians, this will be another matter and in that case the  settlers' weapons must be removed.    Musa said such a measure would serve the interests of the  Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 4 (BTA) -- The state and prospects of  Bulgarian-Belgian relations, matters concerning European  cooperation and security and the conflict in former Yugoslavia  were on the agenda of today's meetings here of Mr. Willy Claes,  with President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov, acting prime minister Evgeni Matinchev and  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. At a news conference this  evening, Mr. Claes expressed satisfaction with the talks.    Following his session with Foreign Minister Daskalov, Mr.  Claes told reporters that the two sides hold similar views on  the prospects of Bulgarian-Belgian contacts. He called  attention to the exchanged visits by the two countries' chiefs  of General Staff. Members of the Royal Institute for Defence  Studies will shortly visit Bulgaria. Mr. Claes sees this as an  indication of possible agreements in the field of defence.    A number of Belgian companies, especially in food  processing,  agriculture and tourism, might show interest in investing in  Bulgaria, the chief Belgian diplomat believes. He recommended  that the Bulgarian Government launch structural changes and  promised his Bulgarian counterpart that the Belgian Government  would provide the necessary financing guarantees to catalyze  investment. Encouragement of Belgian investment here was  discussed by Mr. Claes with President Zhelev. The two found  that there is a fine legal framework for an increase of Belgian  investment in Bulgaria and a pick-up of commercial relations.  In a couple of months, the Belgian Minister of Agriculture will  visit Bulgaria. A bilateral accord may be signed during that  visit.    Mr. Claes told Acting Prime Minister Matinchev that by  mid-May the ratification process of Bulgaria's Europe agreements  will receive a fresh impetus. In April, the G-24 will consider  Bulgaria's embargo-related losses. Mr. Claes expressed his  conviction that the Bulgarian foreign debt problem will be  settled soon and undertook personally to assist the negotiations  with the London and Paris Clubs.    The debt problem was also on the agenda of Mr. Claes's  session with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, who  found that the only dispute between Bulgaria and Belgium was the  Bulgarian debt to Belgian commercial banks. Mr. Yordanov set  forth the Bulgarian position on the Yugocrisis. "On this matter,  we have no differences whatsoever with the Belgians," he told  reporters. The Bulgarian head of parliament appreciated  Belgium's assistance to the entry into force of the Bulgarian-EC  Interim Trade Agreement and expressed the hope that Belgium will  help speed up Bulgaria's association with the European Union.  "We count on the Belgian Parliament for an early ratification  of the agreement," Mr. Yordanov said.    Bulgaria's integration into the European Community was the  centrepiece of the talks between Mr. Claes and President Zhelyu  Zhelev. The president's foreign policy adviser said that Dr.  Zhelev expressed the hope that Belgium will support Bulgaria in  its efforts to acquire an enhanced status in the Western  European Union and its integration into NATO. Dr. Zhelev and  Mr. Claes also discussed the situation in the Balkans and the  Yugocrisis. The guest lauded Bulgaria's position which upholds  the balance and is in a position to prevent extremes in the  behaviour of various forces in the Balkans, the Presidential  adviser emphasized.</p>

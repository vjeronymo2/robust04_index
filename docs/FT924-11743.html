			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Business sees UK economy slide into second dip BRITISH business suffered a 'deeply disturbing' slide into a second leg of recession last month and no quick turnround is likely, British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. Presenting a grim survey of more than 8,200 companies employing 1.3m people, Mr Christopher Stewart Smith, the organisation's president, said business confidence was 'seriously undermined' and all UK regions were suffering either a slowdown or decline in output. All the main economic indicators - sales and orders, employment, investment and confidence - fell back sharply in the third quarter, reversing a steady improvement in the UK economy over the previous 12 months. Mr Stewart Smith warned that the outlook for employment was particularly grim. Fewer than one in five companies was operating at full capacity last month and a big majority of large manufacturing and service companies planned to shed labour in the current quarter. Underlining the gloomy outlook, Ford said yesterday it would extend short-time working at Dagenham, its biggest British factory, by switching to a 2 1/2 day week for most of November because of continued weak vehicle sales. Mr Stewart Smith said: 'Overall, we have seen a worsening of the external economic environment with depressed home and export markets, interest and exchange rate shocks, as well as economic and political instability. These are not the conditions for recovery.' He called on the government to restore business confidence through infrastructure investment, deregulation and export promotion. But he warned against a 'dash for growth'. Stimulating consumer demand in the short term should not be the first priority, he said. Further cuts in interest rates from the current 8 per cent level were not necessary and could have a the short term should not be the first priority, he said. Further cuts in interest rates were not necessary and could have a counter-productive effect on the value of sterling, pushing up import prices. The government should focus on stimulating exports and business confidence, he said. Britain recorded its third successive visible trade deficit of more than Pounds 1bn last month. The deficit narrowed slightly compared with August but the Central Statistical Office gave a warning that the impact of higher import prices following sterling's devaluation had yet to be felt fully. Even so, import prices rose by almost 1 per cent, the sharpest monthly increase for two years. A 2 per cent drop in the value of exports last month was outstripped by a 2.7 per cent fall in imports which left the visible trade deficit at Pounds 1.06bn compared with Pounds 1.15bn in August. The Treasury blamed the drop in exports on sluggish world economic conditions. The visible trade deficit grew to Pounds 3.34bn in the third quarter from Pounds 3.19bn in the second. The current account deficit, which reflects trade in services and certain transfer payments as well as trade in goods, increased to Pounds 3.04bn from Pounds 2.85bn.

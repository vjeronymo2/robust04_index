			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Hype is hyped as Thatcher memoirs near publication BRITAIN is bracing itself for a blizzard of hype. The imminent publication of the political memoirs of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, is becoming a publishing and political phenomenon unparalleled in the post-war era. Even the hype is being hyped. Television cameras will tonight film The Sunday Times newspaper coming off the presses. It will carry an exclusive interview with Lady Thatcher to tout the newspaper serialisation that precedes the worldwide publication of The Downing Street Years on October 18. 'It will be of considerable significance for the Conservative party and the constitution,' Mr Andrew Neil, The Sunday Times editor, said of the interview. The interview was a consolation prize. Mr Neil wanted to begin the five-week serialisation tomorrow - before next week's Conservative Party conference at Blackpool. Lady Thatcher said 'no' and informed Mr Neil it was 'a deal-breaker'. The Sunday Times decided to delay by a week the serialisation, which Mr Neil hopes will add between 50,000 and 100,000 to his paper's 1.27m sales. 'To the political classes, this book is the equivalent of Andrew Morton's Princess Diana,' said Mr Neil. Mr Eddie Bell, chief executive of publisher HarperCollins - which like The Sunday Times is part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media empire - began to realise he might have a phenomenon on his hands in May at a dinner for the world of bookselling and publishing at London's Berkeley Hotel. Lady Thatcher told the gathering, including many people with socialist or social democrat inclinations, that she was planning to market the book with a two-week tour of the UK followed by a two-week tour of the US. But mostly she told them about Britain and how she wanted to see it great again. 'It was incredible. She got a 10-minute standing ovation,' said Mr Bell, who has read the book twice. He described it as 'an absolute page-turner'. Mr Bell's head is on the block because he has paid, it is believed, a total of Pounds 3.5m, including serialisation rights, for the book and a sequel about Lady Thatcher's early years. So far the orders are as impressive as the advance. By yesterday UK booksellers had subscribed for - that is, ordered in advance on a sale-or-return basis - 247,000 copies. Two reprints are already complete and another is likely before publication. Nearly 200,000 copies have been ordered in the US. The book will be available all over the English-speaking world by October 18 and there will be simultaneous editions in translation in 11 countries. The book is not a chronological account of her 1979-90 premiership, but covers themes such as the 1982 Falklands conflict and the 1984-85 miners' strike. The Falklands chapter is said by those who have read the book to be particularly strong, with details of decision-making, almost minute-by-minute, at the highest levels. Movers and shakers in the political world expected the memoirs to be a frank and informative read. But they did not think Mr John Major, Lady Thatcher's successor as prime minister, needed to lose much sleep over them. Certainly, the mood at Conservative Central Office appears relaxed. One senior official said yesterday that since Lady Thatcher had 'made it clear' she was not in favour of a leadership election, 'anything else she wants to say pales into insignificance'. The memoirs would be of 'enormous historic significance', the official said. He was not sure if Mr Major would have time to read them. But there is more to come. Lady Thatcher has promised to begin the second volume - on the day she gets back from her four-week promotional and signing tour for this one.</p>

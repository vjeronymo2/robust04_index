			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> DEATH ROW INMATE'S CONVICTION SET ASIDE  </P> <P> A Texas appeals court set aside the conviction of Death Row inmate Clarence Lee  Brandley, more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly  tried in the slaying of a white teen-ager. Brandley, 38, spent nearly nine  years on Death Row. He was convicted of the 1980 strangulation and rape of a  teen-ager at Conroe High School, where Brandley was a janitor. The court said  the state's investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked "the  rudiments of fairness" and ordered Brandley released to the custody of the  Montgomery County sheriff for a possible new trial.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Union Preparing Manifesto"] </F>   [Text] A statement issued by the members of the Presidium  of the Democratic Union (UD) after their 30 January meeting  asserts that the end of the current government coalition will  leave the country with debts, increased inflation and  unemployment, and postponed reform in the education, health, and  insurance systems, and local governments losing their power to  centralized authority.    The UD Presidium empowered its deputies to submit a draft  law  on county [powiat] governments to the Sejm. The Presidium also  called on all supporters of Solidarity reforms to "mobilize  forces" in the June local government elections. The UD decided  at its electoral conventions to name candidates for the councils  together with the KLD (Liberal Democratic Congress). Hanna  Suchocka urged members to arouse themselves from their torpor  and to get to work.    According to Jerzy Osiatynski, former Minister of Finance,  the current government is able to do only one thing--raise  taxes. "Under the slogan of fighting unemployment, the  government introduced a lump-sum tax for small companies. In  1993, 1 million people found work thanks to these companies.  Now, the entrepreneurs are deregistering their firms," charged  Osiatynski. He also warned against a rise in inflation brought  about by the "nonchalant attitude of the government to the  popiwek [excess wage growth tax that government plans to stop as  of 31 March]."    The halt in privatization and the bad climate surrounding it  were deplored. One Presidium member lamented, "Minister of  Agriculture Andrzej Smietanko is torpedoing attempts to  privatize the tobacco industry." Another complained, "The person  named to head the commission for ownership transformation is  Bogdan Pek from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], who knows  nothing about privatization."    The UD Presidium also expressed indignation concerning the  government's personnel policy as a return of the "old, PRL-style  functionaries [PRL referring to the Polish People's Republic,  the official name of the Polish state in the communist era]" and  "a purge of voivodes conducted according to party criteria."    Waldemar Kuczynski [former privatization minister and  current  member of the UD Presidium] stated that a joint UD-KLD  commission is preparing a declaration "in the poetics of a  manifesto" for the unification congress. It will consist of two  parts: "Poland five years after the fall of communism" (the  achievements and defeats of the Solidarity governments) and  "Poland of tomorrow" (the vision of the state according to the  new party). He added that the commission is looking for some  kind of catchy slogan, playing on national ambitions, something  in the style of "Polska gola" ["Polish goal," the refrain called  out by soccer fans during international meets].    For each KLD delegate at the congress, there will be 2.7  delegates from the UD. In the 100-person Executive Council,  there will be 73 former members of the UD and 27 former KLD  members. "We haven't yet given up on the idea of inviting 20-25  so-called notables to the congress," UD secretary Andrzej  Machowski told GAZETA.</p>

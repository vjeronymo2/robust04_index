			<p>BFN     [Text] General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian  police force, has ordered all the imams in Gaza Strip mosques to  halt all political activity in the mosques and to stop issuing  calls against the autonomy authorities over loudspeakers. Our  correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Nasr Yusuf also ordered  to shut down the mosques after the last daily prayer, which  usually ends at 2100. He also warned the imams against  nonreligious activity in the mosques. The Islamic movement in  the Gaza Strip has expressed opposition to and anger over  Yusuf's directives and over the fact that the Palestinian police  is hampering its activity.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 6 June adds:  "Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police in Gaza, has  been removed from his position as the Palestinian national  security commander [as heard], apparently against the background  of the sharp verbal clashes between him and Hamas (Islamic  Resistance Movement). He will be replaced by 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Majayirah, who headed the Palestinian delegation for security  talks with Israel. Recently there have been sharp clashes  between Nasr Yusuf and extremist Muslims in Gaza against the  background of Yusuf's demand to disarm Hamas and Islamic Jihad  activists, and also in the wake of the incarceration of Hani  al-'Abd, an Islamic Jihad activist. This is reported by our  Arab Affairs correspondent Oren Kohen."]</p>

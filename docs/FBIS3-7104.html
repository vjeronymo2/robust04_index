			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Australia Is Overdoing It"] </F>   [Text] Australia has said publicly on many occasions that  its survival and future interests depend on Asia, particularly  Southeast Asia, whose 350 million population possesses  considerable buying power. With this in mind, Australia has  strengthened economic relations with the region, particularly  with ASEAN, to firm up its foundation for future interests.  However, if Australia regards all Thais who step on its soil as  criminals, it is creating danger for itself.    Australian immigration officials can hardly deny that they  are treating every Thai man and woman arriving at Australian air  and sea ports in a discriminatory manner. Their luggage is  thoroughly inspected and women are given body searches as if  they are wanted criminals. All of this is simply because they  carry Thai passports. This is untolerable.    If things worsen to the point that Thai people express their  dissatisfaction with Australia at the national level,  Thai-Australian relations will be harmed more than by any  expression by the Thai Government. Thai people have wondered  for some time what criteria Australian officials use to reach  the assumption that all Thais are heroin traffickers and Thai  women are prostitutes. Holders of other passports do not seem to  be subjected to this assumption.    We want to warn Australia that things will worsen if it does  not rectify this matter. The discrimination against Thais is  unacceptable. It is a fact that Thais hardly create any  problems for Australia, compared with refugees coming to that  country. Thais certainly create less problems than the large  number of Hong Kong nationals, who merely go there to establish  permanent residency but never really live there. In addition,  the Thai Government has never treated Australia in an aggressive  manner as it has some countries. Does Australia want to be  treated that way by the Thai people?    If ASEAN should get tough, Australian aircraft and  commercial  ships will face great difficulties and Australian interests in  Southeast Asia will shrink. Australia must not forget how  countries having ambassadorial-level relations should treat each  other. The treatment of Thais as if they are criminal suspects  should be regarded as an insult to Thai people.    We ask Australia to remedy the way it treats Thai people. We  want to know how Australia will feel if all holders of  Australian passports are given completely thorough luggage  checks and Australian women are given body searches as they  arrive at Thai airports, sea ports, or border train stations.</p>

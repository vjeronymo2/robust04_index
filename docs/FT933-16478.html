			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Lang accused of gerrymandering MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, was accused yesterday of gerrymandering in his plans for reorganising local government in Scotland. The accusations followed publication by The Scotsman of details of Scotland's new council structure. The newspaper said the new system comprised only 28 single-tier authorities compared with the present two-tier system of nine regions, three island authorities and 53 districts. The Scottish Office refused to comment on the The Scotsman's revelations, but the 28-council structure is believed to be either the final proposal or a late draft and is in line with recent hints from ministers. Mr Lang is expected to announce the new structure next week. As expected, the new local authority plans involve the disappearance of four of the nine regions, including Strathclyde, which contains more than two fifths of Scotland's 5m population. The Lothian, Tayside and Central regions  -which like Strathclyde are all Labour controlled - will also disappear. Scotland's four cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, will each become unitary authorities. A total of 25 unitary authorities will be created, including a new council called East Renfrewshire around Glasgow. The three island councils will remain unchanged. The Scottish Office has argued that local government needs to be reorganised to make it simpler and more economical. Yesterday Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party accused Mr Lang of creating some authorities with anomalously small populations in order to try to protect existing Conservative councils or to construct new ones.</p>

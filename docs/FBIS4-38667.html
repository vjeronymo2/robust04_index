Talking to journalists, Igor  Giorgadze, chairman of Georgia's State Security Service, said  that this subunit has been trained at the Russian special  services' training centers. The Russian Armed Forces have  provided the new Georgian special-purpose forces with new modern  arms and equipment free of charge. The assault-landing brigade  comprises tanks, armored hardware, artillery, a crack "Alfa"  subunit, and an antiterrorist squad. The latter has been  trained, armed, and equipped by the U.S. CIA.    Newspapers in Tbilisi reported that the upkeep of the  Georgian special forces will cost the Republic 5 billion Russian  rubles a year.</p>

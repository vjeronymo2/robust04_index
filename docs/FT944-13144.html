			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Barrick details mining plans American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has outlined plans to sell four mines in the US and Canada, and to expand the Latin American operations which it acquired as part of its recent takeover of Lac Minerals. Mr Alan Hill, executive vice-president, said yesterday that Barrick plans to develop four new gold operations over the next four years. First will be a new mill at the existing Tambo mine in Chile, which is due to be commissioned early next year. This will be followed by the Meikle mine, which adjoins Barrick's flagship Goldstrike property in Nevada; the Cerro Corona mine in Peru; and the Nevada mine, also in Chile. Tambo is part of the El Indio complex in central Chile, which was Lac's crown jewel. The Nevada property, also held by Lac, is 50km north of El Indio. Barrick also recently acquired stakes in two exploration properties on the Argentine side of the El Indio belt. Drilling will start later this year on the 60 per cent owned Carmen property. The properties for sale are the Macassa and Golden Patricia mines in Ontario, Bullfrog in Nevada and the Red Mountain deposit in British Columbia. Barrick will retain the Bousquet complex and its 50 per cent stake in the adjoining Doyon mine in northern Quebec. The two mines have a combined annual output of 465,000 ounces of gold. Annual output from existing Barrick mines and the retained Lac assets is currently about 2.5m ounces, making Barrick the biggest gold producer outside South Africa. Mr Hill indicated that the company will outline more detailed plans for the development of its Latin American assets next February.</p>

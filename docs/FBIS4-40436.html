			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Two unattributed reports: "A Leak Has Been Revealed at the </F> Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant"]    [Text] On 7 June, a water leak from the second power  unit's decay tank, where cassettes with used-up fuel are stored,  was revealed at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES].  Head of the Chernobyl AES shift Oleksandr Yelchyshchev informed  the INTERFAX-UKRAINE Agency that the leak amounts to two cubic  meters per hour. He pointed out that this has not led to a  change in the radiation situation in adjacent buildings.    According to him, the water leak does not constitute any  special danger. O. Yelchyshchev also stressed that such  incidents are "a disease of all atomic plants of this type."  <H8>  * * * </H8>   As reported yesterday [14 June] by Ukraine's State Committee  for Atomic Supervision, at the second power unit of the  Chernobyl AES, beside the main system for adding water to the  decay tank, where there were 480 cassettes, three additional  ones have been prepared. Collection and purification of water  that percolates through walls and ceilings of several chambers  adjacent to the decay tank have been organized. The  radioactivity of this water is about 1.0 microcurie per liter.  It is mainly due to the presence of cesium.    A program has been elaborated for locating the leak, and  work  is based upon that program. In particular, 420 nuclear  cassettes have been taken out of the tank.</p>

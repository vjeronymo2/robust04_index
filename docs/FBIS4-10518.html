			<p>BFN     [Text] A note from PRENSA LATINA says that Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina today received, in Buenos Aires, the  Illustrious Visitor decoration which was granted to him by the  deliberative council of the Argentine capital. The ceremony took  place during a 48-hour visit by Robaina to Argentina during  which he also met with the provisional president of the Senate,  Eduardo Menem.    It has been reported that legislators from all the political  parties represented in the Senate participated in this meeting,  which has been described as friendly. Upon welcoming Roberto  Robaina, Eduardo Menem ratified a resolution approved by the  Senate last year in which the Senate came out in favor of a  cessation of the U.S. blockade of Cuba.</p>

For some time the Americans have  shown an irresistible inclination to turn inward. They used to  call it "splendid isolation," when talking about the American  east and west coasts. Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, was  the "foreign affairs" president. With his State of the Union  address, Clinton has left no doubt that domestic policy is his  priority.    In his speech, Clinton was as brief as he was vague when  talking about foreign issues. Naturally the president  underlined the absolute leadership of the United States in the  world. But he kept the foreign chapter strikingly short, to be  able to go on all the quicker to popular domestic topics.    Clinton's plan to reform health care in the United States is  undoubtedly popular among average Americans, even though they  find the plans unclear and scarcely comprehensible. But the  reform plan is facing considerable opposition from the  traditional right-wing camp -- including the Republicans and  right-wing Democrats. It is now as good as certain that Clinton  will have to water down his plans very significantly. So the  question arises: How much of the original plan will remain when  the president has reached a compromise with the Republican  opposition?    The president also wants to reform the support system for  the  millions of poverty-stricken Americans. Clinton wants to  provide these people with social security benefits and training,  but if they have not found work in the private sector after two  years then the money will once again be shut off irrevocably.    Clinton has not yet said how he will finance his plan. And  for this plan too he will be obliged to compromise with the  Republicans.    The striking feature in the president's speech was the fight  against crime. This is a very popular subject of conversation  in the United States and the hobbyhorse of the "law-and-order  fanatics" under the Republicans. Clinton wants to floor and  even overtake his rivals on this particular Republican private  hunting ground. And there is a very real danger of  demagogically raising the stakes in the fight against crime.  Clinton wants to take on 100,000 new policemen and build more  prisons at a cost of US$23 billion. The anticrime law passed  recently by the Senate expands the death sentence and has the  president's support. Better than any other, Bill Clinton knows  what themes make a president popular in the United States.</p>

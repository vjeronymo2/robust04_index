			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 19 Jan -- The authorities of the Dniester  Republic introduced the state of economic emergency  [chrezvychaynoye ekonomicheskoye polozheniye] "in order to  justify repression against the people who have run out of  patience with the corrupt and criminal leadership," Mikhail  Bergman, military commandant of the Dniester Republic, said  today. Together with Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed,  commander of the 14th Russian Army, he is known recently for  having accused the leaders of the Dniester Republic of  "untalented leadership" and for having urged citizens to demand  their resignation.    Mikhail Bergman noted that the decree by Igor Smirnov,  president of the Dniester Moldavian Republic, says nothing about  the collapse of the economy or steps to overcome it. However,  the population is being prohibited from holding mass  demonstrations and the press is being instructed strictly to  cover only government activity. Failure to implement this decree  will result in the dismissal of heads of state enterprises and  organizations and the immediate shutting down of private  enterprises.    Mikhail Bergman also said that the leaders of the Dniester  Republic "deliberately refused to compromise in the talks with  Chisinau and to regulate currency circulation with other  republics". As a result, former Soviet rubles still in  circulation have flooded in from all over the former Soviet  Union. Runaway inflation has brought the economy to  catastrophe, Bergman stressed in conclusion.</p>

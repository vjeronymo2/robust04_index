			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Maria Wagrowska: "Why Now?"] </F>   [Text] The shooting down of the aircraft over northern  Bosnia has been the first military intervention in the Yugoslav  conflict as well as the first combat action in the 45-year-long  history of NATO.    The possibility of an operation by the Western air forces  should have been taken into account. Since April 1993 there has  been a UN resolution which envisions the possibility of such a  reaction to the violation of the air space over Bosnia. Since  the spring of 1993 NATO has allowed the possibility of taking  military action whose purpose goes beyond the defense of the  territories of the "16." However, in the past as many as 500  cases of violating the no-fly zone were noted. Why, then, has  NATO decided to shoot down the aircraft now?    The information coming from the NATO headquarters suggests  that the organization's strategists did that for military  reasons. Their arguments boil down to the statement that there  had never before been such a significant violation of the no-fly  zone and that there had never been a need for an unambiguous  reaction.    Despite that, one can suppose that NATO undertook the  operation for political reasons as well. Acting with the  authorization of the greatest international organization--the  United Nations--it decided to underscore that it is the only  political-military grouping in the world which is able to take  an effective military action, an action that corresponds to the  challenges, threats, and needs of the present day. The NATO  operation in Bosnia has no characteristic features of an  offensive action (the organization excluded such a character of  military operations also in the era of confrontation with the  East) or of a revenge action. It is an action aimed at  restoring peace in a regional conflict.    It offers the Western alliance a chance to regain its  credibility, which has been eroded by a lack of action since the  beginning of the Yugoslav tragedy. NATO's action shows that  this organization feels responsible for the security of the  regions located outside of the traditional area of NATO  operation. However, it may also show that the West does not  want to leave such regions in the zone of Russia's influence.</p>

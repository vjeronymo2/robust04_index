			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AIRBUS FIRM ANTICIPATES PROFIT  </P> <P> Airbus Industrie today said it expects to report its first operating profit  this year due to more aircraft orders and efforts to cut production costs.  </P> <P> "The increase in orders is, in turn, a consequence of the consortium's recently  completed aircraft family . . . as well as of the continued buoyant market for  airliner sales," the consortium of four European aircraft companies said in its  monthly newsletter.  </P> <P> It put no figure on the profit.  </P> <P> Airbus said the profit will be shared among its four partners -- France's  Aerospatiale and West Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm, which each have a  38% stake, British Aerospace PLC with 20% and CASA of Spain with 4%.  </P> <P> Airbus said it won firm orders for 254 aircraft during the first nine months of  the year, down from 310 in the first three quarters of 1989.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEADING MAN;  </P> <P> INSIDE LINEBACKER TAYLOR PLAYS KEY ROLE FOR CSUN DEFENSE  </P> <P> Terrell Taylor, Cal State Northridge's man in the middle, might as well be  wearing a bull's-eye on his chest.  </P> <P> Every play he seemingly is the target for a hostile fullback or lineman. Their  goal: to turn Mr. Taylor, No. 13 in your program, No. 1 on the Matador tackle  chart, into a 6-foot-2, 220-pound divot.  </P> <P> The faint of heart need not apply at inside linebacker. It can be a daunting  position even when behemoth blockers miss on their charge.  </P> <P> "Say you're running and you don't see them, but for some reason they just miss  you," Taylor said. "The wind you feel when they go by is enormous. It's power.  It's like, 'Somebody was just trying to kill me a second ago.' "  </P> <P> Even minor jolts can hurt when delivered by men with 22-inch biceps.  </P> <P> "Little elbow points that hit you when they skate by? It's pain," Taylor said.  "You just say, 'My goodness, these guys are serious.' "  </P> <P> None, however, are any more so than Taylor, Northridge's resident film star.  </P> <P> If one thinks that Chuck Norris elicits grunts and groans on the big screen,  one should hear the reaction in CSUN's film room when Taylor leaves the imprint  of his face mask in the chest of a running back. Talk about making a lasting  impression.  </P> <P> Bob Burt, Northridge's coach, recalls one hit worthy of a rerun. "It was like  the next-to-last play against Portland State. They threw to No. 24 and Terrell  just took him out of there," Burt said.  </P> <P> For the record, Don Finkbonner wears No. 24 for Portland and he gained five  yards -- about the same distance he traveled airborne after Taylor smacked him  as he tried to make his way down the sideline.  </P> <P> Taylor, a senior, leads Northridge with 47 tackles and he also has left his  mark in several other categories. He has three tackles for losses, one sack, a  fumble recovery, two interceptions and four pass deflections.  </P> <P> He is even busy between plays, calling signals for CSUN's very un-Matador-like  defense, which is rated among the nation's best.  </P> <P> "Terrell is the leader of the defense," Burt said. Taylor relishes the role.  "I've wanted to be the signal-caller ever since I can remember," Taylor said.  "When I'm talking in the huddle, everyone else has to shut up. I get to take  over. It makes me feel like the boss and that makes me play harder because you  know everybody is watching you."  </P> <P> A year ago, Taylor was the one doing most of the watching. At the start of the  season, he was temporarily ineligible while waiting for a makeup grade to be  recorded. After being ineligible for the first game, he played mostly on  special teams before gradually earning more playing time as backup to inside  linebacker Rod Wilson.  </P> <P> It was a frustrating time. "I felt like I was just as good as the rest of the  guys, but my being late. . . . Once you play a game with people, everybody gets  into a little groove and they get comfortable playing with whoever is next to  them," Taylor said. "That hurt, plus I didn't know the pass defense. And in  this conference, you cannot play without knowing the pass defense."  </P> <P> In hindsight, Burt concedes that Northridge probably started the wrong  linebacker much of last season.  </P> <P> "He's an example for a lot of guys who may not play as much as they think they  should as juniors," Burt says. "When they get their chance, they need to make  the most of it. This season was his chance."  </P> <P> Taylor established himself early this time, putting a hold on a starting  position during spring practice. But the same work ethic that placed him in  that position almost kept him from staying in it.  </P> <P> Back home in Atlanta for the summer, Taylor was weight-training twice a day.  Then he tried to do a little too much in a squat lift and pulled a back muscle.  </P> <P> "I was trying to impress some of the girls," Taylor said. "These bodybuilders  were there and they were acting like the weight was so heavy and I was like,  'Oh, I can play with that.' I went out there and played with it, but I also  hurt myself."  </P> <P> Taylor was unable to do much training during the last month of the summer, but  he kept his starting job anyway.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7, Taylor once again is back in familiar terrority -- this time  showing off his team. Northridge, 6-1 and ranked ninth in Division II, will  meet Santa Clara (5-3) in a Western Football Conference game at Buck Shaw  Stadium, only a short distance from where Taylor played junior college football  at San Jose City College.  </P> <P> Taylor is among 12 players on Northridge's traveling squad returning to  Northern California where they played in junior colleges before signing with  the Matadors.  </P> <P> "We seem to have a harder time getting a kid out of Pierce or Valley than we do  out of Contra Costa or San Jose," Burt said. "It's the old 'familiarity breeds  contempt' thing."  </P> <P> Burt credits several Bay Area products from past seasons for spreading a good  word. "Guys who are happy with their situation go back and tell other guys,"  Burt said.  </P> <P> Taylor was helped along the way to CSUN by Clayton Bamberg, a former San Jose  teammate who starts at strong safety. Taylor had his heart set on playing at  the Division I level, but when Northridge's scholarship offer was the only one  offered on signing day, he took it.  </P> <P> Now he finds he has come full circle.  </P> <P> "I've talked to guys at JCs and they're like, 'Northridge, huh? A Division II  school. . . .' They look down on you, but they just don't know. This is serious  ball."  </P> <P> Take it from the man in the middle.  </P></p>

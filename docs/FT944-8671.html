			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann bounces back to the black Mannesmann, the engineering group which is beginning to benefit from earnings in its telecommunications activities, staged a turnround to a profit in the first nine months of this year, following a DM27m loss in the first half. The group's profits, which were not specified, 'improved substantially', while turnover rose to DM21.1bn in the first nine months, up 9 per cent on the year before. New orders jumped 18 per cent to DM24.7bn. The group's telecommunications division, built around the successful D2 mobile phone network which now has about 760,000 clients, is expected to report its first full-year profit. It broke even last December. The improved results at the Dusseldorf based group were driven mainly by 'dynamic' exports but it also saw improvements in the domestic market. The strongest performers were the automotive technology and hydraulics divisions. Krauss-Maffei, one of the world's leading tank makers, reported 'exceptionally high' orders following contracts from Sweden and the Netherlands. The group was also helped by a turnround at its pipe unit, one of its oldest activities. It represents almost 20 per cent of group turnover and has lost money in recent years. Sales rose 18 per cent, lifted by better turnover at the group's Brazilian unit, while orders rose 2 per cent to DM3.2bn. Demag, the plant division, increased orders 'significantly' following a rise in exports and the incorporation of Van Dorn Demag, a further step in Mannesmann's strategy of strengthening its presence in the US market. VDO, the automotive technology business, saw orders rise 19 per cent in spite of 'sluggish' growth in the car industry. Sales rose 9 per cent. But problems remain at Hartmann &amp; Braun, the group's electronics division, which made a loss.</p>

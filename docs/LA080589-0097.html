			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORE PREGNANT WOMEN DONATING OWN BLOOD;  </P> <P> FEARS OF DISEASES FROM TRANSFUSIONS INCREASES PRACTICE  </P> <P> As she entered the final month of her pregnancy, Ilene Tindall was well aware  of the horror stories about hospital patients contracting infectious diseases  from tainted blood.  </P> <P> Like a growing number of pregnant women, Tindall decided that, in the event she  or her newborn child needed blood during or after delivery, she would feel  safest knowing that it came from an unquestionable source: herself.  </P> <P> After consulting with her obstetrician about the risks involved, Tindall  readily joined the expanding ranks of pregnant women who, concerned over the  quality of community blood banks' supply, decide to store their own blood for  possible use during delivery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'This Way I Have Peace'  </P> <P> "This blood will be 100% safe," Tindall said shortly before technicians from  the North County Blood Bank drew her blood at Pomerado Hospital this week.  "This way, I have peace of mind about the quality of blood."  </P> <P> Fearful of contracting diseases such as AIDS or hepatitis from donors at  community blood banks, hundreds -- and maybe thousands -- of pregnant women are  making the same decision as Tindall.  </P> <P> During 1987, member blood banks of the Arlington, Va.-based American Assn. of  Blood Banks drew 282,856 units of self-donated blood from people facing a  variety of medical procedures -- more than double the 124,454 units of  self-donated blood drawn the year before.  </P> <P> That dramatic increase in self-donated blood, blood bankers say, is  attributable largely to increasing concerns that community blood supplies may  be tainted by infectious diseases.  </P> <P> However, despite the rising interest in so-called "autologous" donations among  pregnant women, the blood banking community has not yet developed firm  guidelines on how -- or even whether -- some pregnant mothers should donate  their own blood.  </P> <P> Because of caution among obstetricians and blood banks about changing past  practices, autologous blood donations by pregnant women remain "relatively  rare," according to Dr. Rebecca Flack, assistant medical director of the San  Diego Blood Bank, which stores blood donated by pregnant women.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Research Encouraging  </P> <P> "We do draw blood if they know they're probably going to need it," Flack said.  "And no one would argue that the safest blood transfusion for both mother and  fetus is blood that comes from Mom."  </P> <P> Research conducted so far strongly suggests that it is safe for pregnant women  to donate their own blood for future use, according to Tindall's obstetrician,  Vivian Ellis, who is on staff at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation.  </P> <P> Although Ellis describes such donations as being compatible with her  "conservative approach to labor and delivery," the issue of whether pregnant  women should donate blood is actively debated within the medical community.  </P> <P> A recent blood bank association publication includes sections titled "Should  Pregnant Patients Be Autologous Blood Donors?" and "Unanswered Questions  Regarding Safety and Effectiveness" of self-donations by pregnant women.  </P> <P> "My concern is that it should not become a commonplace procedure," said Merlin  Sayers, medical director of the Puget Sound Blood Center in Seattle. "Under  some (blood banks), it has become a routine procedure.  </P> <P> Some doctors worry that the risks faced by pregnant women who donate blood  outweigh "the risks she's trying to avoid," Sayers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Problems  </P> <P> For example, pregnant women and fetuses might face special problems on the  "very rare occasions" when donors faint or experience lowered blood pressure or  a dramatically slowed pulse, Sayers explained.  </P> <P> "While those are very innocuous events for a healthy adult, we (cannot yet) . .  . say those are innocuous for a woman who is a few weeks away from delivery, or  for the fetus," Sayers said.  </P> <P> Tindall, whose first child was born nearly two years ago through a Caesarean  section, opted for an autologous donation because her second child is to be  delivered by a vaginal birth. She made the decision after discussing the  possibility with her husband and obstetrician Ellis.  </P> <P> Ellis advised Tindall to consider an autologous donation because complications  can occur when a woman chooses a vaginal birth after a Caesarean section.  </P> <P> But, even though Ellis strongly supported the autologous donation -- as she  routinely does for mothers who face some risk during delivery -- Tindall  realized that such donations are not the norm.  </P> <P> "My sister (in Wisconsin) is an OB nurse in delivery, and she had never heard  of" pregnant women donating blood to be used should a complication arise during  delivery, Tindall said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drawn in Third Trimester  </P> <P> For obstetricians, "the first requirement is a healthy mom and baby," Ellis  said. The blood usually is drawn during the third trimester because it can be  stored without freezing -- and delivered immediately should a transfusion  become necessary.  </P> <P> Pregnant women now account for about 40% of all autologous blood drawn by the  Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank in Boston, according to Linda Chambers,  associate medical director of the bank, which has conducted research into  autologous donations by pregnant women.  </P> <P> Interest is high among pregnant women "because they tend to be highly motivated  and most are acutely aware of any risk to them and their family," Chambers  said.  </P> <P> Beth Israel's blood bank has safely drawn enough blood from healthy, pregnant  women to erase fears that the procedure is dangerous, Chambers said.  Consequently, the Boston hospital no longer does in-depth monitoring while  drawing the blood.  </P> <P> The San Diego Blood Bank conducts in-depth interviews with pregnant women to  determine if they and their fetuses are healthy. Nurses with acute-care  training draw the blood.  </P> <P> "When we have drawn blood, the people have done fine," said Victor DePratti,  medical director of the San Diego Blood Bank. "They don't necessarily require  monitoring."  </P> <P> In contrast, the North County Blood Bank routinely subjects mothers and fetuses  to extensive observation before, during and after the donation is drawn. During  Tindall's procedure, technicians used an electronic device to monitor her  heartbeat while a second monitor tracked the fetal heartbeat. That monitoring  added $25 to the blood bank's typical $94 charge for self-donation.  </P> <P> To Sayers, the different monitoring practices underscore the need for caution.  </P> <P> "That simply emphasizes that we don't have enough experience," Sayers said. "If  we had enough experience, I don't think you'd see such widely divergent"  monitoring procedures.  </P></p>

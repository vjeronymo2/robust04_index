			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armando J. Pernia] </F>   [Text] Last night in its first debate, the Senate  unanimously approved the Emergency Law on the financial system.  The Senate Finance Commission, however, is studying a number of  modifications to the bill to eliminate several unconstitutional  angles. According to Senator Haydee Castillo, modifications will  be to made to Article 5 because the [General Bank]  Superintendency cannot prohibit the transfer of properties,  instead it must ask a judge to prohibit it. There will also be  changes to Article 8 so the assistance preferential rates  principle, strongly opposed by Radical Cause and MAS [Movement  toward Socialism], can be established.    The Senate also proposed extending the deadline for the  delivery of Central Bank of Venezuela credits and Deposit  Guarantee Fund assistance to financial institutions to three  years. The other modification would require bank directors as  well as auditors in any financial organization to present a  sworn statement of their assets.    Senator Orlando Fernandez announced that the accounting  subcommission had agreed to summon all Banco Latino directors  since 1992 for questioning. They have already scheduled Ricardo  Cisneros, Giacomo Leon, and Fernando Laurio to appear at noon  next Tuesday. Apparently, Leon and Cisneros are in Venezuela but  Lauria is abroad. Parliamentary sources, however, emphasized  that the possibility of Cisneros or Leon attending the meeting  are very slim. Haydee Castillo said the parliamentary summons  will be sent out this week.    MAS Senator Orlando Fernandez reported that financial  sectors  are exerting pressure to see that the freedom on bail benefit  and the compulsory sworn assets statements are eliminated from  the law, on the argument they are "unconstitutional."  Furthermore, Senator Jose Lira claimed the Italo Bank is about  to "get its hands on" the Sociedad Financiera Latino through a  stock transfer operation. According to Fernandez, the alleged  embezzlement of Banco Latino trust funds amounts to 30 billion  bolivares.</p>

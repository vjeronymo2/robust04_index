			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Egypt focuses firepower on militants: Islamic extremists have forced Cairo to write off tourist revenues EGYPT'S government seems to have decided to write off the rest of this year's tourist season. A couple of weeks ago, the government did its best to play down the recent attacks by Islamic militants on tourists. It blamed the media for exaggerating their gravity and hired Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to burnish the country's image abroad. Government spokesmen said violence by the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the extremist group aiming to install an Islamic state in Egypt, had peaked and that 90 per cent of its members had been captured in security sweeps late last year and early this. The government seemed determined to rescue what it could of its tourist revenues, which according to Mr Fouad Sultan, tourism minister, are 20 per cent down on last year's record levels, when the industry earned Egypt a precious Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.25bn). Non-government estimates suggest revenues might in fact be down by half or more. Now, however, the government appears to have decided that it is more important to take the fight to the militants than keep Egypt comfortingly out of the news. Since the start of this month, which saw the most violent clashes between police and militants in a decade, a series of raids on Gama'a hideouts and, in one case, a full mosque in Aswan has left more than 40 people dead, including at least 10 policemen. The government denies it is operating a shoot-to-kill policy against the Islamic militants, but is taking massive firepower with it in raids on suspected hideouts. More than 1,000 police, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, for instance, took part in a nine-hour shoot-out in Asyut this week in which 10 militants were killed. The decision to step up the campaign against the Gama'a appears to reflect two discomforting factors for the government. The first is that its claim to have rooted out the militants has proven unfounded. Police and troops continue to be shot and killed in sporadic incidents in both Upper Egypt - the Gama'a's chief stronghold - and Cairo. Even in the face of tougher policing and tighter security at all main tourist spots, the Gama'a still managed to blow up tourist buses last week outside the Egyptian museum, a prime tourist attraction. Yesterday it vowed to avenge the Asyut killings with more attacks in Cairo. The second factor is that the Gama'a's aim of hurting the economy, as a means of destabilising the government, has been disconcertingly successful. Not only is the tourism industry, the country's fastest growing and potentially most lucrative, likely to lose about Dollars 700m this year, but some investors in Egypt's ambitious tourism development projects are reported to be getting cold feet. Businessmen have also been increasingly skittish since the Gama'a said they might direct attacks at foreign investments in the country. Earlier this week the US embassy called in members of the American business community to reassure them that there was no reason to panic. But it is a sign of the concern among businessmen that most say they unreservedly back the use of considerable violence against the extremists. 'The government must be very, very brutal indeed,' says one. There is a wide divergence of views among businessmen, diplomats and other observers as to the real gravity of the militants' threat. But few doubt that the considerable might of Egypt's security forces can contain it - even if it not at once. 'The next three months will be very difficult for the government to control the situation,' says one leading businessman. 'But for my money I'd prefer it this way, to have it out in the open. Let's get on with it and get it finished.' Few, however, believe that force alone will eradicate the threat from militant Islamic groups. In fact, the government has employed more weapons against the Islamic militants than just guns, and broadened its attack to include the officially banned Moslem Brotherhood, which for 60 years has represented Egypt's main Islamic political grouping and commands significant support. Parliament has passed a law aimed at making it more difficult for the Brotherhood to dominate the elections to professional syndicates, most of which they control. The government is trying to bring all the country's mosques under state control and supply the texts for the Friday sermon. The government is also planning to improve services in some of the country's worst slums and increase investment in the poorest parts of Upper Egypt, where poverty is believed to offer the Gama'a fertile ground for recruitment among Egypt's thousands of disillusioned, young unemployed. But there are growing calls in Egypt for more radical action. 'The government should have an integrated policy to change the society religiously, economically and socially,' says Mr Said Ashmawy, chief justice of the supreme court for state security, who believes that without radical changes to liberalise its administration, de-Islamicise the state media and reform the country's education system, 'terrorism unfortunately will last for many years'. That would be profoundly bad news for the Egyptian government, which faces political hurdles enough in pushing through tough economic reforms under joint IMF and World Bank programmes. Equally, the recent violence gives the government a political card to play with the IMF when it opens negotiations on a second agreement with the Fund in the next few weeks. When President Hosni Mubarak meets President Clinton in Washington early next month he will almost certainly underline the terrorist threat when the administration brings up the subject of US aid, of which Egypt is the second biggest recipient after Israel.</p>

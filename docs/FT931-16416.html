			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Prosperity, as much as peace, eludes Cambodia: Attempts to manage the economy AS IF they did not have enough on their hands, United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia have begun the thankless task of supervising the country's shattered economy. Among the first economic measures taken by the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) are moves to control the national budget deficit and to reduce government corruption. Cambodia faces accelerating inflation - consumer prices in Phnom Penh rose 284 per cent between January and November 1992, according to Untac figures - and the country has experienced such a rapid decline in the value of the riel, the local currency, that many prices are quoted in dollars. Although some of the inflation has been blamed on Untac's own heavy demand for services in the capital, the principal problem is that the Vietnamese-installed government has been printing money to plug its budget deficit. This view was endorsed on Monday in a report from the UN's economic directorate, which said Untac money has had a largely positive impact on economic growth. Even with public investment and maintenance spending cut back to what the World Bank calls 'negligible levels' (roads, hospitals, power supplies and telecommunications are in a parlous state) more than 45 per cent of government spending budgeted for 1992 was unfunded. Deprived of Soviet aid since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and reduced to the status of one of the four Cambodian factions by the peace accords signed in Paris a year ago, the lame duck administration of Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, has been struggling to pay soldiers, teachers and doctors. Often it pays them late. Government officials, meanwhile, have enriched themselves by selling state property to speculators and pocketing the proceeds. Untac, aware that spending can hardly be cut further, has prodded the administration into increasing its revenues. A 10 per cent tax was imposed on hotel room charges in October, and customs tariffs, which have lagged behind inflation, are being brought into line with the real market value of imports. Corruption is also being targeted by UN officials sent to monitor various ministries, the central bank and local authorities. 'Now that we are inside and looking at the finances very closely we see a lot of corruption cases, involving tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands in some cases,' says one UN official. Some government officials have been fired. Corruption and prostitution in Phnom Penh have given rise to a widely-held theory that destitute, resentful peasants in the countryside will feel so outraged by the goings-on in the capital that they will start to support the puritanical Khmer Rouge, despite its reputation for having killed a million Cambodians when it ruled the country between 1975 and 1978. The reality is more complicated. Most of the inhabitants of Phnom Penh are themselves first-generation city dwellers rather than urban sophisticates. And Cambodian peasants - like peasants throughout the developing world - are more likely to want to join the migration to urban areas than to despise the cities from afar. Anecdotal evidence suggests that economic revival is not confined to Phnom Penh. Throughout the country, people can be seen repairing their houses and Buddhist temples. Meat and rice and imported beer seem plentiful. There is even a video rental shop in the central town of Kompong Thom, in a province hotly contested by the government and the Khmer Rouge. It is true that most investment by foreign companies and Cambodians of ethnic Chinese origin has been in service industries such as hotels, mobile telephones and banking rather than industry, but that is neither surprising nor necessarily undesirable in a country with such a potential for tourism. There are small industrial investments from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere, including a textile factory, a bakery, the renovation of the brewery in Sihanoukville, now producing Cambodian beer, and the rehabilitation of a tobacco processing factory. Returning Cambodians, says one banker in Phnom Penh, 'are voting with their cash in as much as they are renovating properties, buying properties and starting small businesses'. Cambodia's economic prospects have also been boosted by the sympathetic attentions of the World Bank (which is planning a Dollars 75m emergency rehabilitation loan), the International Monetary Fund (donors are likely to arrange payment of Dollars 50m in Cambodian arrears to the IMF to allow renewed IMF programmes in the country) and the Asian Development Bank (which is to disburse a Dollars 68m loan for rehabilitation). But neither World Bank programmes nor higher customs tariffs can provide what Cambodians really need if they are to enjoy sustained economic growth: peace. So far, with the Khmer Rouge refusing to disarm or take part in the election scheduled for May, the UN is not succeeding in its principal task of bringing peace and democracy to Cambodia. Until it does, economic progress and the confidence of investors will be undermined by exceptionally high political risk.</p>

Admiral Martinez Busch said the Navy is always concerned  about renewing "the old ships, those that are already obsolete."  He indicated that the units to be purchased are large ones.    He declined to indicate what type of units, although he  mentioned they will be very useful to cover the long Chilean  geography.    According to EL MERCURIO, it has been learned that the units  are two 8,000-metric ton ships for transporting the Marine  infantry and its equipment.    Martinez Busch added: "We will be able to provide support  for isolated areas with large quantities of materiel. The naval  units are not only war units but support units for all Chileans."    Last week the Chilean Air Force announced the purchase from  Belgium of 20 Mirages to replace the old Hawker Hunter.</p>

Investigations  had been under way since September 1993.    In total, eight persons were found, but the heads of the  drug  ring, the couple Peter (42) and Ritua S. (38), have disappeared  without a trace. The two are probably in India. From there the  drugs had been smuggled to Austria for years, by means of  condoms filled with drugs, which were swallowed. In the course  of the investigations, a cocaine link with Poland was also  discovered.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the </F> Liberal Democratic Party, by unidentified editorial staff  member: "The Hata Administration Is Unstable: Sound  Parliamentary Democracy Should Be Restored"; place and date not  given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet has finally  started.    [Mori] Now, we can win back the political regime which is  within our reach. It has become apparent that the foundation of  the coalition government is unstable.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your impression of the new  cabinet ministers?    [Mori] I feel the true character of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] is being exposed. Also, the vicious aspect of the old  constitution has surfaced. It seems that the politicians on the  verge of retirement are feeling that, at any rate, (Prime  Minister Tsutomu) Hata is not likely to stay in his position  long, and have appeared on the stage requesting that they should  be appointed cabinet ministers as they can not wait any longer.  In that sense, I feel the new cabinet is "the Last Supper"  cabinet.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will the Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] challenge the new cabinet?    [Mori] Haste makes waste. Though people are talking as they  like about (LDP President Yohei) Kono and Mori as being  irresolute and indecisive, you should never corner your opponent  hastily when the opponent is in a fix. If you deliberately  drive your opponent into a corner, it is certain that he will  reveal his true character. We are to attack our opponent by  waiting.    We have not failed at all. Even political reform has been  carried out based on the LDP's proposal. We have performed our  duties cleverly, utilizing the opponent's power. When a  political regime collapses, it always collapses from inside, and  not as a result of a nation being weakened. Election is the  only other method for changing a political regime.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Discord is still being created within the  party.    [Mori] Though the members who left the party try to give  plausible reasons for their behavior, there is a strong feeling  among them that "Representative Masayoshi Takemura and other  members of Sakigake [Harbinger] alone are enjoying their  enviable positions after skillfully leaving the party".  Besides, they are aware of the problem of electoral districts  (that it becomes difficult to obtain party approval under the  single-seat district system). Literally, they are merely  concerned about their selfish interests and tactics. Anyway,  wistful members have all left the party. There is no one left.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A critical situation was created  temporarily when Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister  and foreign minister, was about to leave the party.    [Mori] Though Mr. Watanabe did not say it expressly, he  thinks the problem of reorganization of the political world,  which has been discussed since last year, was originally started  when the Keiseikai [Takeshita faction] was split. Therefore, he  strongly believes that politicians of the same philosophy should  work together to perform their duties entrusted to them by the  people. It is very impolite to try to utilize such a person.  As a human being, you should not do such a thing.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about your alliance with the SDPJ,  which is on the same side with the LDP as a nongovernment party?    [Mori] We should not touch on policy problems. The time is  not yet ripe to obtain a consensus within the party. What  matters seriously is the fact that a political regime has been  established that excludes the leading party and the second  party, which represent the people's will. No doubt, the result  of the election is being disregarded. It is nothing but the  selfish behavior of a particular party. It is literally power  politics. We are asking the SDPJ to cooperate with us to  restore sound parliamentary democracy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you not aiming to form an LDP-SDPJ  alliance?    [Mori] If a policy consensus can be formed in the process of  our discussions, we may establish an organization for discussion  and study the problem. It is desirable for the two parties to  coordinate their opinions in dealing with the problem of tax  reform, as well as the problem of security, including the  problem involving the DPRK (North Korea). However, it is not  our final objective to do so.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not possible for the LDP to be  allied with the SDPJ if their consensus consists of the nine  items which constituted the consensus between the SDPJ and the  coalition parties?    [Mori] Well, you are right. Through participation with the  coalition government, the SDPJ has also become quite close to us  as far as their policies are concerned. The similarity between  the two parties is being revealed.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] People say that "the Hata administration  will face a crisis in June."    [Mori] Dissolution and general election come under the prime  minister's authority, and we are not supposed to handle such  matters. We are now working on dividing the single-seat  districts. The Hata administration may also be of the opinion  that the next election should be carried out under the new  system.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the circumstances do  not allow the Diet to be dissolved until after autumn?    [Mori] My answer is yes, if we see the situation in terms of  common sense. Even if things go smoothly, the budget is to be  approved in the House of Representatives in the middle of June.  It is physically impossible to discuss the bill concerning the  new electoral districts before that date.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the summit (meeting of leaders of  seven major industrial nations) to be held in July affect [the  political situation in Japan]?    [Mori] It is internationally impolite for a prime minister  who is to leave his post soon to attend such a meeting.  Besides, the same situation will be repeated for two  consecutive years. Domestic confusion should not be brought into  the meeting. Depending on how Hata is going to deal with the  situation, the LDP is ready to deal with the situation, taking  the national interests into consideration.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Yet, is it not possible that a vote of  no-confidence in the cabinet will be called for, and an election  under the existing medium-sized district system will take place  with the dissolution of the Diet?    [Mori] Such a situation can take place. The question is  whether (Shinseito Secretary Secretary Ichiro) Ozawa is ready to  admit the fault of his own techniques. Judging from his  character, he is not likely to do so. We all must reap as we  have sown. Last year, while staying in the center of power  comfortably, they voted no-confidence in their boss (ex-Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa) under the flag of justice named  political reform. God will not forgive, them even if they  deceive the general public.</p>

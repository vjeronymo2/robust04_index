			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: United Friendly rises to Pounds 20m United Friendly Group, the life and general insurance underwriter, made profits of Pounds 20.1m in the 1991 year, up from Pounds 18.8m last time and slightly ahead of market forecasts. The company has funds of Pounds 2bn under management. Life premium income rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 165.8m, ordinary branch premiums overtaking industrial branch premiums for the first time. The improvement was largely due to the success of single premium and recurring single premium pensions sales. Total new annual life premiums were Pounds 20.6m, while new single premiums were Pounds 7.6m. There were also an estimated Pounds 12.7m in new recurring single premiums on SERPS-related pensions. Holders of with-profits life policies were allocated a record Pounds 140.8m (Pounds 119.9m) in bonuses. Investment income declined to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 10.1m) as a result of lower interest rates. General branch premiums written totalled Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 60.8m) and the underwriting result for the year was a slightly reduced loss of Pounds 4m (Pounds 5m). A final dividend of 8.1p makes a 12.3p (10.25p) total.</p>

If  the world Muslims gave only one-tenth of the importance that the  Islamic Republic gives to the Bosnian Muslims, and if the  governments of other Islamic countries possessed only  one-hundredth of the resolute will that our Islamic system has  in its attitude toward the conditions of Muslims in that country  -- as well as Muslims in Palestine and other parts of the world  -- then the situation in Bosnia, or for that matter Palestine  and other parts of the Islamic world would have been totally  different today.    It is because of indifference that we have this situation  today. In particular, during this auspicious month of Ramadan,  the great number of preachers who deliver so many Friday prayer  sermons in so many great and splendid mosques throughout the  vast land of Islam must undertake efforts to make the people  aware of their issues and inform them about what the world is  doing to them: that is that world arrogance is taking control of  some Muslim countries while at the same time attempting to bring  the rest of them under its control too. It is one of our duties  to make people fully aware of such matters. [passage omitted]</p>

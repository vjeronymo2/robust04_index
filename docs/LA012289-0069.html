			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: MEXICO: SAN MIGUEL DE ALLENDE OFFERS ELEGANT PRODUCTS, ART,  HANDCRAFTS  </P> <P> People who visit San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, generally have an eye for the  finer things in life. The town is such a gem that it has been declared a  national monument.  </P> <P> San Miguel de Allende also is a second home for artists. The town's elegant  shops are filled with an assortment of handcrafts made locally and in other  areas of Mexico. There are wearables, home accessories, gift items and  collectible art.  </P> <P> By wandering around the town's delightful zocalo (main square), you see the  best shops. They have fixed prices. It isn't advisable to bargain unless you're  negotiating for an antique or several items that amount to a substantial sale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crafts, Souvenirs  </P> <P> Union des Artesanias (Plaza Principal 6) shows the work of six local  craftspeople. The shop has woven metal baskets with hand-painted flowers ($15  U.S.), tin and brass woven wastepaper baskets ($25), large brass peacock  mirrors ($75), small pocketbook mirrors in brass cases ($3), brass trivets  ($5), large white hammocks ($80 and up) and beautiful white wool area rugs ($90  and up).  </P> <P> Artes de Tequis (Plaza Principal 20 to 24) sells some pretty and reasonably  priced gift and souvenir items. Broad leather and cotton belts with wild  geometric patterns for $14, ceramic pots with pointillistic designs of birds  and flowers made in the state of Michoacan ($40 and up) and oversize mugs with  pretty hand-painted doves and flowers for about $9.  </P> <P> In the back room you'll find a selection of hand-painted ceramic lamp bases  from $35 and up.  </P> <P> Casa Canal (Canal 3) is one of San Miguel de Allende's two most famous shops.  In a home-like setting, the shop displays beautiful and expensive  colonial-style home furnishings, decorative craft items and fashions.  </P> <P> You might begin with the clothes boutique featuring the creations of Josefa  (prices start at $250). It has long dresses, caftans and ensembles bedecked  with ribbons, plus tastefully appliqued and beautifully hued adaptations of  traditional Indian clothing. The boutique also has clothes by Opus 1, with  fringed caftans ($200 and up) and other exotic items.  </P> <P> The furniture galleries display hand-carved wooden sets for bedrooms and dining  rooms, plus assorted chests, bed headboards, armoires and other cabinets.

A silver thick-link bracelet that looks heavy but is light enough to wear  with comfort is $70. Good buys.  </P> <P> Casa Maxwell (Canal 14 and Umaran 3) is a sprawling, multilevel mansion filled  with antique furnishings and all sorts of contemporary decorative crafts and  designer wearables.  </P> <P> Take time in browsing through this shop, which has hand-carved pine wood  chandeliers with 12 lights ($700), sets of bedroom furniture that include  headboards, wooden chests and dressers ($1,000 and up), carved hardwood  dolphins ($35 and up), colorful woolen area rugs and blankets ($175 and up),  hand-blown glasses with red, blue or brown tints ($2 a glass), and matching  pitchers ($10) and earthenware table settings from Guadalajara, Guanajuato and  Morelia ($250 and up per 32-piece set).  </P> <P> The shop also carries fine silver jewelry and designer clothes, including  Judith Roberts' denim coats with bright satin appliques of desert scenes ($225)  and Irene Pulos' lovely takeoffs of traditional dresses with ribbons, applique  and beading ($180 and up).  </P> <P> Plateria Cerroblanco (Canal 17) is a family-owned jewelry shop that designs and  manufactures its own pieces in a modern style.

Best hats are Panama ones from the town  of Becal in the state of Campeche.  </P> <P> Some of these are so finely woven that you almost can't see the pattern of the  weave (from $60). They will last forever. The coarser variety (from $10) have  the same basic shape but don't wear nearly as well.  </P> <P> The shop offers a variety of bands for the hats, and also sells those big gaudy  charro or mariachi hats made of black or red felt and embroidered with silver  or gold thread ($40 and up).  </P> <P> Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of  writing.  </P></p>

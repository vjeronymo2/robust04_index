			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident General Accident should know better than to deliver results in line with market expectations. Sun Alliance fell 5 per cent in September following decent interim results. Respectable third-quarter results from GA - a Pounds 10m flood loss in Canada aside - prompted similar treatment. Having out-performed the sector by 10 per cent over the past six months, and run up to a 30 per cent premium to net assets, GA was heading for a fall. Such volatility is the mark of a sector which has all the good news in the price.</p>

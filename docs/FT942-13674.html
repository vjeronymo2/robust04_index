			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Nervousness subsided in the recently volatile equity derivatives and the June FT-SE contract traded in a narrow range, writes Christine Buckley. But one broker's head of derivatives warned that the confident performance may just be a bear market bounce. June traded at a premium to cash for most of the session, marking an intraday high of 3,154 although its close at 3,140 trailed the fair-value premium by about a couple of points. Volume was subdued at 11,352 contracts while options activity was dull at 29,058 lots.</p>

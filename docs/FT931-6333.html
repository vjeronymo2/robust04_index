			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Observer: Golden debate Bulls of the gold price may be an endangered species, but they were out in force at yesterday's opening of South Africa's Leeudoorn gold mine. Anton Rupert, doyen of South African industrialists, led the celebrations. His belief in the yellow metal is no surprise given that his Rembrandt tobacco business has big stakes in Gold Fields. Still, his view that the world has too little gold is at least novel. 'It is so scarce,' he says, 'that all the gold mined since Noah could be fitted into one luxury yacht such as that of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.' No doubt Rupert is talking from first-hand experience.</p>

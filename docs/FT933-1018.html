			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: An attractive option - Offshore Bond Funds BOND INVESTORS who are non-taxpayers are likely to be attracted to offshore bond funds than onshore unit trusts as they pay income gross. Some resident UK citizens who are liable for tax may also choose to invest offshore because the tax payment can be delayed. The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds recognised by the Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance record. SIB recognition should comfort investors, as should well-known industry names in the table. Figures have been taken from Hardwick Stafford Wright and show the top 10 performing SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector. They are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single price but add an initial charge. Were all funds to be quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. The effect of quoting on an offer to offer basis is that the performance figures are inflated and the returns which would actually have been achieved by an investor will have been lower. Charges on the funds are similar to onshore unit trusts: in the range of 5-6 per cent, although they can vary widely (see Phil Coggan's Serious Money piece on Schwab's new no-load offshore fund service on Page II). The John Govett fund, for example, carries a 5 per cent initial charge and a 1 per cent annual management fee while TSB's charges are 3 per cent initial and 0.75 per cent annual. Barclays Unicorn Sterling bond fund also has relatively low charges of 3.5 per cent initial and 0.85 per cent annual. The Henderson fund, an umbrella fund, carries a 4.5 per cent initial charge and 0.6 per cent annual fee; Sun Life's fund has a 6 per cent initial charge and a 0.6 per cent annual management fee. Investors seeking income should not base their choice entirely on the size of the yield, since a bond fund can achieve a high yield at the expense of declining capital - a problem highlighted by TSB. 'We used to pay a high distribution and became concerned that we would have to pay out capital, so we have reduced the level of income,' said TSB. John Govett's Simon Osborne says that his fund's yield is achieved by investments in foreign currency bonds. A minimum of 75 per cent of the fund must be invested in UK sterling bonds but 10 per cent is in Mexican short-term paper, currently yielding 13.5 per cent. A proportion is also invested in 10-year Italian government bonds which also have a high yield. Barclays Unicorn's sterling bond fund, managed by BZW, the securities arm of Barclays, invests only in gilts (to a maximum of 35 per cent) and Eurosterling bonds. Anita Higgins, fund manager, says that the good yield has been achieved by investing in long-dated high-yielding corporate bonds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 BEST PERFORMING OFFSHORE BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                    Size (Pounds m)    Yield (%)        Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Sterling                255.0           8.5         71.8 TSB Off Inv Gilt &amp; FI              1.5           7.1         70.8 Guinness Fl Acc Pounds Hi          3.0           7.2         69.4 Hill Samuel Fix Int Pounds        34.1           7.2         69.3 Govett GSI UK Hi Inc              13.3           8.4         67.5 CMI (Lux) UK Bond                 15.6           6.9         67.4 Sun Life Secure Hi Inc             8.8           7.2         67.1 Lloyds Trust Gilt                491.2           7.2         66.9 Henderson Horizon Fix             10.0           7.1         64.8 TSB Gilt Fund Qly Share          214.8           7.3         64.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hardwick Stafford Wright * Offer-to-offer with net income reinvested over three years to September 1.

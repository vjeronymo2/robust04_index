			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Portuguese tax on pulp sales unlawful  -European Court A Portuguese tax on sales of domestic and imported chemical pulp, used to help finance a national institute for forestry products, has been ruled unlawful by the European Court of Justice. In the context of a preliminary reference on a point of law from a Lisbon administrative court, the ECJ said the tax was contrary to the Rome Treaty provisions relating to customs duties and internal taxes. The Court said the relevant Rome Treaty provisions were not cumulative. Thus one charge could not be found to be both a customs duty (or a measure of equivalent effect) and an internal tax for Rome Treaty purposes. In general, the customs duties provisions were relevant to distinctly applicable measures - where, for example, taxes were only imposed on imported products - whereas the internal taxation provisions were relevant to national measures affecting both domestic and imported products. However, a tax that was distinctly applicable could fall within the customs duties provisions of the Rome Treaty when the revenue from that tax benefited exclusively domestic products which compensated in full the tax paid for the national products. Where the revenue from the tax only partially compensated the national products, it would be dealt with under the Rome Treaty provisions on internal taxation. The Court also found that such a tax could be held to constitute an unlawful state aid, but only after the correct procedures had been undertaken by the commission under Rome Treaty provisions. The tax did not, however, fall within the scope of the provisions of the EC treaty relating to the free movement of goods. C-266/91: Celulose Beira Industrial (Celbi) SA v Fazenda Publica ECJ 6CH, August 2 1993 Member states' obligations under agreements with third countries The European Court has ruled that national judges should apply Community law on equal treatment between men and women by disapplying any contrary national provisions, except insofar as the application of contrary national provisions was necessary to fulfil obligations arising from an agreement with a third country that predated the Rome Treaty. The case concerned the employment of women for night work in a charcuterie factory. French law prohibits the employment of women for night work. The French law was adopted in pursuance of an International Labour Organisation convention. The director of the factory was prosecuted for breach of the law and the case was referred to the ECJ. The Court ruled the relevant provisions of the EC equal treatment directive obliged the national judge to apply the rules fully by disapplying any contrary national measure. But rights and obligations arising from agreements between member states and third countries concluded before the Rome Treaty came into force were not affected by the treaty. However, to the extent that the agreements are not compatible with the treaty, the member states concerned are obliged to take appropriate steps to eliminate the relevant incompatibilities. To determine whether a Community principle could be held in check by an earlier international agreement it was necessary first to determine whether the member state still had to fulfil its obligations under the agreement to the third countries concerned. If the French prohibition on night working had been repealed by later agreements, the Rome Treaty provisions on the non-effect of the treaty on agreements between member states and third countries would not apply. However, it was for a national judge to determine that question. C-158/91: Ministere Public et Direction du Travail et de l'Emploi v Levy, ECJ FC, August 2 1993 PVC case The August 3 report of the advocate general's opinion in this appeal may have falsely given the impression that the Court of First Instance's decision had been overturned. The opinion is only indicative and is not binding on the Court which will deliver its judgment later in the year.</p>

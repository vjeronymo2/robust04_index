			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> TOXINS FORCE SHELLFISH BAN  </P> <P> The worst toxic contamination since 1980 has forced a quarantine of  non-commercial harvesting of shellfish on the coastline of Del Norte, Humboldt  and Mendocino counties. State Health Director Kenneth Kizer said mussel samples  from the area had potentially life-threatening levels of the toxin that causes  paralytic shellfish poisoning. He said toxin levels were the highest since  paralytic shellfish poisoning was blamed for two deaths in 1980. The quarantine  applies to clams, razor clams, cockles, scallops and other bivalve mollusks.  Paralytic shellfish poisoning affects the nervous system after consumption of  mussels and other shellfish that have fed on certain highly toxic marine  organisms. Commercial harvesting is unaffected by the quarantine since there is  a regulatory program to prevent shellfish with high levels of PSP toxin from  reaching the market, Kizer said.  </P></p>

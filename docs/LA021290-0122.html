			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN PREDICTS ACQUITTAL  </P> <P> Rep. E. Harold Ford, the only black congressman in Tennessee history, predicted  acquittal today as he went on trial on charges he took $1.5 million in  fraudulent bank loans in return for backing a candidate for governor.  </P> <P> Ford, a flamboyant eight-term Democrat who controls a political machine with  the power to deliver the votes of Tennessee's most populous city, strode  smiling confidently past reporters into the federal courthouse for the start of  jury selection.  </P> <P> The 1987 indictment alleges that Ford took $1.5 million disguised as loans from  banks controlled by brothers Jake and C. H. Butcher Jr. in 18 payments between  1976 and 1983. In return, Ford delivered the votes of his congressional  district to Jake Butcher in the banker's unsuccessful race for governor in  1978, the indictment says.  </P> <P> Ford maintains the loans were for his legitimate business interests, including  his family's funeral home.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally leaves share prices firmer GLIMMERS of returning confidence brightened the UK stock market yesterday when share prices rallied to close higher in spite of a background of continuing gloom on both the economic and corporate fronts. Trading volume remained unexciting but increased towards the close on selective buying from both UK and US investment sources. The London market remained tense as it waited to hear if tomorrow's meeting of the Bundesbank council will take action to tighten credit policies in Germany, a move which would inevitably apply upward pressures on UK base rates. Concern over the recession in the UK was fuelled yesterday by news of a 1 per cent fall in May's industrial production figures - substantially greater than expected. The stock market also had to face a heavy batch of profits downgrades on leading UK companies by brokerage analysts. Early deals saw the FT-SE Index fall by 16 points, led downwards by a setback in the September futures contract on the index. The market steadied at 2,461, however, lending substance to the view of some analysts that the 2,500 area is a resistance base. Shares then traded steadily until early afternoon, helped by a steadier performance from the stock index futures contract. A stronger rally developed in the late afternoon and the Footsie regained its losses and moved into positive territory. US buyers appeared for British Petroleum, Cadbury-Schweppes, Reuters and Cable and Wireless, although Wall Street made a slow start to its session, with the Dow Average easing one point in UK hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,484.0, with a gain of 5.7 on the session. Traders eschewed enthusiasm, pointing out that the day's Seaq total of 374.1m shares was still unimpressive. Monday's volume of 349.4m represented retail, or customer, business worth only Pounds 883.8m. Traders of a superstitious nature remembered that tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the stock market peak ahead of the crash suffered in October 1987; the Footsie reached 2,443.4 on July 16 of that year, so only the nimble-footed would seem to have made money out of UK equities over the past five years. The problems of the new issue sector continued to overhang equities. Share issues in MFI Furniture and Anglian Group, neither a great success at the underwriting stage, enter the market this week. A steadier performance by the US dollar helped a large number of London's overseas earning stocks, many of which earn profits in the US currency. The Footsie was boosted by a sharp upturn in British Petroleum, which closed substantially higher on the day after US buyers returned. Domestic stocks, however, continued to suffer from downgrading operations by brokerage firms, which turned their attentions to the retail sector, where several well-known names attracted adverse comments. But the weight of negative views was lightened by more favourable assessments of the property sector, which has suffered a prolonged setback.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMAND FOR CHIPS LEAPS IN FEBRUARY  </P> <P> The Semiconductor Industry Assn., an industry group, said Wednesday that its  closely watched index of new orders for computer chips rose sharply last month.  </P> <P> The group said the February book-to-bill ratio, which measures the rate of new  orders against shipments to fulfill old orders, rose to 1.07 from 1.00 in  January.  </P> <P> Calling the February figure "fantastic," Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Michael  Gumport said the ratio could reach as high as 1.20 in the coming year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Appears Healthy'  </P> <P> Goldman Sachs computer chip analyst Rajiv Chaudri said the February figure  indicates that the industry's buildup in inventories may be over.  </P> <P> "(The February ratio) is a very solid number, a very high quality number. It  says the inventory correction the industry was experiencing appears to be over  now and end-demand for chips appears to be healthy," Chaudri said.  </P> <P> Average monthly orders, for the three-month period ending in February totaled  $1.24 billion, 10.6% above the figure for January, the association said.  </P> <P> The average billings for the three-month period were just under $1.17 billion  to produce a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07.  </P></p>

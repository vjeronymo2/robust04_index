			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Bad earnings news dampens demand Wall Street US stock markets struggled to hold on to recent gains yesterday following more bad earnings reports and further declines in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.76 at 3,207.64, having spent the day hovering a few points either side of Thursday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the end of trading, down 0.8 at 414.10, while the Amex composite slipped 0.27 to 374.24 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.21 to 597.33. Turnover on the NYSE was 197m shares. Rises marginally outpaced declines by 903 to 818. Although analysts have been impressed by the market's recent resilience in the face of a likely Democratic victory in the presidential election, troubling corporate news continues to act as a brake on prices. Westinghouse, United Technologies and Caterpillar have all reported disappointing third-quarter earnings this week. Heavy losses in these individual stocks, which make up a large part of the Dow, have prevented it from pulling away from the 3,200 mark, which could prove to be the middle of a new short-term trading range for stocks. Equities were not helped by fresh declines in bond prices, which pushed interest rates higher. Motor stocks continued to advance with Ford rising another Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 in turnover of 1.5m shares on an upgrade from broking house Salomon Brothers, which believes that there are several positive 'industry dynamics' which will benefit US auto manufacturers, especially Ford, in the short-term. General Motors, which has been in demand lately on reports that Mr Robert Stempel, the group's chairman, will soon be ousted, firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 33 1/2 in turnover of 2.5m shares. The stock was also helped by news that its car sales rose 9.6 per cent in mid-October. Chrysler proved the disappointment of the sector, easing Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 after Prudential Securities downgraded the stock, not for fundamental reasons but because recent buying may have pushed the share price close to its term peak. Philip Morris slumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 74 1/2 in turnover of 5.5m shares after Ms Diana Temple, a Salomon analyst, cut her recommendation on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' because of concerns about the group's share of the US cigarette market. The stock has been sold heavily in recent days on worries about stalling overseas demand. Caterpillar fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 after several broking houses cut their investment ratings following bad third-quarter earnings. On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems bounced back Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 32 in turnover of 6.6m shares. The move represented a strong recovery from late selling on Thursday, which was prompted by the release of disappointing fiscal first-quarter earnings. Canada WEAKER bank stocks led Toronto lower in active dealings. The TSE-300 index lost 12.04 points, or 0.37 per cent, to end at 3,246.73. The index was up about 39 points, or 1.2 per cent, on the week. Volume was 30.764m shares worth CDollars 290.6m against 34.34m shares worth CDollars 277.5m. Declining issues led advances 261 to 247.</p>

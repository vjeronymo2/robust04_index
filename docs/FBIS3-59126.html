Returning from Taiwan to Europe as head of a party  delegation, Csepe is paying a three-day visit to Germany at the  invitation of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group.    "The goal of my visit is to hold political and economic  talks  rather than canvass electoral support," Csepe said.    The German side offered assistance in intensifying Hungary's  relationship with NATO within the framework of the Partnership  for Peace scheme, he said.    "We disagree with the view that we were left alone after the  Brussels decision of NATO. Although full membership in NATO is  still a goal, it lacks reality today. We accept the opportunity  offered by the Partnership for Peace scheme," Csepe said.    The German side stated it would promote Hungary's  integration  into the European Union, he said.    Regarding his visit to Taiwan, Csepe said that Hungary  should  open a trade representation there. "The Czech Republic has  already taken that step," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Spirin and Vyacheslav </F> Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing June 6 TASS -- China intends to "seriously"  study the Russian proposal on holding an international  conference on the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula, but  believes it is better to solve it through talks between  Pyongyang, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the USA and  South Korea, according to a spokesman of the Chinese Foreign  Ministry.    "We have taken into consideration the Russian-proposed  idea",  he told TASS on Monday, but added that, according to the Chinese  Government, "the most efficient and practical variant of solving  the problem is to hold bilateral consultations in three  directions: North Korea - the IAEA, North Korea - the United  States, and Pyongyang - Seoul".    Beijing is conducting an active dialogue with the North  Korean leadership on its nuclear programme, according to sources  close to diplomatic circles. It strives to preserve "special  relations" between the two countries and at the same time to  exert influence on its partner in order to settle the conflict  without any sanctions.    It is noteworthy that last Saturday the North Korean  ambassador in China has resolutely rejected the Russian idea  about the international conference. The nuclear free status of  the peninsula should be discussed only in a close circle -  between North Korea and the United States.    However, the Hong Kong-based "TA KUNG PAO" newspaper is sure  that China can join economic sanctions against Pyongyang. It  believes Beijing can cease shipments of food and oil.</p>

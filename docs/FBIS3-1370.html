Addressing the ceremony marking  the close of the course for the first marines in the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola's [MPLA] navy yesterday,  Joao de Matos said that, quote, we must continue training forces  like these, so that we can be more effective in combat, unquote.    The MPLA war chieftain once again resorted to his usual  excuses, saying the victim is the aggressor, and alleging that  the FAPLA forces will continue to defend themselves in the face  of aggression by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola,  when in fact he is the one who is ordering the FAPLA forces to  go on an offensive against Cuanza Norte, Cuanza Sul, Lunda  Norte, Lunda Sul, Zaire, Huila, Moxico, and Bengo Provinces,  among others. The MPLA's increasingly bellicose behavior is  closely related to the inflexibility of the Faustino Muteka-led  government team to the Lusaka peace talks, thereby confirming  reports that the MPLA is only wasting time in the Zambian  capital while waiting for the arrival of mercenaries and  military equipment imported from foreign countries.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 14,000 CIGARETTES GO UP IN SMOKE  </P> <P> About 14,000 cigarettes went up in huge puffs of smoke outside a suburban  Oklahoma City drugstore, and the owner said he will never sell tobacco again.  </P> <P> Pharmacist Kenneth Henderson dumped about 700 packs of cigarettes, worth about  $1,000, into a trash can Wednesday and tossed in a lighted match to burn them.  </P> <P> Henderson said he decided to quit selling cigarettes as his part of a  "NonDependence Day" observance by the American Lung Assn.  </P> <P> "It just doesn't make sense for us to sell prescription items in the back to  make people well, and sell cigarettes at another location to make them sick,"  Henderson said.  </P></p>

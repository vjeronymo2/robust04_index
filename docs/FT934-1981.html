			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Enthusiasm from across the Commons The UK-Irish declaration on the future of Northern Ireland was given a broad welcome by MPs from all three main parties in the Commons yesterday. Only a handful of MPs from mainland constituencies expressed reservations about the declaration, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given strong support by key backbenchers on both sides. Conservative MPs cheered as Mr Major challenged Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, to accept the challenge to condemn violence and join the political process. Reaction from the Conservative back benches was largely positive, although a handful of MPs suggested that the agreement represented a weakening of Britain's commitment to Northern Ireland. Others called for assurances that the fight against terrorism would continue, and urged the government to insist on a surrender of weapons and explosives by the IRA before entering into talks with Sinn Fein. In Belfast last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, signalled on a television discussion programme that the IRA might be required to surrender its arsenal of weapons before being accepted into the political process. Mr Andrew Hunter, the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee, said the declaration was 'a positive step forward'. But there were cheers as he urged the prime minister to 'ensure that there is no let-up in the hunt for those who perpetrate violence'. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, a senior Conservative backbencher, said the declaration was supported by the UK-Irish Inter Parliamentary Body, of which he is joint chairman. Mr Tom King, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said the declaration contained nothing to seriously threaten the interests of any part of the Northern Ireland community. Few MPs expressed concern about the permanence of the links between Northern Ireland and the UK. However, Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, said there was 'a danger that people will say that the prime minister of the UK is careless with regard to the integrity of the UK'. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, welcomed the prime minister's commitment to peace, but urged him to go to Northern Ireland to campaign for the union. The declaration was welcomed 'with enthusiasm' by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and by Mr Alan Beith for the Liberal Democrats. Most Labour backbenchers also welcomed the declaration. Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North - in whose constituency two boys were killed by an IRA bomb this year - said the terrorists would never be forgiven if they failed to respond. 'It is time for all the paramilitaries to lay down their arms,' he said. The declaration was criticised by some Labour leftwingers. Mr Tony Benn, a former cabinet minister, said public opinion in Britain would support talks with Sinn Fein in advance of a cessation of violence.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Life policies oversold THE DISPUTE within the Unit Trust Association, which has resulted in the departure of five of its leading life assurance company members, has been a clear sign of growing tension within the retail investment services industry. The enormous commercial success and political lobbying power of the life industry is increasingly resented by other competitors. The life companies tend to respond by suggesting this amounts to sour grapes on the part of rivals who have failed to market their products so effectively. But they ought to worry about whether their success has been at the expense of the financial well-being of too many of their clients. A survey conducted for the Securities and Investments Board, the investment watchdog body, has shown that typically about 30 per cent of long-term plans lapse within two years. This involves heavy losses for those involved, and is clear evidence of overselling. Direct sales forces are worse in this respect than independent advisers. In the category of unit-linked pension plans marketed through direct sales forces the two-year lapse rate is an alarming 45 per cent. But the sales campaigns continue at a high pitch. This month, about 700 of the salesmen of MI Group are moving over to the already existing but almost unknown Citibank Life. The life industry has become sales-led to a disturbing degree. No longer do companies look for sales forces, but sales forces look for companies. Low quality It is the industry's oldest cliche that life assurance is sold and not bought. But the importance of the name and quality of the product has never been as low as now, and the power of a well-organised sales force never as high. Even some of the traditional offices ought to be very worried. Until now, the life companies have maintained a strong and united lobby in order to secure the regulatory concessions that could underpin their growth. For example, when the Financial Services Act was being developed in the mid-1980s, polarisation was a compromise which enabled life companies to escape the consequences of poor disclosure to clients and conflicts of interest among their agents. Salesmen could only sell the products of a single company, and independent intermediaries had to offer unbiased advice right across the market place. In practice, however, this has led to shrinkage of the independent sector, which has proved especially damaging to unit trust companies: they cannot in most cases afford to develop other distribution methods, such as sales forces or direct mail. There are, in addition, potentially serious effects on many of the mutually-owned life offices which have also been slow to diversify their distribution. Tougher stand The UTA has decided to make a much tougher stand against polarisation and against poor life company standards of disclosure of commissions and other costs than it did in the mid-1980s. The recent squeeze on unit trust sales has concentrated minds. There is indeed growing concern about not only the costs but also the suitability of a significant proportion of sales of life contracts. All the same, the general tone of the UTA's submission to SIB before Christmas may have been unwisely strident. The accusations were indiscriminate and inflammatory; in contrast, it may be in the UTA's interests to make common cause with the more moderate elements in the life industry rather than to put the life offices in a position that they are forced to defend their existing selling methods without qualification. Now the UTA, after internal protests, is being forced to put out a bowdlerised version. But whatever the detailed compromises the UTA must stick vigorously to its campaign to release unit trusts from the shackles of polarisation. If the life companies should protest that this would be unfair, they could be told that, by improving their standards of disclosure to investors, they could be freed too. But so long as the overselling of life products continues they should not expect much sympathy from the regulators.</p>

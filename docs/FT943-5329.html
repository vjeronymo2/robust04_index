			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Management: Tired of the sweet smell of success Why is it, asked the great and the good of the green movement in a letter to the FT last week, that the media spends more time attacking Body Shop than it does all those thousands of companies that could not care less about the environment? The question makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Over the past two weeks I have been reading the knocking copy about the company that brought us peppermint foot lotion. I have to admit it: I long for holier-than-thou Anita Roddick and her touchy husband Gordon to be taken down a peg or two. I can neither fully justify my aversion, nor can I lay it to rest. Many of the things Body Shop does - giving employees time off to do voluntary work, offering civilised childcare, buying products from the third world - are admirable. What gets up my nose is not the sickly smell of the perfumes but the sanctimoniousness of the company's style. Doubtless, I am suffering from the British disease of hating success, yet there is more to it than that. The Body Shop has put itself on a pedestal so high (it is even thinking of establishing a business school, of all self-regarding things) that it is only natural to want to topple it. In the last 10 years many other companies have taken big leaps environmentally, but their bosses do not tell us about how well they've done as they stride though the jungle waving American Express cards. Neither would they have the brass neck to claim simultaneously that their company never does anything as filthy as advertise. As for the specific allegations made during the last few weeks, I would not be surprised to discover that they do not amount to much. Body Shop may be a little stingy in the information it provides about its do-gooding, but it is still way ahead of the pack. The Roddicks are suffering as a result of their own PR. Anyone who shouts so loud about being perfect is bound to be attacked when the slightest thing goes wrong. And when Body Shop comes in for a bit of stick, it would be better advised to be more relaxed in its response. By publishing 32-page rebuttals of allegations before the latter have even been made, and decrying the 'zealots of cynicism' that dare to be critical, the company is asking for it. And when it gets it, can we really be blamed for laughing up our sleeves? Last week was the traditional time for telling colleagues how well they look after their holidays, and for sifting though overflowing in-trays. In mine there seemed to be fewer than usual of the glossy invitations to business conferences. The big organisers gloomily explain that they went into recession a year after everyone else, and it will be at least another year before they start emerging from it. I wonder if they are being optimistic. It has always been a mystery why companies are prepared to spend Pounds 1,000 or so for the privilege of having their managers out of the office for two days. It was all very well in the times when every company had several extra layers of managers that it did not need. But now that everyone is overstretched and under pressure to produce concrete results it is particularly hard to justify two days sitting at a green baize table in the ballroom of a big hotel listening to things about your industry you should have known already. Most conferences are an inefficient way of disseminating information - the chances of picking up any secrets are nil with the competition sitting listening, too. Regular attendees say that the value is in the networking - but in that case conferences for the mid-1990s should be organised differently, with the formal sessions cut out, and the whole thing abbreviated to a few hours of hobnobbing time. Whether anyone would pay Pounds 1,000 for that is another matter. The same disillusionment does not seem to extend to training conferences and seminars, where there is no limit to the sorts of things people feel the need to learn. The London Personal Development Centre is due to open later this month offering 'inspiration, holistic healing and down-to-earth practical skills for individuals and businesses alike'. There is a course on Astral Sex and Zen Tea Bags, and another on how to make a drum and use it to get in touch with yourself and your tribe or company. A third, The Power of Dynamic Womanhood, shows women how to win, and invites men along at half price. The peppermint foot lotion brigade may enjoy some of those seminars; the one that interests me is called 'I Love My Job]' It includes a 'laughter clinic' and teaches you how to treat work as akin to play. Satisfied customers from this seminar apparently include British Telecom and the BBC - two organisations where morale is so low as to be off the map. Next time your telephone engineer starts humming cheerfully under his breath, or you meet someone from the BBC who is not moaning, you'll know why.</p>

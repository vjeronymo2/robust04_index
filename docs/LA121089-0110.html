			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUNG ADULT FICTION;  </P> <P> EVERY CHILD HAS A STORY  </P> <P> Our young people struggle to "Just Say No" in a country where too many  disenfranchised kids have little to say "yes" to. In their culturally correct  clothing labels, they anguish over belonging, while they absorb, at strenuous  decibels, the latest heavy-metal lyrics angrily demanding autonomy:  </P> <P> "... no need to hear things  </P> <P> that they say,  </P> <P> life is for my own, to live my  </P> <P> own way.  </P> <P> See them try to bring the hammer  </P> <P> down,  </P> <P> no damn chains can hold me to the  </P> <P> ground."  </P> <P> It is the ubiquitous job of children to become themselves, to form their  destinies as distinct from those of their parents, to find their places in the  culture at large. But on other continents, and at other times, these tasks have  been undertaken against social conditions distinctly different from our own.  </P> <P> In We Were Not Like Other People (Harper &amp; Row: $13.95), well-known Soviet  author and film director Ephraim Sevela tells the story of a young Jewish boy,  separated from his family by the German Invasion at the outbreak of World War  II. His mother is a champion sprinter, and from her he learns some tough  lessons: "Mother could not bear weak, whiny children who could not stand up for  themselves, especially if they were boys. Mama despised me. Only a conqueror  could hope to attain her love." She grabs his ear "with iron fingers," forcing  him to fight the bigger neighborhood boys. Excellent preparation for survival,  it turns out, when his father, a Red Army commander, is taken away in the  night, declared an "enemy of the People" during a Stalinist purge.  </P> <P> At 12, the boy gets separated from his mother, and for six years, from Siberia  to the snow-capped Urals to the Volga and Germany, our young hero must live  through the war unprotected. He is rescued by a woman with five daughters, who  asks what a Jew is. "Ordinary people," he explains, and the woman declares,  "Then there is nothing to discuss," and puts him in bed with the whole family.  In Orel, he meets up with his detested schoolteacher, the Walrus, who calls him  "Neanderthal" but nonetheless saves his life.  </P> <P> As the war progresses, he is adopted by an influential Colonel and goes into  battle with this soldier's regiment, only to watch the beloved man die the day  peace is declared. He writes letters home to the wife and children of another  comrade, letters so tender and full of love that the tough private gratefully  concludes: "It'll make the old woman bawl." He learns to "wait very hard," to  curse like an adult, and to mete out compassion to a starving German family  whose home he has invaded.  </P> <P> Filled with poignant vignettes and glorious characters, this Russian boy  experiences more than many will in a lifetime. This wonderful book is about  growing up in extraordinary circumstances, and is full of aches, full of echoes  . . .  </P> <P> Shabanu, Daughter of the Wind (Alfred A. Knopf: $13.95) by Suzanne Fisher  Staples -- a former UPI correspondent in Asia, and foreign-desk reporter for  the Washington Post -- tells the story of a nomad girl in present-day  Pakistan's Cholistan Desert.  </P> <P> This is the year Shabanu's beautiful sister Phulan, age 13, is betrothed; the  arranged marriage will take place after Ramandan, or the month of Islamic  fasting. Shabanu, 11, still just a girl who tends with great love to the  animals, has a while to consider her own forthcoming betrothal. When her  favorite camel Gulaband is sold to pay for Phulan's wedding and dowry, Shabanu  experiences her first loss. Many more follow.  </P> <P> Sometimes sheer detail -- of the fierce desert sun, the challenging land, the  artifacts and traditions of this nomadic people -- overwhelms the narrative.  Yet Fisher Staples succeeds in establishing the reality of this world and the  strict customs and rules that govern it.  </P> <P> But the merciless man-made laws are still more forgiving than the raw forces of  nature: In one tense scene a monstrous desert sandstorm comes upon the family  too quickly for them to rescue their ailing grandfather. He miraculously  survives, but only long enough only to request a site for his burial ground.  Another loss for Shabanu.  </P> <P> But the heart of the novel, taking place almost two-thirds through the book, is  about Shabanu's future. Just as Phulan's wedding is about to take place, the  landlord tries to rape her. Shabanu struggles to prevent the violation of her  sister, and the crazed, infuriated landlord kills Phulan's husband-to-be, and  vows to kill his brother Murad, Shabanu's future husband. To stop the madman,  Shabanu must marry the landlord's brother, wealthy Rahimabhib, who already has  three wives. Will she tolerate the detestable solution and bring peace to the  family, or will she join her remarkably independent aunt and cousin --  outsiders who live in freedom, without men?  </P> <P> Shabanu's destiny may be incomprehensible to American readers, but we all are  enriched from meeting this undaunted, indomitable nomad girl.  </P> <P> In London, 9-year-old Phillip Holbein faces problems that are more familiar to  American youth; they include the torments of torn loyalties and broken homes.  Nina Bawden's The Robbers (Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard: $12.95) deals with a  friendship between two boys: one born to privilege, the other to poverty.  </P> <P> Phillip is summoned to London from his country castle, where he lives with his  beloved grandmother, to visit his newly married father, a well-known television  news announcer; Phillip adamantly falls in with his new city friend, Darcy  Jones, whose father is crippled and whose stepmother, Addie, is beautiful and  black.  </P> <P> When Darcy's wage-earning brother is thrown in jail, Phillip tries to help  Darcy find solutions to his family's fragile economic situation, which is made  worse by Addie's pregnancy.  </P> <P> To earn money, Phillip goes caroling with Darcy, who possesses a glorious  singing voice. But when Darcy's singing is cruelly insulted by penurious rich  people, and they collect only meager funds, Phillip becomes willing to strike  out against a society that unjustly punishes this struggling, beloved family.  He agrees to commit robbery.  </P> <P> This comfortable tale of an uncomfortable world, originally published in  England in 1979, has Dickensian overtones and the sadness inherent growing up  in a society that is not really all right. Bawden tells it with a sure voice  and appealing characters. She sides with the children, as we all must do.  </P></p>

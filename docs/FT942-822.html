			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Local polls blow for Berlusconi Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi suffered his first electoral setback when opposition candidates won several regional polls, results showed yesterday. His opponents won weekend run-off votes for mayors, provincial presidents and a regional council. The results of elections in 137 smaller cities were issued as the Senate president warned that new national elections could become necessary if the opposition used its slight majority in the upper house to block legislation. However, political analysts said the significance of the polls was muted because of the low turnout, with only about half of the 6m eligible voters casting ballots.</p>

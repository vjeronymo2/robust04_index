			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / What would Mrs Goggins say?: Lucy Kellaway is put through the Postman Pat test - Lunch with the FT I am half-way through lunch with Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, and we are discussing Postman Pat. That very morning the newspapers had been full of Davies. He had been quoted making accommodating noises about the Labour party, and had written an article chastising Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, for his naive views on dividends. But now he is sitting in Andrew Edmunds, a rustic restaurant in Soho, central London, challenging me to name six inhabitants of Greendale, a fictional village from a children's storybook . . . 'Postman Pat, Mrs Goggins, Ted Glen, Jess, Peter Fogg . . .' I am starting to struggle, and he helps me out: 'Reverend . . .' he prompts. 'Timms,' I supply the correct answer with considerable relief. I have just failed to name the Famous Five, failed to name any Swallows or Amazons and failed to supply the name of Jennings' best friend. Davies is looking surprised, disapproving even. We have reached Greendale by a circuitous route. I have told him how thankful I am to be meeting him on my terms rather than on his. I was referring to his famous Christmas parties to which he invites a large group of like-minded, over-achieving fortysomethings for a highly-competitive quiz. I had heard tales of senior Treasury officials being humiliated by being unable to name the ERM bands. 'It's amazing what some people don't know,' he says coolly. He proceeds to tell me about an even more hair-raising event that he is in the process of arranging for his seven and nine-year-old sons. The children will answer questions about children's books (doubtless doing better than I did), sing songs in foreign languages and undergo tests of physical strength. Howard Davies evidently excels at this sort of thing. During lunch he shows himself to be an expert not merely on the relative pay levels of British bosses, but on Zimbabwean wine (he is shortly off for what he calls a 'love-in' with Robert Mugabe, the country's president), on the structure of tendons in the leg, and the latest in soccer computer games. He reveals that he is fluent in French and Spanish, and is (or at any rate was) a first-rate sportsman. But that is to skip ahead. I had invited Howard Davies to lunch early this spring. I got a prompt reply from his secretary accepting, but saying that he did not have a free lunch slot until mid-June. Nearer the time, she called again to name Andrew Edmunds as his chosen restaurant. It was a predictably unpredictable choice, full of film people, with the odd sprinkling of alternative business types. To prove he fits the latter category Howard Davies arrives on his bicycle, and is already installed when I arrive by taxi a minute or two late. He orders a bottle of mineral water. 'I have two non-drinking months a year just to prove it can be done,' he explains. 'It makes you lose weight without having to concentrate on it.' I note that he is not exactly a fatty, but he replies it makes him 'look better on the beach'. He glances at the menu, and makes a healthy choice. 'I'll have the salmon sashimi and then the crab cakes, for a change,' he says. A change from what? I wonder. Was he really busy every day since I invited him? He describes the endless succession of people who invite him to lunch to lobby him about this or that and his efforts to avoid a time-wasting meal. In addition there is the endless round of associations and federations, each with their annual lunch or dinner. 'The difficult thing is to think of something new to say.' I ask whether he really needs to say something interesting every time, surely no one would notice if he coasted occasionally? He disagrees: 'You'd quite quickly acquire a reputation of being boring.' I get the impression that in Davies's book, boring is a serious allegation. Everything about him declares that he will not be considered that. Unsuccessful might rank nearly as low. 'I tend to do single-mindedly what I am doing at the time,' he says as we start to discuss his career. 'At Oxford I did Oxford. I did a certain amount of work, I acted in OUDS, edited a newspaper and played games.' He recalls how he applied to the BBC after Oxford, but was turned down without even an interview - it seems to rankle even now. His friend Peter Stothard, now editor of The Times, made the grade, but Davies points out that he did better still by landing a job in the Foreign Office. 'I did what grammar school boys did and asked what is the most difficult thing to do? At that time the foreign office was.' In any case he reflects that journalism is a young person's profession. At just 43, surely he still counts as young? 'No, not since I did the Gazza injury to my knee last year. Gazza was a fit young boy of 24 and he's come back. But the surgeon said to me: we don't think it's worth repairing these if you are over 40.' Then follows the description of tendons and cartilage in the knee, which I only half understand. Yet Davies does not think of himself as old either, and says that will not happen until Mick Jagger stops singing, and there is no longer talk of the next Rolling Stones tour. Here he has hit on our first shared interest. We discuss great Stones' concerts, and I boast that I last saw them in Cologne in 1990. He replies that he saw them in an even more unlikely place in Paris. Whatever age Howard Davies considers himself, he certainly looks older than his years. I ask - as politely as it is possible to ask such a question - whether he thinks his senior appearance has helped give him, especially earlier on, extra gravitas. He looks neither surprised nor offended. He replies that both he and John Birt, director-general of the BBC (another chum), may have been helped by going grey or bald early. However, he insists that he does not look 'older in a total way. It's only hair in my case. I'm relatively fit for someone of my age'. The conversation is getting sticky, and the waitress rescues the situation by asking if we would like a pudding. I order a tiramisu, and he an equally wicked hot almond cake covered in cream. I declare the meal so far to have been 'absolutely delicious'. He agrees that it has been 'quite good'. Does he care about food, I ask. He turns out to be a keen cook, and says he is much better than his wife (Pru Keely, producer of the BBC programme Question Time) at preparing an impromptu meal for guests. Apparently he can knock up a nice Italian pasta or risotto, a stir fry or something Indian in just 20 minutes using whatever is in the fridge. His wife is a better bet for guests who have been invited long in advance. 'She follows recipes that say: 'Take a lobster, boil with four onions, discard lobster, reduce to one teaspoon, pour over a scallop, discard scallop'.' Apropos of nothing in particular, he then starts telling me about a computer football game that his children have. I have already said that a) I have no interest in football, and b) I do not know anything about computers. Nevertheless, he gives a 10-minute soliloquy on the workings of this game, the noises it makes when the ball hits the goal post, the information it conveys about players of European teams, and much else besides. I suggest that it is not only his sons who are wild about this game. He half laughs, but certainly does not admit to having wasted hours bent over the screen himself. I ask for the bill, which turns out to be less than Pounds 40 including service. I pay, and walk him to his bike. 'That was too cheap for the Financial Times,' he says. 'Perhaps we should have lunch all over again.'</p>

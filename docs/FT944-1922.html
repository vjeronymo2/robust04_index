			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Autumn sales lift Courtaulds Textiles Shares in Courtaulds Textiles rose 16p to 435p yesterday after Britain's second largest clothing and fabrics manufacturer defied raw material price increases and unseasonably warm weather by reporting encouraging sales during the crucial autumn season. The rising share price, however, only partially reversed several months of decline, which worsened in September when the group announced a 26 per cent fall in first half profits following significant losses at its newly-acquired French hosiery businesses. Nevertheless, the group said a 'satisfactory' performance in recent months and minimal restructuring costs would help it meet full year profit targets, estimated at about Pounds 47m by analysts. The group's optimism was due in part to increased orders from Marks and Spencer, its largest customer, according to Ms Julia Blake of BZW. 'Demand from M&amp;S has taken off with a vengeance and suppliers across the sector are extremely relieved,' she said. While not downplaying the importance of M&amp;S, Courtaulds Textiles claimed trading had improved following the success of a three-pronged strategy aimed at maintaining margins. Its exposure to raw material price increases has been limited by building up forward stocks; higher prices have been passed on successfully on towels and bedding; and new products have all had increased prices built in.</p>

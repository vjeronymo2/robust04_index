			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: 'A radiantly comic kind of Greenland / A look back at the life of a real professional SURVIVING: THE UNCOLLECTED WRITINGS OF HENRY GREEN Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 301 pages HENRY GREEN was the pen-name of Henry Yorke, managing director of the Birmingham-based engineering company, H. Pontifex and Sons. Originally it had made lavatories - the Pontifex Maximus was the de luxe model - but market forces caused the firm in the 1930s to switch to the manufacture of equipment for the catering industry. Yorke's pseudonym unfortunately coincided in all but the absence of a final 'e' with the real name of a writer who was to rival and eventually out-strip him in fame and reputation - one Graham Greene, a writer whose novels Henry Green happened greatly to dislike. It so happened that both were major novelists, Greene of socially committed fiction with Catholic themes, Green of a radiantly comic kind of novel, strong on verbal mimicry, that was his own unique English thing. For a while in the 1940s the two of them jointly dominated English fiction. From the start Green had the edge over his rival in one respect, the single word title. This kind of title was rare when he published his first novel Blindness in 1926. Green wrote that novel while still a pupil at Eton. By the time it was published he was up at Oxford reading English, one of the first batch of undergraduates at Magdalen to be taught by a newly appointed don called CS Lewis. Green's single-word titles continued. Apart from being a marketing gimmick, they seemed to be saying that the novels dealt with some on-going unresolvable condition - Living (1929), Loving (1945), Concluding (1948), Doting (1952). In Party Going (1939) he allowed himself an extra word to define the circle of rich people and their servants who are the book's subject, held up by fog at a railway terminus on their way to the South of France. Green and his wife, known always as 'Dig', would go on similar jaunts before the war with their friend Aly Khan. In the one work where autobiography and fiction are blended he runs in his title to three quick monosyllables Pack My Bag (1940), but for the two novels which cover phases of the war in England, - Caught (1943) and Back (1946) the titles are resignedly monosyllabic. In a novel of the immediate postwar period entirely written in dialogue - about a flighty father's relations with his solemn son - Green teased his readers with the title Nothing (1950). These were all the books published by Green in his lifetime. Greatly to the disappointment of his admirers, he gave up writing long before he died in 1973. The reserves of energy he had summoned over so many years to pursue his various careers of bright young thing, managing director who shuttled between London head office and the works in Brum, industrial spokesman, novelist, Blitz firefighter, seemed to abandon him altogether on his official retirement. He withdrew in one fell swoop not only from commerce, manufacturing and novel-writing, but from friends and all forms of social life as well. For any admirer who has long thirsted for More (the title I would have given this book - called in fact Surviving), here is a rich reminder of Green's eccentric writing styles. It contains fascinating unpublished juvenilia, rejected late stories and an unperformed TV play, along with pieces that have only previously appeared in magazines, several from the war. The collection is topped by forewords by John Updike and Matthew Yorke, Green's novelist grandson, and is tailed by his son Sebastian Yorke, who contributes a candid, informative, biographical memoir of his father. So far there has been no full-length biography. Green's radio talks on novel-writing, also included, were well worth preserving in this form and so was the hitherto unpublished Mood. This represents the first part of a novel about a friendship between two young women. Later Green admitted he had abandoned the book when he fell out of love with the girl on whom the heroine was based. In the Bookmark programme Trapped: The Story of Henry Green, shown on BBC-2 last Wednesday, sensitively directed by Roger Thompson, we saw glimpses of the man himself in his heyday. There he was in full close-up - that extraordinarily handsome face he normally refused to allow to be photographed from the front. His film-mad admirer J. Maclaren-Ross once told me he thought Henry looked like Ray Milland. Green's replies to the invisible interviewer ('Novel-writing? No, I've given it up - it's too tiring') were inter-cut with shots of Forthampton Court, near Tewkesbury, the family house where his childhood was spent (model for the one in Loving even though that book was set in Ireland), and interviews with former colleagues, fishermen, factory hands, servants, several highly articulate women friends - one Japanese - trying to define the nature of his personal magnetism, male friends like Noel Annan, and finally Jenny Rees (Goronwy's daughter) who was supposed to take down the autobiographical sequel to Bag, never written. Then there was Kate Broom, who served Green with his nightly gins at the George IV in Knightsbridge opposite his London house and was puzzled by his lonely vigils. In my youth I once met him there when I was trying to write something about him and we talked about his books, particularly Back. He said that it had had about 70 reviews and not one reviewer had picked up the anecdote about twin identities from the memoirs of Mme de Crequy, translated by him and planted carefully in the middle of the narrative. 'I even published another extract from her memoirs in Horizon just before the book came out', he said. Fifty years on we now have that extract re-published in Surviving. But one has to say that the relevance of these spurious pieces of 18th century court gossip to the novel is at best marginal. Green then asked me where I thought of publishing my article on him. I mentioned some obscure little magazine. Why didn't I try Penguin New Writing, he suggested. I replied I thought they would be most unlikely to consider a piece by an unknown undergraduate. 'I don't know,' he countered. 'John Lehmann who runs it is absolutely besotted about a Greek poet called Demetrios Capetanakis. Now if you could slip into your first paragraph a comparison between his poetry and my prose, I'm sure you'd be well away.' Green was a charming man and a real professional. The novels of Henry Green are being re-issued in paperback by Harvill. Currently available are Living, Loving and Caught, at Pounds 6.99 each.</p>

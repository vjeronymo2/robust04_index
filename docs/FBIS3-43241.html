			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Law and Order Minister Hernus  Kriel described the murders as callous, adding, the "sheer blood  lust which marked this attack represents the kind of evil that  must be relentlessly fought in the new South Africa".    "The fact that this attack took place during the festive  season is evidence of the depths of depravity to which the  perpetrators are prepared to sink in order to destabilise the  democratic process. They must and they will be stopped.    "All South Africans must now unite and make the greatest  possible effort to fight violence in all its forms. I appeal to  the public to take every possible precautionary security measure  to lessen the likelihood of such attacks. The South African  Government and the SA Police remain as committed as ever to  combating terrorism and every possible effort is being made to  bring those responsible for this latest outrage to justice.    "I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the  families and friends of the victims."    Condemnation of the attack also came from the African  National Congress's Gill Marcus who told reporters she hoped the  killers would soon be brought to book. "We condemn it as  totally unacceptable... It's very difficult to understand the  motives of people who commit random acts of terror."</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING COSTS TURN SWEET SMELL OF PLAYOFF SUCCESS SOUR;  </P> <P> STATE TOURNAMENT: HIGH SCHOOLS ARE DIPPING INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS TO MEET  EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE POSTSEASON.  </P> <P> As Servite High School prepares for its first state basketball championship  game, the Friars are learning that the price of success can be costly.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Tom Vitello said the Friars already have lost $760 traveling  to a first-round regional game. They could lose as much as $1,100 more when the  team travels to play Hayward Mt. Eden on Saturday in the Division III  championship game at the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> But Servite's athletic department isn't the only one in Orange County dipping  into its pockets to meet costs during the state playoffs:  </P> <P>  -- Mater Dei expects to lose $6,000 on its trip to the state Division I  championship game on Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum. The Monarchs used  private donations to cover a $6,000 expense loss when they won the 1987  Division I title.  </P> <P>  -- Woodbridge High School lost about $4,500 in travel expenses when the  Warriors won the 1987 Division II title.  </P> <P> Vitello and other athletic directors and coaches have criticized the state  California Interscholastic Federation for earning a profit from the tournament  while schools struggle to pay travel costs. They say teams that reach the state  tournament are penalized for their success.  </P> <P> College teams complain when they miss out on $286,500 that the NCAA gives them  for making the tournament.  </P> <P> "The (high school) state tournament is completely the opposite," Woodbridge  Coach Bill Shannon said. "It's a 180-degree turnaround."  </P> <P> Jerry Jelnick, Corona del Mar athletic director, said he's not sure if the  school's athletic department can afford a trip to the state tournament next  year. Corona del Mar expects to barely break even after playing a first-round  regional game at San Diego Lincoln and a semifinal game at Servite.  </P> <P> "We're not real happy with the state playoffs," Jelnick said. "We don't get  anything out of it. Only reimbursement.  </P> <P> "It's all negative. There's nothing positive coming out of it. If we would have  gone up to state this week, we would have had to put a lot of money up. I don't  know if we will go into the state playoffs again."  </P> <P> Tom Byrnes, commissioner of athletics for the state CIF office, said last  year's state tournament earned a net profit of $160,000. He said the profit is  returned to the office's general budget to pay for operating costs.  </P> <P> "It's expensive for all schools to run athletic programs," he said. "Schools  don't get reimbursed for travel (to the state tournament) in most sports. The  fact that basketball is, is a plus.  </P> <P> "Teams have 400 to 500 contests on all levels every year. They have to travel  to get to many of them. The CIF games are just a drop in the bucket."  </P> <P> The state CIF office reimburses a school 50 cents for every allotted ticket  sold for a regional and state tournament game, not including box-office sales.  </P> <P> Adults pay $6 per ticket and students $3 per ticket for regional games. Tickets  for the state finals in Oakland are $10, $8, $7 and $5.  </P> <P> Shannon said the policy has a major flaw.  </P> <P> "How many fans are going to buy a presale ticket for Oakland?" Shannon said.  "If you have an immense following, let's say you bring 1,000 fans, you still  get only $500 from the tickets. That will pay for only three players to go to  Oakland out of the Orange County Airport."  </P> <P> The CIF also pays schools $2 a mile for teams traveling by air and $1 a mile  for traveling by bus or van. The CIF also pays for meals if a team travels more  than 100 miles one way.  </P> <P> Vitello said the reimbursement money isn't enough.  </P> <P> "There should be some kind of formula that will allow us to at least break even  on these things," Vitello said. "The meal allowance and lodging I can  understand. But the (assistant) coaches are paying their own way."  </P> <P> Byrnes said the mileage money the state tournament offers is more than all but  one section tournament. The Southern Section pays 75 cents a mile round trip  for travel.  </P> <P> "At least there's some reimbursement for some playoffs," Byrnes said. "What  about wrestling, track and volleyball? There's no (travel) reimbursement at all  for those sports. Team sports like basketball are better off.  </P> <P> "Travel expenses are not something that just occur in state playoffs. They have  to play all those games all year long."  </P> <P> Schools make little, if any, money off allotted ticket sales. Vitello said  Servite had 500 allotted tickets for its first-round game at Lemoore March 6.  </P> <P> "We didn't sell any of them," Vitello said. "The game was on Tuesday and we  found out on Sunday that we were playing up there. We had no chance to sell  any. We made zero off it, zip.  </P> <P> "Even if we would have split the gate with Lemoore, we wouldn't have made $100.  There weren't many people there."  </P> <P> Mater Dei had no problem selling the 500 tickets allotted for each of its three  state playoff games. Assistant principal John Merino said the school wasn't  given enough.  </P> <P> "The whole state tournament process needs to be changed," Merino said. "The  Southern Section tournament is very well organized and it benefits kids. They  put the student section right by the court and the whole thing promotes  schools.  </P> <P> "The state tournament doesn't do that. They didn't give us enough tickets for  our games and we had people standing in line at the L.A. Sports Arena the day  of the game to get us more."  </P> <P> Vitello said Servite lost $760 traveling to Lemoore. Servite chartered a bus to  make the 440-mile round-trip trek from Anaheim to Lemoore. The school also paid  for lodging and meals for coaches, players, a trainer and cheerleader  coordinator, Vitello said.  </P> <P> "We chartered a bus for $1,001," Vitello said. "We were reimbursed only $1 a  mile by the CIF, so we lost (about) $600 right there."  </P> <P> Mater Dei spent $7,800 on travel for the 1987 state tournament, and the CIF  reimbursed the school $1,800.  </P> <P> In the 1987 Southern Section 2-A playoffs, Woodbridge played Righetti High at  Santa Maria and met Victor Valley High at Apple Valley. They played at Fresno  in the Division II regional before moving to the final at Oakland.  </P> <P> Although the school lost money, Shannon said, reaching the state finals was  worth it.  </P> <P> "It's impossible to turn down the opportunity to go," Shannon said. "You go to  the tournament and then you do your best to make ends meet financially. We had  a little bit of money in reserve, but mainly our school district paid for our  expenses."  </P> <P> Besides flying the team to the championship game, Mater Dei also brings its  band and pep squad on a bus. Mater Dei, a private school, relied on donations  to pay for the travel costs in 1987.  </P> <P> "We're doing the same thing this year," Merino said.  </P> <P> Vitello's not sure where Servite will get the money. Servite is a private  school that charges tuition, but Vitello said he has "cut our athletic budget  to the bone."  </P> <P> "I can't say, 'No, we're not going to playoffs,' because that hurts the kids,"  Vitello said. "The only thing we can do is ask the parents to make up the  difference. We're going to pass the hat and hope we can collect enough to make  up at least part of our costs."  </P> <P> Byrnes said schools get to keep profits from concessions on home games; that  helps pay for travel costs.  </P> <P> "That can be a pretty nice trade-off," Byrnes said.  </P> <P> Servite made $250 from presale tickets when it played host to Corona del Mar in  the Division III semifinals. But all the concessions money went to the booster  club instead of the school's budget.  </P> <P> In an attempt to trim expenses, Vitello suggested that the team charter two  vans for the trip to the state finals in Oakland.  </P> <P> "The players' parents wanted the kids to fly up there and be relaxed in time  for the game," Vitello said. "We expect to (spend) at least another $4,600 on  this trip. And after the CIF reimburses us, I'd say we will get roughly half of  that back."  </P> <P> Vitello said Father Patrick Donovan, Servite's principal, is writing a letter  of appeal to the CIF office asking for more reimbursement for the Lemoore trip.  </P> <P> "We're asking for $200 to $300 of the ($1,960) total," Vitello said.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris said the travel reimbursements are one of many  issues troubling the state tournament.  </P> <P> "It's a second-class operation," Orris said. "When we went out to the CIF  office to get the draws, they gave us nothing like rosters or who we were  dealing with or when we played. There are a lot problems that need to be ironed  out.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's fair that Southern California teams have to drive up to  Oakland every year. Why not have the tournament at alternating sites each  year?"  </P> <P> Jelnick said it's up to the schools to help find an answer.  </P> <P> "If enough people are complaining, maybe we should sit down and look at this,"  he said. "If they ask everyone to play and if everyone says no, then let's see  what they do."  </P> <P> STATE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT PAIRINGS  </P> <P> Friday at the Oakland Coliseum  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:5.96IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Boys  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Division V  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> El Cajon Christian vs. Colusa  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4:15 p.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Division IV  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Clara vs. Travis AFB Vanden  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 p.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Girls  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Division V  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Menlo School of Atherton vs. Rosamond  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2:30 p.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Division IV  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Maria St. Joseph vs. Moraga Campolinda  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6:15 p.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:4.97IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Boys  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Division III  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Servite vs. Hayward Mt.

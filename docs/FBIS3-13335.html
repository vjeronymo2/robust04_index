However, we have not lost  hope that the crisis will soon blow over so the state's  constitutional institutions may again become active with the  participation and cooperation of the partners in the coalition  government to implement the document, ease the burden on the  population, and build the modern Yemeni state on modern  foundations that will ensure the sovereignty of law and order,  enhance the role of institutions, nurture respect for  constitutional legitimacy, respect the will of the people, and  be bound by the principle of a peaceful and democratic rotation  of power.    In this effort, we must emphasize our commitment to  inviolable and sacred national parameters, notably unity and  democracy. Unity is the source of the people's strength and is  a guarantee for stability, advancement, and national prosperity.    On this occaion, we renew the call for all disagreements,  contradictions, and problems to be ironed out through the  channels of democratic, objective, and sober dialogue, and  reason and wisdom. The homeland is not the exclusive property of  any one individual, party, or group. Nor has anyone the right  to claim custodianship over unity, the people, or any part of  the homeland. Unity is our people's communal property. We will  not squander our unity no matter what the price. He is in  error who thinks that the solutions to problems lay in  undermining unity or taking the homeland back to the era  preceding 22 May, 1990. The wheels of history have moved forward  and will not turn backward. The solution lay in rectifying  behavior and mistakes and taking a determined stand against all  kinds of corruption and the embezzlement of public money, the  due process of law, accountability, putting the general good of  the homeland before narrow or party interests, dissociation from  parochial affiliations, and desisting from stoking regional,  tribal, and other tendencies. The yardstick by which faith in  the unity of the homeland must be measured is action to advance  the unity of the people. This is because no homeland cannot  remain united unless its citizens share a common will and unless  their loyalty to their respective parties or regions takes  second place to their loyalty to their homeland. The homeland  is a trust that we must keep; the protection of unity is a  sacred national duty. None of us should take lightly any  attempt to tear up our country's unity or plunge it into  sedition or war. It is an unforgivable crime for a Yemeni to  kill his Yemeni brother or for Yemeni blood to be shed by Yemeni  hands. Therefore, it is every Yemeni patriot's sacred duty to  speak up against whatever may heighten tension or trigger armed  conflict.    Brother Citizens: My visit to Egypt and the United Arab  Emirates during the last week of the holy month of Ramadan was  an opportunity for me to meet with brother President Muhammad  Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. The  talks I had there were positive and useful both for our  bilateral ties and for joint pan-Arab action. The two brotherly  countries emphasized their full support for Yemen's unity and  deep concern for its security. We deeply appreciate Egypt and  the UAE and other Arab brothers for their brotherly stands and  the way they relate to our country's concerns.    In the name of all our people, on this happy occasion, I  send my greetings to all our Armed and Security Forces  personnel, who have consistently proved up to the sacred  national responsibility, which they are shouldering with  courage, devotion, and patience. They shall always watch over  our unity, freedom, and democracy and faithfully stand guard  over our national sovereignty and all the gains scored by the  people. To the best of their ability, they shall distance  themselves from all political differences and disputes. This is  because by staying loyal to God, the homeland, the revolution,  and unity, they thus remain above all partisan differences and  disputes.    I repeat my congratulations on the 'Id. God's peace and  mercy be upon you.</p>

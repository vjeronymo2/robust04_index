			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Penna recovers Penna, the USM-quoted outplacement consultants, swung back into the black at the interim stage as it gained market share in 'continuing highly competitive' conditions. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 139,000, against losses of Pounds 118,000 last time and Pounds 309,000 for the previous full year. Turnover expanded by 26 per cent, to Pounds 4.91m; fee income at Sanders &amp; Sydney improved from Pounds 3.89m to Pounds 4.67m. 'This increase has been achieved in a marketplace in which major competitors have reported a decline in sales of about 25 per cent,' said Mr John Beard, chief executive. Marketing initiatives had resulted in a number of new clients across industry sectors, he added. Earnings per share emerged at 1.8p (losses of 2p) and the interim dividend is again 1p.</p>

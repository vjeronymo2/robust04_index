			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Owen to consult EC over role as mediator LORD OWEN, who drew up the ill-fated Bosnian peace plan with Mr Cyrus Vance, yesterday hinted that his future role as a mediator might be in doubt. He told journalists he wanted to consult European leaders over the next few days before making a statement on the subject. Many observers believe the plan has been sidelined by the new international strategy on containing the conflict. Lord Owen said he was facing a 'new situation' following last weekend's meeting in Washington at which the US, its European allies and Russia agreed to press ahead with 'safe areas' for Moslems in Bosnia and proposed the monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border to ensure that essential supplies to the Bosnian Serbs would not get through. 'My role as a negotiator stems from the European Community and I want to talk to them,' Lord Owen said. He declined to answer when asked whether the Vance-Owen peace plan, providing for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, might be dead following the Washington agreement. However, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, firmly rejected any such suggestion at a news conference in Copenhagen. The new peace efforts in Bosnia should be seen as a prelude to the Vance-Owen plan, not as its replacement, he said. 'What we were doing in Washington was to agree on the steps which are immediately possible to stop the fighting and bring the bloodshed to an end.' In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, defended the new policy of limited steps to contain the war in Bosnia as serving the interests of the American people. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the special Russian peace envoy, also denied that the new strategy meant an end to the Vance-Owen plan. Mr Churkin, who met Yugoslav and Serbian leaders in Belgrade yesterday in a bid to persuade them to accept deployment of UN monitors along Serbia's borders with Bosnia, said the new Bosnian strategy reflected 'some aspects of the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan'. At the UN in New York, Islamic member states sharply criticised the Washington agreement, saying the Security Council, by failing to take stronger action, had yielded to 'Serbian blackmail'.</p>

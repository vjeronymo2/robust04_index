			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Many questions still surround the news of a  secret visit to France for medical treatment by Staff Lieutenant  General Husayn Kamil Hasan al-Majid, Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn's adviser. Word of the visit, carried by an opposition  radio in northern Iraq, has set off a political crisis within  the French Government. The Iraqi opposition radio said Lt. Gen.  al-Majid obtained an entry visa to France under an assumed name  and on a Jordanian diplomatic passport, along with his  secretary, Khalid al-Makhzumi, and his wife, who is Saddam's  daughter.    Al-Majid had been hospitalized at the King Husayn Medical  Center, where he underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor that  turned out to be benign. [passage omitted]    The question remains, however, whether Jordan really made  Jordanian passports available to the Iraqis. Jordan's Interior  Minister Salamah Hammad, in a statement to SHIHAN, has  disclaimed any knowledge of the passport issue, and stressed  that his ministry has not issued passports to any Iraqis.</p>

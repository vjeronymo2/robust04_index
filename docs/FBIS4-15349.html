			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/4/1994 -- 1,700 soldiers of  the 27th motorized Division of the Orenburg region serve in the  Russian peace keeping forces deployed in Dniester, says today an  article by the military commentator Viktor Litovkin in the  newspaper IZVESTIA. "16 soldiers had been killed during a year  and half. During the same period, the peace keeping forces had  confiscated from people who violated the security regime 38  guns, five machine guns, seven grenades, seven carbines, 12  pistols, nine shotguns, 200 grenades and 63,000 cartridges. As  to weapons that people on the both banks possess on the basis of  special licenses, both Tiraspol and Chisinau officials do not  have any data." There are 41 posts in the security zone along  the Dniester of which 13 are joint, 10 check points, nine posts  near Tighina (Bender), five near Dubasari and four near the  village of Chitcani. The 41 Russian offices and 358 soldiers  serving at these posts have 400 guns and several tens of armored  vehicles. "Colonel General Col. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian  deputy defence minister and responsible for the peace keeping  forces, stated that no one intends to retain the Russian peace  keeping forces in Dniester for an undetermined period.  Moreover, the reduced Russia military budget cannot afford this  long presence. But, this does not depend on the general's  wish," says the newspaper.</p>

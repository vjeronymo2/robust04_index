			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOOSEN UP ON SEX, IRANIAN LEADER URGES  </P> <P> Eleven years after the Islamic revolution forced women under veils and banned  social contact between the sexes, President Hashemi Rafsanjani is championing a  freer attitude toward sex and social interaction.  </P> <P> "We imagine that it is good if we suppress ourselves, endure frustrations and  be patient in our sexual desires.  </P> <P> This is incorrect. It is wrong," Rafsanjani said last week at Friday Prayers,  an important forum for political statements.  </P> <P> "God has created certain needs in the human being, and he does not want them  left unanswered," he said in his address at Tehran University.  </P> <P> "Why is it improper for a lady to marry twice in her lifetime? Or to have a  temporary relationship -- a temporary marriage -- with someone else?"  Rafsanjani asked.  </P> <P> Sigheh, or temporary marriage, according to Iran's dominate religion, Shiite  Islam, can be verbally contracted between two consenting adults. They take a  temporary "vow" before engaging in sex.  </P> <P> Attempting to make the idea of sigheh as loose as possible, Rafsanjani said in  his sermon that "some people imagine that for a temporary marriage we have to  find a (cleric).  </P> <P> "None of this is necessary," he said. "They can make a contract for themselves,  if they want to be together for a month or two."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial symposium on the training and  selection of minority cadres was held in Guiyang yesterday  afternoon, presided over by Wang Shouqin, Standing committee  member and director of the provincial party committee's  organization department. Attending the meeting were party and  government leaders, including [Guizhou CPC Secretary] Liu  Fangren, [Guizhou Congress head] Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Yuan  Ronggui, Hu Tiansheng, Liang Wenkui, and Li Yuandong.    The current meeting, which was jointly held by the  provincial  party committee organization and united front work departments  and the provincial government's nationalities affairs commission  and personnel department, was to convey and implement the spirit  of the national symposium on the training and selection of  minority cadres and of central leaders' important speeches; sum  up and exchange our province's experience in the work; and  discuss how to do a good job of training and selecting minority  cadres in the 1990's. Addressing the symposium, Liu Fangren,  secretary of provincial party committee said: Guizhou is a  multinational province. Minority nationalities constitute 34.7  percent of the province's total population. Training and  selecting minority cadres has a bearing on the province's  reform, development, and stability and the realization of the  strategic goal of shaking off poverty, gaining prosperity, and  achieving a well-to-do standard of living. We should have a  full understanding of the importance and necessity of training  and selecting minority cadres, sum up experience, consolidate  what has been achieved in the work, do an ever better job of  ideological work, and provide a solid and liable organizational  guarantee for the province's reform, development, and stability  and the realization of the second-step strategic goal. Liu  Fangren stated: To meet the needs of the new situation of  developing the socialist market economy, we should elevate the  work of training and selecting minority cadres to new heights,  place greater stress on improving the quality of minority cadres  while expanding their ranks, give better training to minority  cadres while doing a good job in the training and selection  work, and strengthen the building of the ranks of minority  cadres at the gross-roots units of the minority nationality  areas while optimizing the leading bodies at all levels. In this  regard, first of all, we should conduct education in the "two  indispensables" and strengthen unity and cooperation between  cadres of minority nationalities and those of the Han  nationality. He also urged party localities and governments at  all levels to put the work of training and selecting minority  cadres on the agenda as an important task, personally take up  the work, and continue to strengthen leadership over the work.</p>

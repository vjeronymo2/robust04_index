			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Observer: Half original Of the two new ventures in the life of George Davies, the birth of his son is the more original. As the ex-boss of Next previously had five daughters from his two marriages, a first son (another George, of course) is a brand new development, which is more than can be said for his latest retailing venture. His 'magalogue' - a hybrid magazine and catalogue - is called Xtend, a title somewhat reminiscent of the Department X store he developed while at Next. Xtend will include a gardening section and - as students of Davies's career may recall - his last, doomed venture at Next was the development of a gardening catalogue, which delivered plants but sadly not profits. However some onlookers are taking heart from the fact that Davies's estranged wife Liz, who was product director at Next, is not involved in the latest move. Some suspect it was her undue influence over her husband that precipitated the boardroom bust-up culminating in George's exit in December 1988.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jalal Rashid, Hani Salih, 'Ala' Mu'tamad, and </F> Sulayman Fu'ad: "Car Experts: Plants Producing Compact Cars Face  Threat of Stoppage Because of Customs Tariff; Reduction of  Customs Tariff on Production Requirements to Protect National  Industry; Unidentified Cars Invade Egyptian Markets"]    [Text] Egyptian plants producing compact cars, which have  an engine capacity of less than 1,300 cubic centimeters (cc),  are threatened with stoppage and with the loss of the big  investments spent to build these plants, not to mention the  displacement of a large number of workers because of stoppage or  of reduced production. The reason for this is the reduction of  customs tariffs on all cars with a capacity of less than 1,300  cc. This reduction has made these cars more salable than the car  produced by Egyptian plants and has eliminated real competition  between imports and local production because of the lower prices  of imports.    We have in Egypt more than one plant that has begun to turn  out production or is about to begin production, not to mention  the al-Nasr Car Company production.    Car experts have demanded reduction of the customs tariff on  the requirements needed to produce Egyptian cars of all  capacities in order to protect this newborn industry from the  ghoul of imports. The experts have also demanded that the car  market be protected from numerous kinds of cars that are offered  in the markets without any identification or country of origin  and that carry international brand names. Officials must do this  to safeguard Egypt's economy and its money.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Sa'udi, head of the car dealers branch of  the Cairo Chamber of Commerce, has said reduced tariffs on  imported cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has  inflicted grave harm on domestic car plants at a time when these  plants are making their first steps to meet the domestic demand  for cars and to prepare to compete, even if at the price level  only, with imported cars.    Dr. Sa'udi added that the government must not only consider  securing cars for consumers at a price that is 5-percent or  10-percent cheaper. It must, at the same time, consider the  national industry's future and must promote domestic investments  that open the door for greater employment opportunities and that  create other subsidiary industries around them.    He urged reduction of the customs tariff on imported  components so that plants can reduce their costs and can compete  anew with imported cars.    Engineer Salah-al-Din al-Khudari, the commissioned member of  the Suzuki Egypt Corporation, has noted that the recent customs  tariff amendments have harmed domestic plants from two angles:  customs fees on imported cars have dropped by 10 percent, thus  improving their chance to compete and, on the other hand, the  increase of 4 percent in service fees has led to increasing the  customs fees on imported components, which means an increase in  the cost of the domestic product!    Al-Khudari also said that a continuation of this condition  will compel the Egyptian producer to depart the domestic car  market and that the door will be opened wide for the foreign  product to occupy this market. Al-Khudari further added that  domestic plants have been forced to lower their prices in order  to survive in the market even though this reduction saddles them  with added burdens, keeping in mind the constant rise in the  costs of electricity, power, water, insurance, and taxes.    Al-Khudari went on to add that the increased new car supply  in the market and the drop in the prices of these cars, both  domestic and imported, has led to an increased demand for them  and, consequently, to a drop in the demand for used cars and in  the prices of these cars.    He has urged that controls be established on car imports and  that car dealership owners be given the necessary protection so  that they can perform their role and secure post-sale service to  the consumer.  <H5>  Requirements for Compact-Car Production </H5>   Husayn Abazah, deputy chairman of the Trade and Development  Center, has said that reduced customs fees on compact cars will  negatively affect the production of similar cars in Egypt.    Abazah has urged the government to reduce customs fees on  requirements for the production of Egyptian compact cars so as  to safeguard the investments that have been spent on this  industry and to protect this industry's workers, especially  since this newborn industry needs government protection. We have  been urging full protection for more than a year, because aiding  these plants by reducing the customs fees on the requirements  for Egyptian compact-car production will enable local cars to  compete with imported cars that have less than 1,300 cc engine  capacity. Thus, we will preserve the investments that have been  made in this field.    He stressed that Egyptian cars will find it very difficult  to  compete with imported cars with an engine capacity of less than  1,300 cc, especially in light of reduced customs fees on the  imports. Therefore, the customs tariff concerning production  requirements for cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc must  be reconsidered.    Abazah said that Egyptian-produced cars with an engine  capacity of 1,500-2,000 cc will not be affected by the recently  announced customs tariff reduction and that the volume produced  in Egypt has not been able to meet the growing demand for cars  with a 1,500-2,000 cc capacity. Moreover, the price of the  import exceeds the price of the similar domestic product by  nearly 30 percent.    Husayn Abazah pointed out, however, that the domestic market  for big cars produced in Egypt would, by necessity, be affected  by the customs tariff reduction if such cars were produced in  large numbers.    He urged officials to protect the car market and the  Egyptian  consumer from the entry of unidentifiable cars now that the door  of imports has been opened. He said, "We don't know in what  country these cars are produced, even though they carry  international brand names. This will undermine the national  wealth, because hard currency will be spent on importing such  cars. Moreover, the hypothetical life span of these vehicles is  50 percent shorter than the life span of the genuine vehicle  originating from the genuine source."    He stressed that the Egyptian consumer will suffer a big  loss  if he buys such vehicles.  <H5>  Consumers Prefer Imports </H5>   An official source of al-Nasr Car Company has said that  reducing the customs fees by 10 percent will affect the Egyptian  car market, especially the production plants, negatively.    He added that the consumer will buy imports instead of the  locally-produced types.    This official asserted that [domestic] car companies have  begun to reconsider some current proposals to produce new car  models in anticipation of chaos in the Egyptian car market.  <H5>  Car Plants Face Threat of Closure </H5>   Majdi Mukhtar, the chairman of a new company operating in  the  field of passenger car production, has said that the 10-percent  reduction in customs fees will inflict heavy losses on Egyptian  car producers.    Mukhtar has proposed that the government provide a grace  period of 4-5 years without any customs fee reduction in order  to enable producers to increase the domestic component and  reduce imported components used in car production.    Mukhtar also said, "On the other hand, the resource  development fee can be raised by as much as the reduction in  customs fees so as to make up for the customs fee reduction on  the [imported] fully-manufactured commodity."    He said that he has invested an estimated 150 million pounds  to build a new car factory, and that he will go ahead and  produce the car, because complete stoppage means a big loss in  the invested capital.    Mukhtar asserted that with the customs fee reduction, the  fully-manufactured imported car will compete with the national  production, thus exposing new investments to extreme risks that  reach the extent of complete closure.    Faruq Ihsan, a car dealer, has said, "The used and new car  markets are dominated by chaos and anticipation now that the  customs tariff on cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has  been reduced. This condition will last for three months before  the car market can regain its past condition.    "Used car prices will drop by no less than 20 percent now  that new cars have no customs fees and that there has been a big  increase in the used car supply."    Ihsan added, "Sales declined immediately after the tariff  was  announced, because buyers have stopped buying cars in the hope  of getting the biggest reduction in car prices. They are  entitled to do this because the price of a single car may drop  by 7,000 pounds."    Ihsan further said, "Demand will be for new cars offered by  dealers and companies on bank-guaranteed installments so as to  take advantage of the 10-percent customs fee reduction.  Moreover, all the buyer has to do is make a small down payment  get a brand new car."</p>

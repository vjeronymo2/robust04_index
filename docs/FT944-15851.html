			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Italian unions call protest Italy's three main trade union federations have called for a mass demonstration in Rome on November 19, following up Friday's general strike to protest against proposed pension and welfare cuts. The unions also called for a further eight hours of strikes between now and the middle of next month. But most government ministers remained firmly committed to the 1995 budget, which looks to find savings and new revenues of L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) to reduce next year's deficit. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, missed the general strike because he was on an official visit to Russia, but at the weekend he dismissed further industrial action as futile. 'The government has inherited an economic situation with figures that no demonstration can alter,' he told journalists in Moscow before returning to Italy. Friday's four-hour general strike paralysed Italian cities and angry but peaceful demonstrations attracted at least 3m people onto the streets, according to organisers.</p>

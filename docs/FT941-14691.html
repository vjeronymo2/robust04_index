			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas British Gas's 50-year sterling bond issue looks like a clever piece of opportunism. The government has been unwilling to issue long-dated gilts, leaving life insurers hungry for assets which are a match for very long-dated liabilities such as deferred pensions. Yet 50-year liabilities are few and far between for even the largest life office. That points to strictly limited demand for similar securities. With gilt yields the lowest for a generation, though, other companies must be tempted to try their luck. After all, Walt Disney persuaded US investors to suspend their disbelief last year and lend it money for a full century.</p>

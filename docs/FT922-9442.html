			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Injuries inflicted on basic intelligence - Cinema A bisexual murderess stabs men to death with an ice pick just after they have sexually climaxed with her. Who is she? For adding this problem to the workload of the California police, the screenwriter of Basic Instinct Joe Eszterhas, formerly of Jagged Edge and Betrayed, was paid Dollars 3m: an all-time record for a Hollywood script. For playing the San Francisco detective who goes after her Michael Douglas was paid Dollars 14m. For directing the film, Paul Verhoeven was paid - enough: let us just say that the movie's budget was on the runaway side of Dollars 40m. As a film critic I feel an equivalent amount would compensate me for injuries to my intelligence. Basic Instinct is no Jagged Edge, even less a Fatal Attraction. It is a contrived, flashy, predictable crowd-puller, all the more disappointing for its early promise. As sexual aggression thrillers go, this one leaves the starting-block at 99 mph. We begin with a young man dying in flagrante with an unidentified blonde. We move on to Detective Douglas falling for lead suspect Sharon Stone, a bombshell who writes best-selling novels from her lavish Monterey retreat. And we are shocked as more ice-picked bodies hit the ground and Mr Douglas keeps hitting the sheets. He does so in startlingly explicit detail (for Hollywood) either with Miss Stone or with curvaceous police psychiatrist Jeanne Tripplehorn. When not being stoned or tripplehorned, Douglas occasionally does some police work. Here Basic Instinct shows its edgy best. Douglas displays a line in teeth-gritting angst worthy of father Kirk, and tension is spiced by the frequency with which the sleuths are outsmarted by the suspect. For Miss Stone discovers that by throwing nonchalant sexual candour at the Fuzz or by wearing no knickers during interrogation - five stunned police heads keep dipping whenever she uncrosses her legs - she can reduce the San Francisco PD to drooling incompetence. Yet for two hours the film asks 'Did she do the murders?' Since no definitive video evidence of them exists, whereby a Californian court could identify and acquit the culprit, Douglas must do much leg-work. And wheel-work too: a night car chase, a series of Vertigo-like trailings over San Francisco's rollercoaster hills, and a one-man shuttle service between the city and Stone's glass-and-stone mansion teetering above the Pacific whitecaps. Sadly, all this preludial stylishness gives way to hundred-horse-power hokum. Just when director Paul 'Robocop' Verhoeven has begun to prove that he can direct human beings - with fine use of focus-pulling to point up staged-in-depth conversation scenes - screenwriter Eszterhas piles on Mr V's shoulders one implausible plot twist after another. This is one of those films in which complete strangers turn out to have been at school together, or to have shared a common interest in ice picks, or to have been patrolling the same corridor when bloke X, Y or Z gets a sharp instrument through the jugular. Finally, the whole overwrought mess is cleared up, but not so tidily that a final 'twist' does not leave open the possibility of a lucrative sequel.</p>

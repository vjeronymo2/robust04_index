			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bell Canada restructure plan could cut 5,000 jobs BELL CANADA, the country's biggest telecommunications utility, plans to reduce 1994 operating expenses and capital spending by about 10 per cent, and the payroll of 46,000 people could be cut by 5,000 within a year. Bell is a subsidiary of BCE, Canada's biggest publicly-held company and provides most of BCE's income. Bell told employees it was beginning an overall 'restraint' programme, taking CDollars 466m (USDollars 352m) out of operating expense and cutting CDollars 300m from the capital budget. The burden will fall on local services. Attrition, incentive packages, extended leave of absence, voluntary part-time work and elimination of overtime 'will remove the equivalent of 5,000 people from our workforce over the next few months,' said Mr Robert Kearney, president. Bell said this implied a reduction in the total workforce of up to 5,000 within a year as the programme takes effect but it hopes to avoid lay-offs. In 1990 it employed 52,000 people. The programme is Bell's response to a decision by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission to reject the company's request for rate increases. The CRTC allowed Bell an 11 per cent to 12 per cent annual rate of return for 1994. But Mr Kearney said even this could not be achieved without the restraint programme. 'This should bring earnings in 1994 to a level that will counter the decision by rating agencies to put our debt on creditwatch,' he said. BCE lost CDollars 346m, or 98 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 9.9bn in the first half, after writing off its share of a CDollars 940m special charge by Northern Telecom. Profit a year earlier was CDollars 496m, or CDollars 1.76 a share, on revenues of CDollars 9.8bn.</p>

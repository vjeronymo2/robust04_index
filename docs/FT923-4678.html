			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Delors attacks US over subsidy on wheat MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday heavily criticised the US plan to double its subsidised exports of wheat and warned that this could undermine efforts to reach a trade agreement through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He called US President George Bush's plan to use Dollars 1bn to subsidise the export of 29.1m tonnes of wheat to some 28 countries an 'aggressive act'. Abandoning the informal truce between US and EC negotiators on Gatt, the commission president said the US move had vindicated the Europeans' refusal to bend to Washington's pressures to reduce its own subsidies. His remarks came during a French radio broadcast on the Maastricht treaty. After the broadcast, Mr Delors said the US plan would double the amount of its subsidised wheat on world markets, directly challenging the EC's markets in Pakistan, Kenya and Latin America. 'It is a very bad sign,' he said. Some countries, such as Brazil, have declared they will not buy subsidised wheat from the US, while US officials said yesterday that the announcement was partly aimed pressing the EC to reduce its export subsidies in agriculture. Mr Delors acknowledged that Mr Bush's announcement was probably meant to win US farmers' votes in the presidential election in November, but he complained that the US was aggravating tensions over trans-Atlantic trade through its policy of benign neglect of the dollar.</p>

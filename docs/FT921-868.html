			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Scandals dash recovery hopes - Brokers face the worst slump since the 1960s HOPES of a return in investor confidence toward the Tokyo stock market have been dashed by the recent scandals involving manipulation by brokers of clients' investment accounts. The revelations of the tobashi disputes - brokers trying to window-dress clients' accounts by shifting loss-making investments - could not have come at a worse time. Japanese brokers, already battered by the sharp falls in stock prices in 1990, and deteriorating investor confidence brought on by last year's revelations of stock scandals, face the worst slump in prices and turnover since the 1960s. Daily activity in the stock market has remained below the 300m level, as investors have continued to shun equity investments. In February, daily average volume fell to 196m shares, the lowest level since June 1982, down from more than 1bn at the height of the bull market. Analysts point out that to break even, the large brokers need at least 300m shares, while for the medium and smaller brokers, the figure rises to 500m to 700m. The Big Four brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - recently revised down their profit forecasts for the year to March. Only Nomura managed to maintain net profits. Yamaichi and Nikko have been hurt by the market slump, and Daiwa, which expects to be in the black at the pre-tax level, is forecasting a net loss of Y43bn due to extraordinary losses of Y72bn from the tobashi scandals. However, problems at the Big Four, which have corporate underwriting business as one of their main pillars of business, are not as severe as those at the medium-sized brokers, which rely heavily on brokerage commissions. Of Japan's 260-odd brokers, the medium-sized brokers, which invested heavily in computer networks and increased overheads to maintain competitiveness, have been hit the hardest. Nine out of 10 the ten second-tier brokers expect earnings losses on both pre-tax and after-tax levels. Since costs on capital investments are fixed and staff cuts are not normal practice in Japan, the brokers have resorted cutting expenses such as advertising and entertainment, closing branches, and selling off real estate holdings. Takagi Securities, a medium-sized broker listed on the second section, recently announced the closure of its London-based affiliate. Larger second-tier brokers, such as New Japan Securities and Sanyo Securities, have started to close domestic branches. Yet, cost-cutting schemes are not as drastic as one may expect. Analysts point out that such moves will not be enough to compensate for the sharp declines in revenue. 'Brokerages don't have much fat on them, thus there isn't much room for cost-cutting,' says Mr Robert Zielinski, financial analyst at Jardine Fleming. With an increase in competition due to financial liberalisation slated for next year, where barriers between the banking and securities industry are being eased, restructuring of the securities industry seems unavoidable. However, Mr Zielinski says as long as companies refuse to cut staff, rationalisation of the industry brokers will occur when some securities companies fail. 'There is no use in combining two small losers into one big loser,' he says. While small brokers in the UK and US operate in niche markets, Japanese brokerages are not specialised, and for most brokers, the bulk of operations are concentrated in Tokyo. In a desperate attempt to survive, brokers have tried to attract individual investors back into the market by promoting long-term stock investments, rather than increasing turnover by telling investors to buy and sell stocks on a short-term basis. Looking after the individual client's 'portfolio' has become the trend in the industry. 'We're telling customers that stocks will surely rise in five years' time,' says Mr Kikuo Noguchi, managing director of National Securities. Some analysts point out that such a strategy would not work considering the nature of the industry and the untrained salespeople. Volume in the late 80s was generated by the Big Four promoting issues they had underwritten using 'themes'. The brokers would think up a theme which would give a reason for a stock to rise. The theme would be used to orchestrate buying among institutional investors, and also to convince individuals to commit funds to the market. However, such techniques are now frowned upon by authorities, and investors are becoming more concerned about the real 'value' of their stock investments, such as price earnings ratios and dividend ratios. 'Using themes is the only way the Big Four brokers know how to sell stocks, and following the Big Four is the only way the smaller brokers know how to do business,' says Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, senior economist at Japan Securities Research Institute. Mr Nikami says smaller brokers are even starting to grumble that the present slump has been brought on by the lack of thematic trading generated by the Big Four. Futures and options trading has also been blamed as another culprit of the market slump by smaller brokers. Initial resentment that heavy activity in the futures markets was distorting the thin cash markets, was focused on foreign brokers who have been generating profits by actively trading the futures and options markets. Tensions between foreign houses, which are leading players of the derivative markets, and financial authorities are rising as authorities try to curb derivatives trading through restrictive measures. Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director at Nomura Securities, says that the reactions of the Japanese brokers and authorities is unavoidable. 'If Japanese brokers were making huge profits in New York while US houses were losing money, what would happen?' he asks.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Fresh hope in search for EU chief: Britain lists names of 'broadly acceptable' candidates for Commission presidency The emergence of seven possible candidates for the presidency of the European Commission has reinforced optimism in Mr John Major's government that there will be an early end to the dispute over the successor to Mr Jacques Delors. British ministers indicated that the names on a draft list of contenders - drawn up in Whitehall but representing the government's understanding of the position of other European Union member states - are all broadly acceptable to London. The names have been canvassed during intense consultations among EU governments after the deadlock at the EU summit in Corfu last month. It also became clear yesterday that Mr Major now appears willing to risk the anger of Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches by nominating Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, as Britain's second commissioner in Brussels from January. Among the fresh contenders for the Commission presidency are Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the former Danish foreign minister, and Mr Pedro Solbes, the Spanish finance minister. But Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister, apparently remains the choice in London. British ministers acknowledged that the list, which also includes candidates from the Netherlands, is by no means final. A strong contender from Belgium might yet emerge within the next few days. Mr Peter Sutherland, Irish director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, could also re-enter the race. But comments by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday that Spanish prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez has ruled himself out of the race strengthened the view in London that the successful candidate most probably will be drawn from the names now circulating. Mr Kohl, who as president of the EU council is preparing the ground for a decision at or before the Brussels summit on July 15, signalled also that Mr Delors is unlikely to extend his presidency. Apart from Mr Ellemann-Jensen, Mr Solbes and Mr Amato, the other four being mentioned in London are Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister who failed to muster enough votes at the Corfu summit; Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner in Brussels for external political affairs; Mr Renato Ruggiero, at present Italy's candidate to head the World Trade Organisation; and Mr Poul Schluter, the former Danish prime minister. Britain is unwilling to give public support to any individual candidate for fear of a backlash from other EU governments in the wake of Mr Major's decision in Corfu to veto the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene. But it is clear that Britain's first preference is Mr Amato and it would also be happy with Mr Ellemann-Jensen or Mr Solbes. Mr Major is said to have no 'overwhelming objection' to the other candidates. It is understood that Mr Major will delay a final decision on whether to propose that Mr Kinnock join Sir Leon Brittan at the Commission until after the new president has been chosen. But colleagues say the prime minister is ready to remove the bar he placed on the former leader when Mr Kinnock was first suggested two years ago. If that position is confirmed, the government is likely to press for Mr Kinnock to be given the overseas development portfolio.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Passing a Major hurdle: seven man the UK would not veto  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- John Major Ruud Lubbers                   Netherlands Hans Van den Broek             Netherlands Giuliano Amato                 Italy Renato Ruggiero                Italy Poul Schluter                  Denmark Uffe Ellemann-Jensen           Denmark Pedro Solbes                   Spain  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

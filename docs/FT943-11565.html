			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: ICI Yesterday's half-year figures from ICI were better than the modest rise in the shares suggests. The company has outperformed the stock market by 7 per cent since the end of March, so it is quite a feat to live up to its star billing. The 9 per cent growth in chemical volumes in the second quarter is especially encouraging. With prices of most basic chemicals clearly on a rising trend, there is plenty for shareholders to look forward to. It could be hard for ICI to sustain the current momentum. While European recovery should lend support, stock building ahead of price increases may have helped to boost volumes. The rate of volume growth may therefore be less impressive through the second half of the year. Even so, recent results from US and continental European chemicals companies suggest volumes are growing faster than seemed possible at the start of the year. With capacity utilisation rising - and in ICI's case cost-cutting still flowing through to the bottom line - the operational gearing could be impressive. A multiple of around 25 times this year's forecast earnings begins to look realistic after all.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bank censured over BCCI: Bingham report criticises supervision of corrupt banking group THE Bank of England's supervision of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt banking group, was censured yesterday in a report commissioned jointly by the Bank and the government. The report, by Lord Justice Bingham, said the Bank failed to take appropriate action after receiving a series of warnings over many years that fraud was taking place at BCCI. It was also critical of Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, for failing to brief the Bank fully about the extent of the fraud it had uncovered at BCCI in early 1991. BCCI was closed down in July 1991 after the Bank received a report from Price Waterhouse, listing frauds carried out by the bank involving many billions of pounds. Abu Dhabi, the Gulf state which had a majority shareholding in BCCI, also came under attack for failing to pass on to Price Waterhouse and the Bank of England information it received in the spring of 1990 on the scale of the BCCI fraud. Further criticisms were that the Bank misunderstood its legal responsibility to monitor BCCI's activities closely from as early as 1979 and that subsequently it missed a series of valuable opportunities to take greater responsibility for supervising BCCI's operations. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday the Bank 'was slow to impose on BCCI an appropriate supervisory regime and . . . that the Bank continued for too long to rely on the Luxembourg authorities to play the leading (regulatory) role'. He proposed, however, only modest reforms of the UK banking supervisory system, which Lord Bingham concludes has generally worked well in preventing fraud and financial difficulties at other banks. The Bank is creating a special investigations unit to pursue any indications of fraud or malpractice at banks. Separately, a legal unit is being established to advise the Bank on its responsibilities and rights under the Banking Act, after a series of misjudgments in the Bank's relationship with BCCI. In addition, the UK Banking Act, which gives the Bank its supervisory powers, is being amended to give the Bank an explicit power to close down the UK operations of any international bank if it feels the overseas operations of that bank are not being supervised properly. A separate amendment will introduce a duty on any bank's auditors to pass information on suspected fraud at that bank to the Bank of England. A similar duty will be given to auditors of building societies and insurance companies to report suspected fraud to their regulators. The Bank and the Treasury do not believe Bank officials should resign in the wake of the report. 'The Bank made mistakes over so many years, it hardly seems fair to blame officials currently at the bank rather than those who have now retired,' said one government official. In the House of Commons, the Bingham report provoked fresh calls from Labour MPs for Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton to resign as governor of the Bank of England and for additional government help for BCCI victims. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said ministers - including Mr John Major who was chancellor before becoming prime minister - should accept responsibility. The Treasury 'knew full well that there was a problem', he claimed. But Mr Lamont said Mr Brown's attack was 'absolutely disgraceful' and cited Lord Bingham's conclusion that, 'the conduct of Treasury officials and ministers is not in my view open to criticism in any respect'. Later he said he had 'every confidence' in the Bank governor. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he was conscious of the acute distress the fraud caused innocent depositors but its scale was unique and was concealed from auditors for many years. But several Conservatives, including Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons' Treasury select committee, signalled anxiety that proposals for tightening supervision should be carried through speedily. The committee has called Mr Leigh-Pemberton to give evidence next month. Rejecting calls for extra compensation to BCCI depositors in the UK, Mr Lamont said the existing depositor protection scheme had already paid out Pounds 50m to about 9,000 people and the total could reach Pounds 85m. Under the deposit protection scheme, depositors in a failed bank receive 75 per cent of their deposits up to a maximum payment of Pounds 15,000. Attempts would be made to speed up payments to depositors under the protection scheme. The Bingham report's criticism of Abu Dhabi stems from an incident in the spring of 1990, when Abu Dhabi's royal family was told by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, then BCCI's chief executive, that he had conspired in the misappropriation of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) of the royal family's funds from a BCCI offshoot. Price Waterhouse and the Bank did not learn of this misuse of the royal family's money for nine months. Lord Bingham says: 'There was no reason for not passing on the effect' of what Mr Naqvi had admitted. Price Waterhouse was said to have missed opportunities in early 1990 to give the Bank of England a detailed picture of the BCCI fraud. Lord Bingham said this was regrettable. His strongest criticism was reserved for the Bank of England. He said it should have investigated two separate allegations of wrongdoing at BCCI in early 1988 and was negligent in not investigating separate allegations made in November 1988. The Bank was also wrong not to get more involved in attempts to rescue BCCI from collapse in 1990, he said. It was wrong in early 1991 to focus on the financial implications of reports it was receiving from Price Waterhouse rather than the implication that there was serious fraud at BCCI. Not only did Bank officials fail to understand the implications of what they were told by Price Waterhouse in 1991, they were wrong in not communicating all they knew to the Bank's governor and board of banking supervision, which reviews the work of the supervisory department.

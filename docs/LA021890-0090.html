			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHECKLIST OF TASKS FOR A SMOOTH HOUSE MOVE  </P> <P> Here are the main steps in the house-moving process:  </P> <P> * Find the lot. Recruit realtors to help, scan the newspaper's classified  section for lots-for-sale by owner and track down empty lots and their owners.  Research the potential of the area you are moving to.  </P> <P> Choose an improved, flat city lot or one that has a level building pad. Know  its legal description, sewer and gas access, zoning and setback requirements,  whether any liens or easements exist and if move-ons are approved for the area;  check local parking requirements and height restrictions.  </P> <P> * Find the house. Houses may be found through the classified section in  newspapers, public auctions, a move-on broker or house movers. Unless the buyer  wants a structure of historic value, it is best to pick a house built after  1950 to lessen chances of dry-rot and other problems connected with the age of  a building.  </P> <P> Choose one that is compatible with the neighborhood and the site; find out  whether it is a complex move that requires several cuts to the building and  consider the improvement-to-land ratio in the area and potential resale of  similar properties.  </P> <P> * Get a permit. Each city requires a valid permit to move a building.  Applicants must apply with the relocation division of the Building &amp; Safety  Department and provide the permit office with a simple plot plan indicating  site and house measurements and proposed siting of the move-on.  </P> <P> Within five to 10 working days, a relocation inspector will inspect the lot and  the structure to be moved. Permits are valid for 120 days. Permit fees for a  move within the city run $480 for a dwelling up to 2,500 square feet, and $180  for each 10,000 additional square feet; when a building is relocated from the  county to the city of Los Angeles, an additional permit fee of $300 must be  paid.  </P> <P> * Purchase a bond. A completion or performance bond is required as part of the  move-on process, at a value determined by the city that is usually 65% of the  house plus 10%. A completion bond is obtained from a bonding company or  insurance company.  </P> <P> * Find a lender. Relocation loans are not in the mainstream of real estate  investment. The sources are limited and the costs are usually high. Relocating  a building is more complicated because one is not borrowing on a "packaged  deal" but on a lot and a house in separate locations, with the concurrent costs  of getting them together and rehabilitated to meet the requirements of the  local municipality.  </P> <P> House movers usually know which lenders are familiar with move-on loans and are  willing to provide them.  </P> <P> * Hire a house mover. Once a city permit number has been issued, the house  mover begins his work. The house is split, jacked up, and steel beams are  placed under it. Dollies with wheels are then slipped under the structure to  make it mobile. Moves occur at night, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.,  as required by law.  </P> <P> When the house arrives at the site, it is positioned at a predetermined spot  and "cribbed up" -- sustained by a framework -- to allow the contractor to pour  the foundation.  </P> <P> The mover returns to lower the house onto the foundation.  </P> <P> * Choose a contractor. Contractors, as well as house movers, should be bonded  and insured. The contractor begins by building a new foundation on the new site  based on the footprint of the move-on. He will also "sew up the building,"  renovate and hook up the structure's plumbing and wiring to bring it up to code  and ready to function. The same contractor may also be contracted to do the  landscaping.  </P> <P> * Get certificate of occupancy. To get a certificate of occupancy for a move-on  (a city requirement) all repairs listed by the relocation inspector must be  fulfilled.  </P></p>

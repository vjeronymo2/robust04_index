			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], has withdrawn his warning that he would  definitely cancel the confinement of his forces by 22 January  should government troops continue to report to assembly points  at a slow pace. Speaking in a telephone interview, the Renamo  president said if his organization went ahead with the  cancellation it would be helping Frelimo to continue making  mistakes regarding the implementation of the General Peace  Accord. Afonso Dhlakama said he felt disappointed with the slow  pace at which government troops were reporting to assembly  points, saying he has been under pressure from his generals and  commanders who wish to know the reason for the executive's  attitude. [as heard] The Renamo leader said, however, that the  confinement of troops will continue.</p>

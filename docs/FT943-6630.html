			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / How To Spend It: Ideas above his workstation - Lucia van der Post finds that desk design is catching up with office technology When Marc Vlessing, a media consultant and film producer working almost entirely from home, wanted a new desk to cope with the screens, computers, cables, and machines that were cluttering his work-surface, he found, to his astonishment, that there was almost nothing on the market that met his needs. Or rather, nothing that cost less than about Pounds 4,000. He started by going to Habitat and then to an office stationery store ('Have you seen what they have to offer?' he explodes. 'It's as if they were still operating in the 1950s') but neither came up with anything of the size and quality he was after. The desks in the furniture stores tended to be not big enough to cope with the serious amounts of technology the up-to-date homeworker needs, including a screen, fax machine and printer. Those in the catalogues of the office furniture companies were mainly aimed at the purchasing managers of large companies and were quite unsuitable for any domestic environment. Some furniture retailers, it is true, specialise in desk systems, all clearly aimed at the 'executive' market but these tend to be over-designed and are usually prohibitively expensive. All of which seems odd in the light of the fact that more and more people are working from home (The Henley Centre suggests that there are already 300,000 teleworkers and that by 1995, 2.5m people will be working from home). While the computer companies have moved fast in supplying affordable, powerful computers suitable for home-use as well as attractive software, the furniture to go with it has lagged behind. Vlessing decided there was nothing for it but to get cracking himself. He approached Oliver Peake, an interior and furniture designer, and together they set about trying to produce something that was good to look at, large enough to meet Vlessing's needs and not too expensive. What they came up with is photographed here - as you see it gets away from the rather boring square desk with cabinets on either side which are standard office issue. It has curving lines, good materials and finishes, and an altogether pleasing look. Vlessing calls his system 'Desk'. It consists of the desk pictured here and a satellite filing station, seen here in the far corner of the room. Included in the price of Pounds 2,500 are all the filing systems and the drawers but none of the equipment. The hard disk and printer fit on to sliding shelves and, in this version, the satellite filing station holds the fax machine. The monitor screen sits on an extendable arm so that it can be used at eye-level and be moved in and out of the way. The basic structure is MDF (medium density fibre, a relatively inexpensive, stable material much used in the furniture industry) with aluminium cladding. The filing cabinets and drawers are aluminium clad, brushed and lacquered and the worktop is a linoleum-like material called Desktop. It is photographed here in a pale grey finish but Desktop comes in 12 different colours. A maple trim on the top of the worktop hides the cables and also functions as a pencil-holder. The desk top is raised on four steel columns through which the cables run. The printer and the computer are both on sliding trays in the cabinet, and are very accessible. Both the desk and the filing station have industrial trolley wheels so that they can be moved easily. It is available to order only. Anybody who is interested should contact Oliver Peake on 071-375 0570. If all that sounds a bit elaborate for you, you could, of course, just settle for a large table. Ikea stores, for instance (255 North Circular Road, London NW10 0JQ for mail order inquiries) has the simplest of table tops (unfinished spruce, pine, birch or a mixture of all three, Pounds 21) on trestles (Pounds 20 each) which add up to the princely sum of Pounds 61. A thing of beauty it is not but it is certainly serviceable, straightforward and entirely unpompous. You could then add a drawer unit on castors for another Pounds 60 and be done with it. Another, prettier solution, for technophobes who are still working mainly with paper and pen and perhaps have just a simple PC and telephone and do not mind the few cables they have being on show, is Cattelan Italia's Rondo desk - in walnut or cherry with three little drawers. It would fit into almost any home but at Pounds 1,383 is a real piece of furniture. It is stocked by Atrium of 22-24 St Giles High Street, London WC2. Aram Designs of 3, Kean Street, London WC2 always has a selection of clean and simple desks. Possibly the most stylish of all the simple solutions is Alvar Aalto's solid Birch desk with a top veneered in a choice of black linoleum, white laminate, ash or birch. With it comes a pedestal storage cabinet with five, three or two drawers. It costs Pounds 787. Or there is Jasper Morrison's plain- as-plain blond wood table which sells for just Pounds 600 and Marcel Breuer's elegantly clean-lined solution, a combination of a black-ash-stained desk top with a crisp five-drawered cabinet attached to the side for Pounds 1,322. But if simplicity does not solve your problem - if you want the cables attached to the technology neatly and properly housed, then the prices go whizzing up. Interlubke, the German office furniture manufacturer has a range designed for the home - a bit 'executive' for my tastes, it nonetheless is functional, beautifully-made (the top is of Swiss pearwood), keeps all the cabling out of sight and offers a drawer or a plinth for every device you could possibly need. It is a modular system, so you choose the bits you require. A good-sized desk, some cabinets for storage and what is called in the jargon of the office furniture world a 'return', would set you back at least Pounds 3,500, if not more. The range can be seen at Atrium.</p>

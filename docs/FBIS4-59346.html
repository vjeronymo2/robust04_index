			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with engineer 'Abd-al-Mu'ti al-Junayd, </F> deputy director of projects in the General Electricity  Corporation, by 'Abd-al-Malik al-'Ayzari in the studio -- live  or recorded]    [Excerpt] [Al-Junayd] I am happy to explain to the brother  citizens what happened to the electricity grid in the Dhamar  area as a result of raids and shelling by the secessionists in  the Ba Suhayb military camp. In fact, we are lucky because the  damage was very limited, concentrating on electricity lines that  extend from the station to feed the capital, Sanaa.    [Al-'Ayzari] This means the [words indistinct] lines?    [Al-Junayd] [Words indistinct] In the station itself, the  damage is very minor and concentrated on the lines, [word  indistinct] the lines extending from the Dhamar station to the  capital, Sanaa. The brothers [words indistinct] took a position  in favor of the constitutional legitimacy. Teams moved and the  brothers from the General Electricity Corporation, with their  equipment came and they defined the damage and began repair work.    The lines extend from the Dhamar transformers to Sanaa  through two circuits. The teams in the area repaired the first  circuit. A great effort was made and they were able to restore  electric current to Sanaa. The day before yesterday at 8 or 9  o'clock [am, pm not specified] they completed their task  successfully, restoring power to Sanaa in a very normal way.    Repair work on the second circuit, which is really a reserve  circuit, continues. It was hit harder. The brothers at the  site [words indistinct] brother Ahmad al-'Ayni also present to  have a firsthand knowledge of the situation. The repairs will  be carried out and today, and tomorrow they will be able to  repair everything and the electric power would be completely  restored.    We tell the citizens that the electric current is available  in the capital and there are no problems and their will be no  cuts, God willing. [passage omitted]</p>

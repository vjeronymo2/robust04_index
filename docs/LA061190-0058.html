			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND FEES: THE RULES AND LIMITS  </P> <P> Members of Congress may legally solicit four types of payments from special  interest groups. They are:  </P> <P> PAC Contributions: Political action committees are permitted to collect up to  $5,000 a year from persons who wish to support their point of view.  </P> <P> In turn, these committees may make contributions of up to $5,000 for each  primary and $5,000 for each general election to the campaign coffers of a  member of Congress or candidate for office. Although many corporations and  labor unions have PACs, the money must come from members or employees, not  corporate or union treasuries.  </P> <P> Individual Contributions: Individuals also may contribute directly to the  campaigns of members of Congress or persons running for Congress. No person may  give more than $2,000 to a single member of Congress or candidate during one  election cycle -- $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general election.  In addition, individuals are not allowed to give more than a total of $25,000  to candidates for federal office in any one year.  </P> <P> Honorariums: All members of Congress may accept up to $2,000 from special  interests as payment for an appearance or speech. Unlike campaign  contributions, these fees are personal income. Currently, House members may  pocket up to $26,850 in honorariums; senators may accept a maximum of $26,568.  Beginning next year, honorariums will be banned for House members and limited  to $23,568 for a senator. All fees received beyond these limits must be given  to charity.  </P> <P> Expenses: Members of Congress may also accept reimbursements from special  interests for the costs of transportation, lodging, meals and entertainment  related to speaking engagements.  </P></p>

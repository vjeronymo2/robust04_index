			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rio de Janeiro correspondent Sergio Adeodato] </F>   [Text] The husband-and-wife team of Russian scientists  Boris Margulis and Irina Fridlarkoca arrived in Rio de Janeiro  last month with their family, and carrying in their luggage the  technological know-how that enables them to swap their measly  salaries of $50 a month in Moscow for the $3,000 monthly they  will start earning as heads of the hybridoma laboratory at the  recently established Universidade Estadual do Norte  Fluminense--UENF [State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro],  located in the municipality of Campos.    The university has already invested $60 million in plant and  equipment. This month it begins the second semester since its  founding, and it is hiring 22 Russian researchers to staff five  high-tech laboratories in the fields of biotechnology, new  materials, and molecular biology -- facilities at which projects  will be carried out that are directly related to the  socioeconomic realities of the northern Fluminense region, where  agriculture and oil prospecting predominate.    "In 1992, right after we announced the intention to bring in  Russian scientists, we received more than 300 resumes from  Russia. We had to send four academic delegations to that country  last year to make the selections," said Wanderley de Souza, the  molecular biologist who is rector of UENF. He recalled that,  with budget appropriations continuing to shrink, "working  conditions for Russian scientists in most technological fields  are very bad, maybe worse than in Brazil."    Boris and Irina, like other married foreign scientists who  decided to move to Campos, will be given airline tickets for the  entire family, in addition to a subsidy equivalent to two  salaries so that they can settle in the city. This benefit is  also extended to the unmarried. The contracts are for a minimum  of two years. "Institutions in the United States have offered  the Russians salaries averaging $5,000, but many opted for Rio  de Janeiro, not just out of concern that they might experience  discrimination by the Americans, but because of good medium and  long-term market prospects for their technologies in Brazil," de  Souza said.    Along with scientist Alexander Kineo, also contracted by the  university, the couple will bring to Brazil advanced techniques  for production of reagents to be used in faster and more  efficient diagnosis of illnesses like toxoplasmosis, a disease  transmitted by a protozoan that attacks the central nervous  system and the eyes. The new diagnostic method (at present, this  country imports the tests) will be developed by fusing cells  that produce antibodies (the body's defense agents) with cells  from tumors that have the ability to reproduce themselves on a  large scale. This will produce a hybridoma, i.e., a cell that  combines the capacity to defend an organism with the ability to  multiply itself in large numbers, thereby making commercial  production feasible.  <H5>  Transgenics </H5>   A group of eight Russian scientists, all with doctor's  degrees and headed by Oleg Serov and Alexander Kerkis of the  Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Academy of Sciences of  Russia, will work on development of transgenic animals, such as  goats that have been genetically altered to produce milk  containing insulin. Other animals with transplanted genes might  be used to obtain blood clotting factors that are vital to  hemophiliacs.    The chief product of the new materials laboratory will be  the  technology for producing artificial diamonds by compression of  carbon molecules. These diamonds are essential to equipment such  as dentists' drills, marble-cutting tools, and oil-drilling  bits--the latter being one of the region's main economic  activities.    The technology of the synthetic materials known as  "superhards," developed by a group of five Russian scientists  that will work at UENF for two years, reflects the technological  strategy being pursued by this institution: absorb the know-how  at an advanced point in its development without spending many  years on research, so that the technology can be transferred to  industry in the midterm future. "The technologies will be  intimately related to the vocations of this region," said Gilca  Alves Wianstein, president of the State Foundation of Northern  Rio de Janeiro, the institution responsible for administration  of UENF, which has the flexibility and independence needed to  set up commercial and technological partnerships with the  production sector.    In the vicinity of its 25,000 square meter campus--which  during the first semester of this academic year will house 278  undergraduate and graduate students and 50 researchers--the UENF  plans to encourage the formation of a high-tech complex  sustained mainly by biofactories that produce cuttings for use  in growing fruit and sugarcane, and in reforestation.</p>

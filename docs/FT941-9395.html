			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / JIB puts Lloyd's agency in liquidation JIB Group, the insurance broking company which is part of the international conglomerate Jardine Matheson, yesterday placed one of its Lloyd's agency subsidiaries, Christand, into creditors' voluntary liquidation. Christand is one of dozens of Lloyd's agents targeted by loss-makers in legal actions, which will go ahead as a result of yesterday's decision by Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets traditionally supported the market  -to reject a Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer. JIB said yesterday the decision 'reflects legal advice concerning the size of the contingent claims faced by Christand and the costs which would be incurred in defending such claims'. The size of the claims was not made available, but they are understood to be more than Pounds 100m. Others members' agents could also come under pressure as legal actions get under way. This in turn could accelerate rationalisation - the number of members' agencies declined from 65 to 46 last year. JIB acquired Christand, formerly Nelson Hurst &amp; Marsh Agencies, in 1990 but the agency, which handled the affairs of 475 Names, has not traded since 1991. Its ongoing business was transferred into a separate subsidiary, Jardine (Lloyd's Underwriting Agents), and its past liabilities 'ringfenced'. Although the assets of Christand are limited, the company's liquidation did not adversely affect the rights of Names to make claims against the company, JIB insisted. Separately, London Wall Holdings (LWH), the parent company of two other Lloyd's agencies, confirmed that receivers had been called in. Mr Charles Hunter, managing director of London Wall, stressed that both its members' agency - the sixth biggest in the Lloyd's market handling the affairs of 650 individual Names - and the smaller managing agency were continuing to trade. Negotiations were taking place for their sale. The agencies have been hit by a decline in profit commissions and fee income as a result of the problems at Lloyd's over the past five years. LWH ran into difficulties when its Bankers refused to lend additional funds on top of an existing Pounds 1.4m facility. The group had originally borrowed Pounds 4m in 1988 to finance acquisitions.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Truck and van sales fall 11.3% UK NEW commercial vehicle sales fell by 11.3 per cent in April when compared with the same month last year, with the continuing decline contrasting sharply with the improvement in new car registrations last month. New commercial vehicle registrations fell to 17,220 in April compared with 19,406 in April last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported yesterday. The fall in registrations was the 31st successive monthly year-on-year decline. Sales last month were 48.7 per cent lower than in April 1989. New commercial vehicle registrations in the first four months of this year, at 70,307, were 11.5 per cent lower than a year before. Registrations have fallen by 47.8 per cent over the past three years. The commercial vehicle sector is a significant economic barometer, with vehicles going to many important sectors from retail distribution to construction. Truckmakers have suffered their steepest decline of the post-Second World War period, with sales falling last year to the lowest level since 1954. Commercial vehicle registrations last month were lower in all segments of the market, including the heavy truck market, which had shown the first signs of recovery in March. Sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) in April at 1,219 were 7.2 per cent lower than a year ago. The renewed decline followed an 18.0 per cent increase in March - the first monthly year-on-year rise achieved since September 1989 - which suggested that an end to the recession in the commercial vehicle market was in sight, at least in the heaviest weight ranges. Overall truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) in April, at 2,449, were 7.5 per cent lower than a year ago, while medium van registrations dropped by 12.7 per cent and small van sales fell by 13.2 per cent. In the truck market, Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, has regained market leadership from Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands, which led the market last year. The Iveco group, which includes Seddon Atkinson, gained 24.4 per cent of the market in the first four months, while Leyland DAF fell back to 22.6 per cent from 24.5 per cent a year ago. In the medium van market, Volkswagen and Leyland DAF have both achieved gains in sales volume in spite of the continuing fall in the overall market. AN EXPECTED post-election strengthening of the used car market failed to materialise last month, John Griffiths writes. Statistics from HPI, the hire purchase monitoring group, show the number of finance agreements on used cars last month fell by 7.1 per cent, to 73,483, from 79,023 in March. The fall reverses a recovery for the first quarter as a whole, when credit-financed sales of used cars rose by 9.25 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-APRIL 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume   Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units) Change (%) Jan-Apr 92  Jan-Apr 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                  70,307   -11.5       100.0       100.0 Imports                        25,076   -11.3        35.7        35.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                          22,123   -12.5       100.0       100.0 Imports                         4,379    -8.9        19.8        19.0 Ford                            8,982   -16.5        40.6        42.6 Vauxhall (General Motors)       7,406    +3.2        33.5        28.4 Rover (British Aerospace)       1,870   -35.5         8.5        11.5 Peugeot incl.

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Labour surgeson Israeli tide of discontent WHEN Israel television announced a few minutes after 10pm last night that its widely trusted election exit poll was predicting a big victory for the opposition Labour party, there was an explosion of emotion among party workers gathered at their headquarters in Tel Aviv. 'We have been waiting for this moment for 15 years,' proclaimed Mr Chaim Ramon, a senior Labour MP, as party officials cheered, embraced and danced around him. Labour has indeed been struggling since 1977 to recapture its position as the country's premier political force which it occupied, often complacently, for the first three decades of Israel's existence as a state. Then it was cast into opposition by the forces of Israel's ideological right wing, united under the banner of the Likud party and led by the charismatic Menachem Begin. Although in 1984 and 1988, Labour managed to claw its way back into government in coalition with the Likud, it had acquired the stigma of a force whose time had passed. The Likud, with its commitment to hold on forever to the occupied territories - the Land of Israel - increasingly saw itself as the natural party of government. The tide began to turn early this year when Labour, in a ballot of all its members, replaced Mr Shimon Peres as leader with Mr Yitzhak Rabin. Where Mr Peres was widely seen as a cerebral politician over-prone to intrigue and 'soft' towards the Arabs, Mr Rabin had a no-nonsense image that in Israel is invaluable. He was chief of staff in the triumphant 1967 Six Day War and the defence minister who in 1988 promised to 'break the bones' of Palestinians rebelling in the intifada. Coming from Mr Rabin, the Labour message that it was safe for Israel to abandon Likud's ideological commitment to the West Bank and Gaza Strip and make peace on the basis of territorial concessions suddenly sounded more reasonable. Labour also benefited from abject Likud incompetence. Under Mr Yitzhak Shamir's diffident leadership, the Likud had lapsed into vicious and public intra-party feuding. It also presided over a prolonged period of economic stagnation the effects of which were sharpened by the flood of immigration from the former Soviet Union which engulfed the country from 1989. But Labour under Mr Rabin may yet prove to be a conservative force. He accepts the need to trade 'land for peace' - the formula demanded by the Arabs and backed by the US as the basis of a Middle East peace settlement. But Mr Rabin is against a Palestinian state and opposes giving up large parts of the West Bank, the Golan Heights and all of East Jerusalem. Domestically, Labour on paper accepts that the still state-dominated economy needs a radical dose of reform. But it remains closely allied to the Histadrut trade union federation which is deeply resistant to many of the liberalisation programmes, particularly in the labour market, which the vast majority of economists say Israel must embrace in order to generate the growth needed to absorb the burden of immigration. The euphoria sweeping through the party last night was partly an expression of relief that it had proved wrong the doomsayers who said its time had passed. But it has much work to do to prove that it is truly the party of Israel's future. Of the 3.4m eligible voters, more than 500,000 cast ballots for the first time. About 394,000 eligible voters are Israeli Arabs. The 1.75m West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians are ineligible to vote. Most of the 150,000 Arabs of East Jerusalem who refused Israeli citizenship are also disqualified. Voters choose only one of 25 parties contesting the 120 Knesset seats. Electoral rules say a party must receive 1.5 per cent of the vote to qualify for a seat in parliament. Those that qualify split the 120 seats based on the number of votes they receive. Israeli MPs do not represent any geographical constituency.  ----------------------------------       STATE OF THE PARTIES*  ---------------------------------- Right-wing Likud                           32 New Liberal Party                0 Tehiya                           0 Moledet                          2 Tsomet                           7 Religious United Tora Jewry                4 National Religious               6 Shas                             7 Geulat Yisrael                   0 Centre-left Labour                          45 Meretz                          12 Tikva                            0 Others Dem.

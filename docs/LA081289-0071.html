			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO'S 'THIN AIR' IS A LITTLE TOO THIN  </P> <P> The failure of "Thin Air: Tales From a Revolution," at the San Diego Repertory  Theatre, seems all the sadder because the ideas it presents -- even those only  half-crystallized -- are so terribly important.  </P> <P> The playwright, Lynne Alvarez, is an American who spent her early 20s in  Mexico, where she found out, to her consternation, that a seemingly innocent  act -- in her case, starting a students' forum column in a local newspaper --  could and did lead to death threats for her and imprisonment for the man who  was her husband at the time.  </P> <P> "Thin Air" picks up on the anxiety of the naive American who realizes, too  late, that exercising ordinary American freedoms in a country in conflict can  be tantamount to an act of war. In "Thin Air," the mistake is made by an  American composer, in a nameless Latin American land, who unwittingly endangers  himself and his child when he includes a love song by a revolutionary on his  tapes of local music.  </P> <P> Just the thought of last year's "Burning Patience" at the San Diego Rep and the  recent "Dangerous Games" at the La Jolla Playhouse is a reminder of how  wrenching the stories of the desaparecidos (the disappeared) in Latin American  countries can be.  </P> <P> "Thin Air" would be just as affecting had Alvarez brought the characters to  life, but they never rise beyond the flat, two-dimensionality of sketches. It  is hard to enter the reality of the pain of parents who have lost their child  when you have never once seen that couple with that child. It is hard to  believe in the couple's love for each other when their relationship is  explained by the wife saying she likes music and the husband saying he really  digs her.  </P> <P> The dialogue meanders into stories that neither deepen the characters nor  advance the plot. Nor does it enhance the mood. And what is one to make of the  composer's daughter who, when pulled from the lineup of those about to be  killed, widens her pretty eyes at the soldier who saves her and tells him, when  he asks to marry her, that she isn't in love with him, so it would never work?  </P> <P> Director Sam Woodhouse struggles to lend shape to the action, which veers from  nightmare to cocktail party to reality and back to nightmare, often without  warning.  </P> <P> Woodhouse does deliver some stunning visual sequences from this quivering  chaos. Because of the thinness of the characterizations, the ensemble work at  the elegant party and in the inferno of the prison -- where beatings erupt in a  darkness artfully lit by Peter Nordyke -- provide the most memorable acting  from a talented team that includes John Hertzler, Kat Sawyer-Young, Mickey  Hanley, John Diaquino and Damon J. Bryant.  </P> <P> The symbols loom large on D Martyn Bookwalter's twisting set with a theme of  red and black -- love/blood/life and death -- established by the brilliant red  carnations atop the gleaming black baby grand piano and continuing with the red  and black of the family's clothing as designed by Nancy Jo Smith.  </P> <P> The skills of the design and execution, however, only serve to point up the  unreadiness of the script and the inherent flaws in a system in which the  desire to present a world premiere can result in a theater confusing a work in  progress for a comprehensive work of art.  </P> <P> What "Thin Air" needed was not this elegant production, but a workshop reading  with a full mounting several drafts down the road.  </P> <P> At 8 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday and 7 p.m. Sundays, with Saturday/Sunday matinees at  2, through Aug. 27. At 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego, (619) 235-8025.  </P> <P> </P></p>

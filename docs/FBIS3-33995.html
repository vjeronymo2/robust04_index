According to reports obtained from surgical hospitals, which  treat war casualties, 1,000 individuals from Dostum's militia  have been injured so far and sent to those hospitals. The  report adds: During the second offensive alone, which took place  in the area between Mirorayon and Pacha Pol, as a result of the  counteroffensive of the Islamic army and mujaheddin, 300 of them  were injured. Reports say that it can be concluded that during  the one month of Karmal-Dostom's failure in fighting more than  1,000 people were killed and even more were injured. This  number is very large, and it is a fact that enemy's combat  morale has been sufficiently crushed.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Battle for Corange takes further twist The battle for control of Corange, the Bermuda based pharmaceutical group, took a new twist yesterday when its biggest single shareholder threatened to sell his stake. In advance of tomorrow's special general meeting of Corange, which is the parent company of Boehringer Mannheim, one of Germany's largest healthcare companies, Mr Curt Engelhorn, said he was not prepared to hold shares in a company in which he had no say. The board is attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn, the 67-year-old German who speaks for 42 per cent of the family-owned Corange's shares through three different trusts, as chairman of the supervisory board of Boehringer Mannheim, a company founded 125 years ago. He has also been replaced as chairman of Corange, on a temporary basis, by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank. Mr Engelhorn, who was chief executive for 30 years until 1990 when he moved up to the supervisory board, has retaliated by sending a letter to members of the Engelhorn family demanding the resignation of Mr Max Link, Corange's chief executive. 'Mr Link has behaved in a rough, tough, rude manner. He has alienated the workforce,' said Mr Engelhorn, who is being advised by Goldman Sachs International, the investment bank. In his letter to shareholders Mr Engelhorn says: 'Certain members of the senior management may have a private agenda which is not necessarily consistent with the interests of the family and shareholders'. He criticises Corange 2000, the company's financial strategy, which he says is excessively optimistic. Mr Engelhorn warns that planned investments cannot be met through cashflow nor by additional debt. 'Thus the only alternative would be to go public'. Mr Pohl, along with four other independent directors, have threatened to resign if they lose tomorrow's vote. Mr Peter Warburton, international counsel to Corange, which had worldwide sales last year of Dollars 3.2bn, said Mr Engelhorn had been displaced as chairman because of a breakdown in confidence between the board and Mr Engelhorn. Mr Engelhorn is unlikely to sell his shares until after the annual meeting in May.</p>

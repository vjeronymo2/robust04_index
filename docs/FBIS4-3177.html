			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The First International  Wool Textiles Conference of China opened today in Xian, capital  of north- west China's Shaanxi Province.    The three-day conference, sponsored by China Textile Trade  Association, is being attended by 295 representatives from 13  countries and regions.    The conference will cover the study of the developing trend  of the industry and materials, theoretical study of the  structures of wool and other animals' fabric and manufacturing  technologies of wool.    Representatives of 18 well-known companies from abroad will  lecture on technologies of advanced wool textile equipment.    Wool textile industries have been set up throughout China,  which has 35,000 mechanical looms and 3.3 million wool spindles.    China's wool textile industry has been developing rapidly  since 1979, when China initiated its opening-up policy. During  1981 and 1992, the number of wool spindles in China increased  more than two fold, 5.5 times the number of 1980. The number is  still growing, at the rate of 225,000 annually.    In 1992, the country produced 338 million meters of woolen  goods.    At the same time, China's output of sheep's wool, rabbit fur  and yak fur have all become the greatest in the world in recent  years. China now accounts for 50 percent of the world's total  output of sheep's wool, 90 percent of rabbit fur and about 85  percent of yak fur.    Even so, China still needs to import large amounts of wool  every year.    China is keen on exchanges and cooperation with other  countries in the world, officials of the China textile trade  association said.    Officials from the International Wool Secretariat, Australia  and New Zealand are attending the conference.</p>

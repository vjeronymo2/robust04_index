			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITIES / BILLBOARD BATTLE;  </P> <P> PRIEST PLEADS MORAL RIGHT TO DEFACE ADS;  </P> <P> CHICAGOAN SAYS HEAVY USE OF OUTDOOR LIQUOR, TOBACCO SIGNS IN POOR AREAS IS  GENOCIDE.  </P> <P> Vandalism and battery are rarely headline-grabbing crimes, but Father Michael  Pfleger hopes his trial on those charges next month will help ignite a national  drive to rid minority neighborhoods of liquor and cigarette billboards.  </P> <P> Pfleger, an outspoken Roman Catholic priest, has been accused of defacing  outdoor signs and tossing paint on the owner of a billboard company who tried  to stop him. In an echo of a civil rights theme from the days of lunch counter  sit-ins and bus boycotts, Pfleger plans to argue that he has a "moral  necessity" to fight what he contends is saturation advertising of harmful  substances in poor parts of town.  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome, the case highlights a budding conflict between the  demands of social crusaders and the rights of advertisers to promote their  products.  </P> <P> THE CRITICS: Last year, nearly 20% of the billboard industry's $1.487 billion  in revenue was earned from tobacco and liquor ads, trade group figures show.  Although signs hawking cigarettes or beer can be found almost anywhere in the  country, critics contend that they are abnormally concentrated in low-income  areas or neighborhoods where blacks and Latinos live.  </P> <P> Scenic America, a Washington-based anti-billboard group, said surveys in  Baltimore, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis, Atlanta and other cities have found  that the vast majority of billboards in minority neighborhoods promote tobacco  or alcohol. The numbers in white neighborhoods are far lower.  </P> <P> Pfleger, who is white, said he recently counted every billboard within a  10-block radius of his all-black South Side parish and found 118 pasted with  cigarette or liquor ads. By contrast, in a similar-size white neighborhood on  the city's North Side, he found only three cigarette or liquor signs.  </P> <P> "When you target a particular race of people with (ads for) two of the nation's  top killers, that's genocide," Pfleger charged.  </P> <P> THE INDUSTRY: Spokesmen for billboard companies cite such criticism as a  classic case of attacking the messenger rather than the message. They do not  deny that billboard pitches are tailored to appeal to particular ethnic groups  but say that so-called "targeting" is a common, cost-effective practice in all  forms of advertising.  </P> <P> Billboard firms say that complaints from Pfleger and others have led them to  reevaluate the positioning of some of their signs and they have voluntarily  moved liquor and cigarette ads farther from schools and churches. But Steve  Shinn, a spokesman for Gannett Outdoor Advertising of Chicago, one of five  major billboard companies operating here, said critics are trying to legislate  morality and limit free speech.  </P> <P> "It's a very paternalistic attitude to say these people (in minority  neighborhoods) don't have the ability to make their own decisions," Shinn said.  " . . . If I don't agree that the Catholic Church should have bingo games  because I don't believe in gambling, should I have the right to whitewash their  bingo signs?"  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Pfleger's trial is set for Sept. 11. Meanwhile, more billboards on the  South Side continue to be hit by vandals, who mar their messages with paint or  antismoking and antidrinking graffiti.  </P> <P> And the City Council, under the sponsorship of one of Mayor Richard M. Daley's  floor leaders, is considering what could be the most sweeping anti-tobacco  ordinance in the country. It would not only ban outdoor tobacco advertising but  might virtually forbid the operation of cigarette vending machines as well as  raise the legal smoking age to 19 from 18.  </P></p>

Several shops in the town were petrol-bombed shortly after  the blast and police have offered R[rand] 10,000 for information  leading to the arrest of the attackers. Police spokesman  Maj-Gen Tokkie Nienaber said damage to the ANC office was  estimated at R80,000 and several surrounding houses were damaged  in the 1.15 AM explosion. The kind of explosives used was still  unkown.    Elsie Manoe, 46, suffered burn wounds to her hip and Katrien  Salabane, 14, was injured in her left thumb, said Gen Nienaber.  The interiors of three shops in the predominantly Asian  business centre of Koranna Fontein were gutted when unidentified  attackers broke the windows and hurled six petrol bombs into the  premises at about 1.20 AM. No-one was hurt in the petrol bomb  attacks.    The ANC's [African National Congress] Western Transvaal  branch called on the government to investigate the blast as well  as the proliferation of commercial explosives in the Western  Transvaal region.    Two powerful bomb explosions ripped through the offices of  two trade unions in Klerksdorp, also in the Western Transvaal,  and one damaged offices in Harrismith in the Orange Free State  on Wednesday. The blasts were believed to have been caused by  commercial explosives.</p>

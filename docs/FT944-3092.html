			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / World Trade News: MEPs endorse Gatt trade pact The European Parliament yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade global pact, boosting prospects that the accord will be ratified by member states of the European Union on schedule by the end of this month. MEPs voted 325 in favour, 62 against, with 12 abstentions. The Strasbourg assembly showed broad cross party support for the Gatt agreement, despite criticism from a protectionist force led by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French businessman elected as an MEP in this year's elections.</p>

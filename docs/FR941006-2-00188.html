Except as specified below, concept papers and applications for new projects other than national conferences, and applications for continuation grants may request funding in amounts up to $300,000, although new and continuation awards in excess of $200,000 are likely to be rare and to be made, if at all, only for highly promising proposals that will have a significant impact nationally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applications for on-going support grants may request funding in amounts up to $600,000, except as provided in paragraph V.C.3. At the discretion of the Board, the funds to support on-going support grants may be awarded either entirely from the Institute's appropria-tions for the fiscal year of the award or from the Institute's appropriations for successive fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of the award. When funds to support the full amount of an on-going support grant are not awarded from the appropriations for the fiscal year of award, funds to support any subsequent years of the grant will be made available upon (1) the satisfactory performance of the project as reflected in the quarterly Progress Reports required to be filed and grant monitoring, and (2) the availability of appropriations for that fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

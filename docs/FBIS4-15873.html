			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin's book, entitled  "Notes of a President" is being prepared for publication. It  will come out in Russia and have more than 400 pages with the  text and 90 pages with illustrations. The book consists of 10  chapters:    "A Normal Country. Russia in May to December 1990."    "Independence. January 1991."    "The Collapse of the Empire. September to December 1991."    "After the Putsch."    "Russia and the World. January to August 1992."    "The Shock Therapy. September 1992 to March 1993."    "Run of Bad Luck. April to July 1993."    "The Dramatic Summer. August and September 1993."    "The Dramatic Autumn."    "Premature Results."    The final chapters, which contain Yeltsin's story about how  the plan for the neutralization of the White House was conceived  and developed, are particularly interesting today. The author  writes that Russian fascists idolizing Hitler and his idea,  fought their first battle near the walls of the White House.    "The White House sent out signals which were pushing people  to the most horrible things: arsons, murder and plunder. Here  in the White House, a Russian rebellion - senseless and  merciless - was provoked, prepared and meticulously planned  under the cover of the lofty title 'political opposition'."    "No one was forcing officer Rutskoy, or Professor  Khasbulatov, who consider themselves politicians with high moral  principles, to use the neo-fascists' services," writes Yeltsin.    The author also gives a detailed account of the conference  in  Staroye Ogaryovo (a village in a Moscow suburb) on September 12,  1993, during which Yeltsin informed his power ministers Grachev,  Kozyrev, Golushko and Yerin of the draft decree on the dismissal  of the congress and parliament, and on early parliamentary  elections. The draft decree was approved, while Kozyrev remarked  that such a decree should have appeared a long time ago. The  foreign minister was sharply aware of the dangers posed by the  parliament, of Russia's falling prestige and of growing mistrust  in the world, writes Yeltsin. He also says that Viktor  Chernomyrdin resolutely put his signature under the decree,  already signed by the four ministers. The book also gives  details of the conference on the eve of October 4, when Yeltsin  instructed Pavel Grachev to run the military operation against  the rebels.</p>

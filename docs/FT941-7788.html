			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham Five years after SmithKline and Beecham were fused, Mr Bob Bauman can bow out having delivered the earnings growth which shareholders demanded. From the outside at least, the integration of the two companies also seems to have gone reasonably smoothly. Yet there are still reasons to wonder whether the merger was strictly necessary. Some of the strengths of the combined company - size and a complementary mix of products - are now a drag on sales and earnings growth. Pharmaceuticals remains the most important source of profits. Yet Tagamet, which has always been a source of worry, came from SmithKline, while many of the newer compounds which will replace it originated within Beecham. Its shareholders might have fared better if it had disposed of its personal care business and soldiered on as a drugs company. The Tagamet pain is about to strike in earnest, with the expiry of its US patent in May. Quite how fast Tagamet will lose ground to the generic competition is unclear, though there have been some drastic declines elsewhere in recent years. More general uncertainty over US healthcare reform also remains a depressant. And while the dividend has risen by a 24 per cent, that looks like a one-off rebasing, rather than the kind of cash avalanche which is about to hit Glaxo shareholders. The single-figure earnings growth expected in 1994 will probably come entirely from currency gains. With an encouraging range of new products, there is life after Tagamet, but shareholders are not enjoying it yet.</p>

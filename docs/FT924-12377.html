			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US and EC pursue deal on oilseeds US FARM negotiators yesterday met their European Commission counterparts in Brussels, aiming to resolve a long-standing dispute on the EC's oilseed subsidy regime and paving the way for a weekend meeting of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commis sioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. In its desire to get a deal, the Bush administration has softened its demands for EC production limits of subsidised oilseeds. It is now offering a cap of 9m tonnes a year. This compares with long-standing calls for EC output to be cut to 7m tonnes. EC farm negotiators want the ceiling at 9.5m tonnes, down from current 11.4m tonnes. But the administration's offer has failed to gain the support of the American Soyabean Association, the injured party in an inflammatory Gatt dispute over the EC's oilseeds subsidies. The ASA, which has twice gone to Gatt and won decisions condemning the EC subsidies, is spurning the Bush administration offer. Latest developments confirm US and EC claims that negotiators came close during talks in Brussels last week to resolving the dispute over subsidised farm trade that has for the past two years stalled progress in the Uruguay Round. Mr Joe O'Mara, a senior US farm trade negotiator, flew into Brussels yesterday for talks with Mr Guy Legras, his EC counterpart. It is uncertain whether talks will continue today. Mr MacSharry is understood to be keen to reach agreement with Mr Madigan, if agreement is achievable, before Monday's meeting of the EC Agriculture Council. US and EC officials confirmed yesterday that the most recent US proposal for settling the oilseeds dispute contained the following elements: EC production capped at 9m tonnes, and accompanied by a strong enforcement mechanism; no more than 5.128m hectares sown with subsidised oilseeds; a 15 per cent set-aside required in the first year for land growing oil seeds, with any oilseeds grown on set-aside land (for industrial use, for example) to be included within the 9m tonne limit; present yields of 2.36 tonnes per hectare to be cut to meet the 9m tonne limit. EC officials say reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy agreed in May this year will ensure cuts in oilseed production to 9.5m tonnes. They have warned US negotiators that deeper cuts would require the CAP reform package be opened up, raising the risk that EC member states opposed to the reforms would unravel other parts of the package.</p>

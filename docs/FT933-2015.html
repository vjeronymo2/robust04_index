			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: N Atlantic trust reforms capital NORTH Atlantic Smaller Companies Investment Trust is reconstructing its capital in an attempt to cut the discount to assets at which the trust's shares have been trading. Shareholders will be offered four new ordinary shares and six new units of convertible loan stock (all with a par value of 5p) for every five existing ordinary shares of 10p. The idea behind the scheme is that the trust will be able to purchase the convertible loan stock whenever it stands at a discount to asset value. These purchases will not only put a 'floor' on the discount but will enhance the net asset value of the ordinary shares. Discount on the shares has ranged from 32 per cent in September 1992 to below 17 per cent this month. In January management of the trust moved from Invesco MIM to JO Hambro. Interim results for the six months to July 31 were also announced. The net asset value per share rose by 16 per cent, from 412p to 479.8p, despite the exercise of warrants, which reduced the value by nearly 2 per cent. Quoted portfolio benefited from the performance of Danka Business Systems and the unquoted from the flotation of Mississippi Valley Bank and the sale of Tracker Network. After tax there was a net loss of Pounds 203,000 (Pounds 8,000) or 1.88p (0.075p) per share. The shares rose 6p to 411p yesterday.</p>

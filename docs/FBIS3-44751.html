			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Make Concerted Efforts, Work Hard, and Clear </F> the Way To Forge Ahead"]    [Text] With the clear sound of the new year bell, we usher  in a promising 1994. At this time, when the whole world is  joined in celebration, we want to convey new year greetings and  wishes to our combat comrades in the Navy, Army, and Air Force  who are fighting on every front for the motherland; to Armed  Police officers and men; to militiamen and reserve personnel on  various fronts; to retired and resigned old comrades who have  racked their brains in building our Armed Forces; to demobilized  servicemen, disabled servicemen, and family members of martyrs  and servicemen; and to people's governments at various levels  and the people of various nationalities who have shown care and  support for national defense building and the building of the  People's Armed Forces!    The year 1993, which has just passed, has added a colorful  page to the history of the invigoration of the Chinese nation.  This was a year in which we profoundly implemented the spirit  of the 14th party congress, used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the  whole party and Army, and rapidly developed the undertakings of  reform, opening up, and modernization. It was a very important  year, in which we built the socialist market economy system  based on the action plan which was formulated by the CPC Central  Committee for marching towards the new century. It was a year  in which our country witnessed economic development, political  stability, national unity, social progress, and great vitality  in various areas. During the year, the People's Armed Forces  advanced together with the people of various nationalities in  the whole country, and overall army building scored new results.  Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the  Central Military Commission, of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the  core, the whole Army diligently grasped military quality  building, followed the road of crack troops with Chinese  characteristics, and scored outstanding results in various areas  of work. We implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress  and voluntarily used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of the  officers and men of the whole Army. This completely strengthened  enthusiasm and resolution to uphold the party's basic line and  guaranteed a correct direction for the reform and building of  our Army. We inherited and developed our Army's excellent  traditions, vigorously stepped up and improved ideological and  political work under the new situation, and further promoted the  "five kinds of revolutionary spirit" proposed by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and the "64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by  Comrade Jiang Zemin. With the military strategy for the new  period as guidance, we established our thinking on winning  battles on the basis of currently available equipment, while new  enthusiasm for training emerged in every Army unit. We adapted  to the new situation of development of the socialist market  economy, continuously deepened reform of logistics work, and  enabled logistics and supply ability to improve markedly. At the  same time, science and technology for national defense made new  progress, educational reform in military academies started at a  new pace, reserve strength continuously increased, and militia  and reserve work made new progress. To conclude, meeting the  requirements of "being politically qualified, being militarily  capable, having a good work style, strict discipline, and  effective logistics," our Army's various tasks, aimed at the  main goal of building a modernized and regular revolutionary  army, made another solid step in the past year.    We are facing a new international situation in which peace  and development became the two main themes in the world and  challenges and opportunities coexist, as well as a new domestic  situation in which economic construction has become the center  of various tasks, and reform and opening up is being thoroughly  implemented. Our Army's duties are arduous and difficult, and  the responsibilities are glorious and heavy. In the new year,  we must continue to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army  building in the new period and the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guidance and base  ourselves on our military strategy for the new period to further  implement the policy of paying attention to quality building,  strengthen ideological and political building, firmly grasp the  implementation of various tasks centering on military training,  thoroughly improve our combat ability, and provide strong and  forceful security guarantees for the country's reform, opening  up, and modernization construction. We must continue to  resolutely use the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to arm the whole Army, earnestly put the study  of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping to  the primary position when engaging in ideological and political  building in the Army and giving theoretical education to cadres.  We must use the fruits of the study to guide and promote the  building and reform of Army units. We must strengthen the  building of the cadres contingent -- especially leading groups  at various levels; implement the "Outline on Army Building at  the Grass-Roots Levels" reissued by the Central Military  Commission; promote party work style building, clean government  building, and socialist spiritual civilization building;  strengthen and improve ideological and political work under the  conditions of the development of the socialist market economy;  ensure that at any time and under any condition, the Army  voluntarily maintains a high degree of political and ideological  conformity with the CPC Central Committee; and maintain the  Army's high degree of stability and unity. Based on the demands  of military strategy in the new period, we must upgrade combat  ability under modern conditions -- especially high-tech  conditions; continue to deepen reform of military training,  grasp technical and tactical training, and ceaselessly improve  coordinated combat capability, quick response capability,  electronic warfare capability, combat survival in the  wilderness, and comprehensive logistic ability. We must adapt  to the new situation the socialist market economy, continuously  strengthen the building and reform of logistics, vigorously  develop farm and sideline production, and diligently improve the  Army's material and cultural conditions. It is necessary to  expedite the development of science and technology for national  defense. Management of Army units, educational reform in  military academies, and logistic building must make new headway  in the new year. To conclude, under the main theme of  implementing the military strategy for the new period, our  Army's various tasks should make great achievements.    The goals have now been fixed, the principles have now been  set, and the crucial work now is to grasp implementation. Not  to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all, and not to grasp solidly  is also not to grasp at all. Whether the decisions of the CPC  Central Committee and the Central Military Commission can be  enforced, whether the military strategy for the new period can  be carried out, and whether reform and building of the Army can  scale new heights, all depends on implementation. Emancipating  the minds and seeking truth from facts is the quintessence of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, as well as the precondition and crux  for us to grasp work well. We must always observe this  ideological line, proceed from reality when doing every task,  straighten out the guiding thoughts for our work, and examine  the very work by the criterion of judging whether it is  conducive to increasing the Army's combat ability; and we must  really be able to be responsible to the party, the people, and  the long-term building of the Army. Grasping implementation is  an arduous task, which requires strong revolutionary ambition  and a sense of responsibility. Our cadres at various levels  must always think of the undertakings of the party and the  people; discharge their duties honestly; be responsible, work  hard and not be upset by criticism; and make selfless  contributions. They must run the Army strictly, set strict  demands, carry out strict training, and practice strict  management. They must establish honest and pragmatic leadership  work styles, do practical things, speak the truth, report the  actual situation, resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and  superficial style, always view the grass-roots level and build  the foundation as the core of work. They must voluntarily serve  the grass-roots levels, and really be able to meet the demand  which has recently been raised repeatedly by Chairman Jiang of  the Central Military Commission: "Spend more time on learning,  spend less time on social intercourse, do more research and  investigation, be less subjective do more practical things, and  speak less empty words."    The new century is walking towards us. We must, under the  leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission of which Comrade Jiang Zemin is the core, work  together with one heart, struggle arduously, clear the way to  forge ahead, successfully fulfill the glorious duties given to  the Army by the party and the people, and usher in a bright  future with new victories.</p>

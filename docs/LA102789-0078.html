			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGE OF FUNDS PLAGUES EFFORTS FOR WAR MONUMENT  </P> <P> Four months after it achieved a compromise with Los Angeles officials, a group  of Korean War veterans says its plans to build a monument in a San Pedro city  park are at least one year behind schedule, and its fund raising has suffered.  </P> <P> And to compound the veterans' problems, backers of a congressionally approved  national memorial to be built on the Mall in Washington, D.C., have made a  major fund-raising push in Los Angeles, where they raised $25,000 at a cocktail  party in Koreatown last month.  </P> <P> The party -- billed as a "commemoration of the victory in Seoul" -- honored the  chairman of the Washington memorial committee, retired U.S. Army Gen. Richard  G. Stilwell, who in August came to Los Angeles to promote the D.C. memorial  effort.  </P> <P> The Stilwell fete enjoyed broad support in Los Angeles' Korean community. Its  invitation carried a list of backers that included more than 80 Korean  community leaders -- from pastors to businessmen to an Olympic gold medalist --  and more than 30 Korean organizations.  </P> <P> By contrast, the backers of the San Pedro memorial have not conducted any  fund-raisers in Koreatown and have tied themselves to just one group, the  Korean Veterans Assn. They say they have been so caught up in trying to meet  city requirements for approval that there is little time to raise money.  </P> <P> "It's difficult," said Jack Stites, executive director of the International  Korean War Memorial Committee, the group that is backing the San Pedro  monument. "(For) the national monument, they have their location; the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers is doing all their engineering. The only thing they have to  spend any time on is fund raising. That's a pretty nice position to be in."  </P> <P> The $4-million San Pedro memorial is a private effort, proposed by the Chosin  Few, a nationwide organization of mostly Marine Corps veterans whose members  survived the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. Their monument is intended to  honor veterans from all 22 nations that joined the Allied forces in Korea.  </P> <P> The Washington memorial, which will honor U.S. veterans, will depict 38  combat-equipped soldiers walking in double file toward an American flag. It  will be set in Ash Woods, a grove of trees across the reflecting pool from the  Vietnam Veterans Memorial. So far, $4 million of the necessary $7.5 million has  been raised for the national memorial, said Ed Borcherdt,a California  fund-raiser for the project.  </P> <P> The international memorial is to be built at San Pedro's Angels Gate Park on a  bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Los Angeles Harbor. The park, which was  once a military base, also houses the Korean Friendship Bell, a gift to Los  Angeles from the South Korean government.  </P> <P> Initially, the veterans sought to erect their monument next to the bell -- a  site that Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley offered them in 1986. But that plan ran  into trouble when San Pedro residents complained that the centerpiece of the  monument -- a larger-than-life-size sculpture that depicts a battle scene --  would destroy the bell's peaceful setting.  </P> <P> After a protracted series of hearings, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs  Commission -- the first of four city and state agencies that must approve the  monument -- sided with the residents but gave the veterans preliminary approval  to build the monument elsewhere in the park.  </P> <P> The switch in sites has sent the veterans, who had spent more than $70,000 on  engineering studies for the monument, back to the drawing boards. "We've  started at ground zero," said Stites. "Everything we did on the other site,  with the exception of our aerial survey," is unusable in the new location.  </P> <P> The veterans at first had hoped to begin construction this past July and  complete the monument by November, 1990. They now say construction will begin  in April and conclude by November, 1991.  </P> <P> But officials at two city departments -- Cultural Affairs and Recreation and  Parks -- say those estimates may be optimistic, and that it may take another  year just for the veterans to get all the necessary approvals, including OKs  from the state Coastal Commission and the state Office of Historic  Preservation.  </P> <P> According to Stites, the delays and lack of final approvals have made some  potential contributors leery about giving money to the San Pedro project. "In  many cases they're sitting back, waiting to ensure that we have all our  approvals before making a contribution," he said.  </P> <P> Thus far, Stites said, his group has raised $1 million in cash and pledges,  although he would not give a breakdown.  </P> <P> Stites said he is not sure if the well-organized Washington effort -- which has  included full-page advertisements in the New York Times and several mentions in  the syndicated Dear Abby column -- will hurt his group's fund raising, either  in Los Angeles or the rest of the country.  </P> <P> But in an interview several months ago, he was bitter at the Washington  committee's decision to target Los Angeles' Korean community, saying it had  caused confusion and would harm the San Pedro effort.  </P> <P> "It was frankly assumed by those of us in leadership on this one that since we  were making a point not to go into the Washington area Korean community, we  felt they would probably respect that and do the same here," Stites said in  August.  </P> <P> Some Korean community leaders, meanwhile, say the backers of the national  memorial have made a persuasive case that their project, because it has the  imprimatur of the U.S. government, is more prestigious than the San Pedro  memorial and thus more deserving of financial support.  </P> <P> In an interview during his August trip to Los Angeles, Stilwell put it this  way: "The law says that we are preeminent. The Congress of the United States  has said there will be one memorial in the nation's capital. . . . Any other  memorial that's a private venture has difficulty making the same claim."  </P> <P> That argument received an added boost last week when, on a visit to the United  States, Korean President Roh Tae Woo joined Stilwell for a tour of the site for  the national monument. Although Roh also made a stop in Los Angeles, he did not  tour the San Pedro site.  </P> <P> Yohngsohk Choe, secretary general of the Korean Federation, an umbrella group  that represents a number of Los Angeles Korean organizations, said members of  the local Korean community would support both memorials "in spirit," though he  would not vouch for how the San Pedro memorial would do in fund raising.  </P></p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Arts: Long live the Heimat saga - Television So it is over. What are we to do now on Saturday nights? We have seen Hermann walking back down that long country road - bringing to mind the old Start-Rite ad, even though the trees were missing - towards his home village. His three vows have all been broken. He said he would never return to Schabbach. He said that after his family's cruel destruction of his ecstatic boyhood affair with Klarchen he would never love another woman. And he vowed that his only love would be music. Now he has returned to Schabbach. He has admitted his love for Clarissa. And although he has established himself as a composer and a relatively rich man (perhaps from film scores and jingles, it is one of the practical details which never became entirely clear) his future could lie anywhere. More to the point, music is not his only love: people and places have exerted their power over him and the ideals of the young man who set out so long ago, as it now seems, have been re-forged on the anvil of life, in the heat of experience. For 13 weeks we have been watching that anvil and feeling the heat. The Second Heimat: A New Generation was a sequel to Edgar Reitz's extraordinary and hugely successful Heimat. The first series told the story of a whole generation of Germans, from the first world war to the 1980s. Set in a village in the Hunsruck, it had a feeling for its period, a sense of place, and a cast of vividly realised characters which gave the serial much of the power of a soap opera. Yet its ambitions went way beyond those of any soap: its themes ranged from social history to technological development; from ambivalent attitudes towards Nazism to the meaning of patriotism and attachment to landscape. It was one of the most powerful and impressive works ever shown on television. That first series occupied around 16 hours. The second, with 13 episodes of two hours each, lasts 26 hours and every minute of both series was - astoundingly - written, directed and produced by Reitz. You might conceivably conclude that the first work was some sort of anomaly. With the second, which is in certain ways even better than the first, Reitz has proved beyond question that he has a huge talent. Furthermore if it is not unique, he has so far proved uniquely capable of getting the backing to put his work on the screen for these remarkable periods of time, enabling him to use drama to explore modern life in a way that has scarcely been attempted by anyone else. The only British television dramatist who has tried anything vaguely similar is Frederic Raphael (The Glittering Prizes, After The War) and even Raphael's keenest fans could not pretend that his series had the same scope. Reitz's breadth of vision is Tolstoyan, and future generations will surely look to Heimat 1 &amp; 2 as a key work of the late 20th century. We are told that 'heimat' means much more than homeland: Reitz has said it is 'the distant and yet familiar world in which memories and their images in the mind's eye are one'. As the 13 episodes of The Second Heimat: A New Generation have flowed past, the importance of both parts of that unwieldy title have become increasingly apparent. This new series has been deeply concerned with the new Germany: the country where large businessmen drive large Mercedes, and bourgeois flat hunters queue dutifully for a rare though expensive vacant flat in Munich (illustrated with one of Reitz's typically striking images: an endless helix of clients, turning and turning up a staircase). That is the new homeland. But the series has been even more concerned with the 'new generation': the young Germans whose parents were either Nazis ('My father was a pilot; helped bomb Guernica; got a medal for it; wore it next to his heart . . .') or, nearly as bad in the eyes of the new generation, failed to prevent Nazism. Given that this appalling double bind is not something that British viewers have had to live with, it is amazing how universal has been the appeal of the series. It began in 1960 with Hermann Simon, played with overwhelming charm by Henry Arnold, arriving from the country to study music at the academy in Munich. It ended in 1970 with Hermann pursuing Clarissa across Europe, to spend the night, finally, in her arms - not, characteristically for these two, in bed, but on the floor of a small Amsterdam hotel. There was a dreadful moment when it seemed that Reitz was about to have them gaze into one another's eyes, swear undying love, and wander hand in hand into the sunset across some canal bridge. Having been so compellingly truthful for 25 hours about the ambivalence of modern sexual relations in general and those of Hermann and Clarissa in particular; having brought the character of Clarissa, played with such power and poignancy by Salome Kammer, through marriage to her cello (Reitz cast a genuine cellist in the role which paid tremendous dividends, then, by all accounts, fell in love with her and now lives with her) to partnership with Volker and a child, and finally abandonment of the cello in favour of passionate adherence to feminism - after all that it would have been appallingly cowardly to opt for a Barbara Cartland finale. But of course Reitz did not. Such sentimentality would have been wholly uncharacteristic. Although Reitz has always conveyed his story by way of a personal odyssey (13 actually since each episode has concentrated on a different character, though Hermann, Clarissa, Juan, Schnusschen and so on have remained central) part of his purpose has been to chart the change in moral attitudes during our lives and in this he has been impressively, sometimes chillingly, honest. From the early sixties and the tendency of students to quote Spinoza while playing the Beatles, via the era of sex, drugs and rock and roll, to 'les evenements' when everyone had to debate the ideology of every action, then to the violence typified by the Baader Meinhof gang, Reitz has catalogued the mores of the decade. In contrast to the embarrassment with such matters on British television, he has been particularly successful at dealing with sex. During the episode when Hermann played Chopin while one girl rubbed ointment into the police-inflicted wound on his back, another fed him whipped cream off her finger, and a third merely gazed up at him in adoration, sexuality hung in the air like incense in a cathedral. Yet there was not a thing that Sexfinder General Lord Rees-Mogg could have put his finger on. In another episode where Hermann and Schnusschen made love while baby-sitting the sexual atmosphere was jokey, delightful and matter-of-fact in a way that is impossible to imagine in a British television drama. It really was, in that over used phrase, true to life, as was so much of this huge work. Yet The Second Heimat was no documentary. The reason why Saturday nights will seem so empty now is that, like every great creator of fiction, Reitz created a wholly convincing world that we could opt into. For 13 weeks we have lived with Hermann and Rob, Helga and Stefan, the tragic Reinhard, and even little Lulu, Hermann's daughter who ended up with a definite character of her own. Reitz's genius is not that he has recreated so accurately some of the key social and ethical landmarks of our lives, but that he has done so as the background to a gripping story about people who have sometimes seemed more real than our own friends. Whenever Reitz wants to take Hermann and Clarissa, Elisabeth and Trixi on into the 1970s it cannot be too soon.</p>

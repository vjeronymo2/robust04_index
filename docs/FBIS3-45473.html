So far, there are 29 cities and 889 towns in the province's  100,000 sq km landspace, concentrated in the southern and  northern sectors.    For example, Wenling County has set up 21 towns, ranking  first in the province. These towns, taking advantage of  neighboring on Wenzhou, which was a pioneer in introducing the  market economy, have shifted into the specialized ones involving  the industries of clothing and household electric appliance.    It is also reported that the province has injected an  average  of 10 billion yuan annually to improve the infrastructure of  these towns.    Experts attribute the increase in the number of cities and  towns to the brisk growth of township enterprises there.    So far, six million farmers have flocked to find employment  in over 500,000 township enterprises.    For example, in Shangyu city, a former county town, the  output value from township enterprises accounts for four-fifths  of the industrial output total, far surpassing that of  agriculture. And as a result, it was promoted to a city in 1992.    Meanwhile, the province boasts more than 4,300 flourishing  commodities markets, which are briskly promoting the industries  of finance, communications and services.    Among them, Yiwu is the most outstanding. A poor county ten  years ago, it has poured hundreds of millions of yuan into  infrastructure projects, like an airport, railway station and  power facility, greatly upgrading the investment environment.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Cut in Spanish money rate helps lift Iberian sectors IBERIAN markets were lifted by the Spanish rate cut and news that Portugal plans to scrap its withholding tax for non-residents, as most European core bond markets put on a lacklustre performance. The Spanish central bank cut its key money rate by  1/2 point to 9.5 per cent. This pushed the December bond future on the Spanish futures exchange up 0.51 point to 101.91. After Wednesday's rally, the Portuguese 10-year benchmark jumped another point to yield 9.03 per cent, down 42 basis points in the last two days. Traders reported heavy foreign buying of Portuguese bonds following the tax news and while some felt the rally had gone far enough, others said it could well go further. UK gilts traded in a jagged pattern, falling at the open, recovering during the day and closing lower. The long gilt contract eased  15/32 to 113. The erratic trading pattern appeared to reflect investors' uncertainty over recent inflation and economic data. 'There is mild bearishness, but no outright conviction,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. However, the near-term bias was still downwards, he said. The Bank of England is set today to announce the next gilts auction and most participants expect a new five-year benchmark. Some said it may be smaller than the recent Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.25bn issues, given that the Treasury is well ahead of its funding schedule. But others said a new 1999 benchmark might require substantial liquidity. FRENCH bonds slipped after the central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at its latest open-market operation. Nevertheless, rate-cut hopes remain alive. 'They wouldn't let call money ease like this if it wasn't going to happen near-term,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist with Midland Global Markets. Call money trades at 7 per cent, the lowest it has been in seven years. French easing is expected to be kicked off by a drop in the German repo rate. Once the easing process resumes, Ms Owens Thomsen expects to see funds shifting back into shorter maturities, causing French and German yield curves to steepen and pushing their 10-year yields back above 6 per cent. BELGIAN bonds jumped on foreign buying spurred by hopes for near-term easing. The 10-year yield premium over bunds narrowed to 124 basis points from 131. GERMAN bonds ended little changed, with the December Bund future closing at 99.97 down 0.05 point on the day. As French and Belgian francs came under increased pressure traders reported some safe-haven buying of bunds, but flows were modest. GOOD news on inflation sent US Treasury prices soaring at the long end of the bond market yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/8 at 105 17/32 , yielding 5.851 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/32 , to yield 3.774 per cent. Buyers moved into the market as soon as the Labor department reported that its producer prices index rose 0.2 per cent in September, slightly below the 0.3 per cent analysts had been expecting. Meanwhile, the core measure of producer prices (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) was unchanged last month. The numbers underlined what the market knew - that inflation was not a threat to fixed-income investors at the moment - but the weak core PPI figure proved enough to push longer-dated prices sharply higher.</p>

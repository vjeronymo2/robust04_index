			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 24 STATES PRESS FOR PUNISHING OIL COMPANIES THAT RIG PRICES  </P> <P> Attorneys general from 24 states met Monday in an effort to pressure the  Administration to punish oil companies found to have rigged prices as a result  of the Mideast crisis.  </P> <P> The attorneys general, joined by representatives from 12 other states, compared  notes on state price-gouging antitrust legislation and the sharp jump in oil  prices that occurred after Iraq invaded Kuwait this month and oil from the two  countries was embargoed.  </P> <P> North Carolina Atty. Gen. Lacy H. Thornburg urged the federal government to  study the entire oil industry to determine why retail gasoline prices have  jumped 20 cents to 30 cents a gallon in many parts of the country. The oil  industry, he said, "has yet to demonstrate that a single gallon of oil has been  denied these shores."  </P> <P> President Bush last week urged oil companies to hold down costs to consumers,  and several companies temporarily complied.  </P> <P> "Our citizens are shocked," said Florida Atty. Gen. Robert Butterworth. "They  believe oil companies are gouging them."  </P> <P> Butterworth said Florida had subpoenaed 16 major oil companies to determine if  price-fixing was occurring. New York is issuing subpoenas to retail service  stations charging particularly high prices, and North Carolina has taken Exxon  to court on suspicion of retroactive pricing.  </P> <P> The attorneys general met representatives of oil and consumer groups and held  discussions with Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust  officials.  </P></p>

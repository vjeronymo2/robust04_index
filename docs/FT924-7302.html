			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Canadian mining groups in cash call TWO SMALL Canadian exploration companies have taken advantage of international excitement over a hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories by raising new equity from European investors. Aber Resources of Toronto and Vancouver-based Lytton Minerals said yesterday they have raised a total of CDollars 9.7m (USDollars 7.6m). Both deals were channelled through First Marathon Securities of Toronto, which is understood to have sold the bulk of the shares to British and French institutions. The diamond rush is one of the most frenzied in North American mining history, with companies staking claims over several thousand square miles around the Lac de Gras area, some 400m north-east of Yellowknife. A small quantity of diamonds has been found. Aber and its partners last week announced the discovery of 'micro-diamonds' in two of seven samples from one drillhole. But analysts have cautioned that evaluation of the area remains in the early stages. International investors appear to be attracted by the involvement of some of the world's biggest mining companies in the search. Kennecott, the North American subsidiary of the UK's RTZ, has a right to earn 60 per cent of Aber's interest.</p>

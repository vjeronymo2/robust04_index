			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Modern artist of the Renaissance - Patricia Morison reviews the Mantegna exhibition at the Royal Academy ANDREA Mantegna was the most famous modern artist of 15th-century Italy. Contemporaries hailed his 'Camera degli Sposi' in Mantua Castle as 'the most beautiful room in the world'. In the 'Triumphs of Caesar', Mantegna's passion for antiquity combined so powerfully with his dazzling artistic technique that Rome's victorious legions seemed once again to shake the ground with their tread. Andrea Mantegna at the Royal Academy in London until April 5(sponsored by Olivetti) is a miracle of an exhibition. Through it we rediscover an artist whose work lights a path back to the excitement and the intellectual ambitions of the early Renaissance. Many people would have said the day had gone when there could be a major exhibition devoted to one of the greatest names of the 15th-century Renaissance. And yet room after room of the Academy - painted a rather surprising damson-purple - is hung with paintings, drawings and prints either by Mantegna or his circle. Separating the former from the latter is part of the exhibition's scholarly raison d'etre, without which far fewer treasures could have been prised away from their owners. Admittedly, Mantegna made things easier by his preference, unusual before 1500, for painting on canvas. As he pointed out to a client, paintings on canvas were so convenient to transport; you simply furled them round a rod. In Padua, city of Mantegna's youth, fresco was the natural choice for grand decorative schemes. The precocious artist proved his mastery of fresco in the Ovetari chapel in the church of the Hermit Friars. Destroyed by an Allied bomb in 1944, the chapel was perhaps the most tragic artistic loss of the War. One surviving seraph appears in the exhibition. The way the seraph's white tunic clings to his well-modelled body, as if he had just stepped from a celestial bath, shows the extraordinary importance of Donatello's example for the art of Mantegna. Mantegna at Padua quickly became the darling of a group of bankers, lawyers, physicians and the bishop. However, he was wooed away by the blandishments of the duke of Mantua, the highly cultivated but, as Mantegna was to discover, not always solvent Ludovico Gonzaga. Mantegna's adopted city was damp, thanks to Lake Garda, which made fresco painting something of a battle  -one which, technically but not artistically speaking, Mantegna lost in his 'Camera degli Sposi'. Canvas proved the solution for large-scale works such as the 'Triumphs of Caesar'. Lake Garda itself inspired Mantegna's restrained and poignant 'Death of the Virgin' from the Prado, one of a number of paintings on panel which, quite exceptionally, have been loaned to this exhibition. This lovely view, half water and half sky, is so spacious and tranquil that it recalls landscapes by Giovanni Bellini, his brother-in-law. What a contrast there is between the simplicity of this painting and the obsessively detailed world of Mantegna's earlier devotional panel-paintings, the rock-strewn landscapes of the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' from the Met and 'St Jerome in the Wilderness' from the museum at Sao Paolo. What a contrast, equally, with the National Gallery's 'Agony in the Garden'. Perfectly reasonably, this great early painting has stayed in the Gallery where, if any strength remains after this demanding exhibition, you should see both it and the brilliantly-coloured altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with Saints on your way home. At the Academy, we have a fascinating opportunity to compare Giovanni Bellini and Mantegna in their treatment of another deeply affecting theme, Christ's 'Descent into Limbo'. Mantegna's interpretation (from the Barbara Piasecka Johnson collection) is shown with his drawings and engravings, and with the painting by Bellini from Bristol. Mantegna's is the more dramatic; indeed, in all of Renaissance art I doubt there is a more eloquent back view than that of Christ standing at the gates of Hell, his red robe fluttering in the infernal draught. I cannot begin to describe the other extraordinary masterpieces now gathered together. From the Louvre comes 'Pallas expelling the Vices from the Garden of Virtue', Mantegna in his late years creating the most complex allegories any humanist scholar could devise. Turn from that to contemplate Mantegna the great religious artist, above all in the Copenhagen 'Man of Sorrows with Two Angels'. This important painting is so well-preserved that it allows us to imagine how many less fortunate paintings would once have looked. If time or strength is limited, however, I would suggest starting at the end with the 'Triumphs of Caesar' from Hampton Court. Could any exhibition have a more blazing finale? Eight canvases are displayed, the whole series save for the severely damaged scene of the Gallic captives. The 'Triumphs' entered the Royal Collection in 1629 when Charles I bought them from the Gonzagas. Not for five centuries has it been possible to see the series more or less as Mantegna intended, separated only by pilasters as they were in the palace of San Sebastiano. Over the centuries restorers from Laguerre to Roger Fry have inflicted terrible wounds on this masterpiece. Mantegna's rapturous evocation of the civilised aspects of conquest, of proud cities captured and their statues carted off to grace the conqueror's home, is a wreck of its former self. Even so, the 'Triumphs' keeps its incredible beauty of design. From the first musician blasting away on his curved trumpet the procession moves to a rhythm so entrancing it may well hold you spell-bound for an hour. Not surprisingly, the 'Triumphs' will not be travelling with the show to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, where it runs from May 9 to July 12. There will be other gaps, too, but the New Yorkers will have their own compensations, such as the portrait from Berlin of the memorably stoney-faced, brooding Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan. Mantegna's paintings are not as familiar today as many by contemporaries such as Uccello, Giovanni Bellini or Piero della Francesca. Rather oddly, to my mind, there seems to be a feeling that Mantegna is a difficult artist, characterised by a streak of harshness, something discordant and even repellent. Unfortunately, this was due to contemporary gossip about the man. Mantegna was a genius who was proud, prickly, and more than a little spoilt. The duke of Mantua himself had to step in to solve his painter's quarrels with his tailor. He could even be downright vicious. There is a well-known story, rather unclear in detail, of how he hired thugs to beat up the artist who made illicit copies of his engravings, and then hounded him from Mantua with allegations of sodomy. But since when has it been necessary for a great artist also to be a noble character? However, no less a connoisseur than Sir Lawrence Gowing takes a curiously wary approach to Mantegna as an artist in his preface to the catalogue - which is beautifully written throughout and quite indispensable. For Gowing, Mantegna is a difficult artist whom he describes as ferocious, stony-hearted. 'There was no pity in Mantegna', he writes, and nothing 'heroic or idyllic in (his) evocation of the ancient world'. Well, this was not previously my view of Mantegna and is still less so, thanks to this memorable exhibition. Time and again it is the gracefulness of his figures which astounds, something especially well seen in his preparatory drawings. For all the variety of poses and human types which Mantegna delighted to paint, he never caricatures them. Roman soldiers in their fantastic armour appear as personifications of ideal male types; and yet in his later works - for example in the fascinating grisaille, 'The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele to Rome' - we marvel that he could depict men who are bald and ageing, the stuffed shirts of the Senate, and yet give them dignity and even beauty. Mantegna stands out for his extraordinary gift for individualising characters. We can still see it in the 'Triumphs' and with wonderful skill in even the most rapid sketches, for example in his Saints Andrew and Longinus. His painting of St George from the Accademia in Venice shows this passion for the living, breathing, and above all thinking man, particularly well. Here is no vacuous Christian pin-up. Instead we see a thoughtful youth reminiscent of Donatello's St George, both warriors for whom conquering a dragon seems to be only one step in a spiritual journey. As Paul Kristeller noted in his magnificent book on the artist published in 1901, 'even those of his characters who seem peaceful and happy, betray a touch of sad melancholy, as though they felt the weight of a supernatural power hanging over them.' But like so many truly great artists, no one characterisation will quite fit. Look at Mantegna's exquisitely tender engraving of the Virgin and Child, and there is no wistfulness. Instead here is the magical intimacy of a mother who is, after all, only a simple peasant who bends in a transport of tenderness over her baby. Mantegna is an artist who takes a lifetime to discover in all his variety. This exhibition will put its visitors several decades further along that path.</p>

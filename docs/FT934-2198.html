			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Prevention is better than cure  -Frank McGurty on the changing US approach to pollution control An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Why then has the US Environmental Protection Agency only recently begun to examine ways of reducing industrial pollution before it is produced? Many of the reasons can be found in a joint study released last month by the EPA and Du Pont, the chemical company. The project, which identified ways to minimise waste generated at a New Jersey chemical plant, is perhaps the best illustration to date of how the US approach to pollution control is evolving. The collaboration began in February 1991. As part of a settlement over violations at its Chamber Works plant in Deepwater NJ, Du Pont agreed to pay a fine of Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.2m). More significantly, its deal with the EPA included an undertaking to examine how to reduce wastes at the facility and to make its findings available to competing chemical producers and research organisations. Two important conclusions emerged. First, prevention is much more effective than traditional 'end-of-pipe' remedies, which usually simply transfer hazardous waste from one medium to another - say, from water to land fills. Second, pollution prevention - or 'source reduction' - can cut operating costs, improve product quality and boost profitability. When all of its recommendations have been implemented at a one-time capital cost of Dollars 6m, Du Pont expects to save about Dollars 15m a year, with a reduction of up to 73 per cent in hazardous waste from the processes selected for study. Traditionally, the EPA has favoured sticks over carrots. Its mission had centred on assuring compliance with federal regulations through a system of permits, inspections and enforcement actions. The focus was on rigid rules and equipment specifications, which are often based on outdated technical data. Amazingly, pollution generated by individual industrial sites was often neither measured nor analysed. Last spring, a study conducted by the EPA and Amoco at its oil refinery in Yorktown, Virginia, revealed that neither party knew the source of dangerous benzene emissions there. Nevertheless, the EPA had required the company to spend Dollars 41m on a system to capture benzene vapours from pools of waste water, known as separators. The real problem, the study found, was fumes escaping when oil was loaded on to barges. EPA rules, based on data compiled in 1959, did not address the loading process, and Amoco complacently accepted the agency's short-sightedness. 'The system encourages companies to put in place managers who know the regulations and how to comply with them,' says Kevin Mills, an attorney with the Environmental Defence Fund, a private non-profit making group. 'This priesthood of specialists typically acts very conservatively, in well-documented, safe ways.' Tension between regulators and the regulated is an even more formidable obstacle. Source reduction, the Du Pont study suggests, is incompatible with the antagonism that seems to flow from the EPA's traditional role as policeman. The study 'recognises that the best environmental solutions come when government establishes priorities and realistic goals, and when industry accepts the responsibility of meeting them in the most efficient way,' says Paul Tebo, Du Pont's vice-president for safety, health and environment. The EPA first compiled a list of 33 chemical processes at the plant, which produces about 650 products using 4,000 chemicals. The company was free to select 15 of them and develop its own recommendations on cutting the waste they generated. Some of the solutions which Du Pont put forward involve subtle refinements of complex procedures. In examining a process that produces nitroaromatic compounds, the assessment team initially focused on a single step. Later, it concluded that only a series of small improvements to all of the process's flow-control systems would result in substantial waste reduction. The lesson for other companies is that waste-minimisation assessments must often be expanded beyond their original scope. In many cases, only close scrutiny of the entire process can lead to effective action.</p>

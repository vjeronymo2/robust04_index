			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Dense-Pac Microsystems Inc. reported a net loss for the second quarter ended  Aug. 26 of $387,911, compared with net income of $110,190 for the same period  last year. Sales for the quarter rose 20%, to $1.8 million from $1.5 million.  </P> <P> James Turner, chairman and chief executive, said the loss was due to an  inability to ship several large orders and lower profit margins due to supplier  problems and the worldwide shortage of memory chips. There were also increased  general and administrative expenses in connection with terminated merger  discussions with another company and a settlement charge of $92,000 from a  Chapter 11 reorganization payable from 1985.  </P> <P> Dense-Pac, based in Garden Grove, manufactures semiconductors for the defense  industry.  </P></p>

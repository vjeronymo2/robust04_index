			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Somalis killed by US troops US TROOPS in Somalia killed at least nine people during rioting in the Somali capital of Mogadishu yesterday by supporters of warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. The outbreak of anti-US rioting may well mark the point at which things start to go badly wrong for America's precedent-setting humanitarian intervention. In the view of a rising number of Somalis, the US presence is rapidly changing from an army of liberation into a force of occupation. As in Lebanon in the early 1980s the US has inevitably come to be seen as a partial player in the labyrinthine and vicious world of Somalia's rival clan-based militias. Washington's authority and its willingness to use greater force against armed gangs and bandits is being severely tested by the armed factions. The nine rioters shot dead were among thousands of protesters who erected barricades of burning car tyres in the city and tried to storm the US and French embassies. The demonstrators - loyal to Gen Aideed, Somalia most powerful warlord  - who two months ago thronged the streets to welcome US marines yesterday chanted 'Go Home Americans' and 'Down with America'. Angered about what they believe is US support for a rival warlord, the protesters fought running battles with foreign troops. The latest violence erupted after the clan-based militia led by Gen Mohamed Siad Hersi 'Morgan,' the son-in-law of former dictator Gen Mohamed Siad Barre, seized part of the southern port city of Kismayo from an ally of Gen Aideed. Belgian and US troops stood by amid the clan fighting which claimed at least 11 lives and left the city destabilised. Despite a US ultimatum accusing Gen Morgan of criminal activities and warning him to evacuate his forces from the city by midnight tonight, Gen Aideed went on radio accusing the US of bias towards Gen Morgan. 'We don't want a jihad (holy war) but events in the last few days are very disturbing,' he said, threatening action unless the US stopped supporting Gen Morgan. The fighting in Kismayo, and inaction by the foreign forces, is a serious blow to the operation. It has proved that the warlords remain highly armed, powerful and determined to carry on with their conflict. It has also exposed the lack of will among the US-led force to use their superior firepower. Memories of Beirut, where US marines had to beat an inglorious retreat in 1983 after a suicide bomber killed 242 troops, and of Vietnam continue to cast a dark cloud over the US military intervention. US generals are anxious not to take risks that might result in hefty casualties. Political observers, however, say it was inevitable the US would get sucked into the scheming and complex world of Somali politics it does not understand.</p>

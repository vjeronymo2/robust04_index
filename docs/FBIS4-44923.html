			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yusuf al-Sharif: "Islam and the National </F> Dialogue"]    [Text] At the present time, Islam, Islamic societies, and  organizations for the propagation of Islam in general are facing  various sorts of crude attacks and clear controversy over their  motives, tendencies, allegiances, methods, and goals. The  secularists in Egypt, for example, who reject the idea of a  religious state, generalize: They do not differentiate between  the Islamic groups that strive in God's path, with wisdom,  spiritual counsel, conviction, and good example, and other  groups that attack society for blasphemy and of pre-Islamic  apostasy. [They fail to distinguish the danger of those] who  call for individual interpretation of religion and the right to  monopolize the propagation of Islam -- those who rush to  establish Islamic law by violent means and even terrorism!    Some secularists think there is an unwritten agreement  between these groups--those who call for Islamic law by  democratic and legitimate means and others who employ violence  and terror. [They think] that each of the two groups is backing  the other, and that whichever succeeds in attaining power first  will necessarily and immediately proclaim the unification of the  Islamic groups. All differences and conflicts between them would  then disappear. The secularists who hold this opinion offer as  proof their claim that various violent Islamic groups grew out  of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded by the late Shaykh Hasan  al-Banna in the 1940s. They even accuse the Muslim Brotherhood  of having hatched and nurtured persons who are easy for the  violent Islamic groups to recruit.    There is a regrettable meeting of minds between the  secularists and the political-Islam groups who pursue democracy  or violence in their call for social change. They both scorn  the role of al-Azhar and its esteemed scholars, who have  understood the sciences of religion through study and the  attainment of qualifications, who pursue the propagation of the  faith, religious counseling, and reasoning. The secularists for  their part reject al-Azhar and its scholars whenever they try to  correct mistaken ideas, in their preaching, writing, and  intellectual achievements, as recently happened in the case of  the television series ["The Family"] that tried to portray the  phenomenon of terrorism without any familiarity with Islamic  thinking or with the principles of worship and the  proportionalities of reward and punishment for one's deeds. This  sparked a dispute and all kinds of excesses by the secularists  authors in response to the statement issued by His Excellency  the Shaykh of al-Azhar in "The Family" series. One author, Wahid  Hamid, even denied that Islam provides any clear pronouncement  or allusion about what awaits a deceased person, who had been a  heretic in this life, in terms of judgement and punishment in  the grave. And there was the statement issued by the Supreme  Council on Islamic Affairs, which defended the right of  religious scholars and their role in combatting the excesses and  errors in views of Islam, and in monitoring the literary and  artistic works that exploit the climate of democratic freedoms,  and distort Islam, the latest of the divinely revealed  religions, which is valid and applicable at any time and in any  place.    Meanwhile, the general message of the political-Islam groups  is that they reject al-Azhar and the clerics of the Islamic  Council, the Dar al-Ifta' [office of the mufti], and the society  of preachers and those of the Ministry of Awqaf, claiming that  they represent or express government Islam, and justify or are  silent regarding government abuses. Islam, they say, does not  recognize a clerical class; it is thus the right of every Muslim  to deduce his own interpretation of the faith in his own best  interests and the interests of other Muslims, even should that  lead them to prey on society! It is amazing that a writer such  as Tharwat Abazah, the vice-president of the Consultative  Council, in an article printed in AL-AHRAM newspaper last week,  entitled "Art is Integrity," accused factions of the national  left--Nasirites and communists--of being, in his words,  "infidels." What can the violent and extremist groups, who  accuse society of blasphemy and apostasy, do with them, after  seeing a secularist declare them to be infidels, except  assassinate them, in accordance with the sentence that they  claim is their right? When a great Islamic thinker such as Fahmi  Huwaydi resisted this dangerous distortion of Islam, and called  for Muslims to unite their visions and efforts to confront the  dangers facing the Islamic nation, we received, at AL-SHARQ's  Cairo office, dozens of telephone calls from people demanding  that we supply them with the last two articles AL-SHARQ printed  after their publication in other newspapers had been prevented!    Why all this distortion, clamor, and conflict over Islam  now among Muslims in Egypt, secularists, fundamentalists,  traditionalists, and moderates? Why did this not happen during  the monarchial era, or at the peak of the July Revolution and  the leadership of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Perhaps because, in the  days of the monarchy, the various classes and factions of the  people had joined the political parties that expressed their  aspirations and interests, and because the central national  issue was embodied in the concept and the practices of all the  popular forces on the achievement of independence and liberation  from colonialism. Even the Muslim Brotherhood, which represented  the Islamic political opposition to the existing regime, did not  resort to accusing society of blasphemy and ignorance. They  occupied themslves with Islamic education, and its mass  expansion throughout Egypt, in the hopes of establishing an  Islamic state through democratic means.    Thus the Muslim Brotherhood fought side by side with the  Egyptian army in the Palestine war, and cooperated with the  secret Free Officers organization in launching a war of nerves  against the British occupation all along the Suez Canal. This  was despite the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood undertook,  after the martyrdom of Shaykh Hasan al-Banna, and the leadership  of Counselor Hasan al-Hudaybi, to announce its hostility toward  the July Revolution, to the point of trying to assassinate Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir and overthrow the regime by force in 1954 and  1965. The revolution's national achievements and development  projects surpassed the other parties in terms of establishing  foundations of social justice; it thus pulled the rug out from  under their feet, and crushed their former members' mass role,  influence, and skirting of the revolution.    In Islamic terms, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was from the very  beginning keen on the Islamic sphere, its thinking and strategic  inclinations, side by side with the Arab, African, and  nonaligned spheres. He extended his hand to support and aid the  liberation of Islamic peoples from colonialism and backwardness.  In its time, the Islamic renewal saw the rise of the Supreme  Council on Islamic Affairs, which revived the Islamic heritage  and printed thousands of Islamic publications and books. It had  a plan to develop al-Azhar to graduate thousands of qualified  doctors, engineers, and religious scholars to undertake the  propagation of Islam throughout the world, in the languages of  all its peoples. It established Holy Koran Radio.    We therefore believe that the early beginnings of Islamic  extremism in Egypt were attributable to Anwar al-Sadat, may he  rest in peace. He was the first to use them, in a Machiavellian  fashion, to fight his Nasirite and communist enemies. It is he  who supported them with money and violent means, as his close  aides have attested. Then they turned against him and became his  deadly enemies when he visited Jerusalem and signed a separate  peace with Israel at Camp David, and he was assassinated by  Islamists, setting off a wave of terror.    The picture is different today; the details are less  distinct, in light of the government's failure to meet society's  minimum aspirations. It is true that there are great  achievements, and they keep coming, but they cannot deal with  the problems, which also keep coming, and grow ever more  serious. In the absence of a national plan, and frustrations on  the Arab scene, the climate is ripe for the fragmentation of  intellectual and ideological unity into scattered, conflicting,  and struggling pieces. Meanwhile, political parties are merely  skeletons, or just newspapers or words, incapable of influencing  the government or the masses.    Thus we, and the people of Egypt, rely on the glimmer of  hope  emitted by the anticipated national dialogue, which may limit,  or solve, the problems of intellectual poverty in general, and  the resulting distortion of Islam in particular. Perhaps the  first conditions for success and credibility of the national  dialogue lie in the trust and participation of every person who  has a vision for Egypt's change for the better, individually or  collectively, without disqualifying any, according to the  standard of democracy and political and popular balance.</p>

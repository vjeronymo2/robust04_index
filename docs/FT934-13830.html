			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Growth seen in London economy LONDON'S ECONOMY was yesterday given a qualified seal of approval by the London Chamber of Commerce, which reported a slow improvement in business but continued job losses. In the chamber's third-quarter survey of member companies, both manufacturing and service sectors reported improved domestic activity with more businesses expecting profits to rise in the months ahead than at any time in the past 3 1/2 years. Exports weakened, however, particularly among manufacturing companies with 33 per cent of them reporting a drop in export orders against 29 per cent reporting an increase. On balance, companies expected to increase investment over the next 12 months. Among manufacturers, 27 per cent said they planned to revise upwards their investment plans against 7 per cent predicting a downwards revision. Among service-sector companies 24 per cent forecast higher investment against 4 per cent predicting a fall. Demands for government help for manufacturing were stepped up yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers' Federation, Tim Burt writes. Both organisations called for new policies to encourage investment in industry, claiming such moves were vital if companies were to raise finance for expansion. The CBI said at a manufacturing seminar in Birmingham attended by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, that the government should replace the Business Expansion Scheme with a new system to raise 'seedbed finance'. However, Mr Sainsbury said that industry did not want to see government intervention beyond the pursuit of a low-inflation strategy for growth.</p>

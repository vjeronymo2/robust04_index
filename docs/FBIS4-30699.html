			<p>CSO     [Text] The Petrochemical Industry Association (Chairman  Hajime Murata) revealed on 16 June that Taiwan has levied an  antidumping tariff on polypropylene (PP) resin made by Japan and  South Korea. According to the association, a maximum 68.71  percent tariff has been superimposed on the regular import  tariff (2.5 percent) for Japanese products. It is the first time  that Japanese resin has become the target of an antidumping  tariff.    In the fall of 1992, a complaint was received from a  Taiwanese PP manufacturer, Taiwan Polypropylene (Taipei), that  it suffered a disadvantage because both Japanese and South  Korean manufacturers imported PP at an unreasonably low price,  and Taiwan authorities carried out an investigation starting in  June 1993. While Japanese manufacturers submitted data, they  counterargued in a public hearing that "they are importing  product items that cannot be manufactured in Taiwan," but it was  not accepted.    The subject of the tariff is the PP homopolymer type used  mainly for sundries. An antidumping tariff of 5.16 to 68.71  percent for each manufacturer has been imposed according to the  difference between domestic shipment price in Japan and export  price to Taiwan. The same tariffs will be applied even in cases  where manufacturers who have not previously exported to Taiwan  newly export.    The amount of raw material propylene production is slight in  Taiwan, the amount of PP production is about 220,000 tons  (1993), and they depend on imports for about the same amount  (little over 190,000 tons, 1993). Exports from Japan were 45,000  tons of this (1993).    Regarding the effect of the antidumping tariff, the  Petrochemical Industry Association explains that, "since  necessary items will probably be imported in the future also, it  will not be zero. Since the export amount for each individual  manufacturer is small, it will not be a problem."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: German markets merger scaled back PLANS for a full-scale merger of the German derivatives market with the market for German equities and fixed interest securities have been scaled back, it emerged yesterday. Only last week the Deutsche Borse - the German stock exchange - announced far-reaching plans for a fusion with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), Germany's screen-based futures and options market. This was heralded as a step towards the full integration of the German securities markets. Following a meeting of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Borse yesterday, the scope of the planned merger has been curtailed, casting doubt on the pace of reform of the German securities markets following the creation of the Deutsche Borse at the beginning of the current year. The meeting decided yesterday that fusion between the legal bodies which own the Frankfurt Stock Exchange - by far the largest of the eight stock exchanges in Germany - and the DTB was to be examined. Further co-operation between the two entities will be limited to administrative matters and will not extend to a full-scale fusion of dealing and settlement technologies. This represents an about-turn from last week's statement, which presented the merger of the two bodies as a fait accompli. The supervisory board said then that the integration of the equities and fixed interest markets with the derivatives market was essential to improve the speed and reliability of transactions on the German markets, to cut costs and enhance the competitiveness of Germany compared with other financial markets. Yesterday's toned-down statement from the Deutsche Borse points to tensions with the DTB over the pace of future integration. When the Deutsche Borse was created at the beginning of the year, it said that merger of the DTB's settlement and trading technologies with those for equities and fixed interest would be a priority. It now seems that concrete measures in this area will not be discussed until next year. The Deutsche Borse has considered enhancing the Ibis service, an electronic dealing system for a limited number of German shares and fixed interest securities that was introduced in April 1991. This has won a significant share of turnover in leading German securities, but is seen as being in need of updating - perhaps with the help of technology developed for the DTB for the derivatives market. But co-operation between the Deutsche Borse and the DTB looks likely to be limited to certain administrative functions. There will be, for example, a joint press office and a joint office to oversee market supervision.</p>

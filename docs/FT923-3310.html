			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: School ties that fail to bind - Inky dictators and youthful necrophiliacs OLD SCHOOL TIES by Tim Devlin and Hywel Williams Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.99, 472 pages PREP SCHOOL: AN ANTHOLOGY compiled by Michael Gilbert John Murray Pounds 17.95, 228 pages THE TROUBLE with schools was that they were full of people who were immature, ignorant and, sometimes, psychopaths. That was just the teachers. The pupils were much worse. 'Not all headmasters were sadists,' was the best that could be said about the inky dictators at the top of these festering institutions. Have things improved over the years? More or less, according to the findings of Tim Devlin and Hywel Williams, who had the bright idea of asking prominent people about their schooldays. Around 1,600 of them did their homework and sent back their questionnaires. Some, unfortunately, were a great deal less interesting than others. The difference between a filled-in form and a well-written book seems to have escaped the authors. Old School Ties is bitty and, on the whole, a dull read. The most banal pieces of information are plonked down on the page, isolated amid acres of white space. But a few nuggets sparkle through the rubble. Comedian Roy Hudd had to write his own prayer and read it out at assembly. Actress Angela Pleasance went to a school of which the assistant head was Jomo Kenyatta's first wife, Edna. Rupert Allason MP, alias espionage expert Nigel West, went to a Catholic school where one of the resident monks was a former spy. The most interesting section consists of memories of people who didn't go to school, or not for any length of time. That might well say something about educational establishments in general, but it is not worth ploughing through 472 pages to find out. Prep School, by contrast, is a real book. It helps that Michael Gilbert, as well as being himself a better student of English than Devlin and Williams, has taken his quotations from already-published writings. He propounds the theory about not all headmasters being sadists, although to some extent this flies in the face of the evidence he has collected. One head walloped his boys so hard with a massive ruler that he broke a finger - not, alas, his own. Another, known as Beetle, not only beat a pre-teen fiercely enough to draw blood but also had the nerve to charge the parents the enormous (for 1914) sum of ten shillings for the birch he used. At Cyril Connolly's school, 'The death rate was low,' which counts as high praise. It is well known that the public schools have given our teenagers a tough time over the centuries; it is more startling to appreciate that the preparatory schools have handed out much the same treatment to the seven-to-12 bracket. Indeed, it is amazing that any of the lads actually stayed on school premises - and not all of them did. One well-known journalist did a bunk, having received a perfectly serious death threat from a youthful necrophiliac. Fortunately, Prep School provides us today with more entertainment than most of its contributors seem to have enjoyed at the time. Their short extracts, grouped together under headings such as 'Matrons' and 'Great Men in Short Trousers,' make for more than a catalogue of horrors. There are some triumphs: conductor Malcolm Sargent could skive off games by dislocating his shoulder at will and actor Peter Finch could vomit to order. Giles Romilly, whose 16-year-old brother Esmond started the subversive magazine Out of Bounds, wrote ribald verses about a master handicapped by the name of Handicap. Arriving at my own prep school some 20 years after singer George Melly, the youngest of the writers quoted in the book, had left his, I found the atmosphere far less ferocious. The boys were nicer, for a start; my favourite teacher had to marry the matron, but no one wrote a single ribald rhyme about him.</p>

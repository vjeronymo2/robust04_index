			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Observer: Over the hill When a troubled construction company makes its personnel director redundant, one might well think that the only people left on the premises are the bailiffs. But Higgs &amp; Hill stresses that Stephen Schneider, who has resigned as a director, had been so successful in reducing the company's workforce by a half over the past three years that he had worked himself out of a job. In future the P45s will be issued by a more lowly official without a seat on the Higgs &amp; Hill board. Even so, it suggests a topsy-turvy sense of priorities in a labour-intensive business.</p>

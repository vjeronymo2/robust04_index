			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga, 3 Mar -- In a note passed to the Latvian  Foreign Ministry the Russian Embassy today expressed serious  concern over articles in a number of Latvian newspapers.    For several months the newspapers PAVALSTNIEKS and ATMODA  have been printing the names of Russian servicemen, members of  their families, and well-known personalities in Latvia. Their  addresses, telephone numbers, and information of a personal  nature are being published. Included in the lists were Vladimir  Steshenko, deputy editor of the Russian-language newspaper  SM-SEGODNYA; Fedor Shinkarenko, hero of the Soviet Union who  liberated Latvia from fascism; Retired General Ivan Kibal, also  a hero of the Soviet Union, and many others. These lists are  being published under the caption "Our Land Is Groaning Under  Their Boots."    The Russian Embassy note stresses that the lists are  dominated by Russian citizens whose personal data is being given  wide publicity without their knowledge or consent. The  information is being published under provocative headlines. The  safety of these people is being jeopardized. The embassy  considers that such actions by certain Latvian periodicals could  lead to unwelcome incidents with unforeseeable consequences. In  this event, the note says, the Latvian authorities will have to  bear the entire blame. The Russian Federation Embassy expressed  the hope that the authorities would take the necessary measures  to prevent such a development of events, which could harm  Russian-Latvian relations.</p>

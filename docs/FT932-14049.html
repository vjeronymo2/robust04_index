			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Trade News: Beijing to develop shopping complex BEIJING is to build a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 659m) shopping and commercial complex only a few hundred metres from the compound where China's communist leadership lives in seclusion, symbolising the growing clout of the urban Chinese consumer. Under a Beijing municipality plan the state-controlled Hua Yuan Real Estate Company will head the redevelopment of Xidan street. Construction is expected to start on the 20 hectare site in June. The English-language China Daily reported yesterday that foreign companies, including Jing An Investment of Hong Kong, would participate in the project which involves building a 585,000 square metre complex just north of Chang An boulevard, Beijing's main thoroughfare. Foreign investors are rushing into China's consumer market enticed by the lure of millions of cash-rich and product-starved consumers as Chinese living standards continue to rise. According to a recent survey by the management consultants McKinsey, China has already outstripped many other Asian consumer markets. 'With China's huge population even a small overall percentage of high-income consumers (with Dollars 1,000 plus of officially reported income) adds up to a real consumer market of some 60m people, a reservoir of wealth equivalent to all of Thailand and greater than all of Malaysia,' said the report. The Xidan street project, to be known as Xixi, will include six high-rise buildings, two car parking towers and a number of office and apartment buildings. Mr Ren Zhiqiang, president of Hua Yuan, said the Xixi project would 'make Xidan a multi-purpose commercial centre for shopping, entertainment and sightseeing'. Hua Yuan is one of Beijing's largest property developers with assets of about Dollars 200m.</p>

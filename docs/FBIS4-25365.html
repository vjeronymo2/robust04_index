			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan's private  visit to Mexico underscores development in ties between Taiwan  and the Central American country, Deputy Secretary-General  Raymond Tai of the presidential office said Tuesday [7 June].    Lien arrived in Mexico City Sunday afternoon for a three-day  visit after concluding his official visit to El Salvador and  Guatemala.    In a regular news conference, Tai noted that Taiwan should  strengthen trade and cultural exchanges with Mexico, which forms  the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United  States and Canada. The NAFTA agreement became effective January  1.    Taiwan and Mexico suspended official ties in 1971, however,  trade ties between the two countries have been on the rise since  1989. Two-way trade totaled U.S.$700 million in 1993, with  Taiwan enjoying a surplus of U.S.$260 million. Taiwan opened an  economic and cultural office in Mexico City on May 1.    Tai pointed out that the premier made the private visit to  Mexico at the invitation of Mario Vazquez [word indistinct],  president of the Association of National Olympic Committees and  former chairman of the U.S.-based UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL  news agency.    Vazquez, a media tycoon who controls 80 publications, radio  stations, and television stations in Mexico, made a whirlwind  visit to Taipei last August and met with President Li Teng-hui  for two hours, he elaborated.    During the meeting, he said, Vazquez invited President Li to  visit Mexico. Li, however, was unable to visit that country  during his state visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica last month  due to his tight schedule, he added.    Asked whether Li will visit Mexico in future, Tai quoted the  president as saying that he is willing to visit any country for  the sake of Taiwan's interests.    Tai reiterated that Mainland China should understand that  Taiwan's cooperative ties with foreign countries aim to benefit  both sides of the Taiwan Strait rather than disrupt the  mainland's diplomatic ties with other countries.    Taiwan will continue to seek an active, positive role in the  international organizations, Tai stressed, adding the government  is obligated to promote economic and cultural ties with foreign  countries and find trade opportunities for its traders.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Bank of China status stays THE Bank of China will not become the colony's central bank after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 but will remain a commercial bank, according to a senior Chinese government official. He also questioned whether the Bank of China could, or would want to, replace Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as the colony's leading bank. Bank of China, a collection of 13 mainland banks, is the colony's second largest bank with assets in excess of HKDollars 500bn (Pounds 36bn). Chen Ziying, the deputy director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was quoted by the semi-official China News Service as saying: 'How would Bank of China replace Hongkong Bank? Bank of China will not have such a plan, will it?' Hong Kong currently has no formal central bank or monetary authority, although the colony's Exchange Fund performs many central banking functions. It is responsible for the management of foreign reserves and for conducting operations in the money markets to ensure that the Hong Kong dollar remains fixed to the US dollar at a rate of HKDollars 7.8 to the US unit.</p>

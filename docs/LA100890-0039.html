			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREATIVE INTERACTION FROM MCLAUGHLIN TRIO;  </P> <P> JAZZ: THE GUITARIST DEMONSTRATES HOW EASILY THE MUSIC CAN INCORPORATE A  COLORFUL ASSEMBLAGE OF STYLES, INFLUENCES AND ATTITUDES.  </P> <P> John McLaughlin has had so many achievements in his long career that's its hard  to imagine him finding another peak to climb. Yet his current trio -- with  Trilock Gurtu on percussion and Kai Eckhard on bass -- is producing music  easily in a class with some of his finest past accomplishments.  </P> <P> Friday night at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach in what was, regretably,  the group's only recent local appearance, McLaughlin and his associates played  a set that bristled with creative interaction.  </P> <P> The connections between the players were both intuitive and visual. Gurtu sat  on the floor, Indian drummer-style, behind a cymbal-rich collection of  instruments. His movements never seemed to stop, touching, stroking and  striking his various implements -- a mad scientist of percussion, black hair  flying, mustache bristling, eyes sparkling. On the opposite side of the stage  McLaughlin -- cooler-looking, smiling, more laid-back -- worked his acoustic  guitar, constantly reaching out to make electric eye contact with Gurtu and  Eckhard.  </P> <P> McLaughlin mixed rapid-fire, Al DiMeola-like runs with snap-crackle chording  and soaringly lyrical melody lines. Yet, as abstract as some of his lines were,  he could, on a piece like "One-Night Stand," abruptly shift gears into a series  of hard-swinging, body moving, funk/soul-driven choruses.  </P> <P> Gurtu's work verged on the remarkable. Firmly based in the extremely complex  rhythms of Indian classical music, he demonstrated an equally masterful command  of Western jazz drumming. Bassist Eckhard devoted himself, for the most part,  to a supporting role, balancing the other players' solo flights with a solid  rhythmic foundation.  </P> <P> The net result was an exquisite evening of contemporary jazz. The McLaughlin  trio demonstrated how easily jazz can incorporate a colorful assemblage of  styles, influences and attitudes under its mantle of creativity. And that's  exactly the message McLaughlin has been working on -- with continuing  effectiveness -- for years. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

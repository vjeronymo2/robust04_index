			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Currency turmoil drove trading in futures to new highs LAST year's currency upheaval helped to drive trading on European futures markets to new highs at a time when trading in some underlying cash markets showed only modest growth, according to figures from the continent's futures exchanges. The shift of trading to futures markets came largely in the second half of the year as investors sought to shift their exposure to European markets quickly during periods of high currency volatil-ity. 'In volatile markets, it is easier to trade one generic security than lots of underlying ones,' said the head of fixed income futures at one US investment bank in London. The transparency of pricing on futures exchanges, compared with the difficulty in times of market upheaval of obtaining firm quotes for trades in underlying cash bonds, also explains the use of futures, he said. As a result, futures prices had a greater impact on prices in cash markets. 'The government cash markets were visibly driven by futures at more times last year than they had been previously,' said Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of fixed income research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. He attributed the switch to futures to the large number of investors who sought to sell futures contracts to hedge their long positions in various European currencies. At the same time, many investors wanting to take positions in the European fixed income markets chose to use futures contracts rather than cash bond to reduce their exposure to currency movements. A sharp increase in trading was recorded across all types of contract: Government bond contracts. Trading in the main French, German and UK government bond contracts in 1992 was up by around 50 per cent from 1991 levels. Most actively traded was the Matif's 10-year French government bond contract, which turned over 31m lots, up by 47 per cent. The two German bund contracts traded on Liffe in London and on the DTB in Frankfurt recorded 18.9m between them (13.6m of these in London), a growth of 52 per cent, while the long gilt futures contract in London showed a 56 per cent increase, to 8.8m contracts. Growth in the cash markets was slower. Turnover in gilts in 1992, at Pounds 1,236bn, was up just over 10 per cent on 1991, although all of this increase was due to more active trading of short-dated and index-linked gilts. Turnover in bunds, together with bonds issued by the German rail and post agencies, was up by around a third. The Italian government bond contract was the fifth most actively traded contract in London, after the main sterling and D-Mark contracts, turning over 3.8m lots. Short-term interest rate contracts. Turnover grew even faster, with a 154 per cent jump in London's Euromark contract, to 12.2m, and a 115 per cent jump in Matif's Pibor contract, to 6.4m. The short sterling contract traded 11.3m, up 40 per cent on 1991. One trader noted the absence of contracts in Europe covering medium-maturity paper, except for the German Bobl futures contracts. Such contracts would be of particular use to investors as Europe's yield curves shift from an inverted to a normal shape, he added. Equity indices. Trading increased by around a half in the futures on both the FT-SE 100 and Cac 40 indices, which turned over 2.6m and 3.6m contracts respectively. Turnover on the Dax index leapt from 1.3m to 3.3m. In all, Liffe traded 72m futures and options contracts last year compared with the 55.5m on the French exchange. Although the figures are not directly comparable, due to different contract sizes, the numbers suggest a comfortable margin compared with 1991, when both exchanges traded 37m-38m contracts.</p>

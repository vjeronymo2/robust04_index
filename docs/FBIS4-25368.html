			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Four representatives of the  families of the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the March 31  Qiandao Lake incident said Tuesday [7 June] that they will go to  Hangzhou in southeastern Mainland China to witness the trial of  the accused murderers, which begin this Friday.    [Words indistinct] said at a press conference at the  Legislative Yuan they hope to see a fast conclusion to the  incident [words indistinct] mainland authorities, whom they  condemned as not having shown respect for the memories of the  victims or concern for human rights.    Legislator Annette Lu, who accompanied family members of the  24 victims at the conference, called on the entire nation to  support them. She said she also had contacted a score of  international human-rights organizations for support, and had  demanded that mainland judicial authorities postpone the trial  of the three men until facts surrounding the incident are made  publicly known.    Meanwhile, H.Y. Hsu, deputy secretary-general of the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF), the semi-official organization that  handles cross-strait affairs with Mainland China in the absence  of formal ties, called on mainland authorities not to ignore the  rights of Taiwan citizens who lost family members in the  incident and not to shrug off the compensation issue.    As facts about the Qiandao Lake incident are not entirely  clear, he said, mainland authorities should also continue  investigating the incident and give reasonable explanations and  answers to questions and doubts raised about it in a report  released by SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council.</p>

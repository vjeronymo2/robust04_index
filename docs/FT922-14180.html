			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Tesco In many ways, Tesco's full-year figures represent another remarkable achievement. Operating margins have risen yet again, even in the more difficult second half. Sales per employee are up 12 per cent, profits per employ-ee 20 per cent. And, it seems, better times are coming: 'for us', the company says, 'the recession is moving away'. This may seem slightly at odds with the fact that its hugely ambitious expansion programme is still enjoying falling land prices and construction costs. But that may be a matter of leads and lags in a consumer-driven recovery, in which case Tesco is getting the best of both worlds. The snag is that even in the supposed upturn, Tesco may be enjoying no underlying volume growth at all. Current like-for-like volume, it seems, is up by some 0.5 per cent. But all of that might be attributable to the one-off effect of Sunday opening. Judging by last year's figures, too, the increase in sales per square foot is slowing sharply. The 20 per cent rise in last year's earnings, in fact, owes a good deal to recessionary cost-cutting and an abnormally low tax charge. This year's earnings growth will doubtless continue in double figures, in which case a prospective p/e of 12 or so might not seem too demanding. But as the market has come to realise, the outlook for the grocery trade further into the decade is a good deal riskier than it seems.</p>

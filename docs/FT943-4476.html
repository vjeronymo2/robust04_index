			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: American Barrick weighs options for Lac after takeover American Barrick Resources is poised to own 100 per cent of Lac Minerals in a few weeks and will then focus on the future of Lac's Canadian gold mining assets and its Latin American properties. Barrick yesterday had taken up 84 per cent of Lac shares under its cash and share offer that expired on Tuesday at midnight. The expiry date has been extended to September 19 to give remaining Lac shareholders time to tender. By then, Barrick expects to have acquired more than 90 per cent and can then proceed to acquire the balance. The offer is either CDollars 5 cash and 0.325 shares of Barrick for each Lac share, or 0.487 Barrick shares. At Wednesday's price for Barrick shares, the offer was worth about CDollars 15.56 a Lac share, for a total of CDollars 2.3bn (USDollars 1.7bn). More Lac shareholders have opted for Barrick shares than expected because of a firm gold price and the strength of Barrick shares. Barrick is meeting the cost of the takeover from cash resources. Mr Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman, will take over as chairman of Lac until the companies are merged. Mr Robert Smith, Barrick president and chief operating officer, has been appointed Lac president. Lac chairman Mr James Pitblado has resigned his post but will remain a director of the merged company. Lac chief executive Mr Peter Steen will also stay on as a director of Barrick. Already north America's fourth largest gold producer, Barrick becomes the world's third-largest producer, after the Anglo-American group and Goldfields South Africa. Barrick's mining team will examine Lac's Canadian properties immediately. Analysts believe Barrick will probably sell most of them, except a new British Columbia producer. Mr Vince Borg, a spokesman for Barrick, said: 'Nothing has yet been decided. Some smaller and mature Lac properties in Canada may be more valuable to other companies. 'Barrick is looking at the long-term potential of all the Lac properties, and our focus is also on the Latin American assets.' Barrick also sees China as an area with 'tremendous geological significance', Mr Borg said.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / People: Winckler: supervision at SIB Andrew Winckler, who helped found boutique merchant bank European Capital Company in 1990, has been persuaded to head the supervision division of the Securities and Investments Board for a three-year term. Winckler, 44, who confesses that it never crossed his mind that he might be a candidate for the new job, says he made the 'fairly agonising decision' because he thought it was 'a very important job from the City's point of view'. He goes on to the SIB board as an executive director alongside chairman Andrew Large and chief executive John Young. He says the ECC board has given him 'leave of absence' and he resigns as a director. It is understood that SIB had been keen to make the appointment a five-year term. Nor will he join until March next year, giving him time to disengage from ECC, where he has worked on the corporate advisory side, recently being involved with the water industry and its periodic review. He says that ECC has been profitable for the past two years, and achieved in three years the modest targets set out for the first five, but he says it was not the earnings aspect that complicated his decision to cross the fence. SIB, fighting to restore its credibility after the Maxwell scandal, has in Winckler a market practitioner who also knows Whitehall from the inside. After 12 years at the Treasury, three of which were spent on secondment to the diplomatic service in Washington, he moved in 1982 to Lloyds Bank International, and from there to Security Pacific Hoare Govett as an executive director responsible, among other things, for debt and swaps origination. Deputy chairman of The Securities Association (TSA), which in 1991 became the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), Winckler lost out in an election to Christopher Sharples, who became chairman of the new entity. Winckler remained SFA's deputy chairman. In August, SIB announced the creation of four new divisions, including supervision, central to Large's review 'Making the two-tier system work'. Winckler will have responsibility for the 'front-line' regulators, including the exchanges and for the professional bodies, and will have a staff of 50. SIB has also restructured its board, appointing Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, as its deputy chairman. Other new members are Rosalind Gilmore, chairman of the Building Societies Commission; John Kennedy, senior partner of Allen &amp; Overy; Oonagh McDonald, management consultant; and Lord Stewartby, deputy chairman of Standard Chartered.</p>

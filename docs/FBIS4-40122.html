			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Vasyl </F> Ivanovych Yevtukhov by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date not  given: "Reform -- Not at the Price of Ruining Our Own Economy"    [Text] Our conversation with Vice Prime Minister Vasyl  Yevtukhov started with the following question: As is known,  there repeatedly sound reproaches in the press, as well as in  official circles, to the effect that economic reforms in Ukraine  are being implemented sluggishly, at any rate, slower than in  neighboring countries. What is your opinion on the situation?    [Yevtukhov] True, such statements already set one's teeth on  edge. However, let us first decide what we mean by the notion  "reform." Even specialists are not infrequently confused here.  This is what I will say: Some people reduce this notion to  something primitive. If the state diminishes its influence on a  certain branch or enterprise, which start floating with the  stream, to some people this already looks like reform. Under  reforms, I understand such management of economic processes as  would ensure a rise in the efficiency of production and, in the  final analysis, the people's well being. It is precisely from  this formula that I proceed, even though there are many critics  of this approach.    For some reason, there is an opinion, even shared by some  economists, that reforms imply an intensive development of small  businesses (of course, through a weakening of the state sector).  Indeed, small businesses are a necessary element in reforming  the economy.    However, they have no plans of investing money in long-term  projects or in the program for the state's strategic development  and are in no hurry to engage in science-intensive production or  in the fulfillment of other important and promising state tasks  -- for example, defense, social protection of the people, and so  on.    Therefore, while implementing reforms, we should not ruin  our  own economy for the sake of privatizing at any price something  that we do not infrequently observe in our state. Reforms  require a sensible correlation between the state and private  sectors, as this is done in advanced countries, and a cautious  approach to privatizing strong and well-established enterprises,  at the same time providing wide possibilities for the  development of small businesses.    [Kraslyanskyy] However, Vasyl Ivanovych, Western experts  particularly criticize us for the fact that state control over  the economy allegedly hampers reforms and stifles the  development of private businesses.    [Yevtukhov] Our economy needs to be reformed proceeding from  common sense and should not blindly copy someone's models, which  are in many cases not the best ones. In this, I support  academician Pakhomov, who expounded a whole scheme of resistance  on the part of various countries of the world to those reforms,  which are based upon a strictly monetary approach and upon the  thesis to the effect that "the less the state's interference,  the more extensive the reforms."    Japan became an economically strong country despite, and not  owing to, such an approach. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,  Singapore, Indonesia, and now also Malaysia have also rejected  such a model.    [Ludwig] Erhard [FRG postwar economics minister], whom we  often quote, started not just with monetary reform but also with  directives. He restored "in a Soviet manner" the severed ties  and set economic mechanisms into operation through directives.  In postwar Germany, there existed planning on the macro-level.  It was only after the situation started to take proper shape  and the economic transition to the conditions of market  regulation started that prices were liberated.    As you can see, the economy of the aforementioned countries  developed under the control of the state in order to concentrate  efforts and prevent chaos.    I believe, therefore, that the thesis "the less the state's  interference, the more extensive the market" is erroneous and  even harmful. It is more suitable for countries with weak  industry, where this model restricts possibilities of ruination.    In our country, with its colossal economic potential,  including missile construction and biotechnologies, such actions  are very detrimental to the development of science, up-to-date  technologies, or to the elaboration of fundamental projects.    I am stressing: I am against administrative interference  into the work of enterprises, but I am in favor of discipline  and well-considered actions in all links of the economy.    With your permission, I will once again turn to foreign  experience. By the resolution of 1 December 1986, the principle  of free prices was introduced in France (mind you, as late as  1986!). However, this document allows the government to take  measures in the case of excessively high prices or in situations  created by extraordinary circumstances, including crisis ones.  They make it possible to establish ties between the market  economy and the economy of planned distribution and, on the one  hand, to avoid social shocks and, on the other -- to protect the  national producer.    I am convinced that we are currently in the transitional  period from the strictly administrative command economic system  to a market one. That is why it is necessary to chose  "transitional" methods without extremes and take into account  the experiences of other countries, which must be studied with a  pencil in hand instead of taking for granted what newspapers and  magazines write.    [Kraslyanskyy] At sessions of the Supreme Council, the  government was repeatedly admonished for its failure to have a  distinct plan for emerging from the crisis. Do you have your  own vision of such a plan?    [Yevtukhov] The government has a plan. I also know what  needs to be done in the sphere of which I am in charge. I am  convinced, in particular, that we must start with establishing  order in the banking and credits system concurrently with  restructuring the economy. Today, as you know, the nonpayments,  the absence of credits, the failure to pay wages, the decrease  in the population's purchasing power (and also a slump in  production, since an illusion of overproduction is created), and  financial abuses painfully hit the economy. It is only  stringent normative regulation of Ukraine's banking and finance  systems that may today rescue us from total chaos in this sphere  and in the entire economy.    The banking legislation in the United States envisages, for  example, state regulation of the functions of the credits and  finance system to a larger extent than of other types of  entrepreneurship precisely because the character of banking  operations has the greatest influence upon the material well  being of a society or upon its moods.    The second, in my opinion, important problem is a  reorganization of trade, primarily external trade and the  related system of currency regulation in mutual settlements and  control over currency receipts. Export today is becoming  unprofitable due to the fixed rate of exchange of the  karbovanets with regard to the dollar.    The third problem is a complex of measures associated with  the encouragement of the national commodity producer.    [Kraslyanskyy] You, Vasyl Ivanovych, have come from the  Supreme Council. How do you see, from your new positions, a  cooperation between these high-level state structures?    [Yevtukhov] We are jointly doing common work, and it is  necessary to proceed from this. Everyone must be in his own  place and be answerable for what he has been authorized to do by  the law and by the Constitution.    Undoubtedly, the Supreme Council, as the state's  highest-level body, must control the government's activity, but  not by way of demanding monthly reports after the return of the  deputies from provinces, as was the case in the past.    I would like to stress that reforms will not advance (even  if  supervised by a new Erhard), unless the power vertical and  control over the economy are restored. Here, the Supreme  Council, as the highest legislative body, must assume the  responsibility.    I see as optimal such cooperation in which the government,  jointly with working structures of the Supreme Council, submits  its plans for consideration, deputies thoroughly study them,  analyze, and, if necessary, amend, and then ensure their  implementation through legislation.    I am against any confrontation, ambitions, or populism and  favor constructive work and logic of mutual persuasions.    In conclusion, I would like to say the following. Ukraine  may be rich and strong. For this, it is necessary to work more  and not whimper or give rise to hysteria about the crisis or  various disasters. No one, except us, will extricate our  country from the difficult period in its state development.</p>

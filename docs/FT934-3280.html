			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vacant space behind 19% decline at In Shops In Shops, the retail and office centres operator, saw profits dip 19 per cent to Pounds 735,000 pre-tax in its first half to September 30, against Pounds 903,000. During the first half, Millbank, which with its chain of Job Lot stores was acquired last August, contributed Pounds 1.64m to total turnover of Pounds 14.3m. Turnover of continuing operations was marginally higher at Pounds 11m. The high level of vacant space in In Shops' centres caused profits to drop, but recently there has been some improvement, opening the way to higher profits in the second half. The Birmingham-based group sold Executive Centres, its lossmaking chain of serviced offices, shortly after the period-end for a nominal Pounds 1 to the Fuchs family, which had been involved in the business before its acquisition by In Shops. The disposal appears in the accounts as a loss of Pounds 5.04m which is more than offset by a provision of Pounds 5.52m set up in the previous year. The disposal, combined with Millbank, has repositioned In Shops as a retail specialist. Next month Job Lot will expand from the north into the Midlands and south of England. Earnings per share on continuing activities were 1.25p, against 1.7p. The interim dividend, up from 0.66p to 0.7p, is being paid on capital enlarged by the share sale to pay for Millbank.</p>

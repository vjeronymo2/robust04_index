Will Howe of the  Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Troy Waters, 16, suffered moderate injuries, he said.  </P> <P> Waters, traveling east in a pickup truck about 3 p.m., swerved head-on into  Stufkosky's car after the car in front of Waters stopped to make a left turn.  The impact pushed the front of Stufkosky's sedan onto his body. KIRSTEN LEE  SWARTZ  </P></p>

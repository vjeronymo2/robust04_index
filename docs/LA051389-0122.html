			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENTENCED IN MURDER OF EX-GIRLFRIEND;  </P> <P> KILLER FACES 25-YEAR-TO-LIFE TERM  </P> <P> A spurned lover convicted of killing his girlfriend and burying her body twice  in the Mojave Desert was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in state prison,  the maximum allowed by law.  </P> <P> Gerald Lee Bishop Jr., 24, of Westminister was sentenced by Orange County  Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer in Santa Ana. Bishop was convicted of  strangling, then drowning his ex-girlfriend, Marina Garcia, 23, of Huntington  Beach, nearly a year ago.  </P> <P> "It is a particularly deplorable crime, and we're pleased that (Bishop) was  sentenced to the maximum allowable punishment," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard  Toohey.  </P> <P> Bishop's attorney, public defender David C. Biggs, said he felt the sentence  was too harsh. Biggs contended that Bishop killed Garcia in a fit of passion,  and was only guilty of manslaughter, punishable by a maximum of 11 years in  prison.  </P> <P> Bishop was convicted of the June 3, 1988, murder of Garcia. A former girlfriend  of Bishop's testified during the trial that she heard him mention the idea of  killing Garcia the day before the murder. According to testimony, Garcia was  attempting to end a long relationship with Bishop shortly before the crime.  </P> <P> The next day, Bishop choked and then drowned Garcia in the bathtub of her  Huntington Beach home. After cleaning up the house, Bishop took her body and  buried it in the desert near Victorville. He returned later with his brother to  dig a deeper hole for fear that the body would be discovered.  </P> <P> Biggs maintained his client killed Garcia in the heat of passion during a  vicious argument and should have received a lighter sentence.  </P> <P> "He will be punished like everyone else," Biggs said Friday. "But he is not  like everyone else."  </P> <P> He described Bishop as having learning difficulties.  </P> <P> Bishop "understands very little of what is going on," Biggs said. "He only gets  about a third of what he is hearing."  </P> <P> But prosecutor Toohey disagreed.  </P> <P> "He certainly knew what he was doing that day" when the murder was committed,  Toohey said. Bishop tried to feign ignorance about the crime by going to  Garcia's father's house to ask where the victim was after her murder, Toohey  said. He also cashed a paycheck that Garcia had just received, according to  Toohey.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE REJECTS GATED COMMUNITY  </P> <P> A developer's plan to create a privately gated, 19-unit town home community in  the shadow of the San Diego Freeway was narrowly rejected Tuesday by the  Torrance City Council.  </P> <P> Citing traffic concerns and excessive noise from the freeway, which lies about  55 feet from the 2.43-acre Yukon Street site, City Council Members Tim Mock,  Mark Wirth and Dee Hardison and Mayor Katy Geissert said the ISCO Industries  plan would not be appropriate.  </P> <P> Some council members said they would prefer to see an office building at the  site, which is zoned "residential professional," a rare zoning designation that  allows houses, apartments, condominiums or professional offices but requires  city review of any construction.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the intersection of Yukon and 182nd Street is already too  crowded.  </P></p>

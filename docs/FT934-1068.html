			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Income falls at A&amp;P in quarter The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the troubled US supermarket chain better known as A&amp;P, reported a fall in net income from Dollars 422,000 to Dollars 379,000 in its third quarter ended December 4. Sales were down from Dollars 2.38m to Dollars 2.34m and net earnings per share were unchanged at 1 cent. Net income for the first nine months was Dollars 23.4m, compared with Dollars 30.9m before non-recurring charges or a loss of Dollars 149.4m after non-recurring charges. A&amp;P is controlled by Tengelmann, a German retailing group. Tengelmann acquired a majority stake in the company in 1981 and brought it back from near-bankruptcy. But A&amp;P has come under fire from the New York state employees' pension fund for its recent poor performance. Mr James Wood, the English chairman and chief executive installed by Tengelmann, said a strike had closed 63 Miracle Food Mart and Ultra Mart stores in Ontario, Canada, on November 19. He estimated that lost revenue and the costs of closing the stores wiped 6 cents off third-quarter earnings per share. Same store sales, excluding the 63 closed stores, were 1 per cent lower than in last year's third quarter and 1.1 per cent lower for the first nine months of the year, he said.</p>

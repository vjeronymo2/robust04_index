			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unscheduled announcement"] </F>   [Text] Brother listeners: The fate of thousands of members  and cadres of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] in Aden is  shrouded in mystery. Following the proclamation of secession in  the early hours last Saturday [21 May], reports said that  members of the YSP Political Bureau and the Central Committee  have been under house arrest. Unconfirmed reports say that a  number of those members -- particularly the ministers or members  of the House of Representatives -- have been killed.    Political observers noted that following the declaration of  secession, Aden Radio did not broadcast a congratulatory cable  to al-Bid from [former defense minister] Haytham Qasim, but  broadcast Haytham's letter to soldiers and officers on 'Id  al-Adha. The observers interpreted this as an indication that  differences have surfaced between al-Bid and Haytham. This,  they added, was what prompted al-Bid to leave for al-Mukalla  after 'Adnan [not further identified] helped him gain control of  Aden and the radio so that al-Bid could broadcast the secession  statement from Aden radio in his own voice.    The observers noted that the formation of what al-Bid called  the presidential council includes names that do not exist in  Aden. Consequently, such a body can never hold a session.  Al-Bid's thirst for the title of president was behind the  issuance of the first order appointing al-Bid as the president.  He did not even find an adviser or legal scholar to draft a  decision based on any constitutional or legal law.    Political analysts said anybody who has followed the reports  broadcast over Aden radio since the declaration of secession  will find that the newscasts have not included, over the past  three days, any statements of support even from the YSP bodies  to which al-Bid is affiliated. The Aden radio newscasts also  show that only four people support al-Bid: Salim Jubran in  al-Mukalla, Shaykh Hani (?al-Hadshi) and [name indistinct] in  Aden, and a fourth person residing abroad.    The analysts added that al-Bid's choice of 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Jifri to be his deputy shows that the two men have agreed to  return the rule of shaykhdoms and sultanates to the southern and  eastern governorates so that Aden will become the capital of the  shaykhdoms while Hadhramaut will be the lot of [former prime  minister] Haydar al-'Attas, who was the only person who assumed  a leading position in the YSP despite his affiliation with a  sultanate dynasty. He is also known for his affiliation with  the [words indistinct] the Hadhramaut Governorate. The return  to the rule of sultanates will allow al-Bid, al-'Attas, and  Bin-Husaynun to impose full control over the Hadhramaut oil  after ridding themselves of the rest of the group, which is  linked, through marriage, with the families of these three  persons. The political analysts believe that al-Bid's  appointment of (?Bin-Suraynah) as Shabwah governor is evidence  of this.    The political analysts ruled out the achievement of any of  these goals because the way al-Bid and the separatist clique  have acted has deprived them of any credibility, particularly  before the sons of the southern and eastern governorates. The  secession statement showed them to be a group of agents for an  external party which has used them over the past four years to  tarnish the image of Yemeni unity abroad and to undermine it  locally through the crises and riots which they engineered.    The task of the forces of constitutional legitimacy, unity,  and democracy now receives Arab and international sympathy and  support.</p>

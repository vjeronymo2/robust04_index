			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Housing starts continue to climb BUILDERS started work on slightly more US homes last month, adding to a surge in August, but the knock-on effects for the rest of the economy could be slight, Reuter reports from New York. The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 1.4 per cent in September, following a revised 12.6 per cent climb in August. Mr David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, which tracks mortgage activity, said: 'I don't think people should think the housing industry is likely to drive the economy in a significant manner, but we're finally on the right road.' Some economists said the modest September rise compared with August might show housing activity had peaked. They also noted a decline in mortgage applications.</p>

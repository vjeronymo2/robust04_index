			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Rouble climbs 20% after sharp decline The Russian rouble, which lost more than a fifth of its value this week on 'Black Tuesday', staged a startling recovery yesterday, climbing 20 per cent against the dollar. Its rise prompted currency traders to break out into spontaneous applause on the floor of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex). There was heavy buying of the rouble by commercial banks at yesterday's auction but it was not clear to what extent the Central Bank had intervened. The bank denied reports it spent Dollars 155m (Pounds 98m) buying the rouble but declined further comment. The government moved quickly to fill the post of finance minister following the sacking of Mr Sergei Dubinin on Wednesday. Mr Andrei Vavilov, the deputy finance minister who has strong reformist leanings, was named acting finance minister. His appointment has yet to be confirmed by parliament. The rouble's wild fluctuations have left currency traders, politicians and the public bewildered. 'Trade on the Micex continues to amaze,' was the headline yesterday of the normally sober RIA government newsagency. One western economist in Moscow said: 'It is understandable that there has been steady pressure on the rouble given the seasonal increase in credits and the rise in inflation. But I am not sure that anybody knows what caused Tuesday's stampede. The political reverberations are likely to prove more significant than the brief economic shock.' Appearing before the parliament's budget committee, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, said he could not understand the reasons behind the rouble crash on Tuesday. The Central Bank said its foreign exchange reserves had fallen to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 2.45bn on October 1, seemingly leaving it vulnerable to renewed speculation. But it has already introduced some changes to the payment system to encourage greater stability. The new finance minister, Mr Vavilov, received strong endorsements from western diplomats and economists. He will have an important role in Russia's negotiations with an International Monetary Fund mission which arrives in Moscow at the weekend. Ukraine currency falls, Page 2 Currencies, Page 32</p>

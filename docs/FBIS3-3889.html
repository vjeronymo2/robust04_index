Abraham Roodt, deputy head of the South African mission at  the GATT headquarters, made the statement while meeting with a  Taiwan delegation for tariff-reduction talks under the GATT  framework.    During the talks, Roodt asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on  22 agricultural and 126 industrial products in accordance with  GATT requirements.    Roodt complained that South Africa has been unable to raise  agricultural exports to Taiwan because Taiwan maintains quota  and area restrictions on farm imports.    "We hope Taiwan can raise annual import quota for our apples  and allow our grapes and grapefruit to enter its market," Roodt  said. Taiwan currently allows annual importation of 500 tons of  South African apples.    In response, Huang Yen-chao, head of the Taiwan delegation,  said Taiwan has decided to remove quota and area restrictions on  farm imports after it gains GATT membership. "We'll instead  regulate farm imports with a tariff system," said Huang, also  director- general of the Board of Foreign Trade.    This was the first round of Taiwan-South African tariff  talks  in connection with Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based world  trade regulatory body. As the two countries have maintained  close relations, Huang said, the talks proceeded under a  "friendly, pleasant" atmosphere. The two sides will hold  further discussions later this year.    Earlier in the day, the Taiwan delegation also held tariff-  reduction talks with its Hungarian counterpart. Hungary was the  second country that expressed the intention to hold bilateral  tariff-reduction talks with Taiwan after the United States.    The Hungarian mission, headed by Aniko Ivanka, a senior  secretary in charge of economic affairs at the Hungarian GATT  office, asked Taiwan to cut tariff rates on 28 agricultural and  34 industrial products, including auto parts, engines, meat and  dairy products.    Huang told hungarian delegates that large quantities of  Hungarian auto parts have entered Taiwan, indicating that Taiwan  has not discriminated against Hungarian products.    The two sides agreed to meet again later this year to  further  discuss tariff and non-tariff problems. They also agreed to  promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    The Taiwan delegation arrived in Geneva Sunday for tariff-  reduction talks with six countries, including Hungary, South  Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Turkey.    Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

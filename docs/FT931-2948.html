			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Engineers' bodies tighten links TWO OF the UK's largest engineering institutions yesterday signed a collaboration agreement intended to improve service to members and help bring unity to the profession. The move by the Institutions of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers is an important step in the long and often painful process of forging closer links between the UK's 44 professional engineering institutions. It comes shortly before Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council - an umbrella body - unveils final proposals for a reformed structure for the profession. In the summer of 1991, the Electricals and Mechanicals deferred plans for a merger after internal opposition, but they have been collaborating informally over the past two years at local, national and international levels. The signing yesterday of a memorandum of understanding between the two institutions formalises collaboration, improving their efficiency and effectiveness. It is understood that the institutions also want something to build on if Sir John's plans fall through. These have generated considerable debate in the engineering profession, with criticism both by individual members and by the larger institutions. The agreement outlines new areas of co-operation between the two bodies, accreditation of engineering courses, and planning and management of conferences.</p>

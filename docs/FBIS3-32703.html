			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Ramon Diaz] </F>   [Text] Division General Jesus Rafael Caballero was  discharged from the National Guard staff as part of the changes  and transfers in top positions of the National Armed Forces  ordered by President Rafael Caldera.    The unexpected removal of the military officer, who by the  way still had two more years to serve, caused him to ask his  superiors to let him retire. They apparently had no difficulty  in granting his request. Gen. Caballero has, in fact, gone home.    Among the many posts occupied by Caballero were the general  commander of the Caracas Military Police, chief of the National  Guard Regional Command No. 5, and finally the National Guard  chief of staff. Gen. Caballero is a graduate of the Armed Forces  of Cooperation Officers Training School (EFOFAC) and a member of  the 1966 graduating class called the Battle of the Yokes  [Batalla de los Horcones]. He is considered a firm defender of  the democratic system and one of the National Guardsmen who  confronted the coupist intentions of those promoting the 4  February and 27 November 1992 uprisings.    Names of other officers are being reviewed to occupy top  positions in other forces, like the Army, Navy, and the Air  Force, despite obstacles due to a lack of division generals and  admirals. It was reported that President Caldera's order, made  prior to yesterday's proposals of the top military command, is  to completely reorganize the top cadres of the National Armed  Forces before the promotion of the candidates to top posts  within the armed institution.    The unofficial candidates for inspector general and chiefs  of  staff of the respective forces, which are in the hands of  Defense Minister Div. Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, are the  following:    In the National Guard, as is already known, its commander  general is Egberto Fidel Artuza Delgado. Those who would serve  with him, at least until next July, are Brig. Gen. Julio Cesar  Pena Sanchez, (Inspector General), and Brig. Gen. Euro Luis  Rincon Viloria, who will surely be out by July.    In the Navy, Commander Gen. Vice Adm. Carlos Ramos Flores  still has two more years of service to go and Rear Adm. Joel A.  Rodriguez was given the post of inspector general. The post of  chief of staff is reserved for the commander himself because  there is apparently "no trustworthy candidate" for that post.    The commander general of the Air Force is Otto Garcia  Rivara.  Tulio Prado Fernandez, who was formerly the Air Defense chief,  is the new inspector general of the Venzuelan Air Force, and  Brig. Gen. Jose Agustin Borges Blanco is the chief of staff. The  latter is a strong candidate to be discharged in July.    In the Army, in addition to Commander Gen. Moises Orozco  Graterol, the proposal is to appoint Div. Gen. Alberto Emerich  Esqueda Torres from the Security and Defense Department to the  post of inspector general and Div. Gen. Nestor Lara Estrano, who  is currently the director general of the Defense Ministry, to be  in charge of the chief of staff temporarily.    According to the new authorities in Fort Tiuna, the abrupt  departure of the old top command members has really created  problems, certain traumas, which can be overcome.</p>

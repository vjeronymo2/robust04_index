			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson shares hit by warning The market value of Lloyd Thompson fell by about 20 per cent yesterday after the insurance and reinsurance broker issued a profits warning. Lloyd, one of the fastest growing and most profitable London brokers in recent years, said it expected pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 of at least Pounds 18m. Analysts had been expecting more than Pounds 19m but the group said investment income would be substantially lower than anticipated owing to sharp falls in the value of fixed interest securities and lower interest rates. Investment income was expected to be at least Pounds 3.8m, compared with Pounds 6m last year. Growth in income from core brokerage would be similar to the 3 per cent reported at the interim stage. The market reacted by marking the shares down 45p to 185p, a drop of nearly 50 per cent since last summer. The group also announced the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in Triangle Holdings, a Bermuda-based broker, in a deal worth up to Dollars 5.39m (Pounds 3.54m). It has an option, exercisable during the second half of 1997, to acquire the remainder as well as the outstanding minority interests in Triangle's two subsidiaries Lloyd will pay an initial Dollars 3m in cash with a further profit-related consideration of up to Dollars 2.39m. Triangle's main subsidiary, Triangle Brokerage, specialises in liability business. Brokerage for the year to December 31 amounted to Dollars 2.1m.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Payout cut hits Sturge shares STURGE HOLDINGS, the biggest agency group on the Lloyd's of London insurance market, saw more than a third of its market capitalisation disappear yesterday morning after adverse reaction to a dividend policy change. Sturge, which like Lloyd's is chaired by Mr David Coleridge, cut its interim dividend by 50 per cent to 2.75p. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 2.58m (Dollars 4.62m) from Pounds 3.70m in the six months to March 31, 1992. The group is one of two agencies at Lloyd's with a full London listing. The other is AJ Archer, which last week also reported a fall in pre-tax profits. Sturge warned shareholders to expect a final dividend of 5.5p, down from 11p. The shares plunged 65p to 105p on the news, before recovering marginally to close at 111p. Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the reaction but said the stock market had 'regarded Sturge as a yield stock and the decision was bound to be adverse'. Operating income fell to Pounds 802,000 from Pounds 1.16m, following a rise in expenses to Pounds 11.4m from Pounds 11.07m. Interest and other income fell to Pounds 1.78m against Pounds 2.54m. The group said it expected pre-tax profits for the year as a whole to be not less than Pounds 7.5m compared with Pounds 19.12 (before the write-off of deferred expenditure last year). Analysts expect profits commission earned on the 1989 underwriting year, which will be reported in the second half, to shrink to around Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 14m last year. Sturge has reassessed underwriting prospects for 1990 and 1991 and said it would take longer than expected for group profits to return to previous levels. Sturge syndicates have had to provide bigger-than-expected reserves for future losses in areas such as stop-loss insurance (which provides reinsurance for individual Names) and errors and omissions covers (which meet the cost of legal awards for agents' negligence). Investment returns were also down. Lex, Page 26 Observer, Page 25 Syndicates hit, Page 10</p>

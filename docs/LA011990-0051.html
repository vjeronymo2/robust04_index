			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD TO VOTE ON USE OF BOOK SERIES  </P> <P> Redondo Beach elementary school trustees, at the urging of a conservative  Christian parents' group, have scheduled a vote on the district's continued use  of a series of readers some parents deem morbid and anti-Christian, district  officials said.  </P> <P> "Impressions," a series of grade-school readers that are the basic reading  texts for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders in Redondo Beach schools, will come  before the school board at its Feb. 6 meeting, Supt.  </P> <P> Nick Parras said.  </P> <P> The texts have come under fire nationwide from members of the religious right,  who disapprove of the inclusion in the books of stories and poems about sorcery  and magic. Critics have also charged that the books are morbid in tone.  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach parents demanded last month that the district shelve the  books. The board took the matter under advisement but, in interviews afterward,  most board members said they had no intention of withdrawing the books.  </P></p>

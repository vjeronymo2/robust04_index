			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Observer: Old boy rivalry While the acquisitive TT Group's boss, John Newman, takes umbrage at being called a copy-cat, that is the way things would seem. One after another, the members of the Hanson old-boys' club are taking to the acquisition trail. Greg Hutchings' Tomkins is buying RHM, a couple of old Hanson hands at Wassall are bidding for Evode, and now TT Group is buying AB Electronic. Newman, aged 47, was the first of Lord Hanson's acquisition chiefs to go off on his own, and his public company remains the smallest and most lowly rated of the three. He keeps in touch with Hutchings, but plays down any rivalry. Meanwhile Bob Cowell, who master-minded Hanson acquisition strategy in between Newman and Hutchings, assures me his Makinson Cowell business has no plans to join the fray. But isn't it time that Lord Hanson himself showed his buying mettle?</p>

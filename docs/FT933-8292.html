			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Price war declared in travel trade THOMAS COOK, the UK's third-biggest travel agency chain, yesterday fired the opening salvo in the campaign for customers next summer, offering a 10 per cent discount on all holidays in its new package tour brochure. Mr Tony Bennett, Cook's director of strategic marketing, said: 'There is a retail price war about to break out with a good chance of blood being spilt in the next six months. We intend to be very aggressive on price.' Last night Pickfords and Hogg Robinson said they too would be offering 10 per cent discounts on their summer 1994 overseas holidays. Mr Andrew Jones, Pickfords marketing manager, said: 'With more buying power through (our) larger base, it is Thomas Cook's blood which will be spilled.' Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest travel agent, will unveil its new brochure on Thursday. Today Thomson, the market leader among tour operators, launches its 1994 brochure, followed by Owners Abroad next week. Mr Bennett said competition in the industry had been increased by consolidation. In the past year tour operator Airtours has bought Pickfords and Hogg Robinson, and Thomas Cook has taken a 20 per cent stake in Owners. In addition to its opening discount offer - due to run for only a few weeks  -Cook is continuing a promise to match any other lower price offered by a rival chain. This summer's top destinations are predicted to be favourites again next year. Spain, Portugal and Turkey head the list. Cook also expects France to be popular. The group, which is controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, expects the package holiday market to grow by 10 per cent next year, equivalent to an extra 1m passengers. The gradual growth in self-catering is expected to continue. Ten years ago the self-catering market accounted for about 15 per cent of package holidays. This year it reached 43 per cent and Cook expects it to rise to 50 per cent next year. As part of the link with Owners, Cook will market the Enterprise holiday brand as its own. It expects to sell between 50,000 and 100,000 Enterprise holidays next year. Mr Bennett said the winners of the price war were the consumers, but at some cost. 'Discounting is against the consumer interest in the long term because travel agents and operators alike are unable to make the investments that will ensure improving quality.' Owners will also use the launch of its 1994 brochure to try to revive its fortunes. The company recently issued a profits warning to shareholders. Observer, Page 15</p>

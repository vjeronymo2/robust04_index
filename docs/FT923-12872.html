			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / SFO tells of regrets over Blue Arrow THE Serious Fraud Office would not handle the year-long Blue Arrow fraud trial the same way again, the Court of Appeal heard yesterday. Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the prosecution for the SFO, said his original estimate that the trial would last four to six months was genuine and sincere. The first lesson to be learnt was that pre-trial hearings had to be more rigorous than was the case in Blue Arrow, he said. However, there was no risk that the convictions of four City advisers of conspiracy to defraud were unsafe or unsatisfactory, he continued. Mr Jonathan Cohen, Mr David Reed, Mr Nicholas Wells, all former County NatWest executives, and Mr Martin Gibbs, a former UBS Phillips &amp; Drew director, are appealing against their convictions for conspiracy to defraud. In a separate hearing in the High Court Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, was given leave to bring a prosecution for contempt of court against Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Mail on Sunday; Mr Stewart Steven, the newspaper's former editor; and Mr Clive Wolman, City editor. Counsel for the attorney-general argued that the newspaper's publication of interviews with members of the Blue Arrow jury constituted a breach of the Contempt of Court Act 1981.</p>

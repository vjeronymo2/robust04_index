This event is of great significance to promoting  the development of the socialist market economy, forming a  matching legal system, establishing a modern enterprise system,  and standardizing the microbasis of the market economy.    The Corporate Law is an important law for standardizing the  main body of the market economy. Its functions include  standardizing corporate organization and behavior, protecting  the legitimate rights and interests of companies, shareholders,  and creditors, and maintaining social and economic order. It  cultivates, in a legal form, the main body of the market that  caters to the needs of large- scale socialized production and  the market economy and improves the system of legal entities in  China. This is a foundational project for the establishment of  the socialist market economy that integrates the economic  structural reform with the building of an economic legal system,  activates and protects economic reform with economic  legislation, and standardizes and codifies the measures of  enterprise reform and the achievements of the reform. The  making of the Corporate Law embodies the principle set by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee that  calls for close integration of reform decisions and legislative  decisions. The Corporate Law has been brought forth in pace  with the needs of the enterprise reform. It not only is a  result of the effort to sum up experiences and consolidate what  has been achieved, but also promotes and protects enterprise  reform by wielding legal authority, so that this reform may make  steady, yet vigorous progress on the broad road paved by the law.    The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a natural  requirement of the development of large-scale socialized  production and market economy. It points to the direction of  the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. A company is an  important, typical form of modern enterprise and is a product of  the development of large-scale socialized production and market  economy. Company, a form of enterprise organization  standardized by law, can effectively separate corporate equity  from ownership of promoters. In a company, the relationship  between operational power and ownership is well-defined, the  organizational and management system is scientific and rational,  rights and responsibilities are clearly demarcated, various  parties to the company check on each other, and risks are  distributed in a way that is also conducive to fund-raising. It  not only effectively protects the rights and interests of the  owner, but also gives full decisionmaking power to the operator.  Enterprise management and capital are separated from government  administration, which is made possible by the relationship  between the operational power and the ownership and the mode of  property organization, so that the state is freed from its  unlimited liability for enterprises. These legal principles  embodied in the Corporate Law are the very basic requirements of  a modern enterprise system. The making of the Corporate Law is  in keeping with the demand on the establishment of a modern  enterprise system and has a positive role to play in renewing  the enterprise system with concentrated efforts and in further  emancipating and developing the productive forces.    A company is built on the basis of concentration of capital.  This determines the following important features that are  inherent in a company: One, a company is set up in a  responsibility form, not in accordance with ownership or  administrative jurisdiction: and two, the concept of company  connotes diversified economic sectors and investments from a  variety of sources, as the corporate form can be used by owners  of different natures. The relevant provisions in the Corporate  Law are based on China's national conditions and were made by  drawing upon and assimilating useful experience of other  countries in corporate legislation while close attention is  given to practical experience and the needs of development. As  to the specific corporate form, two major forms, namely, the  limited liability company and the joint-stock company with  limited liability, are prevalent and found in large quantities  in China. The Corporate Law gives due regard to the  characteristics of our country and contains separate provisions  on solely state-owned ones among limited liability companies,  which are designed to meet the needs arising from the  reorganization of state-owned enterprises into companies. Such  stipulations conform to China's national conditions and indicate  a dynamic, yet cautious effort.    Making the Corporate Law means establishing a standardized  corporate system in accordance with the requirements of the  modern enterprise system. The corporate system is a common  asset of mankind, but for it to play a truly positive role as a  scientific form of enterprise organization, we must adhere to  standardization and the legal premises and requirements for  incorporation or reorganization of companies. Incorporation of  companies and reorganization of enterprises into companies can  go ahead only when the required conditions are ready; otherwise,  incorporation or forced reorganization is not allowed. To  ensure its correct enforcement, the Corporate Law contains the  special chapter "Legal Responsibility" which stipulates that  violators of this law will be called to account. Existing  companies must be screened also in accordance with the  provisions of the Corporate Law. The procedures and specific  methods to follow in implementation are governed by the State  Council's stipulation.    The enforcement of the Corporate Law as well as the  establishment of the modern enterprise system is an arduous and  complex job. It requires meticulous organization, close  cooperation among related departments, and concerted efforts in  the renewal of China's enterprise system, so as to help promote  the development of the socialist market economy.</p>

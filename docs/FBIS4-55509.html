			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] During a morning news conference, Slovene  Foreign Minister Peterle summarized the main characteristics of  his recent visits to Uruguay, Argentina, the United States, and  the Czech Republic. Zvone Zorko reports:    [Begin Zorko recording] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle at  today's news conference could not say anything essentially new  since we have reported extensively about his visits and meetings  with the statesmen and economists in these states from the  location itself. [passage omitted] We can expect a visit of the  Slovene prime minister to Argentina this year already, while  Argentine Prime Minister Menem will visit Slovenia next year.    Regarding Peterle's visit to the United States, let us  single  out the assessment of the economic experts that it would be  possible to double the scope of trade between the two countires  in the near future and the assurance by U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher that the United States will even in the future  continue to pay appropriate attention to Slovenia and the entire  Central Europe. Regarding the arms embargo, Minister Peterle  said that the U.S. secretary of state had acknowledged the new  arguments, especially the one that because of the embargo  Slovenia cannot import commercial explosives, urgently needed in  the planned construction of highways. Regarding succession, the  United States remains firm in its stand that the FRY cannot be  the sole successor of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    Minister Peterle was not willing to answer questions  concerning relations with Italy. He merely said that the  Slovene Government still does not have an official standpoint  from the Italian Government and that it will take its own stance  once the new Italian policy in this department is defined.

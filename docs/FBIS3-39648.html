			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Athens University Professor Kostas Kalogris: </F> "Inflation's `Low  Blows'"]    [Excerpts] In the last 15 years, inflation in Greece has  been particularly long-lived and impervious to austerity and  other anti-inflationary measures. Inflation stood at 12.3  percent at the end of last year, with an average yearly rate of  13.8 percent, or quadruple the average rate in other European  Union member countries (3.2 percent). [passage omitted]    The principal structural causes for Greek inflation are:    1. The nature of national expenditures,  characterized today by a high rate of consumption and a low rate  of savings for investment purposes. The consumerist nature of  national expenditures stems from the strong consumer habits of  the Greeks, notably those involved in the underground economy  who siphon off nearly half of the national income, which thus  remains untaxed and is used instead to purchase  luxury--especially imported--goods. Another cause is the strong  consumerist character of public expenditures, most of which go  toward servicing the public debt, whose nature is also  inflationary.    2. The rate of savings/investments and their  nature. The rate of savings in Greece (15.5 percent) is  small in comparison with that of other EU countries (20  percent). In addition, part of the savings remains "sterile" in  bank vaults and remains outside the productive process because  of the high interest rates paid to depositors and, more  generally, because of unfavorable bank loan terms and the  difficult access of commercial companies--notably small-and  medium-sized firms--to the capital market.    On the other hand, part of the "potential" investment funds  from accumulated savings is channeled into very attractive  income-producing sources, such as state bonds and high-interest  private loans (half of the Greeks lend to the other half),  rather than into production.    As a result of the nature of national savings, only 18.1  percent of GDP is channeled into production, despite the fact  that investments in the 23-25 percent range are needed to  support the development rate (4 percent) needed to achieve the  goals of the Greek economy.    However, the problem stems not only from the low rate of  investment, but also from its nature. The largest share of  investment is channeled into low-productivity projects such as  construction and small equipment, while little goes to research,  innovation, and improvement of human resources through education  and training.    The result of the low rate of investment and its inadequate  nature is the slow expansion rate of market potential and  productivity, leading to "gaps" in production and in supply  versus demand, as well as to supply-side inflationary pressures.    3. The basic nature of the Greek economy,  characterized by overdevelopment in the field of what is mainly  middleman services, the small size of companies, excessive state  participation in production, low rates of capital accumulation  and modernization, repeated strike-induced interruptions in the  production process, absenteism, network and infrastructural  dysfunctions, etc.    4. The size and nature of the public debt. With a  public debt amounting to 145 percent of GNP, Greece is on the  brink of overindebtedness. However, the size of the debt is not  so important as its nature. Greece's public debt increased  spectacularly after 1980 in order to satisfy the sometimes  justified and sometimes irresponsible consumption demands of  various groups and of the government, but not the needs of  development, which may briefly give rise to inflationary  pressures, but also creates the possibility of absorbing such  pressures in the medium- and long-term through the national  product it generates.    As a result, the size and especially the nature of Greece's  public debt presently function as a strong structural source of  inflationary pressures and inflation.    5. The nature of the budgets has been inflationary  for a number of years, with the exception of one or two. The  reasons for this inflationary trend are, on the one hand,  increasing expenditures in conjunction with structural  weaknesses of public expenditures and, on the other hand, a  revenue gap. This gap is caused by the citizenry's weak  conscience toward paying taxes, the poor structure of the tax  system, the lack of efficient tax mechanisms, and the escape of  a significant share of the national income--notably the profits  from the underground economy--as well as the not uncommon resort  to printing money under the pressure of inelastic financial  needs.    6. The nature of the markets and the social  structure. Because of the existence of business oligopolies  and the lack of healthy competition, the markets for good and  services, capital, labor, and others are "inflexible" and  "protect" themselves through frequent price increases.    In addition, Greece's social structure is characterized by  deep fragmentation in strongly competing social groups  (physicians, lawyers, tradesmen, businessmen, trade unionists,  etc.) that aim at satisfying "selfish" interests often  incompatible with behavioral patterns serving the national  interest.    Thus, both the nature of the markets and the social  structure  lead to tendencies of higher prices, which have strong  repercussions on costs of production, and hence to inflation.</p>

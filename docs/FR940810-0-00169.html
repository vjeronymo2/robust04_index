OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994] identified two shipyard activities_wet removal/repair/installation and dry removal/repair/installation aboard vessels_where significant contact with asbestos can take place. CONSAD's cost analysis assumes asbestos removal will be performed by abatement specialists currently complying with requirements in the existing asbestos general industry standard (under which asbestos contact during shipbuilding and repairing is presently regulated). Specifically, abatement specialists in shipyards are believed to be currently using the following controls at near-100 percent level:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HEPA vacuums  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wet methods (where feasible)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulated areas with caution signs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Respirators (full-facepiece cartridge respirators and full-facepiece supplied-air respirators)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disposable protective clothing and gloves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Decontamination units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lunch areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training (General Industry standard)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exposure monitoring (daily)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Medical Exams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Written compliance plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For affected shipyards, OSHA's cost analysis assigned engineering controls and work practices required or implied by the revised asbestos standard. OSHA anticipates incremental costs associated with airtight regulated areas; drop cloths; critical barriers; glove bag systems; worker training and competent person training (Class I); initial exposure monitoring and development of objective data; and notification requirements. In all, OSHA projects annual incremental compliance costs of approximately $229 thousand for the shipbuilding and repairing sector. Of these costs, $137 thousand are associated with training required by the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation mandated by the ASHARA legislation. Therefore, net OSHA-related annual costs for ship repair under the revised asbestos standard are expected to total approximately $93 thousand (after rounding). Compliance costs for ship repair are presented in Table 10 by control requirements for affected shipboard activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

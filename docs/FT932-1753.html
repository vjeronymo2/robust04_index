			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political uncertainty leaves Nikkei 3% weaker POLITICAL uncertainty left share prices down 3 per cent and at their lowest level for four months, as reformists in the ruling Liberal Democratic party poised themselves to launch their own political groups, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 592.11, the largest day's fall of the year, at 19,212.43. The index opened at the day's best of 19,742.40 and dropped to a low of 19,039.55 in afternoon trading on selling by foreign institutions and individuals. Volume totalled 340m shares, against Friday's 253m. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that apart from squaring of positions by short-term traders, most investors remained on the sidelines. 'People are not sure what to do,' he added. Losers overwhelmed gainers by 1,044 to 52, with 31 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined for the sixth consecutive day, shedding 56.04 to 1,531.28, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.61 to 1,174.62. Bonds and the yen were also weaker. The dollar closed Y3.08 higher at Y110.48, while the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.38 to 106.91. Mr Souichi Enkyo, an economist at Bank of Tokyo, said the risks of holding the yen would increase sharply until the Tokyo summit at the beginning of next month. NTT, the benchmark for market sentiment, plunged Y79,000 to Y831,000. Margin traders, who faced additional margin requirements as the share price declined, were seen liquidating holdings. Receding hopes of credit easing due to the weaker dollar pushed down large-capital shares and financials. Nippon Steel fell Y18 to Y362 while Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y2,820. Brokerage issues were the hardest hit, the sector falling 6.7 per cent. Nomura Securities lost Y90 to Y1,920 and Nikko Securities Y80 to Y960. Some consumer electronics shares posted gains thanks to the dollar's strength. Sony put on Y50 at Y4,410 and TDK Y10 at Y3,750. However, heavy electricals weakened on profit-taking, Hitachi retreating Y33 to Y794 and Toshiba Y8 to Y688. In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 786.55 to 21,167.54 in volume of 20.7m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of Pacific Rim markets took a lead from Tokyo. Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur were closed for public holidays. HONG KONG slid by 2.7 per cent as the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group ended a first day of talks on the colony's future with no comment on progress. The Hang Seng index closed at the day's low, down 197.17 at 7,003.58. Cheung Kong and its affiliate, Hutchison, met the strongest selling pressure, falling 80 cents and 70 cents to HKDollars 26.80 and HKDollars 20.50 respectively. Semi-Tech added 40 cents at HKDollars 16 in spite of last Friday's announcement that it will pay Dollars 93m to settle a legal dispute. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index edged down 3.8 to 1,726.6 in a turnover of ADollars 183.5m. Against the trend, News Corp rose afresh by 10 cents to ADollars 7.60 on reports that it will be a shareholder in the float of the Seven Network. Advance Bank closed 4 cents lower at ADollars 8.05 after rumours that it might buy State Bank of New South Wales. Commonwealth Bank firmed 3 cents to end at ADollars 8.43. TAIWAN finished lower across the board and the weighted index shed 40.53 to 4,074.37 in thin turnover of TDollars 13.8bn. Financial stocks were among the hardest hit, with Cathay Insurance down TDollars 3 to TDollars 156 and First Commercial Bank losing TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 142. MANILA continued to consolidate, with much of the buying interest focused on new company issues. The composite index finished 3.95 softer at 1,573.91. BOMBAY managed to erase much of an early sharp fall as state-owned financial institutions and mutual funds became buyers late in the day. The BSE index finished 7.80 down at 2,218.88. The early decline was triggered by unsubstantiated rumours that Mr Harshad Mehta, the central figure in a Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal, would produce evidence to support his allegations that he paid Rp10m to Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao. KARACHI's pharmaceuticals rose on press reports of decontrol of medicine prices and financials gained on institutional buying, as the KLSE index gained 20.27 at 1,225.82. SEOUL gained ground in moderate trading, with buying focused on shares with low price-earnings ratios, financials and vehicle issues. The composite index closed 5.86 stronger at 766.06. COLOMBO saw demand for banks as the CSE all-share index moved forward 19.75 to 615.32 in a turnover of Rs68.2m. National Development Bank forged ahead Rs32.75 to Rs172.</p>

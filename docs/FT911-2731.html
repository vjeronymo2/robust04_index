			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Aetna adds Dollars 52m to bad loan reserves AETNA LIFE &amp; Casualty, the largest investor-owned insurance company in the US, added a further Dollars 52m to reserves for bad real estate loans and investments in the first quarter of 1991. As a result, net realised losses for the quarter totalled Dollars 16m, with the Dollars 52m provision being partially offset by Dollars 36m of realised capital gains. This compared with net realised gains of Dollars 20m in the first quarter of 1990, and contributed to a sharp fall in Aetna's first-quarter profits, from Dollars 180m to Dollars 137m after tax. Aetna added Dollars 224m to reserves in the fourth quarter of 1990. It said this brought loan reserves to 'an appropriate level'. At the end of 1990 total real estate write-downs and reserves for mortgage loans amounted to Dollars 550m.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Management: Bouquets in a French vineyard - Nicholas Lander looks at a project which employs mentally handicapped people Chateau de Lastours, a wine property which employs only the mentally handicapped, sprawls over crags above the motorway that joins the South of France to Spain. Since Lastours first released wine in 1977 it has won on average 12 prizes every year. It exports all over the world - Belgium, Switzerland, Japan and Germany - with the UK the biggest market. It has insisted on quality, and then used this as a management tool to instil pride in its workforce. The windswept piece of land was bought for a mere FFr600,000 (Pounds 63,000) in 1970 by the Comite Centrale d'Enterprise of a Marseille bank, Societe Marseillaise de Credit, and established as a Centre d'Aide par le Travail. Comites centrales were established by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to encourage companies to set up organisations to look after the welfare of their staff. The Marseille bank doubled the amount available for investment and specified it should be for the mentally handicapped. The scheme appealed to Jean-Marie Ligneres, hired as a newly-qualified oenologist in 1970, who has been managing director of Lastours since 1977. He recognised that he would have to supply the mentally handicapped workforce not just with an occupation but work that would produce recognised results. That way, he felt, their handicap could be lessened. The rebuilding of Lastours took seven years and the first vines were planted in 1973. Fifty hectares of stones were cleared by outside contractors. A village of small apartments, including married quarters, was built for the workers; there are tennis courts, rugby and football pitches and a swimming pool and all the buildings necessary for the making and ageing of the wine. The total investment by 1980 was FFr50m. Today, Lastours exudes the bustle, as well as the commitment, of a kibbutz. Visitors are continually drawn by new exhibitions and concerts as well as wine. During the 1970's a big management decision was taken. As work on the vineyard neared completion, Ligneres realised that there would be a need for someone with specific psychological expertise at the top. Aware that two 'chiefs' might lead to conflict, Ligneres enrolled as a psychology student, first at Montpellier then Toulouse. His doctoral thesis awarded in 1983 stressed that the mentally handicapped must be offered the possibility of being involved in the whole work process rather than repetitive, bitty jobs which allow them neither contact with the finished product nor bring recognition and dignity. From the beginning Lastours has concentrated on red wines rather than white because red wine making offers more processes for the whole team to be involved in. Red wine takes two years to make compared with nine months for white wine and it also offers the possibility of ageing and cellar work which most white wines do not. Ligneres has involved all his staff in every process from the back-breaking pruning of the vines to the more sociable manning of wine stands in France and abroad. Limited to a workforce of 60, of whom a third are women, Lastours is inundated with applications for places. The working week is 40 hours of which five are stipulated compulsory recreational time, and the pay is about FFr1,800 per month plus board and lodging. Recruiting good management has been the toughest challenge. The reputation of Lastours has attracted more than sufficient applicants, although Ligneres occasionally wishes for the fresh ideas that a higher staff turnover might bring. He manages with a team of 40, including ancillary workers, 12 specialist teachers, a psychiatrist who visits for three hours a week and a psychologist for six hours a week. As a financial organisation, Lastours is in an unusual position because it pays no interest to its bank. Last year it generated a turnover of more than FFr50m and although it has been in profit since 1990, it stresses that all profits are and will be reinvested. This somewhat artificial financial environment can make its competitors jealous - particularly when in 1987 Lastours declassified a lesser vintage to maintain its reputation. Although commercial considerations are important, they are secondary at Lastours. Growth has consistently been 40-50 per cent a year but the company has to ensure that the wine's success does not put too much pressure on the workforce.</p>

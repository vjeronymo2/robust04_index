			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Death-knell for the speculative venture  -Developers must learn from the errors of the 1980s - and from Keynes The recent publication of the second volume of Robert Skidelsky's biography of Keynes, The Economist as Saviour, offers a timely insight into the economic debates of the inter-war depression. These debates take on a new relevance today, as the British economy struggles to emerge from the longest recession of the post-war period. They are particularly pertinent to an assessment of the impact of the 1980s' property boom upon the wider prospects for the British economy in the 1990s. One of Keynes' great concerns was the tendency for savings to exceed the perceived investment opportunities in a mature economy such as Britain's. Uncertainty about the returns from slow-maturing capital investment projects tends to depress the rate of investment, but also to boost the rate of savings as a defensive measure. A rapid expansion in credit can temporarily overcome the imbalance. This typically leads to a speculative boom in the equities and property markets, as in the late-1980s. However, when the supply of credit is cut, the boom collapses and creates the risk of a prolonged slump - as happened in the 1930s and could recur in the 1990s. Keynes identified channels into which savings could be diverted if investment in new domestic capital projects seems too risky. These include hoarding in the form of money deposits, purchase of existing assets and investment overseas. All such forms of saving add to the store of wealth, but not to the stock of capital goods. Consequently they are deflationary because they represent a non-productive diversion of purchasing power away from the demand for goods and services. To this list we should add the more speculative forms of property development. For even when savings are being invested in new capital formation, the extent to which such investment is contributing to the productive capacity of the economy can vary enormously. It is a long-standing characteristic of the UK economy that less productive forms of investment tend to find favour over investment in new industrial plant and machinery. In part this reflects the traditional dominance of the City of London over provincial manufacturing interests, a legacy which has encouraged a strong 'rentier' tendency among owners of capital. This tendency encourages the view that the purchase of existing equities or property is safer than investment in new capital projects. However, Keynes thought that as real interest rates and investment returns fell, in response to a growing surplus of capital, then the result would be the 'euthanasia of the 'rentier'. Instead the opposite has happened. The demand for capital is stronger than ever: to fund Britain's growing trade and budget deficits and to meet the borrowing requirements of individuals. Consequently, real interest rates are as high as they have ever been. At the same time the tax regime encourages personal savings in the form of house ownership and pension schemes. We are all rentiers now. Our direct concern is to accumulate wealth which yields an immediate return. Inevitably the same rentier mentality pervades those financial institutions which invest savings on our behalf. Hence the short-termism of City investors. Hence a commercial property industry which strives to produce what it believes to be 'institutionally acceptable' rather than 'occupationally desirable' buildings. The result is a self-defeating tendency to develop too many high specification buildings without adequate reference to their productive potential. The 1980s building boom has been an example of this tendency. The trigger was financial deregulation and the motor was the credit expansion generated by deregulation. However, this credit has not been directed to rebuilding the UK's manufacturing base. Rather, it has been used to fuel an unsustainable growth in consumption and to fund the construction of too many shopping centres and London offices. All the leading economies with the exception of the US enjoyed an investment boom in the second half of the 1980s. In general this boom was biased towards plant and machinery investment, which expanded by as much as 45 per cent over the five years, compared with only a 16 per cent increase in non-residential building. Britain was the exception. It showed the highest increase in non-residential building investment of any of the G7 economies and the lowest increase in investment in plant and machinery. As a result it was the only one of the G7 to experience a lower rate of expansion of investment in machinery than in building. The implications of the contrasting profiles of investment in the UK and Germany are chastening. While the UK has been building marble-lined temples of commerce, the Germans have been pouring money into rebuilding the industrial base of eastern Germany. It is difficult to believe that the Germans' investment will not show the greater payback in the next 10 years. The UK's missed opportunity is all the more serious because it lessens its ability to take advantage of sterling's recent devaluation to generate an export-led recovery. However, the 1990s may be the decade of reckoning. The UK economy has been running a substantial trade deficit even in the depths of recession. Manufacturing output has fallen from 30 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to just 23 per cent at the beginning of the 1990s. The emergence of some sort of industrial regeneration strategy, however painful, seems inevitable. Less likely, would be a radical switch in incentives from personal savings to corporate investment. What would such a shift in priorities imply for the property industry? It means increased demand for modern industrial property; greater infrastructure investment; more modestly specified office and retail developments attuned to the needs of occupiers and not the perceived needs of investors; and, across all sectors, less speculative development and more customised buildings for specific occupiers. Otherwise the property industry will again be made to pay for the national weakness for what Skidelsky calls 'the triumph of making money over making things'.

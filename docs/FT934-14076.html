			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / People: Laird takes a seat on the bus Gavin Laird, the canny general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, is extending his interests to buses. Laird has been appointed a non-executive director of the company being formed by bus workers to acquire a part of the biggest of the seven English metropolitan passenger transport companies. The splitting and sale of GM Buses into two businesses, each of which is to be sold, is one of the biggest bus privatisations attempted so far. Laird, who is leading the bid for GM Buses North, says that trade unionists and employees would prefer the service to remain in public ownership. But, if privatisation were forced upon them, then employees would rather be the new owners. Each of the employees involved in making the bid is committing a minimum of Pounds 1,000. Laird says that if the bid is successful the company would be driven by one primary objective: to provide the travelling public of Greater Manchester 'with an efficient cost-effective service second to none'. Alan Westwell, GM Buses chief executive and managing director who has worked together with union representatives as a team in formulating the bid says he is 'delighted to have Gavin on board. His credibility, support and guidance gives us enormous strength'. If the bid is successful, Westwell would become md of GM Buses North and Laird chairman.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The visit by Army General Raul Castro, minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], heading a delegation from  the Ministry of the FAR and the Youth Labor Army [EJT] to EJT  integral farms in Havana Province, has concluded.    Today's report covers diverse aspects of the efforts of this  military division, ranging from task work, personnel,  production, and equipment to workers' welfare and productivity.  This EJT division, which was created seven months ago, tends 50  percent of Havana's lands and is already attaining significant  results.    Today, Raul Castro pointed out how much can be done even  under the difficult conditions we are experiencing, through  optimism, better use of resources, and better organization of  the labor force.    [Begin recording] [Castro] Yesterday, I briefly mentioned to  several leaders in Alquizar, several provincial agriculture  leaders, that the EJT is the pride of the FAR and that -- within  the framework of the law so no one can say we are threatening  anyone -- we are not going to let speculators or the  inefficiency of that large bureaucracy called state collection  pilfer their work and prevent it from reaching the population.  [end recording]    Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan states that experiences  such as these, given their importance and reach, ought to be  extended to state enterprises, Basic Cooperative Production  Units [UBPC's], and cooperatives.    [Begin Jordan recording] I believe this experience is  undoubtedly the most integral and complete I have seen. In the  future, it would be good for this type of visit, including  Raul's presence, to continue for assessment of the work of the  UBPC, and above all, the farming cooperatives, given their  importance. I believe there are many interesting things here  that we can broaden, implement, and generalize in the rest of  the production organizations, which have also accumulated a  series of experiences we ought to analyze.

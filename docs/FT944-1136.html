			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Turkmenistan devalues Turkmenistan has cut the value of its currency, the manat, to bring the official and unofficial rates closer together. The new rate, announced on Tuesday, of 230 manats to the dollar, cuts the rate from the previous official rate of 10 to the dollar and commercial rate of 75 to the dollar. The manat, one of the weakest of the new currencies in spite of Turkmenistan's huge reserves of natural gas, has been devalued by over 90 per cent in stages. The average wage in Turkmenistan is 1,000 manats a month, though most staples and services are subsidised to very low prices.</p>

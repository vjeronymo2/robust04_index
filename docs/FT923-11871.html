			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Employers consider seeking approval from Investors in People MORE EMPLOYERS are considering seeking approval from Investors in People, the government's scheme to improve training for people in work, according to a survey by the Industrial Society. The survey, which regularly polls personnel and training managers, said that in 1991, when the scheme was launched, only 25 per cent of respondents had decided to apply for IIP status and only 8 per cent thought they would be applying in the very near future. This year, 45 per cent of respondents were considering applying for the kitemark that signifies approval of their training programme. IIP, promoted and run by Tecs, assesses how companies train their staff  - including whether a company regularly reviews the training and developmental needs of all its employees. Take-up of the scheme has been slow, with 67 companies currently accredited, including Unilever, Shell, Boots The Chemist and J. Sainsbury. Tecs have no budget earmarked to promote the scheme and many Tecs have complained that they have insufficient funds to drive it. Tecs had hoped that government cash might pump-prime the initiative, but Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, told the national conference of Tecs last week there would be no additional funds provided by government.

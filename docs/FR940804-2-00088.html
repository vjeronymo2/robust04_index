Annually, chronic diseases are responsible for significant illness, death, economic cost, and diminished quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide. Improving methods of reaching and sustaining healthy lifestyles, promoting health education and disease prevention, and reducing high-risk activities which result in disease infection will result in significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. Approximately $312,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this program. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 29, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this program is for WHO to coordinate the dissemination of comprehensive chronic disease information and health promotion programmatic expertise among relevant agencies, nations, and health-care professionals worldwide. Findings from this project will be useful in further reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease mortality in the United States and in improving the provision of care through more simple and less expensive forms of technology, as well as contributing immeasurably to reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease mortality throughout the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CDC will collaborate in the design of research protocols, assist in the analysis and interpretation of data generated from each project, provide, as needed, other programmatic consultation and guidance in support of the program, provide continuing updates on scientific and operational developments in the areas of categorical and comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control, participate in the development of plans for the sharing and dissemination of program and research data and information, and assist in defining the scope, the development, and dissemination of plans for chronic disease prevention, research, and control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of life.

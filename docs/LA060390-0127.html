			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL WOULD PROTECT PRODUCTION PROCESSES  </P> <P> No doubt about it, biotechnology companies -- especially those making drugs --  have a patent problem. Biotech patents, particularly those covering production  processes but even, in many cases, the final product, are difficult to get and  often highly contested.  </P> <P> The problem, to a large measure, stems from the essence of the work: What  biotechnology makes really isn't all that new. And in patents, the emphasis is  on new.  </P> <P> The products that are expected to be biotech's blockbusters, such as growth  hormones, insulin, interferons and erythropoietin, are, simply put,  reproductions of what already exists in nature -- in our own bodies, in fact.  What's new in biotech is the ability to identify and isolate the genetic coding  for these substances and then produce vast quantities of them in their purified  forms.  </P> <P> In biotech, the production, or manufacturing techniques -- which process  patents are designed to cover -- are also part of nature. Biotech companies use  cells as miniature factories; as the cell reproduces itself, it also reproduces  the desired genetic material that has been inserted into it. Such techniques  are as "obvious" to a biologist as, say, the production method for making an  everyday pudding -- mixing the ingredients and stirring them over heat -- is to  an average cook.  </P> <P> Now, just as a cook or even a maker of packaged pudding mix can't patent the  stir-and-heat process, so is it nearly impossible for a biotech company to  patent the obvious manufacturing techniques it uses.  </P> <P> The Biotechnology Patent Protection Act proposed by Rep. Frederick C. Boucher  (D-Va.) would change all that, however.  </P> <P> The Boucher bill would extend patent protection to even obvious or common  processes as long as novel starting materials were used. In the pudding  example, if the pudding maker had "invented" a new starting ingredient --  perhaps a no-cholesterol egg -- she could, under the provisions of the bill,  patent the stir-and-heat process that used the new egg in puddings.  </P> <P> Why would she want to? Well, perhaps she couldn't get a patent on her  low-cholesterol pudding (which would be the case if other pudding makers before  her had made, perhaps even patented, low-cholesterol pudding using different  ingredients). And even if she had a patent on her egg, under existing U.S.  trade laws, foreign cooks could use her egg, make the pudding overseas and  import it without infringing on her patent.  </P> <P> That, in very simple terms, is what is happening in biotech. Often, researchers  at universities or even at other companies have identified the final product  long before a company succeeds in figuring out how to make it in large enough  quantities to be useful; so it can't obtain a product patent.  </P> <P> The company may be able to patent its discovery of the DNA sequences (genetic  coding), and even the kind of cells that will be able to serve a factory for  the desired substance. However, those patents do not really protect the  companies from foreign competition.  </P> <P> The Boucher bill would also amend trade laws so that foreign-made products that  infringed upon these new process patents, and even on the starting materials  patents, would be stopped from coming into the country.  </P> <P> Patent experts -- even those from companies supporting the bill -- don't see  the proposed legislation as a balm for all their patent troubles. The potential  for many different patents incorporating the same process could be troublesome,  and license arrangements could become more complicated. (For example, would  someone who had license rights to the no-cholesterol egg have to pay additional  license fees to use the egg in the stir-and-heat process?)  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, said John E. Kittle, director of the U.S. Patent Office's  biotechnology examination group, there will be "a lot of judicial  interpretation of where the property line is drawn." DONNA K. H. WALTERS  </P></p>

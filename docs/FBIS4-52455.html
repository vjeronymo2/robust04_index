			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Sabotage the People's Faith"] </F>   [Text] Four Islamic teachers were recently arrested in  Songkhla Province's Chana District on several charges, including  rebellion. Police authorities told a subsequent news conference  they believe the accused are responsible for the bombing  incidents that have taken place in different places in Songkhla,  Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces over the past two years. The  worst of these incidents was the explosion at the railway  station in Hat Yai District where three people were killed and  seventy others injured.    During the arrests the police gathered more evidence --  including firearms and documents in foreign languages -- with  which to incriminate the four preachers. The accused deny the  charges, however, insisting that they have no connection with  the movement responsible for those terrorist activities, which  were designed to show off to some Middle Eastern countries and  hence draw their assistance.    All four teachers are reportedly graduates from schools in  the Middle East. Police authorities are still looking for their  accomplices; some have reportedly fled and taken refuge in  Malaysia.    It should be noted that the authorities have no evidence to  link the four preachers to last year's torching of 35 schools in  the four southern provinces. Some suspected arsonists have  already been arrested, but the investigation has made very  little progress.    The authorities were very careful in handling this case. The  presence of senior police officers and the governor of Songkhla  Province during the arrest of the four was an indication that  the authorities must have sufficient evidence. The detention of  the four preachers, though, has caused suspicion and resentment  among some local Muslims as well as their students, who are very  likely to hold a protest rally. Hopefully, such a rally will be  peaceful, allowing justice to take its course. In any event, at  this point the accused are still innocent because a court has  not found them guilty.    We believe the arrests are a manifestation of the  authorities' determination to punish the culprits and will serve  to inform the general public about the Interior Ministry's  endeavors in this particular case. Unlike the school arsons,  the Interior Ministry has made progress.    We firmly believe that if the suspects have not committed  the  crimes they are accused of, the court of justice will set them  free. The court's decision will depend entirely on the evidence  both sides present during the trial. We therefore appeal to  people who disagree with the arrest of the four suspects to be  patient until the trial. We also appeal to the authorities to  make sure they have sufficient evidence before they take anyone  into custody, because they are playing with other people's  freedom and could sabotage the people's faith in government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Musiyenko report: "Crimea: A View Through the </F> Prism of the Civil Code"]    [Text] Aleksey Manannikov, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly International Affairs Committee, has  come up with a proposal to hold a session of the Russian  Federation Federation Council in Sevastopol, Simferopol, or in  any other Crimean city.    In his letter to Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the upper  house of the Russian parliament, he rationalizes the need for  such a session by the fact that the former Supreme Soviet of  Russia, which paid much attention to studying whether the power  organs of the former USSR and the RSFSR observed in 1954 all the  casuistic subtleties in turning Crimea over to the Ukrainian  SSR's subordination, did not study at all the question of  whether those organs were competent at all to complete such a  transaction.    "It is a well-known fact that the Crimean Autonomous  Republic  existed before World War II," A. Manannikov writes. "In 1945,  the ranking officials, who did not bother even to honor the laws  and the generally recognized rights and freedoms of their  citizens, made a decision abolishing the Crimean republic. The  criminal decision entailed the exiling from Crimea of a great  number of citizens of Tatar, Greek, German, Armenian, Bulgarian,  and other nationalities...."    The author of the letter thinks that the decision on  abolishing the Crimean Autonomous Republic as part of the USSR,  and on a transfer of the territory thus "freed" from its  legitimate owners to someone else, should be deemed invalid,  signifying that "taking account of the opinion of the majority  of the population of the Crimean Republic, measures should be  taken toward an amicable agreement on restoring it to its lawful  master, that is to Russia."    Drawing an analogy with civil legislation, A. Manannikov  quotes from Part III, Article 152 of the Civil Code: "If some  property should be acquired without payment from a person who  had no right to give it away, the owner shall have the right to  claim it in all instances." And he concludes: "Authorities of  the Ukrainian state have no more rights to claiming legitimacy  for owning Tavrida [Crimea] than does a citizen who receives as  a present from a thief some stolen property (fur coat, necklace,  etc.)."</p>

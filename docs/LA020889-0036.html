			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LACKADAISICAL CSUN MANAGES TO DISPOSE OF CAL STATE L.A., 72-70  </P> <P> Looking for a quiet place to study Tuesday night? The Cal State Northridge gym  was the place to be.  </P> <P> Sure, there was a basketball game going on, but that wasn't going to bother any  of the 217 in attendance.  </P> <P> Why, it was so quiet inside that Darren Matsubara, Northridge's point guard,  claimed he heard echoes when he called out a play.  </P> <P> "I didn't even have to yell," Matsubara said. "I'd just say, 'One' and everyone  in the gym could hear me."  </P> <P> Another person who could be heard loud and clear all night was Northridge Coach  Pete Cassidy, who was none-too-pleased with his team despite its 70-62 victory  over Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Going hard is a habit and we didn't display that at all tonight," Cassidy  said. "We got a 12-point lead and we figured it was over. We relaxed, and I'm  not pleased with that at all."  </P> <P> Fortunately for the Matadors, their opponent wasn't exactly bursting with  energy, either.  </P> <P> If, as Cassidy said, going hard is a habit, coasting was the trend in this game  -- even for those not directly involved.  </P> <P> "I can't understand what happened," CSUN forward Alan Fraser said. "It was like  everybody was in second gear and couldn't get out of it. The band . . . . I  think they were playing at half-speed, too. It was ridiculous."  </P> <P> Cal State L.A.'s record should have been the most obvious excuse after the  game. The Golden Eagles came in 3-17.  </P> <P> Still, those on the CSUN side denied taking their opponent lightly.  </P> <P> "I was worried about this one," Matsubara said. "The one thing I didn't want to  happen was a team that wasn't going to the playoffs to hurt us in the  standings. I didn't want to look back and say, 'that loss to Cal State L.A. is  the reason we're not going.' "  </P> <P> And with the current state of the standings in the California Collegiate  Athletic Assn., every game takes on that much more importance.  </P> <P> Northridge (13-8) is 4-4 in CCAA games, leaving it in a four-way tie for third  place with Chapman, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Cal State Bakersfield. The  Matadors play back-to-back games at home Thursday against Bakersfield and  Saturday against San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Cal State L.A. came in having won its first conference game in 23 tries last  Saturday against Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> That win, plus earlier strong performances against the CCAA's top teams, UC  Riverside and Cal State Dominguez Hills, had Matador players and coaches  concerned.  </P> <P> But the concern never manifested itself on the court.  </P> <P> "I just kept throwing people in and out to see if anyone wanted to play hard --  and smart," Cassidy said.  </P> <P> Said Matsubara: "We had no emotion at all. I kept saying to the guys in the  huddle, 'We keep playing around like this and they're going to sting us.' "  </P> <P> It almost happened.  </P> <P> Northridge coasted along with a double-digit lead for much of the second half  before Cal State L.A. clawed back into contention.  </P> <P> The Matadors led, 61-53, with five minutes left, but the Golden Eagles  outscored CSUN, 9-3, during the next two minutes to trim the margin to 64-62.  </P> <P> Northridge was clinging to a three-point advantage with 17 seconds left when a  foul -- and a few choice words from Coach Henry Dyer -- took the Eagles out of  contention.  </P> <P> Jemarl Baker of CSUN was fouled by Omar Bray with 17 seconds left, prompting  Dyer to take out his frustration on the officials who hit the CSLA coach with a  pair of double technicals and kicked him out of the gym.  </P> <P> Baker made all four free throws to stretch CSUN's lead to 69-62.  </P> <P> Cal State L.A. closed the gap behind the play of forward Rhodney Moore, who  scored a game-high 22 points and 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Matsubara and Fraser led Northridge with 14 points each. Derrick Gathers added  11 and Baker 10.  </P> <P> Todd Bowser missed his third game because of a sore hip that seems to be  getting worse. He will be examed by a doctor again today.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Setback for Miyazawa's party JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was defeated at an important by-election yesterday, heightening pressure within the party for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa to step down as prime minister to appease voters disillusioned with the scandal-tainted government. The upper house poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, was narrowly won by a trade union candidate backed by the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which had taken the seat in 1989 when the LDP was troubled by an earlier set of corruption scandals. In conceding defeat, Mr Miyazawa said that the party had waged an 'excellent fight' in attempting to regain the seat, but the result and a low voter turnout highlighted public disaffection with the LDP. Opposition politicians said the outcome was a significant victory for them, and showed that the public wanted reforms of the scandal-prone political system. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said that 'we deeply regret' failing to win and will 'do our best to revive public trust'. Mr Miyazawa had campaigned on behalf of his party, although the local campaign manager had suggested that it would be in the LDP's best interests if the prime minister stayed away. The branch had wanted to focus its campaign on local issues, drawing attention away from the scandals at the party's centre. The Miyagi area is also an important rice-growing district, and it was expected that some farmers, traditional LDP supporters, would have deserted the party or not voted as a protest against the expected liberalisation of Japan's rice market. One result could be to make the LDP even more cautious about rice reforms. It was the LDP's second poll setback in a month, and the party faces a difficult upper house election in July. Faction leaders are likely to meet to discuss whether Mr Miyazawa should lead the party into that election or whether his resignation would improve the LDP's popularity. The party would have difficulty finding a suitable replacement, particularly when the most serious of the scandals, alleged bribery by the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company, is still unfolding. And while Mr Miyazawa's faction has been implicated in a separate bribery episode, Mr Miyazawa himself is still generally regarded as a relatively 'clean' politician.

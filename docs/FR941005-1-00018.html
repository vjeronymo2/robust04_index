			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the questions at the end of this section, comment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought on the usefulness of these criteria in selecting an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment-base definition, as well as on whether additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or alternative criteria should be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Fairness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This criterion refers to the extent to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are neither systematically favored nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systematically disadvantaged due to factors such as size and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic location. Under this concept of fairness,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar institutions operating under similar circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and representing similar risks of failure and magnitude of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential loss to the insurance fund, would generally incur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar insurance costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fairness may suggest that claims receiving potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal protection in the event of a failure be assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equally. Similarly, since there are varying degrees of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection for different categories of claims, it could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that fairness demands higher assessment payments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater degrees of protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fairness may also refer to the extent to which abnormal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrences, such as the receipt at quarter end of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unusually large deposit to be held only briefly by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, affect the amount of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments. In this regard, fairness may suggest that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base should be defined in terms of averages,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would help smooth out the effects of such abnormal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrences, rather than on actual ``as-of'' report-date data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Measurability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This criterion refers to the extent to which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components of the assessment base can feasibly and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectively be calculated with a minimum degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainty and disagreement by separate, independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties (such as the institution being assessed and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an assessment base that is limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insured deposits might raise measurability concerns, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely and reliable calculations of only those deposits (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of deposits) that actually would be covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance in the event of a failure might not be feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (To the extent measurability is not an issue, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping necessary to support such a calculation might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be.) If measurability is a problem here, a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solution might be to identify a ``proxy'' intended to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a less precise (but related) substitute that is more readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available than actual insured deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Relation to Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Mixed feelings on Pacific Rim as Nikkei loses 1.4% CONCERN about the political situation in Russia held investors back in Tokyo and stock prices ended broadly lower, awaiting reaction in the European markets, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The 225-share Nikkei average fell 292.03, or 1.43 per cent, to 20,174.62, more than erasing Tuesday's 200-point gain prompted by the Bank of Japan's bigger than expected 0.75 percentage point discount rate cut. The index registered a high for the day of 20,380.74 and a low of 20,112.11. Volume was estimated at 300m shares, compared with 349.9m the previous day, and declining issues outnumbered advances by 959 to 115, with 111 stocks unchanged. The broader first section Topix index was down 21.68, or 1.31 per cent, at 1,628.12, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.64 to 1,251.68. News of the Russian political crisis had sent Nikkei futures prices falling in Chicago, laying the ground for a weaker Tokyo opening. The market was also hit by selling from arbitrage unwinding. After falling throughout the morning, the market was reluctant to move in afternoon trade, in the absence of much foreign demand. However, some buying by trust funds gave some stability at the lower levels and helped the Nikkei to tread water above the 20,000 mark. The decline was broadly based with no sectors advancing. High-tech shares were heavily traded. NEC retreated Y10 to Y935, Fujitsu Y9 to Y793 and Oki Electric Industry Y17 to Y520. Toshiba was an exception, moving ahead Y16 to Y698, boosted by some buying by foreign brokerages. Banking issues weakened across the board. The Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y70 to Y3,290, Nippon Credit Bank Y60 to Y6,010 and Sumitomo Bank Y70 to Y2,180. Among easier steel shares, Nippon Steel slipped Y2 to Y329 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y8 to Y680. Roundup WITH ONE or two markets oblivious to problems elsewhere in the world, the region's equity markets fell by an average of less than 0.5 per cent on the day. BANGKOK offered the biggest response as bad news below 1,000 on the SET index was interpreted as a sell signal, the index falling by 14.83, or 1.5 per cent, to 977.75 in turnover of Bt7.46bn. SINGAPORE recouped half of a 2.4 per cent intraday fall to end with the Straits Times Industrial index 25.77 down at 1,969.97. Volume amounted to 403.87m shares. CarnaudMetalbox dropped SDollars 1.90 to SDollars 9.80 on worse than expected interim earnings. MANILA mirrored New York's overnight decline on Russia's political turmoil, the composite index closing 18.28 lower at 1,921.43 in combined turnover up from 626.44m pesos to 672.46m pesos. HONG KONG and AUSTRALIA, hosting the biggest equity markets on the Pacific Rim outside Japan, did little in aggregate terms, the Hang Seng index shedding 16.41 to 7,478.90 in HKDollars 2.64bn turnover and the All Ordinaries losing 5.9 at 1,919.3, after an opening 1,927.5, in ADollars 463.8m trade. In the former, investors were looking to the vote tomorrow on Beijing's bid to host the 2000 Olympics. The result, it was estimated, could move the Hang Seng index by 200 to 300 points either way. In the latter, a strong golds sector offset big falls elsewhere. Winners on the day included KARACHI and SEOUL. Pakistani stocks saw fresh buying in the energy sector after the government announced plans to privatise the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC), and the KSE index climbed 13.75 to 1,327.11. Seoul survived late institutional selling to finish with the composite index a token 2.90 ahead at 697.56.</p>

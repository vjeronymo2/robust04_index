			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: UK financial reports repay a diligent reader - The need for skill in interpreting company accounts THE STATE of UK financial reporting has provoked some agitated debate in recent weeks, even verging on a state of panic. It has been suggested that accounts have become so unreliable as to be valueless. We fundamentally disagree. After months researching UK accounting policies and their application in the accounts of several hundred leading British companies for a book published next week, we feel equipped to offer a different view. No one would claim that the present rules on financial reporting in this country are ideal. But we believe British company accounts compare very favourably with those of most other countries, and provide a great deal of useful information for those with the skill to interpret it. Regrettably, we sometimes wonder how many users of accounts really have that skill. Although this might be considered the fault of over-complicated accounts, we think it might equally be seen as a criticism of the users. One perennial problem lies in the widespread misunderstanding of what accounts can, and cannot, do. Their arithmetical neatness suggests to the layman a precision and completeness that is in fact wholly unattainable. The affairs of large companies are highly complex, and can no more be encapsulated in a few simple measures than can the workings of the British economy. Accounts should not be regarded as objective statements of fact, but only as a subjective and stylised description of a company's financial affairs. The underlying reality which they seek to describe is to be found in the transactions which the company undertakes, and the cash flows which are derived from them. This is where objective reality stops, and subjective interpretation has to take over. There is an extensive framework of rules and practices which govern the presentation of accounts. But their application requires considerable professional judgment, and different people will make different choices in exercising that judgment. In addition, accounts have to deal with estimates as well as known amounts, and there is obviously room for differences of opinion when making these estimates. Sophisticated investors know this, and also understand the political motivations which influence the manner in which boards of directors wish to present their companies. Consequently, they treat the accounts with an appropriate degree of circumspection. They also appreciate that the accounts are only a small part of the total information available about a company to assist their investment decisions, and give them appropriate weight alongside these other sources. Despite this, we frequently hear cries such as: 'How can Polly Peck go bust when its last accounts reported record profits?' Such a question can easily be answered by anyone diligent enough to have read the last accounts in full, as they clearly demonstrate that this was a high risk investment and not suitable for widows and orphans. Both the low UK tax charge and the segmental analysis showed that most profit was not earned in the UK but in much more risky economies. A simple rearrangement of the statement of source and application of funds into the format of a cash flow statement would have revealed a very large outflow of cash from operating activities. It was also quite evident that the group had just taken on a very significant debt burden in connection with the Del Monte acquisition. This is not to imply that the accounting profession can be self-satisfied about the state of UK financial reporting. Many companies produce excellent annual reports, and their boards clearly take their reporting responsibilities very seriously. But some others are much less praiseworthy and convey a shifty and devious impression, using creative accounting to prop up their otherwise sagging performance. One positive feature of UK accounting rules is that they require extensive disclosures. These usually make it abundantly clear to the informed reader that the company is presenting a somewhat generous view of its financial position. For example, even though the existing standards on accounting for acquisitions are weak, the disclosure requirements are strong. The unfortunate thing is that so few analysts and other commentators seem to be capable of recognising these signs. If they were, the market place itself could act as a more effective force for good accounting. In the absence of a stronger influence towards good accounting from the market place, do the accounting rules need to be improved? In principle, yes, but this is easier said than done. We certainly do not need more rules. Accounting standards which seek to regulate every conceivable circumstance are ultimately self-defeating because they get bogged down in their own complexity and often open more loopholes than they close. More insidiously, they risk changing the nature of financial reporting from a process of communication to a compliance exercise, in which anything which is not explicitly forbidden acquires a spurious legitimacy. That spawns an avoidance industry which sees accounting rules in the same light as tax laws. Passing more laws does not make people more honest. What we need is clearer principles, which make it harder for preparers of accounts to rationalise dubious treatments both to themselves and to their auditors. Based on our review of company accounts, we believe that some of the areas which are most open to abuse do not correspond to the apparent priorities of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB). These include fair value accounting, and the treatment of fixed assets and depreciation. There are also a number of existing accounting standards which are in urgent need of reform. We would highlight SSAP 15, on deferred tax, and SSAP 24, on accounting for pension costs. Although the ASB commissioned studies on these issues a year ago, we have yet to see any results. In addition, we have doubts about some of the topics already tackled by the ASB. Just ten months after the new cash flow standard was introduced, for example, our research shows that widespread inconsistencies have already developed through what we identify as deficiencies in the standard. We are glad to see that the ASB has embarked on the most difficult challenge of all laying down a framework for accounting in its Statement of Principles. While we are not convinced that their proposals under this project so far are heading in the right direction, we entirely endorse their decision to undertake the quest. But the main problem is one of interpretation. It is not that UK accounts fail to provide useful and reliable information. They convey a great deal to the diligent and skilled reader. What we most need is to expand the number of these readers with these attributes.

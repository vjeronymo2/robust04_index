She said Gamsakhurdia and part of his supporters were  ambushed in a village but she was not told about its location.    Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said her husband had told his supporters  to  blow themselves up with grenades in the face of an overpowering  pro-government unit. But he later shot himself dead "not  wanting to cause anguish and pain to his associates," she said.    Gamsakhurdia said she was told about her husband's death  only  on Wednesday.    Gamsakhurdia's death puts an end to the national liberation  movement in Georgia, which will forever remain in slavery,  Manana said in tears. She said her husband was Georgia's last  hope.    She said she would like her husband to be buried next to his  father's grave in the courtyard of their house in Tbilisi,  something she said the government would never allow.    The 54-year-old Gamsakhurdia took over the country's  national  democratic movement in 1989 following the death of its leader  and well-known human rights campaigner Merab Kostava. In the  same year, pro-democracy groups forged a "Round Table-Free  Georgia" alliance which won an overwhelming majority in  Georgia's free elections a year later, its first for many years.    In 1991, Gamsakhurdia became the country's first  democratically-elected head of state after gaining 97 percent of  the vote. However, he was accused of dictatorship and overthrown  in December 1991, after the anti-government forces mounted an  attack on the presidential palace. Gamsakhurdia left it and  went into hiding in the Chechen republic early in January 1992.  However, the former president returned to western Georgia last  fall to take charge of troops loyal to him.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. move for early  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed  at putting pressure on the negotiations between North Korea and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a senior  government official said Friday.    "If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early  date, I think that the anti-missile missiles will be deployed in  Japan instead," he said.    Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy Patriot missile  batteries at U.S. Army bases in South Korea in March, he said.    "U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval for the  deployment of Patriot missiles, but I guess that sooner or later  he will approve it," he said. "The South Korean Government  agrees to the deployment in principle and the intercepter  missiles will be deployed at the bases of U.S. Forces here in  March or April at the latest. The number of Patriot missiles to  be deployed here is 36. They are for protection of strategic  points of U.S. Forces in South Korea rather than for defense of  overpopulated areas including Seoul and the metropolitan area."    Deployment of Patriots on the Korean peninsula is the first  step in establishing the theater missile defense (TMD) system,  which the U.S. Government is pushing for on a long-term basis.    Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment  of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against  North Korean attack.    Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, requested  deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against  Scud missile attacks by North Korea.</p>

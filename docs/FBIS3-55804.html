			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A government session took place today on  Toompea. At the post-session news conference President Lennart  Meri's speech was also under discussion. Mati Kirotar reports:    [Kirotar] The rivalry between Kadriorg [presidential  residence] and Toompea [seat of government and parliament] seems  to have ended for the time being. The subject of the  presidential speech in the Riigikogu [parliament] today came up  again at the news conference after the government session.  Premier Mart Laar said that he had not declared any kind of war  on the president. [passage omitted]    [Begin Laar recording] There were definitely many very  accurate observations in Mr. President's speech, in particular  those to do with rivalry between Andres and Pearu [reference to  a literary classic]. I think that such rivalry has indeed  damaged the Estonian state. I believe that our common aim is to  avoid anything similar in the future. There were also some  other aspects which I fully subscribe to, for example the influx  of Russian capital into the Estonian economy, as Mr. President  claimed. As far as Russian capital influx into Estonia is  concerned, this is indeed under the government's close scrutiny.  We have for example arrived at a position not to support the  granting of banking licenses in Estonia to Russian banks,  whether state or non-state. Or at least we would consider each  individual application very thoroughly. I believe that the new  economics minister will definitely... [changes thought], as Mr.  Meri sees a problem in this area and pays serious attention to  it the problem has arisen for Mr. Meri at the moment [as heard].  I am not fully certain that this is so and I would not like to  accuse the outgoing economics minister of anything. [passage  omitted]    I hope that these shocks of the past few days will not lead  us further afield but will educate us instead to conduct our  affairs better. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

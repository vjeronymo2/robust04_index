			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Observer: Expectations Who is the Centre for Policy Studies' favourite couple? Why the newly-weds, of course, columnist Barbara Amiel and publisher Conrad Black, who will be in Brighton next week for the Tory party conference fresh from their two-month 'working honeymoon'. The Thatcherite thinktank CPS has asked Amiel to deliver its annual lecture  -traditionally held on the Thursday of the conference. Two years ago, Conrad Black was the guest speaker. His fiercely anti-federalist words, entitled 'Conservatism and the paradox of Europe', fanned a heated debate, including on the board of CPS, which found itself in less than complete harmony over Europe. Amiel, meanwhile, is set to speak on the suggestive subject: 'What women can expect from John Major'. Observer can't help feeling the more urgent question is what the nation can expect from its prime minister.</p>

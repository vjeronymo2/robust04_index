			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / TSB reduces mortgage rate TSB BANK has cut its mortgage interest rate from 11.5 per cent to 10.95 per cent for new borrowers in England and Wales. The rate will apply to existing borrowers from March 27. The move was prompted by Abbey National's cut earlier this month, which was followed by the main building societies. NatWest is the only other bank so far to have cut its mortgage interest rate.</p>

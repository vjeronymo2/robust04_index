			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (10): New way of managing skills and resources / Case study of Rockwell Graphics at least in the UK edition - was printed on a press made by Rockwell Graphic Systems, a leading manufacturer of printing presses for newspapers. Every printing press is slightly different, and every customised delivery involves the scheduling of a variety of skills and resources as the press is commissioned. Sometimes this happens on the other side of the world - and to co-ordinate its resources, Rockwell uses Artemis, the mainframe-based software from Lucas Management Systems. When installing outside the UK, Rockwell had felt that the problems of controlling resources were magnified by distance. 'It was a matter of bringing down the time it takes to install a printing press and reduce costs, ' explains Maurice Leyland, the manager of information and material systems. 'We felt we had a problem, but we didn't know what was on the market, and the first goal was to find out exactly what was needed.' Decision-making, he admits, was very much by 'gut feel,' using very simple reports - 'it was a matter of establishing control over an inherently manual process,' he adds. With 20 projects annually, and each taking nine months to a year to complete, the main problem was scheduling scarce resources, such as the skilled software engineer who set up the presses. The experience of two full-time project managers, one with an engineering background was a help in establishing a detailed requirements' analysis. 'It was a focusing exercise. We came up with the need for project management disciplines,' he adds. The requirements' definition that followed was derived from establishing the information which Rockwell thought it should be providing to its customers. 'We wanted graphics to help us demonstrate that we were in full control of all eventualities in the installation process,' explains Maurice Leyland. 'I call it the 'gee whizz factor'.' ROCKWELL wanted a mainframe product, and although it explored several PC products as well, it found them incapable of managing multiple projects which all called on the same scarce resources. Artemis fulfilled the requirements of user-friendliness, and provided the scheduling facilities Rockwell wanted, as well as needing little extra in the way of hardware resources, since it fitted on the existing IBM mainframe. Rockwell also makes use of a PC tool, Schedule Publisher, which links with the mainframe. There was also board-level interest in the choice, for the need for a solution was recognised worldwide. It was also seen as something that would link with all other Rockwell systems, such as production control and material requirements' planning. It would even have a role in the sales function, providing strong control from the start, so that sales, engineering, manufacturing and customer services would all work more closely together. The entire contract was worth Pounds 500,000, split more or less equally between the cost of the software, and training and consultancy. The software project is 'owned' by customer services, and the in-house effort to promote its use is driven by Frank Williams, customer services manager. Maurice Leyland believes that use of the product has forced some changes for the better - 'there are a lot of thought processes that have to be changed. We're going to break down the barriers between different areas of specialisation. Everything becomes visible.' However, he offers some valuable advice: 'Beware of the expense. It's a costly commitment over a long period of time and the expense comes far ahead of the benefits, The lifespan of a two or three-year order means that the benefits are not visible straight away.' ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS Artemis 9000 This product runs on mainframes, providing comprehensive planning and control solutions which can be customised to meet specific needs of different companies. In addition there is an easy-to-use PC project management tool, Schedule Publisher. The Artemis family of products also runs on other systems. It is widely used in in defence, manufacturing, aerospace, and other industries. Suppliers: Lucas Management Systems, founded in 1977 in the UK, is a subsidiary of Lucas Industries. Turnover: more than Pounds 50m in 1991/2. Number of users: more than 1,000. Hardware and operating systems: IBM RS6000, ICL DRS6000, HP 9000 300/400, 700/800, DEC system Ultrix, SCO Unix, SUN4, Bull DPX/2, SUN SPARC, IBM mainframes, and all PC LANS. Sales and support: direct from Lucas, with full support worldwide, maintenance cost undisclosed. Other services available: Seminars, training, technical bulletins. User views: Pros - 'the number of hardware platforms, ability to allocate the same resources across different projects, ability to handle large volumes of data, flexibility, level of support available.'

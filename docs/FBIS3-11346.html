			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 19 Mar (EFE) -- The rebel leader known  as Subcommander Marcos warned today that the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) could attack again if the Mexican Armed  Forces continues their harassment.    Marcos told local media that some EZLN members were tortured  after their capture on 6 March and said that if the situation  continues, the rebels could take up arms again and repel any  attack.    "Everything indicates that a military offensive is being  prepared regardless of the results of the consultations" held  after the peace talks with the government and that "the Army has  already begun to mobilize," Marcos said.    The guerrilla leader added that the Armed Forces have been  constantly harassing the EZLN by detaining Indians, patrolling  the area, and collecting military information.    Marcos said that all of these actions have forced the  Zapatists to change their minds about peace and prepare for a  probable counterattack.    "We could go into action again. We cannot trust a government  that talks of peace while taking warlike actions," he stated.    Marcos said everything indicates that the government is  seeking a military solution, not a political one. He explained  that currently there is no peace agreement, only a government  proposal that is being studied by the Indian communities.    Marcos also said that the EZLN has received information  about  a probable military attack on the Zapatists before May to  annihilate the guerrillas before the presidential campaign  enters its most critical stage. "The government's wants to  behead our movement by removing the leadership in a surgical  operation," he reported.    Marcos said 10 Zapatists have been detained since the Armed  Forces began to patrol Indian communities. These persons are  probably questioned to learn more about the guerrillas'  strategies and positions.    He said that the government's actions will only increase the  EZLN's distrust of the government and, if the Army attempts to  attack Zapatista positions, the guerrillas will respond in kind.  The present truce in Chiapas, he said, is an "undeclared war"  that will quickly break out again if the government decides to  attack.    The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January when the  EZLN took up arms against the government. The EZLN engaged the  Mexican Army in bloody combat early in the conflict, resulting  in at least 150 dead, 500 wounded, and some 20,000 refugees,  according to unofficial figures.</p>

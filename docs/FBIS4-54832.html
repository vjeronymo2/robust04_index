			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Marusic: "The Serbs Are Advancing"] </F>   [Text] Mostar (from VJESNIK's staff correspondent) -- The  situation regarding the destroyed town of Gorazde and the Serbs'  (non)withdrawal is still vague (because of another example of  the international factors agreeing to play the Serbs' game),  but, on the other hand, it is increasingly certain that the  Bosnian Serbs -- even if they forego further attacks on Gorazde  -- do not intend to give up further conquests of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to "annex" it to the "republic of  Srpska." The concentration of Serbian forces around Gorazde --  from the territory of the "FRY" alone, 60 tanks and 80 trucks  packed with soldiers came over to Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was,  unfortunately, just a drop in the ocean considering the scope of  last week's Serbian military operations in the area of Brcko,  Orasje, and Usora, and, especially surprising (after so many  months of cease-fire), on the Mostar-Stolac front lines.    The main brunt of their assault is to be expected in the  area  of Orasje and [Bosanski] Samac, where the Serbs are constantly  applying pressure to expand the corridor (which in its present  state cannot guarantee unobstructed passage and connections  between "the Serbian lands" to their liking). Eighty tanks that  have recently been stationed in Bijeljina (brought from Valjevo  and Zajecar) and the presence of a great number of commandos  from Nis, provide enough "guarantee" of the seriousness of  Serbian intent and inevitability of a new battle for [Bosanska]  Posavina. Furthermore, the Serbs even have the nerve to  threaten towns on the left bank of the Sava -- Slavonski Brod  and Zupanja -- trying to provoke new conflicts in Croatia as  well.    That the Serbs do not consider this war over, although they  control two-thirds of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, is evident  from the concentration of forces of the Eastern Herzegovinian  Corps (some of whose units are also fighting in Gorazde) and  additional units of "volunteers" and the regular Yugoslav Army  in the Neretva valley, around Stolac and Mostar. Thus, long  since stated Serbian desires to gain access to the sea and to  the left bank of the Neretva are again in focus. Daily  provocations along the demarcation lines, which sometimes grow  into serious attacks, support this thesis. Those attacks became  the daily practice after the signing of the Washington Agreement  and they have recently escalated, causing panic among Muslims on  the left bank of the Neretva.    Naturally, the units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats are  prepared to fight back and repel the possible Serbian offensive,  that is, to defend Mostar and Stolac, if the Serbs threaten the  territory under their control, but the Muslim side should be  aware of this and change some of its views regarding the  Washington Agreement (General Arif Pasalic in Mostar is one of  the biggest obstacles to the normalization of relations) if it  really wants to form the federation, which, among other things,  would also have a joint defense against Serbian aggression.</p>

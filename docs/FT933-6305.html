			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dixons exits UK property market via Pounds 28m deal Dixons Group, the retailer, has agreed to sell a portfolio of property to Legal &amp; General, the assurance company, for Pounds 28.55m in cash. The deal virtually completes Dixon's exit from the UK property market, which it announced in July 1992. Mr Robert Shrager, corporate finance director of Dixons, said that it had decided to pull out of the UK property market, which it entered in the mid-1970s, because of its highly speculative nature. Dixons said it had no plans to dispose of its Continental European portfolio, which includes about Pounds 100m of property in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Germany. It said this portfolio had been historically successful. The portfolio includes about 30 properties in various sectors throughout the UK.</p>

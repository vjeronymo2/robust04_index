			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / US factory output falters Growth in US manufacturing slowed in April, reinforcing the view that the economy is recovering only sluggishly, Reuter reports from New York. The Purchasing Managers' Index, one of the first clues to how the economy performs each month, fell to 51.3 per cent from 54.1 per cent in March. Although any reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is expanding, the decline in April was unexpected and sparked a mild rally on the bond market.</p>

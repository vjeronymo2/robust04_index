			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Observer: Optimum speed Full marks to the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for a strongly worded missive on Monday. The bean-counters savaged proposals emanating from HM Customs &amp; Excise to prevent holding companies from receiving VAT rebates. Unfortunately, last Friday Customs issued a press release announcing it had all but abandoned its proposals. Perhaps the tax faculty had difficulty understanding the release; it contained so many double negatives that a sceptic might think Customs was trying to conceal all suggestion it had backed down. Or maybe the tax accountants were just exhibiting their characteristic caution and holding fire until they knew they had backed a winner. Then again, those more familiar with the labyrinthine workings of the Institute might feel there is another explanation. After all, the original Customs proposals were announced last October.</p>

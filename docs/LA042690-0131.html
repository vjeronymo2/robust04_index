			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAIWAN SEEKING UNOFFICIAL TIES WITH MAINLAND  </P> <P> The Taiwanese have proposed swapping unofficial representatives with China -- a  major step toward ending one of the last Cold War standoffs.  </P> <P> Senior Cabinet official Ma Ying-jeow on Wednesday told legislators that Taipei  wants to set up "private offices" in cities throughout China and would  reciprocate by allowing Beijing to do the same in Taiwan.  </P> <P> "Our contact would be . . . practical and mutual," said Ma, one of the chief  architects of Taiwan's China policy.  </P> <P> He stressed that the suggestion does not imply recognition of the Beijing  government.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many Taiwanese believe that the older hard-liners finally have  been forced to abandon their policy of "no contact, no negotiation, no  compromise" with Beijing.  </P></p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Training facility for British Telecom A Pounds 25m contract has been awarded to WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION's eastern region to build a residential training centre (pictured) for British Telecom at Kents Hill in Milton Keynes. Eight two-storey buildings will be constructed during the two-year project, creating more than 241,000 sq ft of accommodation on the eight-hectare site. In addition to housing BT's training facilities, the development will also provide conference, restaurant, office and sports amenities together with extensive residential accommodation. Architect RMJM has designed the buildings using traditional brickwork walls with generous overhanging eaves to the slated pitched roofs. When the project is completed, the densely landscaped sloping site will incorporate some 3,800 trees and will provide parking for more than 800 cars. Wimpey's work gets under way on site at the end of April with quantity surveyor Beard Dove and project manager Bucknell Austin acting in association with RMJM.</p>

A ship on charter to a Participant shall not be subject to contribution under this Agreement in the case where the period of contribution would be longer than the remaining term of the Participant's charter or in a case where the contribution would otherwise breach the terms of the charter party, but such tonnage shall be included in the calculation of the Participant's controlled tonnage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The ``controlled tonnage'' of each Participant shall be divided into two categories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Level I <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Vessels of the Participant which are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Subject to Title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1171  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) It is anticipated that Title VI will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators and the Secretary. Vessels covered by an operating agreement are in Level I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Otherwise required by law to be made available to meet national defense requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Level II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _All other vessels of the Participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Level I vessels shall be provided immediately in response to the call of the Administrator and instructions of the Administrator are to be observed with the utmost dispatch. Level I vessels will be called into service before Level II vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Level II vessels shall be provided according to the schedule set forth in the call of the Administrator. Level II vessels will be called into service if and when Level I vessels actually provided are not sufficient to meet the emergency. A Participant may offer Level II vessels for service as Level I vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Other than the specific use of ships described in VI.C.2.b. (foreign-flag feeder vessels), it is expected that vessels covered by an operating agreement will be utilized to the maximum extent possible for line haul service to meet DOD requirements. When a specific ship covered by an operating agreement is removed from regular service to meet DOD requirements, a foreign-flag ship may be employed to replace the ship taken from regular service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Administrator retains the right under law to requisition ships of Participants. A Participant's ships which are directly requisitioned by the United States or which are under other U.S. Government voluntary arrangements shall be credited against the Participant's proportionate contribution under this Agreement. Ships on charter to DOD when this Agreement is activated shall not be so credited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equitable Contribution of Intermodal Equipment_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. ``Controlled intermodal equipment'' shall mean such equipment as is needed in the operation of a Participant's intermodal shipping system and which a Participant owns or leases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. During the standby period, the Administrator shall determine the inventory of controlled intermodal equipment as of a specific date each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. When an ocean carrier Participant contributes containerships or partial containerships, or capacity, it will provide containers in accordance with VI.C.4. above and chassis as specified in a Plan of Action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Each Participant agrees to contribute intermodal equipment as provided in a Plan of Action, which may require contribution in the proportion of its inventory of each type of equipment to the total inventory of that type held by all Participants; Provided <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , that, at the discretion of the Administrator, on the advice of the Committee, when a Participant contributes specialized equipment which is not available from all Participants, its proportionate share of common types of equipment may be adjusted so that its overall contribution is in approximately the same proportion to its total available inventory as are the overall contributions of other Participants to their available inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

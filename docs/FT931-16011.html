			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Man in the News: Driven to his destination - David Crossland David Crossland sold 1.7m holidays last year. When it came to going away himself, however, the chairman and founder of Airtours persuaded his wife not to take a summer break. Instead, he spent two weeks in front of a computer screen, selling holidays. In spite of owning 35 per cent of the UK's third-largest holiday tour operator, now capitalised at about Pounds 250m, Crossland's appetite for deal-making is undiminished. 'I really like parting people from their money. It's an art form to give good service.' This week, Crossland embarked upon his largest transaction. In a move that could bring Airtours into a bruising price war with Thomson, the dominant holiday company in the UK for more than a decade, he launched a Pounds 215m bid for Owners Abroad, number two in the UK market. If successful, the bid will put him in charge of a Pounds 500m holiday empire that is run from a converted Lancashire mill known as the Tardis surrounded by a field of sheep. A quiet and - for the travel business - uncharacteristically retiring boss, Crossland, a 46-year-old native of Burnley, appears the antithesis of more colourful characters such as Harry Goodman of ILG, and Sir Freddie Laker, who have passed through the travel industry's revolving door. 'I'm a boring workaholic, so my wife says,' Crossland repeatedly jokes. Though his house backs on to the fairway of a golf course, he says he does not play. He likes music and tennis and relishes the time he spends with a family. Nevertheless, he sees little of them because of his consuming passion, the travel business. Rising before dawn, he drives his red Jaguar XJ12 from Cheshire to the office at Helmshore, in the Pennines, by 6 am. The review of the previous day's work is complete by 8 am, and he says he is exhausted two hours before he goes home at about 8 pm. Asked why he is driven to work so hard, in spite of his now substantial wealth, Crossland's explanation is compelling in its simplicity. 'I actually enjoy it,' he says, almost apologetically. 'Every day I get up, it's as good as the second day at the travel agency - the first day I was frightened.' That first day, 30 years ago, followed a less than easy childhood. His father was a wholesale fruit and vegetable trader but also played football for Burnley, and worked in the evenings as a toast-master and club singer. The family took one-week holidays in traditional working-class resorts like Skegness. 'We were not a very well-off family but we were all very well looked after.' But it was only after he 'struggled' to pass three 'O' levels and was prevented from following his mother into hospital administration that he went to work in the travel agency. Crossland talks about his school days with the candour of a man who has proved he can be successful without conventional qualifications. 'Maybe I was not capable of taking in things very fast,' he says. 'I changed the day I walked into a travel agency - it was like someone turned the key. It was this amazing place with unbelievably cheap prices.' Nine years later, aged 25, a client asked if Crossland would buy his two holiday businesses. 'I cannot to this day say why I did not say I had no money.' But most of money he borrowed - amounting to some Pounds 8m - was paid back in nine months. From 1972 to 1980 most of the profits were ploughed back into buying more travel agencies. From this base in the Manchester area, Crossland cut his teeth as a tour operator, developing an instinct for destinations that would sell. 'We had begun to buy blocks of tours from (the tour company) Intasun,' he says. 'We bought whatever we could see there was a demand for over the counter; you can tell on the first day a brochure comes out.' Crossland then took one of the key decisions that led to a change in Airtours' fortunes. 'I could see retail margins were going to get quite fine,' he says. He also spotted a lack of flexibility in the market. Existing tour operators would, for example, insist that if you wanted Malta, you flew on a Wednesday - most working people in the Manchester area could only fly at weekends. He began direct buying of aircraft seats and accommodation in resorts, selling the packages through his Manchester-based travel agencies. In 1980, his first year, he sold 900 packages; the second 23,000, and by 1985, 250,000. Crossland jokes this was, in fact, a bigger transformation than Airtours will undergo if it is successful in taking over Owners Abroad's 2m holiday packages. 'There was no management in Airtours. I wrote the brochures, did all the hotel buying, costed it, priced it and sold it over the counter.' Only after 1985 did Crossland begin to bring in the managers and accountants who provided the professional support that helped him to float Airtours in 1987, just before the stock market crash. For three years the shares fluctuated between 24p and 42p. But in 1991, Airtours was the best-performing stock in London, rising to a peak of 334p in 1992, confirming Crossland's super-rich status. What Crossland is attempting now, however, is in a different league. Almost overnight he plans to double Airtours' size through an acquisition after years of organic growth. And Thomson, which has not faced a similar sized competitor in 20 years, is unlikely to watch placidly as its dominance is challenged. While Crossland's knowledge of the business and tight control of Airtours is grudgingly acknowledged in the industry, there are competitors who think he may be moving too fast. 'He has grow up in the business and is a loner,' says one rival. 'But he has changed and is beginning to believe his own propaganda. I believe in walking; he is running and he might trip up.' Crossland disagrees and is at pains to dispel the idea that he is throwing a gauntlet at Thomson's feet. His advisers maintain that a man who would retain a 17 per cent stake in Airtours after a merger is likely to have calculated the risks of a price war. Crossland says he is simply working for shareholders and trying 'to turn the holiday business into a credible business', trying to win respectability for an industry that is only 30 years old.</p>

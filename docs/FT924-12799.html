			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Gillette climbs on strong progress from razors side STRONG progress in its core razors business helped Boston-based Gillette, which is seeking to buy the UK's Parker Pen business, to report profits after tax of Dollars 128.2m in the third quarter to end-September. This compares with Dollars 104.1m in the same period a year earlier, with sales rising from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.25bn. Earnings per share were 10 cents higher, year-on-year, at 58 cents. The third-quarter figures bring Gillette's after-tax profits for the first nine months of 1992 to Dollars 374.5m, compared with Dollars 296.3m in the same period of 1991. Gillette said that both sales and profits of its core blade and razors business grew strongly during the quarter, with profits from Braun products rising 'substantially'. Sales and profits in the Oral-B dental products division also made significant advances.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Tomorrow BBC1 begins a six-part series, shown nationwide, called 'The Underworld', investigating 'Britain's, and in particular London's, criminal underworld since the second world war'. Today, in the London region only, ITV begins a six-part series called Gangsters 'offering powerful personal testimonies from members of London's criminal underworld from the 1940s to the early 70s' (7.30). It's a good job we are all obsessed with crime and criminals, isn't it? Channel 4's series Without Walls returns with a new notion: 'Bad Ideas of the 20th Century' and 'Good Ideas Of The 20th Century'. In the bad category today is 'Bodyism', the pressure which, we are told, 'drives' women to attempt to make their bodies the same shape as those of fashion models. In the good category is plastic surgery .. could there be irony buried here somewhere? (9.00). BBC1 shows the first 80 minutes of a two-part drama, Calling The Shots, in which Lynn Redgrave plays a television journalist who is urged to take her programme down-market (9.30 BBC1).</p>

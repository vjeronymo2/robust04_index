			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia hit hardest as tropical storm devastates Windwards' banana crops The banana industry in the Windward Islands, the main source of British imports, was devastated by the tropical storm that passed through the eastern Caribbean ten days ago. Shipping schedules will be disrupted, according to government and industry officials. The islands - Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent - will lose millions of dollars in exports earnings and could also lose some share of the market because of the damage, the industry officials said. St Lucia, the largest producer in the group, has been the hit hardest. 'All of our banana, coconut and cattle production has been lost, small gardens are destroyed and the roads are flooded,' said Mr John Compton, St Lucia's prime minister. Banana exports provide the island with income of about USDollars 60m a year, representing just under a half of all its foreign earnings. The Windward Islands Crop Insurance Scheme (Wincrop), an agency which insures the region's agriculture, says it is receiving hundreds of claims following the storm. 'We are receiving claims now mainly from Dominica, St Lucia and St Vincent,' said Mr Kerwin Ferreira, Wincrop's manager. 'St Vincent's loss is of a fair level, Dominica's significant, and I would say St Lucia is very, very, very bad.' The losses in the Windward Islands will disrupt suppliers to the UK, according to a St Lucian government official. The loss for the four islands will not only be in export earnings but also in market share, he said. There is concern in the Windward Islands that any reduction in shipments from the region will benefit Latin American exporters, who will fill the shortfall. Latin American producers had earlier attacked the new European Union import regime, which allows duty free entry to Caribbean fruit. 'The has come at a very bad time for the Windwards' industry,' said the official. 'We might not be able to recapture our markets after this. The only consolation is that if we start replanting now we will have export fruit ready in a few months.'</p>

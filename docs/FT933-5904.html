			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Management: Are you an optimistic or pessimistic boss? - Discover whether you are a benevolent autocrat, a cynic or a trusting manager A pessimist is an optimist with experience. Listen to the US management gurus, who seem to model their delivery style and their beliefs on TV-evangelists and you might believe that all workers are fundamentally good, diligent and legal. All that is required is a corporate vision, sincerity and a caring ethical boss and the workforce will deliver. The optimist, it is said, believes that we live in the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist fears this is true. Is the pessimist one who, when he has the choice of two evils chooses both, or is he a realist? Is a pessimist one who feels bad when he feels good for fear he will feel worse when he feels better, or simply a shrewd and accurate observer of life? The British seem more reserved and sceptical than other nationalities. More used to the threat of the stick than the promise of the carrot, they appear not to hold such a rosy view of their fellow man and less still of their fellow woman. Followers of the French idealist Rousseau stand in sharp contrast to the bleak perception of the Englishman Thomas Hobbes. The pessimistic, modern manager might believe that 'man was born free everywhere is in trains', on his way to a nasty, brutish, tedious and unsatisfying job. For some, the experience of management is that people avoid work because they inherently dislike it. They have to be completely controlled, directed, bullied and threatened. They prefer not to show responsibility or empowerment and need to be constantly monitored. About 30 years ago a US academic called McGregor who was interested in what determined a person's leadership style said managers were likely to hold one of two 'philosophies' about workers. One, labelled theory X, maintained that people do not like work, avoid it, have little ambition, try to avoid responsibility and need firm direction, control and coercion. Subscribers to theory Y maintained that under the right conditions people not only work hard, showing commitment and talent, but also seek increased responsibility and challenge. Test yourself to see if you are a theory X or Y believer. Give yourself 4 points for strongly agree, 3 for agree, 1 for disagree and 0 for strongly disagree. 1. Almost everyone could probably improve his or her job performance quite a bit if he or she really wanted to. 2. It is unrealistic to expect people to show the same enthusiasm for their work as for their favourite leisure-time activities. 3. Even when given encouragement by the boss, very few people show the desire to improve themselves on the job. 4. If you give people enough money, they are less likely to worry about such intangibles as status or individual recognition. 5. Usually when people talk about wanting more responsible jobs, they really mean they want more money and status. 6. Being tough with people will usually get them to do what you want. 7. Because most people do not like to make decisions on their own, it's hard to get them to assume responsibility. 8. A good way to get people to do more work is to crack down on them once in a while. 9. It weakens a person's prestige to admit that a subordinate has been right and he/she wrong. 10. The most effective supervisor is one who gets the results management expects, regardless of the methods used in handling people. 11. It is too much to expect that people will try to do a good job without being prodded by the boss. 12. The boss who expects his or her people to set their own standards for superior performance will probably find they don't set them very high. 13. If people do not use much imagination or ingenuity on the job, it's probably because relatively few people have much of either. 14. One problem in asking for the ideas of subordinates is that their perspective is too limited for their suggestions to be of much practical value. 15. It is only human nature for people to try to do as little work as they can get away with. Score under 20 and you are an optimist. You probably trust your subordinates and use a wide range of rewards. You may prefer group participation in decision making and like people to be well informed. Score 21 - 30 and we see more caution with substantial, but not complete, confidence and trust in subordinates. You wish to keep control of most important decisions. Score 31 - 45 and some may consider you a benevolent autocrat. You have a rather condescending confidence and trust such as a master has in a servant. You tend to believe in economic motives and do not fraternise with your staff. Score 45 and above and face it you are a cynic about the average worker. High scorers may even be exploitative autocrats who have no confidence in their subordinates, preferring physical and economic security as a motivational force. All stick and no carrot. Top scorers despise 'soft' management techniques and maintain that the department of hard knocks at the university of life taught them what they know. Low scorers recoil in horror at the monster they see in the high scorer, equally convinced that their experience at work tells them they are right. Neither side is prepared to concede. Hence we need the understanding to know the things we cannot change about workers; the courage to change and improve the things we can change; and the wisdom to know the difference.

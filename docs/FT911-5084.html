			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Baker heads for Israel in bid for peace talks MR JAMES BAKER, the US secretary of state, will return to Israel on Friday for the third time in less than two months to promote a Middle East regional peace conference, Ms Margaret Tutwiler, State Department spokeswoman, confirmed yesterday. President Bush and Mr Baker 'are convinced that all parties are taking a serious approach to peace in the Middle East (and) believe that follow-up now, directly with the parties, is important if progress is to be made,' Ms Tutwiler said. Key issues in further talks with the US will include Israeli refusal to halt Jewish settlement in the occupied territories and how the Palestinians will be represented, both issues which could yet derail Mr Baker's peace effort. Meanwhile Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, will meet Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, in London today for an unprecedented meeting which underscores the steady improvement over the last two years in Israeli-Soviet relations. Mr Shamir will tell Mr Pavlov that Israel's consent to a regional peace conference held under joint US-Soviet auspices is conditional upon Moscow first re-establishing full diplomatic ties broken off after the 1967 Six Day War. Consular relations have been restored and Israel is anxious to complete the process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 29 (AFP) -- Attacking northern  Yemeni warplanes set fire to the south's only oil refinery on  Wednesday [29 June] as an air and artillery bombardment killed  eight civilians and wounded 41 here, officials said.    A black cloud drifted over Aden from the burning refinery 18  kilometers (11 miles) to the west. Journalists could not reach  it because the road has been cut by fighting, but could see the  fire from here.    A southern military spokesman said the refinery was attacked  by two northern warplanes, while hospital officials said eight  civilians were killed and 41 wounded in air raids and shelling  of northern suburbs and other districts.    Buildings trembled from the pounding of artillery fire.    Oil storage tanks at the refinery were set ablaze three  weeks  ago after a northern raid, officials here said.    Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have  been trying to capture the refinery since they entered the  western suburbs for the first time on Saturday, cutting off the  road to the refinery.    Northern troops were also in control of Bir Nasr', 15  kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, where the city's only water  pumping station is sited.    Aden residents have suffered severe water and gasoline  shortages since the north's advance into the city's suburbs.  [passage omitted]</p>

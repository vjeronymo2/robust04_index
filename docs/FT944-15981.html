			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Engineers fall The engineering sector suffered two sharp body blows yesterday in the shape of profits warnings from Senior Engineering and Aerostructures Hamble, which sliced Pounds 125m off the combined market value of the two companies. Senior was the most actively traded share of the day, tumbling 34 to 72p in a turnover of 12m as the company announced that a combination of order shortfall and cost overruns would lead to a big drop in profits for 1994. Securities houses were quick to downgrade earnings estimates with BZW coming down Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m and Smith New Court shading by a similar amount to Pounds 18.5m. These leave the dividend nicely covered but analysts' hopes of a 10 per cent increase are fading rapidly. With six-month profits down more than a third, no interim dividend and the resignation of its chief executive, Aerostructures put in a near cataclysmic performance, sliding 35 to 24p with 2.2m shares traded. The company, which made its stock market debut in June at 120p, warned last month that all was not well. Affected by problems on Harrier component contracts, it expects 1995 sales will be hard hit.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (14): Competitive edginess / Economics/Industry EUROPEAN COMPETITIVENESS edited by Kirsty H Hughes Cambridge University Press Pounds 29.95 312 pages THE LEARNING IMPERATIVE edited by Robert Howard Harvard Business School Press Dollars 29.95 352 pages COMPETITIVENESS can be analysed at the level of individual firms, of an industry, of a country or group of countries. And the word 'competitiveness' itself is understood and used in many ways, though there are two broad categories: the first views competitiveness as a question of relative efficiency as reflected in productivity and productivity growth; the second views competitiveness as reflecting relative international trade performance. Recognising the complex nature of the subject, European Competitiveness uses all these concepts and perspectives to examine patterns of competitiveness within Europe, as well as between Europe and its main competitors, the US and Japan. The essays focus on aspects of the internationalisation process, to examine some of its key characteristics, with special attention to multinational activities of firms in Europe, their organisational form and location decisions. The role of technology in competitiveness is analysed, and the book discusses likely changes which will result from increased integration of various markets. Finally, it discusses the role of key factors such as the public sector and national culture, which will continue to differentiate countries and to shape their competitiveness. The overall message of the book is not earth-shatteringly different from conventional wisdom, but what it does contribute is academic rigour and thoroughness. Relentless change demands relentless improvement. To achieve relentless improvement faster and faster, various panacea have been attempted and found fashionable. The most popular of these is Quality Management, the most recent is Learning Organizations, the concern of Learning Imperative, a selection of 17 essays on the subject from the management journal, Harvard Business Review. And what, pray, are Learning Organizations? Well, there is no clear consensus among the luminaries whose work is gathered in the volume, the first essay of which was originally published only three years ago, but that does not reduce the variety of perspectives and routes offered. There is some agreement, though. All the contributors see a dynamic and volatile economy in which competition is getting tougher, technology is moving ever faster, customers and business partners are becoming more demanding. All the contributors agree that the only source of continuous competitive advantage is the people of an organisation, provided one somehow manages to motivate them to learn faster than the competition, and to harness and apply that learning across the whole of the organisation. Easier said than done, even at the individual level; the thorny question is, as one would expect, at the organisational level. The Learning Imperative gathers together much American discussion of the subject (including the single and highly influential non-American contribution to American discussion by the Japanese scholar lkujiro Nonaka). However, it does not even indicate the European discussion of the subject, which has taken place largely in parallel to the American discussion.</p>

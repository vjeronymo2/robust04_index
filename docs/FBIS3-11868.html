			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Luis Enrique Vasquez] </F>   [Excerpts] Panama City, 27 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Panamanian  President Guillermo Endara said here today that, with his  Colombian colleague Cesar Gaviria in the post of OAS secretary  general, the organization will wake up and become more dynamic  for the benefit of all people on the continent.    "Under the leadership of President Gaviria, we will have a  new OAS -- one as dynamic as its new secretary general," Endara  told NOTIMEX in an interview. Endara added that the people of  the continent will have "a great servant" in Gaviria, who is  known for his great abilities and charm.    Endara said: "The days of the OAS being a somewhat sleepy  organization have ended. We will truly see a new OAS. I  congratulate President Gaviria and offer him Panama's full  support during his tenure."    In the past, Panamanian politicians and journalists have  criticized the American organization for having maintained "an  extremely submissive" position toward the regime of General  Manuel Antonio Noriega. In 1989, the Civic Democratic  Opposition Alliance (ADOC) asked the OAS to issue a resolution  condemning the Noriega regime and recognizing Endara's triumph  in the May general elections; this, however, never occurred.  [passage omitted on Gaviria's biographical data, background  material on the OAS election]    Although Panama's vote was committed to Niehaus last year,  Endara said Gavira was a "great candidate" to occupy the post.  "President Gaviria is very suitable for this post," the  Panamanian president told NOTIMEX over the telephone from his  presidential residence, where he is resting today.    Endara said he urged Niehaus to not feel discouraged by his  failure to win the post of OAS secretary general, and he also  urged him to offer his support to Gaviria.    "I hope this defeat will not discourage him from continuing  his great efforts for the sake of the entire continent," Endara  added.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / German telecoms sell-off in balance: Union threatens strike after collapse of benefits talks with management Hopes that Germany's largest privatisation can go ahead next year hung in the balance last night after talks between the management and unions of the postal and telecommunications services collapsed. The two sides broke off early yesterday after a third day of talks, trading bitter accusations. The 570,000-strong German Postal Union (DPG) said it would call out 11,000 workers across the country to press home its demands that the management of the three companies guarantee workers' benefits after privatisation. The present state-owned postal and telecommunications leviathan, which employs around 670,000 people, is to be broken up into three services by January 1, 1995 according to a government plan. However, privatisation means the government must change the constitution, an exercise requiring a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the support of the opposition Social Democratic party which is close to the DPG union. The vote must take place before June 29 if privatisation is to go ahead at the start of next year and a number of SPD politicians have warned that support will not be forthcoming unless management and unions can reach agreement. 'If anyone imagines the SPD will back the change in the constitution while strikes are going on, they have lost touch with reality,' said Mr Arne Bornsem, the SPD telecommunications spokesman. Management of the three companies, meanwhile, fears it will be unable to compete internationally if saddled with a catalogue of workers' benefits which include the right to a cold drink if the temperature rises above 26 degrees Celsius, money for new shoes worn out by postmen on letter rounds and subsidised holidays. 'The self-appointed representatives of the workforce obviously consider cold drinks and holidays on the Cote d'Azur more important than secure workplaces,' said Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom chief executive. Mr Rudi Vetter, a union spokesman, said the strikes would continue until the management presented proposals 'which are negotiable'. He also dismissed charges that the union was demanding benefits which were outdated. 'All large enterprises offer their workforce similar benefits,' he said. 'We just don't see why our members have to give up their benefits just so that the companies can be floated.' In the first stage of privatisation the government will remain the sole shareholder. Deutsche Telekom, which will take over the telecommunications sector, has said it wants to be floated by January 1, 1996 - the earliest legally permissible date - in order to raise badly-needed capital. Postdienst, the postal services, and Postbank, the banking arm, are also to be privatised as soon as possible. Aside from the talks between management and unions to settle the question of benefits, parliament must decide before the end of the month how to cover pensions payments worth about DM100bn (Pounds 40bn) after privatisation. A further DM16bn must be found to fund future liabilities of two in-house health insurance funds which will cease to exist.</p>

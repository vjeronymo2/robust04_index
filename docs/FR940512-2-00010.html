			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We used BIA for these exporter's sales price (ESP) sales, because ICI failed to answer the Department's further manufacturing questionnaire for these sales and to provide prices to the first unrelated purchaser. ICI stated that it was either impossible or extremely difficult to answer the questionnaire, and, instead, provided a small amount of financial and manufacturing information for the related company responsible for the ESP sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At verification, we explored with ICI the reasons it provided for not responding to the further manufacturing questionnaire. We were told that providing the specific further processing information requested by the Department would take an excessive amount of time. We reviewed documentation that demonstrated that the production of the further processed product involves a series of steps. At each intermediary step, chemicals and compounds are combined to produce new compounds that will be mixed with other compounds in the next step. As a result, to determine the amount of INC used in the final product, and to determine which products use INC, would require a complicated trace back through multiple intermediary steps. (See Report on Verification of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March 24, 1994, 26&hyph;27.) However, our verification established that ICI had the documentation needed to fulfill the Department's request for further processing information. ICI's claim appears to be based solely on the time and resources that would be required to provide the requested information. We, therefore, conclude that it would not have been impossible for ICI to have answered the further manufacturing questionnaire, and that doing so would have been no less burdensome for ICI than for respondents in other cases who are asked to answer further manufacturing questionnaires. (See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order; Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom, (59 FR 39729) July 26, 1993.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since ICI could have, but did not, provide the data, we have used non-cooperative BIA for these sales. There were no other firms involved in the LTFV investigation or in this first review. We have therefore used ICI's rate from the final determination in the LTFV investigation as BIA for these particular sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act, we calculated FMV based on home market sales. We did not include sales to related parties in calculating FMV. Under 19 CFR 353.45, the Department may disregard transactions between related parties if the price does not fairly reflect the usual price at which sales are made to unrelated parties. We performed an analysis of related party prices and found that they were not at arm's length. (See Memorandum to the File, April 15, 1994.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the LTFV investigation, product comparisons were made on the basis of the following criteria: nitrogen percentage, viscosity rating, wetting agent type, cellulose source, physical form, and wetting agent percentage. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial Nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom, 55 FR 21055 (May 22, 1990). Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market with which to compare merchandise sold in the United States, sales of the most similar merchandise were compared on the basis of the characteristics described above. In those instances, we made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated FMV based on packed and either delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers in the United Kingdom. We made deductions for home market packing, inland freight, and rebates, and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a commission was paid on a PP sale but not on the home market sale, we added the amount of the commission to the FMV and then deducted from FMV the lesser of either total home market indirect selling expenses or the U.S. commission amount, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

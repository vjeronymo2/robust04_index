			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dofasco battles its way back into profit - Robert Gibbens assesses the steel maker's options DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steel maker and an industry leader until to late 1980s, is battling its way back to profitability and a new niche in the north American market. The company is shutting a further 1m tonnes of uneconomic ingot capacity at Hamilton, Ontario, Canada's steel capital, and considering a joint venture thin-slab casting mill either in Canada or the US. Dofasco, which specialises in flat rolled products for the car and appliance markets, was one of the first north American steel makers to adopt continuous casting and until the late 1980s was profitable. High pay rates kept the United Steelworkers' union at bay, while attrition and early retirements enabled it to introduce automation with the minimum of pain. In 1988 Dofasco bought Algoma Steel from Canadian Pacific for CDollars 560m (USDollars 438.6m) to build up its raw steel capacity, and continued to spend heavily on all its plants. But by 1989, north America was sliding into recession. As the steel market faltered, Dofasco was forced to retrench. High interest rates and a strong Canadian dollar, followed by trade disputes with the US, made matters worse. Dofasco had to write off its Algoma investment. Last summer Dofasco closed a castings operation and announced early retirement plans to take its payroll to 9,000, down 2,000 in two years. Eventually the workforce would dip below 7,000, it warned. In the first nine months of 1992, after restructuring charges, Dofasco lost CDollars 98m, or CDollars 1.52 a share, on sales of CDollars 1.5bn, against a loss of CDollars 23m, or 64 cents, on sales of CDollars 1.55bn a year earlier. Shipments rose slightly to 2.5m tonnes. Dofasco has taken several key decisions. It will omit the dividend due January 1 1993 to conserve cash. This follows omissions in the previous two quarters. The preferred dividends will be maintained. The No. 1 ingot line will shut next summer. This will lead to a special pre-tax charge of CDollars 150m, to be taken in the final quarter of 1993, and including severance costs for a further workforce reduction of 2,000. A considerable offset will come from using a pension fund surplus. Annual capacity will fall to 3m tonnes. The company will decide next year whether to go ahead with a mini-mill costing between CDollars 250m and CDollars 300m. 'It would give us competitive high quality flat rolled steel to complement our existing output,' says executive vice-president, Mr John Mayberry. Much may depend on US recovery and the steel trade dispute with the US. The recent US decision to slap heavy duties on steel imports from 12 countries, alleging subsidised prices, could firm steel markets in north America. These countries represent 3-5 per cent of the US hot and cold rolled and galvanised markets.</p>

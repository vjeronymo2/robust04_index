			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / German unions warned on pay EXCESSIVE wage rises or any other avoidable increases in inflationary pressure will rule out cuts in German interest rates, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, threatened yesterday. In an unusually direct criticism of trade union ambitions, he singled out this year's 26 per cent pay claim for eastern German metal workers in a renewed attack on the danger of inflation. It would be impossible to offset such an increase with rate cuts, however big they might be, he said in Leipzig, Saxony. Any increase in inflationary tendencies 'which can still be avoided' would rule out interest rate reductions, he warned in a speech at the installation of Mr Olaf Sievert as president of the central bank of Saxony and Thuringia. He was speaking after local IG Metall union leaders rejected a 9 per cent pay offer for members in Saxony. The union insisted on a 26 per cent rise, agreed in 1991 as part of a package assuring eastern members of pay parity with the west by 1994. The issue will now go to arbitration. Mr Schlesinger's speech coincided with figures from Baden-Wurttemberg showing a jump in inflation this month to 4.2 per cent a year, compared with 3.5 per cent in December. Mr Schlesinger's choice of words suggest that while this month's increase in value added tax and persistently rising rents - due to a national housing shortage - could be regarded as 'unavoidable', inflationary pay increases, either in the east or west, could not. An over-generous award to Saxony's engineers would almost certainly be followed by similar deals for their colleagues in other eastern states and increased pressure for equal treatment for other workers in the former GDR.</p>

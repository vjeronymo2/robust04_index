			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Observer: Indigestible One thing is certain about the new decor of the dining room at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Its construction must easily have consumed every hour of the weeks during which the restaurant was closed for refurbishment. Whether it was worth the wait is another matter. A good few of the accountants - a breed not generally renowned for their experimentalism - may find eating inside a psychedelic post-modernist collage not exactly to their taste. There are neo-classical white-framed mirrors at the entrance and a bizarrely amateurish bas-relief with tortured figures on one wall. All around, Magritte-style friezes of Grecian vases and paintings are interspersed with panels of fake green marble and softwood. The centrepiece clinging to the ceiling is best described as a squashed metal octopus with red ear-rings. . .  .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz at the </F> Ukrainian Supreme Council in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] Today, we are supposed to examine the issue that  concerns the main principles of the directions of establishing  Ukraine's economy in the period of crisis. The establishment of  Ukraine as an independent and sovereign state is only possible  under conditions of a reliably functioning economy. It should  be based on an integral and effective economic system. It is  promoting the creation of this economic system that these main  principles, as the legal basis of (strengthening) control of the  economy by the state, are called upon. The methodological  approaches that the main principles are based on envisage a  systematic and comprehensive nature of setting up the state  regulation of the economy, taking account of its organic  synthesis with market regulators and the developed countries'  postwar historic experience of overcoming crisis. The main  principles originate from objectively analyzing the cause,  nature, and scale of the systemic crisis in Ukraine and the  persistently continuing trend of its deterioration. After two  years, state authorities have failed to make effective use of  Ukraine's high scientific and technological level, rich land  resources, and its people's great industriousness.    The analysis shows that the state of the economy endangers  Ukraine's sovereignty. Large-scale deindustrialization of the  economy is being carried out, with hi-tech industries degrading  most of all. The average annual rate of the decline in the  production sphere is more than 13 percent, and almost 30 percent  over the first six months of this year. The production indices  have decreased by 50 percent as far as the 50 most important  kinds of products are concerned. Construction has been sharply  curtailed. The average annual decline in agricultural  production exceeded 18 percent. As to the consumption of animal  husbandry products, Ukraine has been thrown back 30 years. As  compared with the developed countries, the production of meat,  milk, and eggs per capita amounts to only 60 percent.    The main causes of the crisis are the absence of a clear-cut  political and socioeconomic strategy of Ukraine's development,  the chaotic destruction of the planned-administrative system of  management without it being adequately replaced by the market  mechanisms and infrastructure, the collapse of the USSR  national-economic complex, and the fact that the mechanisms of  Ukraine's independent economy functioning have not been formed,  distorted formation of a market economy by means of a mechanical  implantation of the other countries' experience in the national  soil, ill-considered liberalization of prices and foreign  economic activity and privatization, boosted by the inadequacy  of the legal basis and the absence of a reliable state  regulation, the unskillful sale and appropriation of national  property, penetration of crime elements into the economic  activity, partial merger of the state apparatus with the shadow  structures, absence of an economic mechanism of the mixed  economy functioning, groundless hopes that in conditions of a  transition toward market economy the state alienates itself from  the economy. [passage omitted]    I believe that the state withdrawing from control over the  economy and the role of market self-regulation being  groundlessly exaggerated in the economic policy of Ukraine's  power structures, were some of the main causes of the economic  crisis. The main principles make provision for the necessary  adjustments in the government's actions in order to establish  the optimal ratio between state and market regulators in the  economic system.    The aims and sequence of state regulation are as follows:  The main and the nearest objective of the state control over  the economy, which is determined by the main principles, is to  stop the crisis and stabilize the socioeconomic situation in  Ukraine. The strategic objective of the socioeconomic  transformations in all spheres of life is to bring Ukraine to  the way of building a society of progressive development with  the state being subordinated to citizens's interests in real  terms.    Generally speaking, in terms of economy this means the  creation of highly developed production, financial, scientific  and technical infrastructure of Ukraine's economy, ensuring  highly technological energy and resources-saving and  ecologically safe development of all its industries and their  competitiveness on the world market, ensuring Ukraine's  accession to the world community on an equal footing with other  states.    As far as the protection of the state is concerned, the  objective is to ensure the high enough military might of the  country and the ability to protect and defend its territorial  integrity and national interests.    In the social and cultural spheres the objective is to  ensure  the modernization of the high scientific and technical level of  production, consolidation of the positions of Ukraine's science  in the world on the basis of raising the general education level  of citizens, guaranteeing possibilities for them to receive  proper education and qualification, creating conditions for the  all-round development of all the branches of culture,  literature, and the arts, multiplying the features of high  spirituality inherent in the people of Ukraine. [passage  omitted]    The socioeconomic transformations will be implemented in  three stages. A considerable part of the tasks, envisaged at  these stages, will be simultaneous, i.e. will coincide and be  held as a set.    The first stage is the determination of the state  priorities and mechanisms to ensure them, a gradual transfer  from chaotic economic relations to regulated market relations.  The task of this stage is to stop the decline in production and  begin to raise it, stabilization and implementation of an  effective employment program. During the first stage it is  envisaged to create by the end of 1995 favorable economic  conditions for the effective industries and enterprises of all  forms of ownership that determine the economic potential of the  state. At the same time production units lacking prospects will  be closed down gradually, with those employed at these  production units being socially protected. [passage omitted]    The second stage is stabilization. At this stage a reliable  stabilization of production is achieved approximately by the end  of 1997. A gradual increase in output begins. At the end of  this stage the output of industrial and agricultural products,  most probably excluding animal husbandry products, should reach  the level of the late 1980's, with the improved structure of  these products and their significantly higher quality. During  this time it is necessary to create the required industrial  capacities to ensure the priority trends in the development of  the economy, especially for agriculture and the processing  industry, to stimulate an increase in the volume of capital  construction and modernization of enterprises, housing  construction, the development of the social and market  infrastructure with conditions being created for the involvement  of the money of the enterprises that do not belong to the state.  [passage omitted]    The third stage is socioeconomic growth. The effective  implementation of the tasks of the first two stages should  create a reliable basis for the country's entry to the next  stage of the socioeconomic development. In general terms, its  main task is to complete the structural reorganization, to form  an effective, competitive, socially-oriented market economy,  develop and introduce the world standard technologies along the  main trends of the scientific and technical progress, to bring  the Ukrainian citizens' living standards closer to the level of  the industrially developed countries.    The main prerequisites of state regulation policy are these:    Laying the main foundation of state regulation in the  economy  must take account of certain social, political, and  organizational conditions of principal importance. Among them  the category of social conditions should include such areas as  the social security of the population, maintenance of its living  standards at a level no lower than the poverty line, and  provision for constitutional and social guarantees of this. The  political conditions are state independence, international  cooperation, and good-neighborliness, developing democracy and  self-government, strengthening society's legal basis, and  political accord in society. The organizational and economic  conditions are ensuring the stability of the economic system,  averting shock methods in economic transformation, supporting  economic, scientific and technological priorities, stopping the  fall and ensuring an increase in the productivity of  agriculture, and production in society in general.    The state management of the economy must be carried out  comprehensively and extend to all spheres of production in  society, i.e. production proper, distributive relations, the  sphere of monetary circulation and eventual consumption.    Let us look at the directions and methods of influencing  economic development. The menacing depth of the crisis requires  the lack of state control over the main economic processes in  Ukraine to be ended. The effectiveness of the following changes  depends upon the precision of the steps opted for at the first  stage. It is exactly these steps that the document focuses on.    The aim and form of implementing structural changes is as  follows:    The main form of making structural changes is a policy of  state priorities based on drawing up national programs and the  state stimulating them. The aim of the state priorities policy  is supporting the quicker development of the national economy  industries and enterprises manufacturing competitive goods of  priority importance.    One should remember that the real state of Ukraine's economy  in the past and at present, its unique level of concentration  and integration with neighboring countries, combined with the  incomplete technological cycles, naturally requires the use of  large-scale (organizational) and economic formations, including  between industries, functioning on the basis of diverse forms of  ownership and up-to-date scientific and technological policy.  [passage omitted]    Ensuring a balanced development of regions, with their  speciality and orientation taken into consideration; overcoming  structural deformations, which of late have become worse and,  under these conditions, Ukraine retaining productivity;  organizing effective cooperation in production between  enterprises and industries within Ukraine, and restoring the  necessary economic ties within the framework of the CIS and with  other world countries, and establishing new relations.    The policy of restructuring must be consistent and gradual  and make use of pin-point investment; (a new type of)  cooperation between enterprises, targeting complete  technological cycles within the state; institution of national  and transnational companies on the basis of various forms of  ownership; competition between enterprises of raw materials and  semi-raw material industries, on the one hand, and machine  building industries, including those with the participation of  foreign investors, on the other; diversification of industries  and (purposeful) programs of restructuring; and gradual shutdown  of unproductive enterprises. [passage omitted]    Provision is made for transforming facilities, and, at the  same time, forming a normative basis to restructure the  machine-building complex in order for it to manufacture  components for common use in industry, agriculture, and  processing; and ensuring a rise in the volumes of enterprises'  reconstruction, housing construction, and the social  infrastructure. [passage omitted]    In view of Ukraine's economic, scientific, and technological  potential, the needs of its population and the task of entering  the world market, the following industries should be identified  as a matter of priority at the first stage of restructuring:  These are agriculture and the processing industry, the fuel and  energy complex, industries making extensive use of science and  capital construction, including housing construction.    Taking account of world competition and social orientation  of  consumer goods -- I emphasize consumer goods -- and food,  agriculture, regardless of its forms of ownership, is heading  for specialization and greater industrialization by way of  developing the sphere of the agro-industrial complex,  preserving, processing and selling produce, thus stimulating  production in low-cost production regions.    To that end, the structure of agro-industrial production in  Ukraine should be optimized.    At issue is a really complex and topical task. In  particular, the structure of grain production should be revised,  not only from the viewpoint of (requirement by) agro-industrial  complex industries but also from the standpoint of its energy  consumption. [passage omitted]    This task [optimization of agricultural production] is also  important because agricultural production and rural areas in  general -- on the basis of the mentality of the people and the  traditional system of family life -- recreate the sources of the  viability of society and the state, and improve the demographic  situation.    This was addressed the other day at a meeting with the  leadership of the city of Kiev, and the conclusion that is being  made today by local authorities is that resolving the housing  problem by the methods used before has no future. So, individual  construction should be more widespread. To put it rudely,  people should be sat on the land and given an opportunity  themselves to resolve this problem.    The formation of energy policy comprises measures on energy  saving and the wider-ranging use of renewable energy carrier  sources. At issue is liberating the agro-industrial complex  from its energy dependence primarily upon, indirectly, Russia.    The development of industries making extensive use of  science  is based on the experience of world trends, Ukraine's  achievements and possibilities, the state's strategy and  scientific and technological policy being determined.    The development of general machine-building industries,  adapted to world standards, is acquiring particular  significance, of which I have already spoken. [passage omitted]    As for reforming ownership and privatization relations, the  implementation of privatization must make provision for setting  up a mixed economy in Ukraine, with the economy's state and  nonstate sectors clearly delimited; legislatively distinguishing  the state-owned industries and facilities forming the foundation  of Ukraine's economy and economic security and not subject to  privatization; safeguarding the interests of large and  medium-size enterprises and protecting them from their ruination  as integral property complexes; and privatizing social  infrastructure enterprises and facilities, with their profile  and jobs retained. [passage omitted]    Provision is made for regulating a mechanism for the  workforce to exercise its priority to choose a form of  privatization and ensure its implementation at the same time as  ensuring the principle of all Ukrainian citizens' equal access  to property; determining conditions for foreign capital to  participate in privatization processes and the methodology of  assessing the market value of facilities being privatized, with  account taken of inflationary processes; the state mandatorily  supervising the privatization of state property; legislatively  determining a procedure of receiving earnings from privatization  and ways of using them. [passage omitted]    Provision is also made for settling the issues of social  security of those working at the facilities being privatized;  improving the methods of assessment and control of the  legitimacy of the privatization processes; a possibility of  privatizing state and municipal property with the guaranteed use  of all the privatization papers by the workers engaged in the  budget-supported sphere, pensioners, youths, as well as  compensation with the state property of the citizens' indexed  deposits in the savings bank, with their consent; liquidating  opportunities for corruption and uncontrolled privatization.  [passage omitted]    The right to private ownership of land is granted by way of  privatizing plots of land to be used as personal subsidiary  farms or gardens, for individual housing construction or for the  construction of garages, with the right of buying and selling  the above plots of land. The right to private ownership of land  is granted to the citizens of Ukraine only. Land can be  provided to foreign legal and natural persons and to persons  without citizenship for use only, including the use of land on  conditions of a lease and, first and foremost, on conditions of  a long lease.    Farmers use land for their production needs on condition of  a  long hereditary lease or under condition that the land will be  sold to the state, as is being done in the majority of countries.    The right of citizens to housing is ensured through the  privatization of the apartments belonging to the state housing  fund and accelerated cooperative and individual construction of  housing. [passage omitted]    As for the state regulation of economic processes, it, as a  rule, has to do with price formation, the finance and credit  policy, the taxation, credit, budget, currency, and wage  policies, regulation of investments, scientific and technical  policy, and foreign economic activity. Let us look at each of  them in turn.    Pricing: The state policy is to stop the chaos in price  formation, to take measures to stimulate [as heard] the price  rise and achieve stabilization of prices, to remove distortions  within the price system so that prices could become a  stimulating regulator of production, registration and  consumption of goods and services. The pricing policy must  ensure support for an intersector pricing parity, particularly  between agriculture and other sectors; and a close connection  between prices and tariffs on the most important goods and  services, on the one hand, and the level of the minimum pay and  pensions, on the other. The regulation of prices for consumer  goods should be effected through the margin of profit and the  size of trade brokerage mark-ups, acknowledging the need to  reduce superfluous brokerage operations and, probably,  superfluous brokerage structures.    Financial, credit, and taxation policy: Reforming the  taxation system in Ukraine must aim to stimulate the development  of the national economy, increase the gross output, form a fully  fledged budget, and settle social issues.    Profit, land, immovable property, and citizens' incomes  should be liable to taxation. The tax rates should be  substantiated. It is envisaged to improve the mechanism of the  annual declaration of incomes by all the subjects of taxation,  carry out strict control and step up responsibility for the  fullness of the taxes paid by all the legal and natural persons.    Credit policy: Credit policy is to be aimed at creating  favorable economic conditions for the effective use of the  credit resources, the acceleration of the structural  reorganization of the economy and its social orientation.  [passage omitted]    The population's deposits should be index-linked in line  with  the actual rates of inflation. They could be further used as  additional means for the privatization of property or returned  on another basis, which is to be stipulated by law. At any  rate, it seems to me the time has come to turn to using  citizens' funds in deposits, which will act as deposit accounts.  Otherwise, we will never be able to protect the citizens from a  loss of their savings or restore their trust in the state.    Strict economic sanctions should be introduced for delays in  payment for the products delivered, work performed, and services  provided. A mechanism of control by the National Bank over the  policy of interest rates should be worked out. Commercial banks  should -- in economic terms -- be made more interested in  crediting priority industries and the sphere of production by  way of reducing the rates of payments to the budget as taxes on  their incomes from such crediting.    Separately, there is the issue of commercial banks in  general. They are now in a state of anxiety, caused, on the one  hand, by the uncertainty as to what the attitude of the  legislature and authorities as a whole toward their fate will  be, i.e. whether they will be somehow oppressed and so on; and,  on the other, by the impossibility of investing the colossal  monetary resources they are sitting on, because what is in fact  happening is that they are looking to inflationary processes in  expectation of another round of inflation so that money could  then produce more money, which mechanism is now well-known to  everybody.    Everything possible should be made to involve the credit  resources, the possibilities of commercial banks in the  production sphere, to make them finance production, provide  people with jobs, ensure the profitability of production and  therefore, consolidate and stabilize the finances in the state  and the budget in particular.    We should set up special funds within the state budget to  provide credits and finances for priority industries by means of  state contract and state order, which above all concerns  agricultural produce and raw materials; and increase state  control and the responsibility of the National Bank and  commercial banks to ensure that credits are used for the purpose  intended. [passage omitted: Moroz emphasizing the need for the  Supreme Council budgetary commission to establish greater  control over credits to prevent their misuse]    Budgetary policy: In budgetary policy, the state's actions  should be focused on rationally using budgetary funds, combined  with stimulating a reduction in the deficit. Increasing the  budget revenues should be based on an (effective) taxation and  tax collection system at the same time as essentially reducing  concessions in taxation and issuing state securities to cover  the budget deficit etc. Decreasing budgetary expenditure must  be achieved by reducing the cost of maintaining the state  government apparatus, transferring many of its structures to the  system of profit and loss management, stopping subsidies to  loss-making -- and I would like to emphasize loss-making through  no fault of the state -- enterprises and stopping financing  capital investment in the production that has no future.    The use of social programs funds for the purpose intended  and  the correspondence of budgetary allocations to social norms  should be monitored more closely.    Also, our foreign trade deficit should be eliminated and the  state's debt reduced by stimulating export and optimizing import.    It is envisaged that the stability of the financial system  will be improved through strictly delimiting the state and local  budgets and the budgets of state enterprises. This can also be  viewed as a way toward the regionalization of the economy.    Currency regulation: At the first stage it is necessary to  set the exchange rate of the national currency in relation to  hard currencies and to the ruble proceeding from the real  purchasing capacity of the currency. I would only make one  remark at this point. It is necessary to stop using the Russian  ruble as an oil- ruble, because this will finally destroy our  economy. This distorts the entire price policy and all economic  relations as a whole.    It is necessary to regulate the circulation of foreign  currencies on Ukraine's territory ensuring the exchange of  currencies through banks and their representatives only, and  this can be done immediately without waiting for any special  conditions.    The system of registration and constant control over  currency  circulation should be sorted out, strengthening its normative  and legislative basis and stimulating the use of currency for  the purpose intended and ending the granting of concessions to  enterprises in terms of their currency relations with the  budget. A tax on earnings in currency or the sale of 100  percent of it should be introduced.    At present, 50 percent are sold at a fixed exchange rate and  even through the mechanism of tenders -- which seems to be  necessary for the state as it has to control and concentrate  currency -- however, this undermines the interest of the  commodity producers in export activities and, generally  speaking, their earnings in currency only result in losses. I  believe, this must be radically changed.    Forming the appropriate stabilization fund is a prerequisite  of carrying out a monetary reform.    Wages and incomes policy: A state policy in the sphere of  labor and wages will presuppose that the minimum wage at  enterprises of all forms of ownership cannot be lower than the  minimum subsistence level. We are not publishing any data on  the consumer basket anywhere today because it will only confirm  that we will not be able to provide anything for that basket.  In the deputy prime minister's speech and questions yesterday  [14 June], the opinion was voiced that it looked as though the  economy was stabilizing. All earnings of citizens today,  however, are in fact being used to procure food, which is the  first sign of the population's total impoverishment.    Pay should be regulated by the state by way of developing  recommended differentiated ratios between wage rates, salaries  of the post, and certain additional payments, taking account of  the conditions and complexity of labor affecting the cost price  of products.    Bonuses and additional payments at enterprises of all forms  of ownership are to be paid from the profit made without  limitations, after the production funds, required by them, are  formed. This must stimulate conscientious, inspired labor.    A mechanism of monthly index-linked wages and payments  according to the level of inflation is being worked out.  Conditions for a changeover to paying wages and salaries weekly  are being prepared. Here, strictly speaking, we are talking  about the implementation of the law on index-linking wages that  was already passed.    The tariff system of a directive nature is (becoming more  widespread). It is regarded as a reference point for the  intersector and interqualificational differentiation of pay,  except, certainly, for the budget-supported sphere.    Investment policy: The main objective of the state's  investment policy, at the first stage, is to channel resources  to developing and setting up production, above all in priority  industries, at enterprises manufacturing competitive goods,  which would be needed by the consumer.    I would like to underline here that we previously, in the  past months, made a mistake in concentrating on support for  products that would be competitive on the external market. What  we need to do is to focus our attention on protecting the  producer supplying goods to the internal market. [passage  omitted]    The main sources for financing city investment projects  should be state, enterprises', and the people's funds. With the  aim of stimulating investment activity, a mechanism of  encouraging a mixed form of financing investments should be  elaborated that would include foreign investments and they  should be protected from inflation. The state, first and  foremost, promotes foreign investments that are directed at  manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. [passage omitted]    Scientific and technical policy. At the first stage the  state should direct its efforts at overcoming the innovation  inertia of enterprises. To do this it is necessary to  considerably increase state support and improve the economic  mechanism of managing scientific and technical progress in all  stages. It is necessary to envisage the creation of an  integrated system of stimulating innovation activity by  corporate bodies. The financing of scientific programs should  be carried out on a competitive basis. It is necessary to carry  out an inventory of all of Ukraine's scientific potential, renew  scientific schools in the main areas of science and technology.  [passage omitted]    Foreign economic activity. With the aim of state  regulation of foreign economic activity, it is necessary to  regulate the system of control in the following areas: To  ensure the timely receipt of hard currency earnings and payment  of customs duties, taxes, and other payments that would benefit  the state. It is necessary to guarantee state control over the  quality of imported goods and that they comply with  international standards. It is necessary to ensure that all  corporate bodies fully abide by the hard currency regulation.  It is necessary to stimulate an export hard currency policy and  create a reliable mechanism for protecting and forming an  internal market. It is necessary to argue for critical imports  and to protect the domestic producer from imports that could be  manufactured in Ukraine. [passage omitted]    Regulation in the sphere of consumption. The main criterion  for the state regulation in the economy should be to raise the  living standard of the people of Ukraine as well as to increase  the population's consumption of goods and services. The main  principles envisage defining the subsistence level based on the  people's minimum necessary requirements and on the possibilities  of fulfilling them in the present phase. The legally fixed  minimum consumer budget is guaranteed by the state and is  reviewed with the purpose of increasing it in accordance with  the improving economic situation in Ukraine. The state  guarantees the legislative regulation of protecting consumer  rights, promotes the involvement of a broad mass of the public  in carrying out public control over maintaining legislative  demands with regard to prices, the range of products, their  quality, and the terms on which they are offered for sale and so  on. We are talking about control over the organization of  imports so that we do not have the situation that we have today.  I will not talk about this phenomenon.    The state's stimulation of increasing mass demand and  consumption is an absolute precondition for raising production,  successfully overcoming the crisis and laying the foundations of  the principles of Ukraine's national economy. The strategy of  legal policy with regard to stabilizing the development of  Ukraine's economy is closely intertwined with these tasks and is  precisely the subject of our activity. For this reason, I will  dwell in greater detail on this section.    The legal policy in the formation of a new stage in  Ukraine's  statehood is based on the principles of its economic  independence. Politically and legally it is fixed in the  declaration of state sovereignty of Ukraine, which announced  that the policy of the legal act was approved by the people at a  referendum and cannot be abolished.    In spite of this, instead of introducing the necessary  changes to the basic law of Ukraine in October 1990, a law on  suspending the activity of 19 articles of the Constitution was  adopted, Section II, Articles 16 and 17 with regard to the  basics of Ukraine's economic system, the legal regime for forms  of ownership, the constitutional guarantee of citizens on  sources of their well-being through socially useful work, a  planned economic and social development of society, forming  Ukraine's state budget. [passage omitted]    The main aim for a strategy of legal policy is to guarantee  state regulation of economic relations in the state sector, a  parallel implementation of legal reform to formulate a mixed  economy; the creation of a legal base for regulating the  activity of various corporate entities that compete with each  other and that have diverse forms of ownership, the consistent  and legal guarantee of the state market regulation of the market  with its social orientation. The realization of the strategy of  the legal policy and carrying out reforms is directed at an  effective use of actions, object economic laws in an optimal  ratio of various forms of ownership and later the growth in  production with a view to the stage-by-stage introduction of a  mixed economy. In order to implement these stages it is  envisaged:    To repeal the law on suspending the activity of Section 2,  16, and 17 of Ukraine's constitution and the corresponding  introduction of changes and additions; to firmly strengthen the  equality of all forms of ownership -- state, collective,  private; to regulate legislation and to guarantee the  accessibility of law-abiding acts; to improve adopted laws, to  review first generation market legislation that cause discord in  the market today; to complete the organizational and legal  building; to form an institution of legislation and so on.  [passage omitted]    The legal methods of ensuring stabilization of the  development of the economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to adopt  the following: Codifying economic legislation as one of the main  ones with which to legally regulate the economy; liquidating the  heritage of the administrative-command system, which is based on  various instructions and legal acts; using agreements in various  spheres of the economy and promoting socially useful  entrepreneurship, and improving the structures of legislation  and maintaining the hierarchy of legally binding acts, using  contracts in various spheres of the economy and promoting  socially useful business activity, and improving legislative  structures. The key problem was building a model of a new  constitution for Ukraine and the move away from the concept of  the new constitution adopted in June 1992, and also abolishing  the constitutional regulation of the economy on the part of the  state, the establishment of democracy, the protection of human  rights, free education, health-care, social guarantees, and the  formation of economic conditions for the people's well-being.  [passage omitted]    Apart from adopting a new constitution, it is expected to  complete work on Ukraine's civil and criminal procedure, and  trade codes, as well as on various other administrative codes  and on the issue of the military and Ukraine's national defense.  Particular attention should be paid to corporate bodies; the  procedure for destatifying ownership, legislation on foreign  investments; on privatization; on securities and the stock  exchange; on banking activity; intellectual property on  stimulation of production through taxation; assets funds;  transport and customs legislation.    The carrying out of measures envisaged by this document  envisions a sharp increase in the responsibility of officials  who break the law.    A real fight against organized crime, corruption, and the  shadow economy is envisaged. We are talking about a certain  purge of the apparatus depending on the current demands and the  specifics of the situation in the economy. It is time to renew  state control for using state property, rationalizing  privatization, and subordinating it to criteria of economic  effectiveness. Increasing state discipline and bringing order  to all spheres of social life does not necessarily mean  increasing control over the actions of the Cabinet of Ministers.  It should have the freedom of actions as defined by the law.    The Supreme Council together with the higher level executive  structures should take upon themselves the responsibility for  carrying out the stabilization of the economy and are obliged to  speed up the creation of a system of legal instruments to adapt  civilian and economic legal norms, the taxation and budgetary  systems, state regulation, and supporting economic activity in  order to legally guarantee a normal economic environment that  would motivate productive work by all participants in the  process of production, distribution, and consumption. This is  the main content of the basic principles, which is being  proposed for your attention. [passage omitted]    I would just like to stress one more thing. We, the Supreme  Council, will use our constitutional right to confirm the  candidate for the post of prime minister, which will be proposed  by the president, and we should also proceed on the basis to  what extent he agrees with such an economic policy. At the same  time we should divide the responsibility for implementing this  policy between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the  Supreme Council. I think that such an approach is also expected  by the electorate because they do not divide the authority of  deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and  the president. You are in the constituencies and therefore, you  are responsible for it. Thank you for your attention.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 7 BOMBS DETONATED AT APARTMENTS NEAR CAL STATE FULLERTON CAMPUS  </P> <P> Residents of the University Village apartment complex in Fullerton were  awakened at 4 a.m. today when seven homemade bombs blew up behind the complex,  which is near Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> A Fullerton police spokesman said no one was hurt in the blasts. Residents,  primarily students, called the police to the Oxford Avenue complex. When  officers arrived, they also heard explosions. They discovered nine bombs, seven  of which had been detonated. The devices had been made from plastic beverage  containers.  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's bomb squad was able to defuse two of the bombs,  which were filled with a gas that couldn't immediately be identified. Police  were seeking suspects.  </P> <P> The culprit apparently did not want anyone or anything to be hurt by the  blasts, officers said, because the bombs were placed far enough away from the  apartments to avoid injury or property damage.  </P></p>

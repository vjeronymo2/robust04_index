			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> DOLLAR MIXED ON GNP REPORT; GOLD PRICE UP  </P> <P> The dollar turned narrowly mixed in quiet trading Tuesday after the government  released its latest data on economic growth.  </P> <P> Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. Republic National Bank of New  York said gold was bid at $387 an ounce at 4 p.m. EST, up 50 cents from  Monday's late bid.  </P> <P> Dealers said the dollar finished higher overseas and opened firmer in domestic  trading, but it lost ground after the Commerce Department reported that the  economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 2% in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The slowdown in the gross national product, the total output of goods and  services, was accompanied by a pickup in the inflation rate as food prices and  the costs of imports rose, the report said.  </P> <P> "The GNP figures were a little bit lower than expected," said George DeLuna, a  trader with Irving Trust Co.  </P> <P> He said the dollar also was held in check by marketwide fears of central bank  intervention.  </P> <P> "The central banks have the markets well under control here," DeLuna said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  rose 1.15 Japanese yen to close at 127.15 yen. It was quoted lower in London at  126.70 yen but at 126.89 yen in New York, up from 126.775 yen.  </P> <P> The dollar gained against the British pound in London but fell in New York. It  cost $1.7430 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.7440 late Monday.  Sterling fetched $1.7430 in New York, up from $1.73795.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Monday's levels, included:  1.82275 West German marks, down from 1.82435; 1.5549 Swiss francs, up from  1.5530; 1.19925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20325; 6.2035 French francs, down  from 6.2070, and 1,341.75 Italian lire, down from 1,343.00.  </P> <P> Late dollar rates in Europe, compared to Monday, included: 1.8230 West German  marks, up from 1.8150; 1.5535 Swiss francs, up from 1.5495; 6.1975 French  francs, up from 6.1775; 2.0555 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0490; 1.2005 Canadian  dollars, down from 1.2025, and 1,341.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.62.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed  at $387.50, up 20 cents from Monday.  </P> <P> Gold fell in London to a late bid of $386.75, compared to late Monday's $389.

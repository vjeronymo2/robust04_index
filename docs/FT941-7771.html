			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Exchange gains lift Sedgwick Foreign exchange gains offset a fall in investment income and allowed Sedgwick, the insurance broker, to increase 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 70.5m, compared with Pounds 56.7m previously. Earnings per share grew from 7.8p to 9p, while a final dividend of 3p per share made an unchanged total for the year of 6p. Brokerage and fee income increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 762m (Pounds 631.9m). Excluding acquisitions and exchange rate gains, the underlying growth rate was 3 per cent. Expenses increased to Pounds 722.5m (Pounds 610.3m), an underlying increase of 2 per cent. Interest and investment income fell from Pounds 53m to Pounds 47.7m. Share of associates' losses fell to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3.1m), while the insurance underwriting result amounted to a loss of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 900,000 profit), with losses at the River Thames, a London market company, increasing to Pounds 6.9m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 15.7m). Foreign exchange gains resulting from both the strength of the US dollar over the year and successful hedging amounted to Pounds 16.2m. A generally improving economy helped US retail income grow by 6 per cent. However, despite increases in premium rates in the reinsurance market, income at Sedgwick Payne, the group's reinsurance arm, fell by 2 per cent. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, suggested a shortage of capacity in the energy market and the decision by many buyers in the marine market to buy less cover was responsible. Losses at Sedgwick's Lloyd's agency subsidiary increased to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.3m). Mr Riley said that Sedgwick was concerned about the failure of the Lloyd's settlement offer last week, but was 'confident that the strength of our members' agency will carry it through this difficult period.' 'We are prudently reserved and have quite a small problem compared with the rest of the market,' he added. COMMENT Cynics will suggest that the markets were unduly impressed yesterday by profits that had more to do with foreign exchange gains than any significant underlying growth in business. Indeed measured against some of its smaller and faster growing rivals, Sedgwick - on an historic p/e of 21 on yesterday's closing price - looks fully valued. However, there is a positive side to the story. Expenses are under control and following the acquisition of Noble Lowndes last year the quality of group earnings has improved, with nearly a third of income coming likely to come from fees this year. Also, Sedgwick - with more than 35 per cent of its income stemming from US retail business - is well placed to benefit from US economic recovery, the strength of the dollar, the long forecast 'turn' in the US insurance market and possible rises in US interest rates.</p>

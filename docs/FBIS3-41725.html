			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Stadnik: ``'Dirty Syringes'--Not the Only </F> Cause of AIDS Infection'']    [Text] There were 268 of them--children infected with human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in hospitals of Elista, Volgograd,  Rostov and Stavropol. The outbreak that occurred in the south of  Russia in 1988-1989 raised the country right away to the same  level as the rest of the world, which had long known the  pleasures of AIDS. At the same time it emphasized our  vulnerability even here: Rather than having the disease occur in  risk groups in large cities, we got AIDS as a children's  epidemic in provincial, out-of-the-way places. But if only that  were the only problem! In the last 5 years some of the infected  children have managed to become adults, but no one is yet  certain that such an outbreak will not occur in our country  again.    The official explanation was given very quickly--infection  occurred due to the absence of disposable syringes and poor  sterilization of reusable ones. This was the version presented  by Vadim Pokrovskiy, the director of the All-Union AIDS  Prevention Laboratory. It took him several days in Elista, where  mass infection was first detected, to reach this conclusion.  This version was actively supported, including at the  international level, by Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of the  USSR (now the Russian) Academy of Medical Sciences.    An entire boom of purchasing disposable syringes has passed  (as an example Yeltsin brought 100,000 from England, paid for by  an honorarium for his book), and production in this country was  organized. Concurrently it seem as if the chain of infections  that led to the single adult infection in the Elista hospital,  which started it all, was untangled. With this, official  medicine relaxed. But here's what's strange--the unprecedented  mass outbreak of hospital infection has rather distinct bounds:  It began in mid-1988, and ended in the middle of the next year.  There were still not enough syringes, the investigation was  still ongoing, but the infections had already ceased, as if  someone had dropped the boom in the virus's path.    Just 2 years ago physicians of one of the ``capitals'' of  children's AIDS, Rostov, said: ``Syringes are far from always to  blame. If a child that was already infected was lying in the  first floor of the hospital, then another who was on the fourth  floor at this time, and who was infected at the same time,  couldn't have received the virus from him. Syringes don't  circulate between floors and wards.'' The question, asked in  amazement, ``So how could he have been infected?'', was usually  followed by a long stare, leaving the dilettante bewildered.    Nobody wanted to talk in Rostov back then, and no one  especially wants to today. But there are grounds for this. In  1989 the AIDS laboratory of the Rostov Plague Institute began  its own investigation of the circumstances behind the infection  of the children, which didn't fit with the official ``dirty  syringes'' version. Its associates turned their attention to the  fact that immunoglobulin had been administered to most of the  infected children in the hospital. This preparation is made from  blood, including placental blood, which is taken from women  during labor. No one asks the female donors for their consent  for this--as a rule, they are not even informed that the  procedure is taking place. A maximum of 100 milliliters is  obtained from one person, while an industrial lot consists of  over 100 liters. One can imagine how many people have been  ``mixed together'' to create the preparation. The shelf life is  limited. After it expires, anything left over is scrapped.    In several series of experiments the laboratory diligently  reproduced the immunoglobulin production procedure after first  infecting the raw material with the virus. As a result in the  second series of experiments the virus was still alive in the  fifth, or second-to-last, production stage. It should be  considered that the laboratory meticulously adhered to the  procedure, which requires, in addition to other things, the use  of alcohol. How strictly it was observed in industry, under the  conditions of the fight that was going on then against  alcoholism, remains only to be guessed.    The first results were communicated at a meeting of Rostov's  extraordinary epidemic commission by the institute director,  Yuriy Lomov. And literally just a couple of weeks later the  order came from Moscow, from the Main Administration of  Quarantine Infections of the USSR Ministry of Health, to close  the AIDS laboratory of the plague institute ``as being not  consistent with its profile.'' The two series of experiments  were the only ones completed.    Mikhail Norkevich, who was then the director of the main  administration, now heads the AIDS control department of the  Russian Ministry of Health. He categorically rejects the  immunoglobulin version. He has his own arguments for this. Nor  does Vadim Pokrovskiy recognize it. We weren't able to learn his  reasons, because he refused to talk with this journalist. But  neither ever gave reasonable explanations why this study of an  alternative approach had to be stopped quickly and at its roots.    One of the main arguments against the danger of infection by  way of immunoglobulin is that the initial blood is tested for  AIDS. It is in fact tested for antibodies. But between infection  and the appearance of antibodies, there is a ``dead zone'' of  from 3 weeks to 3 months, during which tests are blind. If  infection and pregnancy occur simultaneously, this would be  precisely the time period during which women would go in for an  abortion, at which time blood would be taken.    There is one other argument--the procedure itself, which  consists of six stages, kills the virus. However, in 1984 HIV  was detected in such a blood preparation in the USA. Since that  time the finished product undergoes a seventh stage  there--processing by gamma-radiation, which kills every living  thing. This is a 100 percent guarantee, and it also saves on  tests to determine the quality of the blood and the end product.  On the backdrop of the punctures formerly suffered by the by-far  more procedurally precise and disciplined Americans, the  calmness of AIDS fighters in Moscow appears, in the least, as  not too justifiably presumptuous.    It seemed as if the disbelief of Rostov doctors in the sole  true version of infection was fated to remain at the level of  talk--no one is eager to stick his neck out when the two highest  AIDS officials are avidly interested in preserving only one  cause. But it turned out that there is an unrelated power  interested in conclusive investigation of all the details. The  procuracy in Rostov has been conducting an investigation since  the moment the first infected individuals were revealed.    Examining magistrate Valeriy Lysenko is rather cautious:  ``Clarification of the causes of infection is still continuing.  The personal opinion of no individual, even the most  authoritative, can be considered to be the truth until all of  the details are clarified.'' And there is plenty that is  unclear: For example, there has been no sanitary-epidemiological  analysis of infection in Rostov Oblast. The investigation  conducted its own expert examination at the Rostov Oblast  Children's Hospital, where 44 children were infected (a total of  99 children were infected in the oblast, and 75 remain alive).  After meticulous examination of all cases the experts brought in  by the procuracy concluded that for practical purposes not a  single child could have been infected by a syringe from the  infected girl from Elista who was also lying in this hospital.    After this conclusion the procuracy began searching for the  lots of immunoglobulin sent to Rostov in the middle of 1988, and  scrapped a year later. Control samples are supposed to remain in  the factories making the blood preparations, but the suspected  factories remain silent.    In the meantime one other fact that may turn even the local  version of infection several degrees in who knows what direction  fell into the lap of the procuracy. Until quite recently there  were eight infected adults in Rostov Oblast. One man, and the  rest women. The husband of one of the women divorced her after  the diagnosis, while another three women became pregnant (after  the diagnosis!) and gave birth, leaving their husbands healthy  in this case.    And it became clear just recently that there should be many  more infected adults in Rostov. Following the death of Gennadi  Ilchenko, the director of the oblast's main medical school, it  was revealed that he had been ill with AIDS since 1985. While he  was alive he was known as a person who could use his official  position to his advantage. As it now turns out, not only  materially but even physically. After the cause of his death was  announced, both male and female students, past and present, and  even instructors at the school, who had managed to have  relations with the deceased director, appeared for testing at  the oblast AIDS centers. The scandal is growing in Rostov's  medical circles. However, it turns out that what was a secret in  Rostov was known for a long time in Moscow. Ilchenko had been on  record at the hospital on Sokolinaya Hill, presently the Russian  Scientific and Teaching Center for AIDS, since 1987. It was  then, and is now, under the command of Vadim Pokrovskiy, who (no  one in Rostov doubts this) set up treatment for Ilchenko without  publicity. Unauthorized people shouldn't know about an AIDS  diagnosis, but even the chief physician didn't know about this  in the oblast AIDS center, which takes care of Rostov Oblast.  Two persons infected by Ilchenko have been revealed in Rostov  thus far. But few doubt that this is only the beginning.    People infected by the chief of the medical school may be at  any of the oblast's therapeutic institutions. Including at blood  transfusion stations, and in children's hospitals. The procuracy  is preparing to investigate a new version of the possible mass  infections--by way of infected medical workers.    As for what conclusions will be reached by the  investigation,  which has gotten into a matter that is not in its typical line  of work, time will tell. But until medicine opts to investigate  all versions at a serious scientific level, not one of us can be  assured that new hospital infections won't break out.</p>

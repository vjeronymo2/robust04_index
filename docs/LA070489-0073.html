			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Minnetonka Stock Falls: The price of Minnetonka Corp.'s shares fell sharply  amid disappointment that no third party would emerge to challenge  Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.'s $376.2-million offer for the perfume manufacturer.  Minnetonka, a Bloomington, Minn.-based company that makes Calvin Klein  fragrances, agreed to be acquired by Chesebrough-Pond's, a unit of Anglo-Dutch  consumer goods conglomerate Unilver PLC. Minnetonka slumped $2.625, or 10.5% of  its value, to close at $22.375 in heavy over-the-counter trading of more than 1  million shares.  </P></p>

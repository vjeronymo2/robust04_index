			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Smith backs bid to restart Irish talks MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, said in Dublin yesterday he fully supported efforts by the UK and Irish governments to restart round-table talks on Northern Ireland, Tim Coone writes. He said the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement and reunification of Ireland by consent remained the central pillars of his party's policy on the province. Mr Smith said that any renewed political talks in the north 'should be on the basis of the three strands of the previous talks, and on the principle that nothing should be agreed until all is agreed'.</p>

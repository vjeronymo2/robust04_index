In  preparation for upper house elections in summer 1995, the  coalition parties believe it is necessary to open talks on  interparty cooperation in election campaigns within this summer.  In connection with this, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has  recently requested a high-ranking official of the multiparty  parliamentary group Shin-Ryokufukai to expand the group to the  entire coalition as soon as possible. The merger of upper house  parliamentary groups will be carried out among the  Shin-Ryokuhukai, the Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ]. Informal negotiations are now under way among  SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, Komeito Deputy Secretary  General Naohiko Okubo, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]  Parliamentary Group Chairman Yukihisa Yoshida.    To cope with the next general election, Prime Minister  Hosokawa is seeking a unified parliamentary group in the lower  house. The upper house's moves toward a parliamentary group  merger involving the SDPJ is likely to accelerate inter-party  alliance, or even party realignment, in the lower house.    In a speech given to the 10 March meeting of the "10-Men  Association of the Coalition Village," a gathering of coalition  leaders chaired by former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe, SDPJ  Secretary General Kubo said: "The coalition must fully grapple  with the 1995 upper house elections narrowing our candidates.  We must unify our parliamentary groups." Attendants from other  parties basically agreed with his opinion.    Touching on the possible timing of the parliamentary group  merger at the upper house, a senior Komeito official said "we  are seeking the merger in the end of the current Diet session."  The new group may be called the "Dai-Ryokufukai."    At the upper house, the Shin-Ryokuhukai was formed last  month  as a joint parliamentary group of the Shinseito, the DSP, the  Democratic Reform Party [Minshu Kaikaku Rengo], the Japan New  Party [JNP], and the Sports Peace Party. In particular, the  Shinseito and the JNP take positive stances toward the  parliamentary group union because it may trigger similar moves  at the lower house, or even a political party realignment. In  mid-February, Prime Minister Hosokawa met with Shinseito  Parliamentary Group Acting Chairman Ichiji Ishii at the prime  minister's office and make a request to "unify (all coalition  parties) as soon as possible."    The Komeito has been taking positive attitudes toward its  own  participation in the unified parliamentary group. However, the  party wants the SDPJ to join the group simultaneously, since it  would be unfavorable to leave the largest ruling party in an  isolated position. Therefore, the Komeito is currently "waiting  for action by the SDPJ" (as a senior Komeito official said).</p>

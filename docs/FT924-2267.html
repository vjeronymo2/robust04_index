			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Nissan links with its suppliers' suppliers NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is strengthening its influence over the quality, cost and delivery time of components it purchases for use at its Sunderland plant by forg-ing links with its suppliers' suppliers. In a pilot project, Nissan has trained some of its suppliers' purchasing staff in its 'partnership philosophy' so they can help their suppliers cut their production costs. The initiative has led to Nissan personnel visiting 30 second-tier suppliers so far, to work with them on eliminating waste and improving assembly-line organisation. In some cases this has produced reductions in cost, and therefore price, which are being passed along the chain to Nissan. Mr Bob Gray, a purchasing manager at Sunderland, which will next year make 270,000 Primeras and Micras, said: 'We've developed a partnership philosophy with our first-tier suppliers. The intention is to develop that down through the sub-suppliers. 'We're trying to get them to drive their costs down rather than sit down, as tradition has been in the industry, and negotiate the price.' A report last month by Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and Andersen Consulting highlighted a productivity and quality gap between UK and Japanese automotive components suppliers. Many European suppliers, Mr Gray said, are not cost-competitive with Japan. Nissan operated an 'open book' system with suppliers, analysing their costs and production methods and agreeing a 'fair and realistic' profit, Mr Gray said. It floated the idea of its second-tier supplier experiment earlier this year among nearly all its 195 European suppliers. It will next year buy Pounds 850m worth of components from them for use in Primeras and Micras. Mr Gray said only five did not wish to get involved. Thirty suppliers from the UK and the Continent sent purchasing staff to Sunderland for workshop training in Nissan's partnership sourcing philosophy  -'a commitment by the customer and supplier, regardless of size, to a long-term relationship based on clear, mutually agreed objectives to strive for world-class capability and competitiveness'. Suppliers' staff then visited some of their suppliers. Mr Gray said Nissan became directly involved with the second tier only by invitation. 'It's not an imposition.' Most, he said, invited Nissan in.</p>

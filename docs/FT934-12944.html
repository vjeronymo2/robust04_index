			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Food and Drink: Simple, succulent Portuguese fare - Philippa Davenport samples local cuisine TERENA IS a small village, not far from Redondo, which is famed for its pottery. It has a Templar church, a beautiful slate pillory, and the remains of a 13th century castle. But another good reason for going there is Miga's restaurant - a fine example of Portuguese cuisine. Two cottages knocked into one, it has a choice of eating areas. In summer, you can sit outside under an olive tree on a geranium terrace serenaded by an orchestra of cicadas. In winter, there are dining rooms with log fires. The food, like the decor, is simple and well executed: flavoursome and without unnecessary elaboration, but presented with care. First, we were given a selection of appetisers: briny black olives, tangy sheep cheese from Nisa, and tiny sardine-like fish in saor (fried, soused in vinegar, dribbled with olive oil and served with strips of pickled carrot). The bread was good and the soups were even better. Hot tomato soup was flecked with oregano and green coriander, swirled with olive oil and served with a choice of boiled egg or salt cod if wanted. Gazpacho was the pale pink of vin rose and almost as thin as wine, as elegant and refreshing as any I have ever tasted. Then came a richly flavoured version of migos, a mixture of bread with garlic, bits of chorizo-type sausage, and fresh pork pan-fried in its own juices. This is not a summer dish (somehow, it is reminiscent of bubble and squeak) but I could not resist it. Next time, I shall also try the partridge escabeche and pig's muzzle with beans. Owners Susana Bianchi and Aboim Arnaldo opened the restaurant just four years ago so that guests at Casa de Terena (the B &amp; B she runs at the other end of the street) would not have to go to Redondo for meals. But Casa de Terena is a useful place to lay your head if you have dined too well at Miga's to want to drive on. The six rooms come with no frills but all the basics. Each has its own shower or bathroom, an electric ceiling fan to keep the temperature down in summer and a radiator or wood stove to keep you cosy in winter.

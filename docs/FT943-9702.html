			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / US hint on Serb sanctions US Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday endorsed easing sanctions against Serbia if Belgrade keeps its promise to stop aiding the Bosnian Serbs. 'If there is a substantial period of enforcement, if the border was effectively closed and if the Bosnian Serbs seem to be deprived of important aid and war-making material, clearly there then would be a case for easing of the sanctions,' he said. Mr Christopher's cautious statement suggests that the US regards steps to isolate the recalcitrant Bosnian Serbs as a potential turning point. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic last week cut ties after the Bosnian Serbs rejected the latest western-backed peace plan. A US Senate amendment to lift the arms embargo on Moslem-led Bosnia may be introduced as early as today. However, the White House fears any unilateral move would endanger allied peacekeeping efforts. Bosnian government troops, meanwhile, are overrunning Moslem separatist positions in the Bihac region, sending thousands of civilians and rebel soldiers fleeing across the border into neighbouring Croatia, according to United Nations officials. Government forces have made big advances against rebels who backed local business tycoon Mr Fikret Abdic, a former member of the Bosnian leadership, who split with Sarajevo almost a year ago over whether to accept an international peace plan for Bosnia.</p>

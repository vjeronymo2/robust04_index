			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Fans of that marvelous English soap opera, "Eastenders," will be saddened to  hear that only a few more episodes are scheduled for broadcast on KOCE in  Orange County. A spokesperson at the station told me that the last show will  air on April 12 and there are no plans to purchase additional shows. If viewers  enjoy the series as much as I do, they should let the station know.  </P> <P> Tina Fulton, San Clemente  </P></p>

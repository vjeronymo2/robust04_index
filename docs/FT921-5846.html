			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: US paper group to acquire 11% of Scitex INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US paper group, is to buy 11 per cent of Scitex, the Israeli manufacturer of computer imaging equipment, for Dollars 209m. Scitex will sell the New York-based International Paper 4.75m newly-issued ordinary shares in a private placement. The deal is still subject to the final approval of the respective boards of Scitex's two major shareholders - IDB Holding Company and Clal - and of International Paper. Each group would hold about 11 per cent of the shares in Scitex. Mr Arie Rosenfeld, Scitex's president and chief executive officer, said Scitex and the imaging products division of International Paper were already considering joint development projects, incorporating Scitex electronic imaging technology with International Paper's film, plate and consumables know-how. Scitex, Israel's most profitable company, announced a net profit of Dollars 100.6m, or Dollars 2.70 per share, for 1991, an increase of 31 per cent over the previous year. The company, whose shares are traded over-the-counter in New York, increased its revenues 22 per cent last year to Dollars 430m. Several months before his death, the late Mr Robert Maxwell had sold his 20 per cent holding in Scitex for Dollars 250m in order to help ease his debt problems elsewhere.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: New chief at US arm of WPP Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, one of the two big advertising agencies owned by Britain's ailing WPP Group, yesterday announced that Charlotte Beers had been appointed chairman and chief executive. Ms Beers replaces Mr Graham Philips, who is rumoured to have clashed with Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chairman. Ogilvy said yesterday that Mr Philips, who is 53 years old, asked to step down as chief executive last December. The agency added that it was agreed then that no announcement would be made until a successor had been found. It also said that Mr Philips would stay on as a vice-chairman 'with continuing responsiblity for certain key client relationships'. This arrangement, it said, was at Ms Beers' request. Ogilvy, founded by the legendary adman, David Ogilvy, was acquired by WPP in 1989 in a leveraged deal. This was its second big US acquisition, the first being the JWT Group.</p>

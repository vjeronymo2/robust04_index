			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Some 100  Guatemalans participated in a demonstration today in front of  the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), demanding the suspension  of the 30 January referendum which seeks the introduction of  constitutional reforms.    The demonstrators -- who were led by the Mutual Support  Group  (GAM), which is striving for the return of 45,000 people who  have been victims of violent actions -- asked the TSE not to  validate "the settlement between the Executive and Legislative  Branches" through the referendum.    Late in 1993, the TSE announced a referendum that would  allow  3.429 million voters to approve or reject reforms that seek to  shorten the terms of the Executive and Legislative Branches.    According to the multisector social forum that comprises  various civilian groups, the referendum is only a result of the  demands and pressure exerted by the IMF and the IDB  [Inter-American Development Bank], both of which are compelling  the government to sell various state enterprises.    The Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP) issued an appeal  to  all groups, urging them "to comprise a united front that rejects  the settlement that is about to take place."    On 16 November the executive and legislative branches agreed  to introduce the reforms, thereby ending a confrontation which  began on 27 September -- when President Ramiro de Leon Carpio  requested the resignation of 116 deputies.    GAM leader Nineth Montenegro issued an appeal to the  Guatemalan people, urging them to abstain from voting on 30  January because the very act of voting will legitimize a  settlement between the government and the congressmen. If the  referendum -- which was proposed by the Executive Branch,  endorsed by Congress, and announced by the TSE -- is approved by  a majority, the reforms approved will be enforced 60 days after  the TSE announces the results.    The current Legislative Branch should conclude its term on  14  January 1996, but, because of a dispute with the Executive  Branch stemming from former President Jorge Serrano's  self-inflicted coup on 25 May, the legislators' removal was  brought up. Provisional legislators will only remain until  January 1996, when congressmen elected in the 1995 general  elections should assume their posts. President de Leon Carpio's  successor must also be elected on this occasion.</p>

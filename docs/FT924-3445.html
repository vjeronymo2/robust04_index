			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Cost of Norfolk claret If the global climate does warm up during the next half-century, the effect on the world's food supply will be dramatic, but mixed. Our children or grandchildren could see flourishing vineyards in southern England, abundant sunflower crops in northern Europe, a shift in the balance of food production from Texas and Oklahoma to Minnesota and the north of New York state - and a disastrous fall in the third world's ability to grow cereals. None of the above is certain. All of it is indicative of the growing level of complexity of the research into the likely effects of global warming. Some of the work in progress was discussed at a conference on 'Energy for the 21st Century' at Brocket Hall, a commercialised country house in Hertfordshire, at the weekend. The host was Nuclear Electric. Several of the old reliables of environmental discourse were present, including Sir John Houghton, chairman of the greenhouse effect working group of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Sir Crispin Tickell, who turned Lady Thatcher green, and Professor David Pearce, a proponent of the use of market instruments to foster good practice. Anyone who attended and heard out the 11 speakers could only deduce that there almost certainly will be an unprecedented rise in average temperatures across the planet. What is not so well established is by how much, or whether, during the first century of getting hotter, the losses will be outweighed by unforeseen gains. Work on both these conundrums has been extended since the US played for time at the midsummer save-the-world conference in Rio. Fascinating preliminary results, upon which I built my opening fancy about Norfolk claret and Berkshire champagne, have come from Oxford University's Environmental Change Unit (ECU), headed by Professor Martin Parry. The latter's findings are derived from a three-year study commissioned in 1989 by the US Environmental Protection Agency, and conducted jointly by the ECU and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Some 50 scientists in various parts of the world were involved. The professor's computer models say that, depending on the degree of warming, world cereal production may be reduced by between 1 per cent and 7 per cent by 2060. Poor countries would become poorer, with an average fall in crops of around a 10th. In hot regions wheat, rice, maize and soybeans are already grown near to their limits of temperature tolerance. In low latitudes, yields of these foods, which account for 85 per cent of the world's trade in grains and legumes, would be badly affected by higher heat and humidity. An additional 60m to 360m people would be more likely to starve. The worst effect would be in Africa. That is the bad news. It should lead to the early adoption of precautionary measures against the emission of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Bring on a carbon tax, you might say. Unfortunately for those of us who believe that this is an urgent necessity, the findings are presented as tentative. They are dependent on variables about which we cannot be sure. They are emphatically not a forecast. Even more unfortunately for us eager greens, rich countries may actually gain from global warming. The energy-profligate Europeans and Americans are the very countries that must tax themselves to reduce emissions. Once again it is demonstrated that fate knows nothing of justice. Under most versions of the ECU model, crop yields increase in the rich countries. That is, I suppose, good news. At higher latitudes greater warmth can benefit farmers currently held back by cold weather and short growing seasons. This effect is not only global; it is also apparent within regions. In Europe everything moves a few paces north, including grains, grapes, sunflowers, soya plants - and the deleterious effect of the Sahara. If firmly established by further research, and if believed, Professor Parry's maps could change the balance of European environmental politics. Germany, Scandinavia and the Netherlands may become less green; Italy, Spain, half of France, and Greece more so. A similar shift within the US may also be visualised. A disaster, or the appearance of one, could change all that. The successively stronger conventions on phasing out chlorofluorocarbons were given their initial impetus by a satellite photograph of the hole in the ozone layer. The global warming debate began to be taken seriously in the US after the serious drought in the mid-west in 1988. A succession of iffy scientific studies, hedged about with necessary precautions, will never shape public opinion. Another drought in the US might, however, ratchet the entire debate a notch forward - perhaps to the point where closing coal mines, and generating power by nuclear means, will come to be regarded with favour by the green and the good.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alliant Techsystems in Dollars 465m defence purchase Alliant Techsystems, a Minnesota-based defence company, has agreed to pay Dollars 465m in cash and shares for the aerospace and defence business of Hercules, a company whose interests also extend to food additives and specialty chemicals. The deal is intended to create a stronger combined business in the defence and aerospace businesses, the two companies said, and echoes other mergers which have followed recent cuts in the US defence budget. Hercules Aerospace, which had sales of Dollars 660m and operating profits of Dollars 105m in 1993, makes rocket motors for space exploration, weapons systems and ordnance for the US army. Alliant, with sales of Dollars 775m and operating profits of Dollars 39m in the year to March 31, makes munitions and marine systems for the US and other countries. Under the agreement, Alliant will pay Dollars 365m in cash and issue 3.5m new shares to Hercules. Alliant's shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 yesterday to Dollars 28 5/8 . Over time, the company said, it will buy back 3.5m of its shares in the open market to counter the effects of the deal. The transaction will leave Hercules with a 26 per cent interest in Alliant, and two seats on its board. According to Mr Toby Warson, Alliant's president and chief executive, a significant attraction of the deal is the ability to combine the two companies' propellant production activities. Northrop Grumman has reached an agreement with Carlyle Group to acquire Carlyle's 51 per cent stake in Vought Aircraft for Dollars 130m, taking Northrop Grumman's ownership to 100 per cent. The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive agreement and Rodino anti-trust review.</p>

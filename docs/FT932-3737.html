			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Osborne &amp; Little better than expected SHARES in Osborne &amp; Little rose by 16p to 113p yesterday after the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics group reported better than expected trading results and announced a dividend increase. However, a Pounds 1.2m exceptional loss on the sale in August of Fardis, its French subsidiary, meant the group suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 98,000 in the year to March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 855,000 the previous year. There was a loss of 8.12p per share (7.83p earnings) but Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said that the group's stronger balance sheet and improved trading results justified a 10.6 per cent increase in the final dividend to 2.6p (2.35p) per share, making a 4.6p (4.35p) total. Group turnover fell to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 19.1m), including Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 5.65m) from discontinued operations, but the contribution from continuing operations grew by 19 per cent. Operating profits slipped slightly to Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 1.38m) but were ahead by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.04m) on a continuing operations basis. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 525,000). The group's expanding US operations boosted sales by 29 per cent which Sir Peter described as 'an exceptional result against the background of a very depressed home furnishings market.' In the UK, however, where the group closed its Edinburgh showroom, sales only increased by 4 per cent.</p>

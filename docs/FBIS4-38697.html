			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt report: "Sam Nunn's Press Conference. Uncle </F> Sam Is Disposed Peaceably But Won't Share"]    [Text] In the course of the ongoing visit to Moscow by a  delegation of U.S. legislators led by Sam Nunn, head of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, the question of holding joint  military exercises of the two countries, not in Russia alone but  also on U.S. territory, was discussed. In the opinion of Mr.  Nunn, voiced in yesterday's news briefing at the  Russian-American press center, this will partially put at rest  those in the Duma who mistrust joint military games with the  Americans. At the same time the senator indicated his total  rejection of Russia's claims for admission to the world arms  markets.    Duma Defense Committee head Sergey Yushenkov; two chairmen  of  international affairs committees, Vladimir Podoprigora  (Federation Council) and Vladimir Lukin (State Duma); and Sam  Nunn could not sidestep the now inevitable "Partnership for  Peace" topic. But nothing new in addition to commonplace  phrases on the need for cooperation and respect for Russian  statehood was heard.    Of greater interest is the other question touched upon --  the  arms trade. Moscow's desire to "divide the market" (it was also  repeated to Nunn by Andrey Kozyrev) runs against the United  States' sustained resistance. Washington wishes to divide  nothing because the capacity of the world arms market has in  fact been dwindling in recent years. Russia's arguments that  its position is especially difficult (saying the UN sanctions it  religiously observes kicks back at it in the most painful way)  are not being heeded: "Your allies are your problems."    The United States did at one time offer to divide the  market,  not according to regions (as Moscow would like to) but according  to sectors. This makes one think about "the tops and roots  tale" [a smart peasant let Bear, his partner, have the leaves of  beetroot they planted and kept the roots in the fall. The next  season they sowed oats; Bear wanted the roots and got them]:  Russian products cannot compete in high-tech sectors, while  their price in the obsolete weapons sector is not competitive.  As Yushenkov put it, the senators "flexed their muscles" to  show that "the U.S. grip on arms markets has not slackened." As  for their Russian counterparts' argument, that this position  would result in "the mafia's starting to sell weapons to the  countries targeted by the UN sanctions at that," it failed to  scare the Americans. Although they were not shy about admitting  that the Russian S-300 missile system is better that the  American "Patriot."</p>

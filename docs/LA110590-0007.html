			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL MASS TRANSIT PLANS  </P> <P> The idea of rail transportation in Southern California has been derailed many  times by old-fashioned attitudes such as the ones expressed by William Fulton  in his Opinion article ("Transit Rides the Rail Right-of-Way With Opportunistic  Approach in L.A.," Oct. 21).  </P> <P> One attitude is that Southern California is so spread out that only a handful  of us will benefit from rail transit.  </P> <P> Another is that many commuters can't -- or won't -- use rail transit regularly.  Both of these attitudes are wrong. Times have changed!  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC) is building an  integrated system serving all of Southern California with light rail such as  the Blue Line, heavy rail such as the Red Line subway, long-distance commuter  rail, which we can start very quickly on our new 175 miles of right-of-way,  plus the freeway system, surface streets and buses. Everyone knows that we will  also need our freeways, streets and roads for people who will need -- or prefer  -- to use their cars.  </P> <P> All Southern California will benefit because we have saved the Southern Pacific  rights-of-way for future generations.  </P> <P> NEIL PETERSON, Executive Director, Los Angeles County Transportation Commission  </P></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Finland leads falls on political concerns COMMENTS by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, that the current level of inflation did not justify further cuts in interest rates set thetone for equities last week. The World Index, according to the FT-Actuaries series, declined 1.3 per cent in local currency terms, dragged lower by a 1.4 per cent fall in the US and a 1.7 per cent drop in Japan. The Tokyo fall was accentuated by shrinking volume before the Golden Week holidays, starting yesterday. The worst performer of the week was Finland. The bourse dropped by 5.3 per cent in local currency terms in daily volume of less than FM20m (Dollars 4.9m) onuncertainty about the economic policy of the new centre-right government, whichwas formed last Friday. Mr Peter Bradshaw of Swiss Bank Corporation in London says the market came under heavy selling pressure on Thursday, when volumeexpanded to FM50.1m as investors took up their options, which expired that day,and immediately sold the underlying stock. Union Bank of Finland was also reported to have been a heavy seller, via Unitas, the brokers, of restricted shares in itself and Kymmene, the forest products group. However, Mr Bradshaw believes that the new government's adherence to the previous administration's economic policy, as well as promising to lower interest rates, should help the stock market. The government aims to keep the Finnish markka strong, avoid currency devaluation, cut interest rates and reduce the current account deficit. Mr Bradshaw also believes the stock market is emerging from its 18-month trough. Investors have discounted the collapse in Finnish trade with the Soviet Union and are now looking forward to 1992 when the fortunes of Finnish companies are set to recover. Australia provided the week's biggest rise, of 1.8 per cent inlocal currency terms, on prospects of further decreases in wages growth and inflation into 1992.</p>

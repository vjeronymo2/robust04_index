			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILNER SAYS HE WON'T SEEK 3RD COUNCIL TERM  </P> <P> Saying he had accomplished most of his key goals, Glendale City Councilman  Jerold Milner announced Tuesday that he will not seek a third four-year term in  the April 2 election.  </P> <P> Milner, 60, said he agrees with the California voters who approved term limits  for state officeholders in last month's election, although the measure does not  apply to Glendale officials.  </P> <P> "I think the people of California have decided there should be an eight-year  limit on how long people should serve," the councilman said.  </P> <P> Milner said he had accomplished the two major goals he set for himself when he  was elected to the council: to control the city's growth and improve the city's  redevelopment program.  </P> <P> The councilman played a leading role in preparing the growth management program  enacted recently to reduce the number of new apartments and condominiums that  can be built in Glendale.  </P> <P> Milner said the city faces several challenges "that would be lots of fun to  address." He said the city must assist Glendale car dealers, whose expansion  plans have been opposed by nearby residents, and address the problem of day  laborers who congregate at two Glendale sites. Other unresolved issues, he  said, include developing new design rules for single-family houses and  providing more open space.  </P> <P> But, Milner said, "I think the philosophy of limited service in office  overrides the temptation to continue."  </P> <P> He said his greatest disappointment was the council's failure earlier this year  to approve an overnight on-street parking ban that was strongly opposed by  residents. Milner said the parking restriction would have helped the city  reduce the size of Glendale households, and he predicted that the council would  reconsider the matter in the future.  </P> <P> His announcement ended the uncertainty regarding the reelection plans of two  council members whose seats are at stake in the spring election. The other,  Mayor Larry Zarian, last week launched his campaign for a third term.  </P> <P> Although nomination papers cannot be filed until January, two other candidates,  Mary Ann Plumley and Eileen Hadley Givens, have already begun campaigning for  the council.  </P> <P> Milner, who said he does not plan to endorse anyone in the April race, said he  is disappointed by the number of candidates. "I would like to see the people of  Glendale have a choice among four or five business-oriented candidates," he  said.  </P> <P> The councilman said he favors candidates with such a background because he  considers the operation of the city a big business.  </P> <P> Milner's announcement could trigger the entry of other candidates who were  reluctant to challenge a well-known incumbent. When Councilman John F. Day  decided not to seek reelection in 1979, 13 candidates filed and Glendale had  its most widely contested campaign in four decades.  </P> <P> Milner, a native of Boulder, Colo., who grew up in Cheyenne, Wyo., and San  Carlos, Calif., has lived in Glendale for 27 years. In 1987, he retired after  33 years as a manager with Pacific Bell.  </P> <P> He said he plans to remain active in civic organizations including the Glendale  Kiwanis Club and the Glendale Symphony Assn. after he steps down from the  council.  </P></p>

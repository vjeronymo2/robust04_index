			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Kiev cracks whip over Crimea Urkaine's parliament took steps yesterday to compel the separatist Crimean peninsula to accept its rule. It rescinded a host of Crimean laws declared in violation of the Ukrainian constitution and backed the action with limited economic sanctions. This is the fourth ultimatum this year and follows the failure of Crimea's parliament to meet a deadline to comply with Ukrainian law. Despite calls to close the Crimean parliament and rescind the republic's autonomous status, voiced loudly by nationalists, the conservative Ukrainian parliament put off those decisions until later. The vote marks the latest volley in the dispute between Kiev and Crimea which has been raging since the Soviet Union's collapse left the predominantly Russian Black Sea region within Ukraine, to which it had been transferred in 1954.</p>

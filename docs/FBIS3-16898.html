These are the results of the poll carried out  in the first week of March by the "National Self-determination"  Union (NSU)'s Public Opinion Studies Center. In 1991, when the  President election was held, over 80 per cent of Armenian  citizens voted for Levon Ter-Petrosyan.    More than a quarter of the respondents, the total number of  which is 600, claimed they wouldn't vote for any candidate.  13.2 per cent prefer the NSU leader Paruyr Hayrikyan. Other  candidates' rating is far lower.    According to the poll, published in Yerevan newspaper  "Ankakhutyun" (Independence), about 9 per cent of Yerevan  residents will vote for the ruling party - Armenian National  (Pannational] Movement. Most chances have Armenian  Revolutionary Federation "Dashnaktsutyun" (20.8 per cent), and  NSU (11.5 per cent). A little more than 8 per cent of the  respondents choose to vote for the Communist Party.</p>

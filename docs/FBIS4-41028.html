			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of the statement released by the Supreme Council </F> press center in Kiev; date not given]    [Text] As is known, for the first time in history,  Ukraine's Supreme Council on 15 June initiated and adopted basic  principles and directions for developing the Ukrainian economy  during the crisis period. A report on this topic was delivered  by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz.    The legislative chairman paid a working visit last week to a  number of Ukraine's oblasts and regions to clarify the  principles of economic policy and the realistic, concrete steps  for implementing these principles during the current stage. It  is understandable that during a meeting with working collectives  and citizens other issues were discussed, as well. In  particular, Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz is being  addressed as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency. Certain  organs of the media, however, while covering the working trip by  the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, allow biased reports or  insinuations to be filed, or sometimes simply produced outright  provocative reports. Along these lines, the Moscow television  company Ostankino made an unsubstantiated statement that  Oleksandr Moroz had withdrawn his candidacy and refused to run  for president. Alas, this provocative fabrication was picked up  by other indiscriminating media, including some in Ukraine,  which found themselves in an awkward position before the eyes  and ears of their readers and listeners, having swallowed  Ostankino's primitive bait. The Supreme Council press center is  being addressed by the electors with demands to clarify the  essence of these reports -- is this true? The press center is  authorized to report that this so-called sensational report by  the Ostankino television company is a vicious fabrication  pursuing certain political goals. There were no reasons for the  appearance of such a piece of reporting during either the  meeting of Oleksandr Moroz with electors or the news conference.  This is not the first time that Ostankino, in its reports from  Ukraine, has released disinformation and twisted facts with the  purpose of distorting the actual state of things, ignoring the  truth -- one of the principal requirements of journalism. While  covering such important official events as the working trip by  the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, every paper, every  television or radio agency should be even more accurate and  objective, and inform people only of the truth, not spread  clearly provocative fabrications.</p>

In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Monday, he noted that  Egypt's stand on the settlement policy is clear and known and  that it considers the settlements illegal and that they should  all be removed. He remarked that there is agreement to discuss  the matter in the final stages of the solution.    He expressed his belief that the Israeli-Palestinian talks  will not be resumed officially until the Security Council passes  a resolution denouncing the Hebron operation and providing  protection for the Palestinians.    The ambassador denounced Israeli and Western media  exaggerations and one-upmanship in handling the manifestations  of violence and terrorism in Egypt and these media's attempts to  damage Egypt's image abroad.</p>

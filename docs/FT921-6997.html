			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Indian president warns parliament on high inflation INDIAN President R. Venkataraman yesterday opened parliament with a warning of the dangers of high levels of inflation in the country. His speech to the two houses was seen as setting the scene for a budget in which the main emphasis will be on cutting government expenditure as a way of reducing the fiscal deficit and inflation. The government is keen to avoid adding substantially to the tax burden for fear this will further exacerbate pressure on prices. Describing inflation as 'a matter of grave concern,' Mr Venkataraman said that 'once the fiscal deficit is reduced and brought under control, inflation can be expected to come down to reasonable levels'. The budget, due to be delivered on Saturday by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, will mark the second wave of the government's liberalisation and economic restructuring programme launched by the new Congress party government in July. It will show how radical the government is prepared to be over reducing protective tariffs, cutting government expenditure and in tackling overmanning in the public sector. But room for manoeuvre has been reduced by continuing high inflation and the industrial production slump, raising fears that reform could become ensnared in Latin American-style stagflation. Inflation has dropped to 12 per cent from a 16 per cent annualised rate in August - but remains well above the 9 per cent for financial 1991-1992 that the finance minister had forecast. Industrial production has also tumbled more sharply than expected, with zero or negative growth now forecast this year, against an 8 per cent rise last year. Dr Deepak Nayyar, former chief economic adviser who resigned after policy disagreements with the finance minister, warned at the weekend of the risks of stagflation from unsustainably high levels of inflation and of the deficit on the external account. He called for a slowdown in structural reforms until greater macroeconomic balance had been achieved. The government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, nonetheless faces the budget session in a politically stronger position than six months ago. The 12 seats Congress won in last week's elections in Punjab give it close to a majority in the parliament.</p>

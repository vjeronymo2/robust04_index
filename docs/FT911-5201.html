			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Mexico in debt for study swap MEXICO and Harvard University have agreed a Dollars 2.9m 'debt-for-scholarship' swap. Harvard will assume a portion of Mexico's foreign debt to establish a fund for Mexican students to attend the university and for Harvard students and staff to study and teach in Mexico. Last July Harvard made a similar Dollars 5m agreement with Ecuador, the first of its kind, based on the 'debt-for-nature' swaps which have funded environmental projects. The deal was signed last week by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his visit to the US to promote a North American free trade area embracing the US, Canada and Mexico. Harvard is to buy Mexican discount bonds, trading at about 68 per cent of face value. The Dollars 2m invested in the bonds will be converted into pesos at face value and subsequently into dollar accounts to fund the programme. The fund is expected to provide grants for at least 100 students and professors over the first 10 years. Harvard president Derek Bok said the agreement was 'a crucial step that will enable Harvard to increase its interaction with Mexico in order to better understand and learn from its remarkable neighbour to the south'.</p>

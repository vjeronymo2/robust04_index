			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Put choice back into study of sciences (1) Sir, I would like to comment from a teacher's point of view on the current debate over the fall in the number of students opting for science at A-level ('Discipline in need of a better chemistry', August 28). During most of the 1980s, secondary teachers had the freedom to choose whether to offer students separate sciences, ie biology, chemistry and physics, or combined/balanced science courses, which contained aspects of all three. Pressure groups within the teaching profession pushed for the adoption of the balanced science courses in place of separate subjects. The introduction of the national curriculum allowed the imposition of these courses in many schools against the wishes of the science teachers who previously taught separate sciences. This was one of the reasons why I left teaching in secondary schools after 15 years. If society is concerned about the number and quality of science students, it might do worse than consider the teachers and what they teach. While many are committed to balanced science courses, others - who studied a particular science because they enjoyed it - would like to continue to teach the individual subject. For some, having to teach, say, physics or biology when they are chemistry enthusiasts is as disheartening as expecting a history graduate to teach French or geography. If science teachers were again allowed the freedom to choose the approach they prefer, their enthusiasm for the subject would probably increase, and this would hopefully encourage more students to choose scientific courses.

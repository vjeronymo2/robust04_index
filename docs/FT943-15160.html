			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK insurance The government's decision to allow building societies to write house structure and contents insurance is welcome. The commissions paid to societies for selling policies underwritten by insurance companies - anything up to 30 per cent of premium - are an unnecessary expense borne by consumers. Direct sellers such as Direct Line are already putting commissions under pressure. The government has now given the building societies the choice between accepting lower commissions and going it alone. Even if commissions come down, many societies will be loath to give up such risk-free income and take on underwriting risk themselves. Others will not have capital available to back new insurance ventures. But with modern technology and adequate reinsurance cover, societies should be able to avoid ruinous losses in household insurance. Larger societies may thus be tempted to take advantage of their new freedom, even if it means buying claim-handling or other services from outside. That would be bad news for the composite insurers, which gain up to half their household premiums through building society links. The sharp rise in premium rates in recent years means the business is now highly profitable. Wide margins have already tempted the direct writers to muscle in, and new ventures by building societies would add to the competitive pressure. Composite insurers may face a battle to defend their market share.</p>

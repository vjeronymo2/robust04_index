			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization </F> for the Liberation of Abkhazia, by Maia Toradze; place and date  not given: "Shevardnadze and His Terrorist Group Should Be Wary  of Me"]    [Text] [Toradze] Batono [Georgian polite form of address]  Boris, why was the Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia  formed?    [Kakubava] There used to exist in Abkhazia the Council for  National Unity that had been elected on 9 May 1992 at the  congress of the Georgian population living in Abkhazia. As we  had been thrown off the territory of Abkhazia and were  confronted with another stage in life, we considered it  necessary to transform this purely political association -- the  Abkhazian Council for National Unity that united 19 parties and  organizations -- into a political and military organization that  would lead [the struggle] for the return of the territory of  Abkhazia.    [Toradze] Your organization believes that we should use  military force to recover Abkhazia. How realistic is this?    [Kakubava] It is possible to recover Abkhazia only by using  military force and only now for, if we delay, it will be too  late. I also believe we are already eight months late and this  is the fault of the head of state. We should not have started  the war in Abkhazia at that precise time. We told Eduard  Shevardnadze this right from the start. A group of 10 of us --  five members of the Abkhazian Council for National Unity and  five from the Ilia Chavchavadze Society -- went to see the head  of the Supreme Council then and we proved to him in detail that  introducing tanks and soldiers into Abkhazia would have the  consequences that we can clearly see now. Shevardnadze promised  us then that he would not send armed units onto the territory of  Abkhazia, but, one week later, the Georgian Army entered  Abkhazia and the war began. In spite of our negative attitude,  given that this, nevertheless, had happened, the war should have  ended in our victory; we should have punished the separatists  and their leaders and the enemies of Georgia and established  Georgian jurisdiction over the territory of Abkhazia. This  process should have lasted no more than 10 days. However,  everyone knows that, precisely on Shevardnadze's direct  instructions, Jaba Ioseliani [leader of the "Mkhedrioni"  paramilitary group, first deputy chairman of the State Council  at the time] arrived in Abkhazia, the Georgian Army halted its  advance, and talks were held with the Abkhazians --as a result  of which we were unable to cross the Gumista river. This led to  the surrender of Gagra and later Sukhumi, the extermination of  30,000 people and the expulsion of the Georgian population.  Today, there are no Georgians in Abkhazia. It is no longer  Georgia.    Yet, the greatest misfortune is that this war was called an  Abkhazian-Georgian war, which is in no way true. This was  Russian aggression against Georgia. The introduction of troops  was planned by Russia. Whether it was Shevardnadze or [former  Defense Minister] Kitovani who carried this out does not  interest me. I know one thing: The Army was brought in on  Russia's orders, it was made to halt its advance and play war,  and Russia was given the opportunity to use the Apsua  [Abkhazians' name for themselves] against us and this war was  called an Abkhazian-Georgian war, whereas, in reality, it was  Russian aggression. Many of those who fought in this war say  that Gagra, Sukhumi, and Kochara were sold out. I do not know  if this is true and do not support these kind of statements;  however, I do know that we did not lose a single place in  battle. Even in the position that we were then, we could have  won any war in spite of the fact that Russian Army formations  were opposing us; we could have won as the battle was being  conducted on our territory. However, the Georgian authorities  began to deceive the Georgian population by saying that we could  not manage without Russia and that, for goodness' sake, we  should not offend Russia and we should not say that it was  precisely Russia that was waging war against us. In Parliament,  we were attacked by a part of the deaf- and-dumb majority  obedient to the authorities and were not even given the right to  mention Abkhazia during the parliamentary sessions. I view this  as betrayal. One cannot keep a country in a state of war for  two years and finally state: I [Shevardnadze] did not allow our  Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli because Abkhazians would  have been killed there. Then, why did you go to war? Why are  you the commander in chief of the Army who put us in a state of  war? If you do not destroy the enemy but allow your Army to be  destroyed in the meantime, what kind of person are you? Thirty  thousand Georgians have died, Georgia has lost its best land,  and no one is assuming responsibility for this. It would have  been a different matter had you said that we had fought but lost  the battle. However, when all actions are directed toward your  army units losing the war -- you appoint people from the street  to top positions, people who are absolutely incompetent, all  levels are controlled by mafia structures, and a representative  of the [criminal] underworld is raised to the level of the state  -- if this is not betrayal, let any Georgian tell me what it is.    The head of state's statements that we will return with  dignity to Abkhazia are nothing but deception; this is a fact  because he conducted negotiations with the opposing side against  our wishes. Today, Abkhazia is known throughout the world as an  independent land. Shevardnadze could have held negotiations  with the head of the Russian state as a war was going on between  Georgia and Russia, whereas we could have discussed the conflict  with the Abkhazians and come to an agreement among ourselves.  Shevardnadze had not sent even one of our representatives to  participate in the meetings and negotiations that had been held  up to that point. In spite of our daily protests in Parliament  that this was a step toward recognizing the independent state of  Abkhazia, the independent state of Abkhazia was established in  the accord of 4 April. When we mention this, representatives of  the majority raise an admonishing finger and say that, on the  contrary, we have done a good thing and that this is a political  statement and does not mean Abkhazia's independence. There  followed a flood [of documents] on the state independence of  Abkhazia that were based on the 4 April accord, in particular  the agreement of 14 May according to which Russia was able to  declare Abkhazia to be an independent state and to determine the  Abkhazian-Georgian border along which Russian Army units are to  be deployed. It followed from the final agreement that Russia  was not satisfied with Abkhazia: Samegrelo has been declared a  buffer zone and Russian troops will be located on its territory  as far as Khobi.    [Toradze] Why do you think people are negatively disposed  toward you? Is it simply because they favor Shevardnadze or is  it because they really do believe that it is possible to settle  this problem by means of negotiations?    [Kakubava] No, this is not what they think. I do not know  of any person in Georgia today who could sign a document giving  away Georgian territories. I do not agree with the view that  Georgia cannot exist on its own. We are a country of 5 million,  but we have the potential to maintain a state of 15 million.  However, if we artificially create such conditions in which we  kill the Georgian's desire for originality and, if we allow the  view to prevail that we can do nothing without others and that  the whole world is feeding us thanks to Shevardnadze, we will be  unable to become an advanced nation. The view has been  frequently expressed recently that we are not a warlike people  and that war is not our business. Such statements should be  condemned. We are indeed a warlike people and courageous as  well and no stronger nation than ours exists in the world; we  are truly a decent people, but we simply need a leader who will  conduct a policy that befits an independent state. Today, we  have a government that is dragging us toward enslavement. It  contains people who, in their time, were nothing but thieves and  who do not know what a nation is and what the state approach to  a matter is.    We now state the following: As they have brought us this  far, they should now give us the chance to return to Abkhazia.  I am not competing for anyone's job; I am a soldier. Of those  300,000 Georgians [refugees], there are at least 50,000 brave  men who are able to fight. Shevardnadze can see our potential.  The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia can do this and  this is why he, in principle, does not want to meet us.    [Toradze] If you are able to fight, why didn't you fight  then in Abkhazia? You had the opportunity. Isn't it now rather  late for your self-sacrifice?    [Kakubava] We stated at the time that we should have been  given weapons and we could have defended our land by ourselves.  We warned them: Don't send those inexperienced kids who are  seeing weapons for the first time; give us the chance to fight  alone. However, it is not only in Abkhazia, but also here that  Shevardnadze is failing to help us in our concern to regain our  own territory.    [Toradze] You mentioned that we were fighting against Russia  in Abkhazia. However, even with an army of 50,000 that is well  trained, is there any chance that we can win? Have you taken  this into account?    [Kakubava] We can win on Georgian territory; this should not  evoke any negative emotions in us. If Russia were to wage war  with all its potential, it would conquer not only Georgia but  also the whole world. However, it will not unleash such a war.  We would always win the type of war that is being waged in  Abkhazia.    [Toradze] Today, you held a news conference at which you  said that you were filing a law suit against Shevardnadze in the  Georgian Supreme Court....    [Kakubava] Yes. I said that, if, on the instructions of  Shevardnadze, Parliament does not disavow all those signed  documents concerning Abkhazia within the next five days, we  reserve the right to call upon the Georgian population to  restore the territorial integrity of Georgia and will demand  that the government be replaced by peaceful means, without any  bloodshed or destruction. However, we do not want Shevardnadze  to leave Georgia without assuming responsibility. Therefore, we  have filed a lawsuit in the Georgian Supreme Court and with the  procurator general in which we accuse him of betraying Georgia  in accordance with Article 65 of the Georgian Criminal Code.    [Toradze] Do you think that you will win this case?    [Kakubava] The case is already won, as, to our surprise, he  stated at a parliamentary session that the reason for his not  permitting the Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli was that  this would have resulted in the annihilation of the Abkhazian  people. This crowns everything that he has done up to now. When  the commander in chief does not allow his own army to destroy  the opposing side and, meanwhile, it is his army that is  destroyed, this is betrayal.    [Toradze] Are you not afraid of making so many bold  statements or even of filing a lawsuit?    [Kakubava] Shevardnadze and his terrorist group should be  wary of me because I will be a proper plaintiff at this trial.  If I am killed, those left behind will behave in a different  way.    Furthermore, I will tell you another thing. Whoever intends  to kill me will not be buried in Georgia as it will be  impossible to find a burial place for him here.</p>

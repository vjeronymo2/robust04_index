			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ernest Oelofse] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 9 SAPA -- A row is brewing  between East London newspaper THE DAILY DISPATCH and Mrs Winnie  Mandela, the president of the African National Congress Women's  League. According to the newspaper a secret ANC report, in which  it was found that Mrs Mandela had stolen money from and  defrauded her own party to the tune of hundreds of thousands of  rands, was leaked to a DISPATCH correspondent in Cape Town.    A recent report in the DISPATCH said the ANC was still  trying  to work out how much money was missing. Mrs Mandela, who is  widely tipped as a future cabinet minister in the new South  Africa, had refused to appear before an ANC commission into the  affair headed by late ANC chief Oliver Tambo, it said.    The ANC commission's report, claimed the DISPATCH, had found  that Mrs Mandela had been caught counting piles of United States  dollars and cheques after a visit to the United States. The  money was "donations" Mrs Mandela had collected during her visit  and had failed to declare to the ANC.    There was also evidence that Mrs Mandela had pocketed  "substantial" amounts of interest yielded by funds deposited  into her account. These funds were legally destined for the  ANC's social welfare department.    Mrs Mandela is also suspected in the ANC report, according  to  the dispatch, of taking an alleged R190,000 [rand] "kickback" on  a farm bought by the ANC for returning exiles. The price paid  for the Walkerville property was R350,000, yet it was only worth  R160,000. Mrs Mandela was a main party in the deal.    According to the ANC report, Mrs Mandela had admitted  shaving  R74,000 off a donation destined for the ANC's social welfare  department. The money had, to date, not been paid back. A  statement issued by Mrs Mandela on Saturday said she had  instructed her lawyers to undertake litigation against the  DISPATCH.</p>

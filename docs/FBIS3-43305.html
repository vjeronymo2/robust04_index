As the Lusaka talks  are scheduled to resume on 5 January, it has been reported that  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  delegation arrived in Kinshasa today on its way to the Zambian  capital. Beye, however, did not confirm or deny the report,  merely saying that all sides will be in Lusaka on 5 January  ready to talk.    Before the start of the talks Chief Beye is scheduled to  visit two countries and meet U.S. congressmen. He will go to  Gabon and Zaire to brief the respective presidents on the state  of the peace process. In view of Beye's tight schedule, the  talks will start at 1600 on 5 January.    Beye said he took the opportunity during today's audience at  the Futungo de Belas to greet the president of the Republic on  the occasion of the new year. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the Portuguese news agency, LUSA, says Foreign  Minister Venancio de Moura is on his to New York for a meeting  with Butrus Butrus-Ghali at 2300 today.

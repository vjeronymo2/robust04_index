			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Time to raise, a time to cut ONE MIGHT have expected the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to have steered clear of the dangerous world of macroeconomic forecasting and short-term policy advice. Its recent forecasting record has been far from impressive, while the world economy seems peculiarly unpredictable at present. Yet, undaunted by past difficulties, the OECD has once more stuck its neck out, using this year's annual report on the US economy to advocate a pre-emptive increase in US interest rates before the end of this year and a two point increase by the end of 1994. Is the threat of inflation in America's seemingly sluggish economy really that alarming? US administration officials, buoyed up by Mr Clinton's victory on Nafta, will be disinclined to take the advice seriously. For, as the OECD itself points out, America's two-year old recovery has so far occurred at half the rate of the average of the previous five. The OECD expects growth next year to rise to 3 per cent, half the pace of a normal US rebound. Domestic inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, is actually expected to fall from 2.6 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent next. But might the OECD have a point? The lags in US monetary policy are long and unpredictable, while US short-term interest rates are unusually low for this stage of a recovery - three month money market rates adjusted for inflation are barely positive. If Mr Greenspan, chairman of the board of the US Federal Reserve, wants to beat an upsurge in inflationary expectations, he must be prepared to move at the first sign that expectations are rising. While the recovery may be sluggish, there have been clear signs of acceleration in recent months: manufacturing output rose 4.4 per cent in the year to October, retail sales were 6.2 per cent higher and house prices are accelerating. Economic growth is, as a result, expected to be above an annual rate of 3.5 per cent this quarter, compared to only 1.3 per cent in the first half of the year. Yet so far, there is little evidence to suggest that inflationary pressures are building. Long-term interest rates have risen slightly recently but remain low by historic standards. Credit growth is sluggish, wage inflation is subdued and unemployment high for this stage of the cycle. The annual rate of consumer price inflation did rise 0.1 percentage points to 2.8 per cent in October, but producer prices fell 0.2 per cent. In short, the case for an immediate increase in US rates is hardly compelling. As the OECD also points out, there are a number of reasons to think that growth may remain slow next year. These include the burden of outstanding debt in the personal sector, next year's tax increases, defence cuts, and continued slow growth in US export markets. If slow growth remains the immediate problem, the same is doubly so for Britain. The UK economy has grown by a mere 2 per cent since the trough of the recession at the beginning of 1992, less than a third of the US rebound after a much deeper recession. Unemployment is falling, but other labour market indicators - wages, vacancies and employment - all suggests that deflationary pressures remain strong. Inflation is both low and falling, and UK short-term real interest rates are not only above 4 per cent but actually higher than they were a year ago. Mr Greenspan can afford to wait before raising rates. Assuming that the British chancellor is prepared to tighten fiscal policy in his forthcoming budget, Mr Greenspan's British counterparts at the Bank of England can safely cut.</p>

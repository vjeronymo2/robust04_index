			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Management: Going it alone - Dominique Damon, the only female executive director of a large Swiss company, talks to Ian Rodger / Euromanagers to watch MORE than a few Swiss eyebrows were raised when Dominique Damon joined Alusuisse, the venerable aluminium and chemicals group, in 1988 to head its nascent packaging division. The commanding heights of the big Swiss companies have been notoriously closed to women and foreigners, and Damon, who comes from Paris, is both. Even today, she is the only woman executive director of a large Swiss company. But if the eyebrows are still raised, it is for entirely different reasons. In seven years, she has pulled together a motley group of packaging operations spread around Alusuisse, bought eight complementary companies in Europe and the US and shaped them into a sparkling global performer. Sales of the packaging division have jumped from SFr744m (Pounds 339.7m) in 1988 to SFr1.4bn last year, and it contributes more than a third of group profit. Alusuisse had been struggling for years to diversify from its historical dependence on commodity aluminium products and so its appreciation of her abilities is far from surprising. Early this year, she was given responsibility for the group's industry and transport equipment division, and has just been named deputy chief executive. There is a stereotype of the high-powered French female executive - stylishly dressed, immaculately groomed, confident in carriage, dazzlingly clever, tough, sexy. Damon is different. She dresses simply and conservatively, wears no make-up and does not try to hide her 46 years or her greying hair. She speaks and moves softly, listens attentively and has a charming, self-deprecating sense of humour. Only gradually do the sharp intellect and iron will emerge. She is, above all, a professional manager. She studied management in university, and went straight to BSN, the French flat glass and food group, after receiving a doctorate in experimental psychology in 1970. At BSN she first worked in industrial relations and employee training in the Boussois glass division for five years. She then switched to the food division, just as it was acquiring the Gervais business. As director of administration, she was responsible for the massive internal reorganisation that followed. In 1985, she moved to Carnaud to become chief executive of its FFr2bn (annual sales) plastic packaging business, and was wooed away to Alusuisse three years later. She says she had no second thoughts about joining the Swiss group, having been ignorant of Swiss business culture. 'I had always been in very international groups, and here as well the management seemed very international, not necessarily by nationality but by attitude. It was only afterwards that I realised that perhaps Alusuisse was exceptional among Swiss companies.' She says she immediately felt comfortable with the management style of the Alusuisse executive committee, which emphasised flexibility, teamwork and motivating employees to participate in defining and achieving strategic goals. She recoils from defining her strengths as a manager. 'I like to avoid labels,' but says she feels most strongly about motivating employees to take a team approach to clients. Significantly, in all the companies in which she has worked, the clients have been highly sophisticated. Whether trying to convince Renault to buy more BSN glass, Hypermarche to buy more Danone yoghurt, or General Foods to use Alusuisse packaging for its pet foods, the sell has always been a complex, technical one. Increasingly, the supplier has to co-operate closely with the client in developing a product. 'It is not a question of sending along a salesman. All our managers must have a relationship with the client, and we have to work as a team,' she says. She sees her own role as chief motivator. She travels constantly, visiting her operating units, finding out what is going on, making sure they are meeting their goals. 'If you don't know what people are thinking, you can go seriously wrong. And the only way I can find out is to listen to them. Perhaps I do not have sufficient imagination to figure things out for myself.' She has also been careful to install a rigorous financial reporting system at the packaging division's new home base in Paris. Each operating company has clear goals, and is monitored by the week by one of her team of 12 central executives. Her own interventions are less systematic. 'If a company is going well, it may see me three times a year if it is going badly, it will see me every month.' So far, her system works admirably well. She claims that none of her subsidiaries is in trouble at the moment, and she takes particular pride that the executive teams of all the businesses she has acquired remain largely intact. Damon dislikes the term workaholic, but admits she makes sure there is a telephone and fax available when she goes on holiday. 'I would find it hard to break communications, because it would be so difficult to catch up when I got back. And at this level of responsibility, I do not believe I should cut myself off.' Although she would not seem to have much time for family life, she is obviously proud of her similarly over-achieving teenage daughter. Echoing Hillary Clinton, she observes, 'perhaps she missed something by not having me at home baking cakes, but I don't think so. And she has seen a lot of the world.' Where Damon goes from here is anyone's guess. She claims not to be concerned. 'I have no need to think ahead 10 years. I have sufficient challenge and satisfaction where I am.' Would she want to work in a bigger company? 'I do not think the size of a company is necessarily directly related to the complexity of managing it.' Would she expect to become chief executive of Alusuisse? 'Everyone asks me that. It is not my problem. It is not an important issue. 'I am very comfortable working in this team.'</p>

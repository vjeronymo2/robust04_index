			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Painful Choice Between Human Rights and Trade"] </F>   [Text] The renewal of most-favored-nation (MFN) trade  status for China has become an annual issue. This time  President Clinton has, in effect, unconditionally extended MFN  for China by announcing that his administration would in future  remove the link between the renewal of MFN and China's human  rights record. Has the Clinton administration shifted from its  conventional policy of emphasizing the need for China to improve  its human rights record to a policy of emphasizing the  attractive Chinese market, which continues to grow at a high  rate? The policy shift is the result of a painful choice made  by the Clinton administration, which had previously conducted a  form of human rights diplomacy toward China.    The original purpose of MFN for China was to provide it with  trade and tariff privileges that are not disadvantageous  compared to those granted to third nations. The United States  has renewed MFN for China every year since it normalized  relations. In the wake of the Tiananmen incident in 1989, U.S.  Congress voted to renew MFN on condition China improved its  human rights record, but President Bush vetoed the congressional  decision.    The Clinton administration, which came to office after  criticizing the Bush administration's China policy, has set a  seven-point condition for the annual renewal of MFN. It  includes, among other things, 1) the promotion of exit permits  for Chinese and Beijing's observance of an agreement not to  export prison-labor products. The Clinton administration  asserted that MFN would not be extended next time unless the  seven conditions are met.    In response, China has made a small concession to the U.S.  demand by granting exit permits to a few democracy activists and  allowing foreign human rights activists to visit Chinese  prisons. China took democracy activists into custody in March  when U.S. Secretary of State Christopher visited China.  Attracted by China's bullish economy, however, European and  Japanese corporations have rushed to the Chinese market and this  has prompted China to keep taking a tough stand on human rights.    In the face of this, the U.S. business community has felt an  increasing sense of crisis, saying: "If the situation were to  continue, the United States would fall behind every other  nation." Some Americans maintain that if MFN is not extended, it  will be impossible to foster the Chinese middle classes who it  is hoped will take charge of promoting democracy in China.    The Clinton administration had been sandwiched between human  rights and trade. More important, China's cooperation is needed  in dealing with the issue of North Korea's suspected development  of nuclear weapons. The Clinton administration, therefore, has  chosen to renew MFN in exchange for the "long-term improvement  of human rights in China." It admits, though, that China's  improvement in human rights is still inadequate.    For a long time doubts have been raised about the way the  United States has linked the annual renewal of MFN to an  improvement in China's human rights and rashly pressed China to  choose between them. If MFN is not renewed, though, it would  hurt both the United States and China.    It goes without saying that human rights are universal  values  and the direction the United States has taken deserves to be  applauded. Human rights is closely related to culture and  religion in certain nations and in certain regions. There is no  other way but to be patient about improving human rights in  Asia, and to try various policies.    On many occasions recently the United States has conducted  its foreign policy toward Asian nations without full regard to  their situations and imposed its self-assertion on them. In so  doing, it has incurred a backlash.    To cite examples, the United States has been in dispute with  Singapore over the caning of an American youth, and members of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have reacted  to the U.S. policy of linking labor and trade issues. This  criticism is voiced within the Clinton administration against  its own Asia policy.    The United States has switched its way of conducting human  rights diplomacy to a realistic way. If it were now to begin  making a sweeping review of its Asia policy, this would start to  improve relations between the United States and Asian nations.    On the other hand, China must not think that because the  Clinton administration has decided to renew MFN, the human  rights issue in China is now settled. Under the surface of  economic hypergrowth, human rights in China are placed under  severe restrictions. It is understandable that if living  standards improve in China, the Chinese people will make  political requests compatible with their improved living  standards. To date, though, little headway has been made in  political democratization.    How will China improve its human rights, by the application  of "external pressure" or by its own initiative? This question  has everything to do with the future of China.</p>

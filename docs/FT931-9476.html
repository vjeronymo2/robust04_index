			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tapie sale of Adidas holding near completion ADIDAS, the troubled German sporting goods company, is expected on Monday to announce that Mr Bernard Tapie, its controlling shareholder, has sold his shareholdings to a consortium of investors led by Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group. Mr Tapie, one of the most controversial figures in French business and politics, is under pressure to sell his Adidas stake, to raise capital to reduce borrowings amassed by the acquisitions of Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his holding company, in the late 1980s. He has been in negotiations for weeks with a consortium of investors headed by Mr Louis-Dreyfus, a wealthy French businessman who announced last year that he would be leaving Saatchi this spring to pursue his own interests. The consortium, which includes a number of French financial institutions, notably Credit Lyonnais, the bank, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurer, which are minority investors in Adidas, is believed to have finalised terms with Mr Tapie last week. Mr Tapie is selling his 78 per cent holding in BTF the German holding company that controls 95 per cent of Adidas. An article in yesterday's Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, suggested that the takeover would include Mr Louis-Dreyfus buying 15 per cent of BTF with Credit Lyonnais and AGF raising their stakes to 18 per cent from 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Adidas's supervisory board will discuss the deal at a meeting on Monday afternoon. Mr Tapie, who has sold most of BTF's businesses, has set a deadline of Monday to complete the sale of the Adidas stake, which is his only substantial remaining asset.</p>

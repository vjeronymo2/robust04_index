			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Matra Proposes a Combination </F> Milas/Otomat Mk3 System"; first paragraph is AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The French firm is bringing out a combination  weapons system featuring the new Milas torpedo-bearing and the  Otomat Mk3 antiship missiles. Italy, Saudi Arabia, and the  Emirates are its first targeted customers.    Matra Defense unveiled its new, combination navy weapons  system featuring two new types of long-range missiles in a  single firing unit at the Dubai Show held last week in the Gulf  Emirates. The antisubmarine torpedo-bearing Milas carries a  light torpedo about 55 km, while the antiship Otomat Mk3 can  attack the biggest surface vessels from as far away as 180 km.    According to Matra Defense, the combination Milas/Otomat Mk3  offers "unrivaled flexibility at minimal cost and with minimal  space, weight, and electrical requirements." Indeed, a single  combat system fires both the Milas or Otomat Mk3 using various  on-board sensors (sonars, radars, sight units, etc.) and one  control panel manned by a single operator. The missiles use the  same firing containers mounted in pairs, a fact that enables the  same firing unit to control 12 tubes containing any combination  of Milas or Otomat Mk3 missiles. According to Matra, the  eight-tube combination system can be installed on any warship  starting at about 1,000 metric tons.  <H5>  Firing at a Ship From 180 Meters </H5>   The Milas, says Matra, is "a new torpedo-bearing missile  designed to respond without delay to the briefest detection of a  faraway submarine", by firing a light torpedo at the target from  distances of between 5 and 55 km. The National Navy has opted  for the new Franco-Italian torpedo Impact, alias MU-90, which  was designed on the basis of components of the Whitehead A290  and DCN's Murene torpedoes. The French and Italian navies are  expected to order Impact--supposedly in early 1995--from  Eurotorp, a consortium of Whitehead (50 percent), DCN  International (26 percent), and Thomson-Sintra ASM (24 percent).  For export purposes, Matra is also studying ways to adapt the  American light torpedo Mk46 (Honeywell) to Milas.    The Otomat Mk3 antiship missiles borrow the technical  refinements of Milas, and the airframe and propulsion system  (Microturbo turbojet) of the Otomat Mk2. The 650-kg missile--205  kg of which is explosive charge--flies at Mach 0.9 and ranges  180 km. According to Matra, the Mk3 has a lower signature and is  less vulnerable than a powder missile. It also boasts  performance that is superior to that of earlier versions, partly  due to a new Thomson-CSF homing head. The Otomat Mk3 can attack  a target via four preselected trajectories. It travels through  three orientation points while skirting obstacles (islands,  etc.), and automatically resets to the target in-flight before  finally intercepting it via hedge-hopping or diving (nose-up  dive) flight. Operators can fire a salvo of three Otomat Mk3s at  a single target at intervals of three seconds, or a single  missile every 20 seconds.    The Otomat Mk3 borrows certain technical refinements from  the  Milas, whose development--kicked off in 1988 under contract to  the French and Italian navies--should be complete in late 1995.  Production of the Milas will begin in 1996. In contrast, the  Otomat Mk3 is a joint research project of Matra Defense and OTO  Melara (Italy), funded through their own equity. This is the  same formula that was used for earlier Otomat versions, nearly a  thousand of which (980) sold to ten countries. But the French  missilemaker points out that full development of the new Otomat  will proceed only if an order (still to be won) is placed.  Assuming one is, the missile(s) could be delivered about a year  and a half after the contract. A spokesperson for the firm says  the Otomat Mk3 should be available around 1995.    Matra lists Italy, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi  Arabia--for its F2000S destroyers--as the first potential  customers for Milas, the new Otomat, and the combination  Milas/Otomat Mk3.</p>

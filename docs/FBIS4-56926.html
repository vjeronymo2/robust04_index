			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>   [Text] Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter yesterday  confirmed U.S. President Bill Clinton's plans to nominate Robert  Pastor as the new U.S. ambassador to Panama. Carter said that  he had met with President Clinton last week and that the  President told him that he plans to nominate, to the Panamanian  Government and the U.S. Senate, Pastor as the new U.S.  ambassador to Panama.    Civilist sectors in Panama are against Pastor's appointment  as the new ambassador. They claim the statesman associated with  the U.S. Democratic Party maintained close ties with the former  Panamanian military regime that was overthrown by the U.S.  invasion on 20 December 1989.    Carter added that when he met with President Guillermo  Endara  last week Endara said he was pleased by Pastor's nomination.    If President Clinton's proposal is confirmed, Pastor will  occupy the post of U.S. ambassador in Panama left vacant by  former Ambassador Deane Hinton in February.</p>

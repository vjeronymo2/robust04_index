			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury beats forecasts with Pounds 126m CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the confectionery and soft drinks company, increased pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 112m to Pounds 126m in the six months to June 13, helped by a strong performance in American beverage markets. The company said the result, which exceeded analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 120m, was achieved despite difficult economic and trading conditions in all its main markets and the weak dollar. The adverse impact of exchange rates in the second half was expected to affect full-year results by 4 per cent. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said the company was 'cautious but confident' about the outlook for the second half; much would depend on trading over the Christmas period. He expected confidence to recover earlier in the UK among consumers than among retailers, who had responded to recession by tightly controlling stock levels. The company confirmed that it had looked at the French mineral water assets which the European Commission was forcing Nestle to sell, but said the price was unrealistically high. Sales in the first half rose to Pounds 1.47bn (Pounds 1.42bn). Earnings per share of 10.27p (10.16p), reflected dilution due to the recent share issue. Trading profit in the Americas rose 51 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 16.9m), helped by the acquisition of Aguas Minerales in Mexico, a reorganisation of US operations and improved productivity at the Mott's juice business. However, confectionery profits fell by 2 per cent. In the UK, trading profit rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 51.8m). A late surge in demand due to good weather helped the Coca Cola-Schweppes Beverages joint venture raise profits by 63 per cent, while confectionery benefited from strong Easter sales. However, chocolate sales volumes fell 4 per cent in a declining market. In the rest of Europe profit declined by 32 per cent to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 30.5m), reflecting tougher competition in beverages in France and and poor weather Spain. Cadbury also increased marketing expenditure in confectionery in response to product launches by Nestle. The contribution from the Pacific Rim contracted 12 per cent to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 28.7m) on an 8 per cent drop in sales, reflecting poor weather in Australia and tougher conditions in Japan. Rising drinks sales in South Africa raised profit in the rest of the world to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.9m). Net debt, at Pounds 491m, was Pounds 25m lower than a year earlier. The interim dividend is raised to 3.3p (3.2p). See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A Czech industrial  product exhibition, the largest over recent years to be held in  China, will take place this December in an effort to promote  economic ties between the two countries.    According to reports, the Czech Government believes China's  huge trade market is so attractive that it will send either its  Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy or Economic  Minister Karel Dyba to attend the opening ceremony.    Prague is also planning to earmark 5 million korun (about  220,000 U.S. dollars) to subsidize enterprises taking part in  the exhibition, allocating 100,000 korun or some 4,400 dollars  for each unit.    The Czech Republic exported products worth 250 million U.S.  dollars to China last year, registering a 2.5 times increase  over the previous two years.    They were chiefly machine tools, transport and brewery  equipment and chemicals. It also imported raw materials,  foodstuffs, textiles and other industrial products from China.</p>

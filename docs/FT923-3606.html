			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Bending young twigs in a different way: Political rumpus in Mexico over how national history is being taught SOME 20m Mexican children returned to school last week to discover that their smart new history textbooks have become the centre of a political row. The books have been roundly condemned for having betrayed Mexico's revolutionary past and crudely promoted President Carlos Salinas's technocratic view of the world. The official rewriting of Mexican history has scandalised the leftist intelligentsia, for whom a nationalist, anti-US interpretation of the national past is central to their opposition to Mr Salinas's economic reforms. They charge (with characteristic exaggeration) that the new textbooks downplay the Mexican revolution of the early years of this century, skip over a difficult and antagonistic relationship with the US, and worst of all, portray Mr Salinas as a national hero. The books are mandatory reading for children aged 10-12, and are treated with great sensitivity in a country where debate about history shapes, and reflects, political opinions. Ask a Mexican for his views on Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquistador of the 16th century, Porfirio Daz, the dictator of 1877-1911, and Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary hero, and his attitude to modern politics becomes clear. The row, dominating Mexican newspapers, has been exacerbated by allegations of favouritism and sloppy research. The president's pet intellectual, Mr Hector Aguilar Camn, from the editorial group Nexos, was put in charge of the historians who wrote the text. He is claimed to be much too closely involved with the government to be critical of it. Nexos runs a television station, a monthly magazine, a publishing house, and is said to be bidding for the government newspaper, El Nacional. The texts were written in just two months, without consulting teachers, and contain widely-publicised historical errors. The old textbooks faithfully reflected the nationalist, inward-looking Mexico that Mr Salinas is trying to leave behind. These indignantly described how the US stole half the country's territory (Texas, California and New Mexico) in the last century; they vilified Porfirio Daz for having sold out to foreign capital and worsened inequality of incomes; they praised such revolutionary figures as Zapata, Pancho Villa and Flores Magon; they described the period since the 1940s as one of uninterrupted progress. The new textbooks try not to apportion blame and, as such, are meant to be less ideological. They point out that most Texans in the 1830s wanted to leave Mexico, and maintain that the northern parts of what was then Mexico were unconnected to the rest of the country. By implication, the loss of half the territory to the US was not such a blow. Porfirio Daz is congratulated for having attracted foreign investment that promoted economic development, for having pacified the country and built railways - praise only partly offset by criticism. The revolutionary heroes are described briefly, even dismissively. The antagonism between the US and Mexico over the latter's nationalisation of its oil in 1938 is skipped over lightly. The treatment of the post-1940s has created the most controversy. For the first time, the official textbook describes the massacre at Tlatelolco, where the army killed 200-300 protesters in 1968, but the text merely says the army opened fire - without saying whether it was acting on government instructions. No mention is made of the alleged fraud widely held to have characterised the 1988 presidential election that brought Mr Salinas to power. President Salinas's government 'has showed energy and followed a clear course', and is praised for having brought down inflation, increased growth and spent money on alleviating poverty. Many acknowledge the new books are an improvement on the old, but they certainly reflect the Salinas view of the world. Political figures who promoted economic growth are considered more favourably than those who fought for social change. But, if Mr Salinas hoped a bit of historical revision would legitimise his government, he may have miscalculated. The government has been so stung by the criticisms that it is already back-tracking, saying the books will be revised after consultations with teachers and parents. The presidential chances of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, education secretary and former budget minister, are thought to have suffered.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Observer: Absentee policy Suspicions that the Balladur government is cooking up a sternly protectionist policy towards the Uruguay trade round were only confirmed at Chatham House yesterday when Alain Lamassoure, French European Affairs Minister, who was due to address the foreign policy think-tank on the future of the European Community, failed to appear. It fell to the French ambassador, Jean Guiguinou, to read out the text on his behalf. Full of the die-hard protectionism of the old days, the speech was all the more astonishing because Lamassoure is not merely not a Gaullist - he belongs to the centre-right UDF group - but is generally known for his modern, liberal views. Yet the audience learnt how the single market had unfairly 'benefited companies from outside countries more than European firms'. 'Europe alone can uphold the rules of fair competition that world trade needs, and which the so-called free traders of America and Japan oppose.' No wonder Lamassoure preferred not to deliver all this in person.</p>

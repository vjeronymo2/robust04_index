President Fidel Castro himself on 26 July announced the need  to make changes on the island, which has been seriously battered  by the tightening of the U.S. embargo and the crumbling of  socialism in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. Cuba  maintained 85 percent of its trade with this region.    The Caribbean country's purchasing power fell from $8  billion  in 1989 to 1.7 billion in 1993, for which the search and  development of new revenue sources has become one of the main  objectives in the struggle for national survival.    Political analysts agree in stating that opening the economy  to foreign capital was the measure with the most significant  impact on the local and international scene. It was also the  most realistic in a country that must now purchase everything  its needs with freely exchangeable currency.    The government also deregulated the holding of foreign  currency to improve the government's income by way of the  growing segment of the population that receives U.S. dollars  from tourism or from relatives living abroad.    Some experts affirm that one decision the community  pleasantly welcomed was the creation of the Basic Production  Cooperative Units (UBPC) in the agriculture sector. This, in  fact, constitutes a new concept in land exploitation methods.    By virtue of a government mandate, state-owned lands were  ceded for an indefinite period of time to groups of Cubans  interested in cultivating them. These groups, in the end, will  share the product of the sales of their harvest to the state.    Fidel Castro said that this new policy improves the  application of the socialist principle of pay according to work  and allows better economic control of resources.    Up to now, the weight of agricultural production was  primarily on the shoulders of state farms. The extreme shortage  of oil the island has experienced this year, the lack of  manpower, and the inefficient production levels threaten the  ability to produce sufficient food through intensive  agricultural activity.    According to local sources, the UBPC's offer greater control  over production levels. It is expected the over 1 million Cubans  will join these units, lured also by the possibility of  cultivating food to supply their own family as well as increase  their income.    Local media reports point out that the next 365 days will be  another period of significant changes in Cuba, to include an  in-depth reorganization of the state apparatus.    This issue will be one of the topics of debate at the Cuban  parliamentary sessions on 27 and 28 December. The assembly is  seeking ways to revive the country's domestic finances, which  have deteriorated due to the excess amount of money in  circulation -- calculated at approximately 10 billion pesos  (equal to the same amount in U.S. dollars at the official  exchange rate).    Government officials say that the assembly will analyze the  application of a tax system and other measures, pursuant to the  labor and salary reorganization measures directed at achieving  greater economic efficiency and encouraging production.    The TRABAJADORES weekly recently reported that personnel  rosters were to be reorganized, in light of the lack of jobs for  the number of people in the work force.    The publication, mouthpiece for the Cuban Workers  Federation,  says that this labor reorganization would be a gradual process,  to prevent any major impact on household economies.    Carlos Lage, a member of the Politburo of the Communist  Party  of Cuba and secretary of Council of Ministers, said that workers  "will be moved to other centers. If this is not possible, they  will be given part of their salary. No one will be left adrift."    Another novelty: Cuban television carried, during its  coverage of the recent Central American and Caribbean Games in  Puerto Rico, broadcast advertisements for products and  businesses for the first time in the Cuban revolution's 35 years.    JUVENTUD REBELDE, the newspaper published by the Union of  Young Communists, defended the publicity saying that it does not  harm "the pure essence of our ideas" and allows the entry of  currency; so necessary for the survival of the largest of the  Antilles islands.    As the Cubans see it, the logic behind the changes is the  same logic that society applies to maintain this commendable  social balance and its survival. The ways for change will be  never-ending, but all will follow the same political line: to  find a more stimulating style of socialism and economy.</p>

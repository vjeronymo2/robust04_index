			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> DATABASE TO FOCUS ON HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  </P> <P> In just a few weeks, Capt. Bob Reynolds of the Costa Mesa Fire Department will  receive computer equipment he says will make the department more effective when  faced with hazardous spills.  </P> <P> The City Council voted earlier this week to approve Reynolds' proposal to buy  $16,898 in computer equipment that will give the department access to Cameo II,  a database maintained by the National Safety Council that lists the chemical  properties of thousands of hazardous materials and tells firefighters how to  cope with a spill or fire.  </P> <P> "Costa Mesa does not have a specially trained hazardous materials team to deal  with these incidents," Reynolds said. "But even then, no one person could ever  be trained to know all that's needed.  </P> <P> "The computer will allow us to make a lifesaving response in an emergency. As  it is now, if you make the wrong decision just once, a real disaster could  result."  </P> <P> Reynolds said the computer will also allow the department to create its own  database, listing what hazardous materials are commonly used by industries in  the city.

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Interest rates explain Turkish decline / Analysis both ends of the latest emerging markets performance chart Turkey and India languished at the bottom of the emerging markets performance chart in April, while Pakistan comfortably secured the top slot. According to the data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, Turkish equities dropped by 9.8 per cent in local currency terms, but by a bigger 14.5 per cent in terms of the dollar because of the lira's depreciation against the US currency. Mr Malcolm Cooper, who analyses Turkish stocks for London-based broker Carnegie International, says the fall in the equity market this year can be attributed partly to high interest rates, which have attracted domestic savings to the country's highly developed public debt market. 'There are a lot of short-term investors in Turkey, and this makes the equity market volatile,' he adds. The recent crop of good first-quarter results from the corporate sector have so far been ignored by the stock market. But Mr Cooper believes they could still spark a short-term upward correction over the next month. He also notes that equity valuations have dropped back to levels seen in the mid to late 1980s, when international investors first entered the market. The government's commitment to raising the success rate of its privatisation programme, while regarded as positive by analysts, is not expected to improve the stock market's fortunes greatly. India, which had jumped 35.3 per cent in dollar terms in March following a government budget designed to open up the country's capital markets, retreated 14.4 per cent last month as a brokers' strike and trading scandals prompted panic selling. Some foreign analysts are relieved that the speculative bubble has burst, since Indian share prices had lost touch with fundamentals, such as slowing industrial production and uncertainty about future corporate earnings. They add that the Indian stock market will have to fall a lot further to attract foreign investment. Its gain in the first four months is a hefty 74 per cent. By contrast, Pakistan rebounded by 13.8 per cent last month, reducing its fall since the start of the year to 12.4 per cent, compared with a drop of 22.2 per cent at the end of March. Investor sentiment had been harmed by investigations into speculative buying on the stock market and, more broadly, by the power struggle in neighbouring Afghanistan. Latin America was generally firmer, with the exception of Mexico which weakened 4.9 per cent on fears that there would not be enough demand for the government's placement of more shares in Telmex this month. However, Mr Tony Ewell of BZW says that response to the issue picked up just before the pricing of the issue this week.</p>

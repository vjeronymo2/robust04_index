			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Waiting for the 'avalanche' RENEWED OPTIMISM during third-quarter trading in London was based on confidence that interest rates and inflation will remain low, while economic recovery boosts company profits and dividends for the rest of this year and next. Investor confidence, displayed in high levels of volume in equities and steadily rising sales of unit trusts, has survived a recovery in corporate earnings that has in fact been disappointingly slow, as well as more obvious shocks, such as the turmoil in Russia. If domestic interest rates have been reluctant to fall, this has in no way dimmed belief that they will be cut early in the final quarter. The FT-A All-Share index gained 5.2 per cent over the period, compared with a rise of only 1.7 per cent in the previous quarter. But the performances of other market indices shows that, once again, the smaller stocks outpaced the blue chips, as investors sought to maximise their benefit from the recovery in company profits  - when it comes. The FT-SE 100 index, covering the top 100 stocks, added 4.7 per cent; the FT-SE Mid 250, adding a further 150 stocks, gained 6.1 per cent; Hoare Govett's Smaller Companies Index rose by 7.1 per cent. By the end of the quarter, the London market, encouraged by strength across other European bourses, was attracting strong demand from US institutions, and clearly girding its loins for a fresh assault on the peak levels. As investors waited for economic recovery to come through, the best gains came in capital good shares, with the engineering, aerospace and metal-bashing stocks all leading the way. Interest-rate expectations continued to benefit the financial sector, where merchant banks and property shares advanced. But investors shunned consumer stocks, where stores, hotels and brewers have yet to disclose any great improvement in consumer spending. The third quarter corporate reporting season proved disappointing  - not particularly poor, but not good enough to sustain market optimism. Confidence in the profits outlook has now transferred itself to the fourth quarter season, which will begin to unroll in January, apparently without undue strain. Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London merchant banking and securities firm, has assured clients that 'an avalanche' of profits improvements is about to appear. On the international front, the effective break-up of the original ERM network has worked against the UK market, by increasing the likelihood that interest-rate cuts in Germany and France will make their stock markets more attractive. On this basis, US funds switched their attentions away from London during September, and this could happen again. Domestic investors believe base rates will be cut again before the end of the year, but fund managers suspect they could move up again next year. Pressures to cut rates this year owe a good deal to political pressures on a UK government struggling with electoral unpopularity. Rights issues in London totalled Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter, confirming expectations and perhaps restraining the stock market. By the end of the quarter, cash calls for the first nine months totalled more than Pounds 10bn, and more calls are expected before Christmas. Most forecasts for market performance in the final quarter are optimistic. Nicholas Knight, of Nomura Research International, leads the field with a prediction that Footsie will close at around 3,500. Other London firms cluster around 3,200, with SG Warburg still cautiously holding to a forecast of around 2,900.</p>

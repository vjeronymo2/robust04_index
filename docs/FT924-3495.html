			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Somali traders scent a bonanza when US troops arrive PRICES in Mogadishu's bustling street markets are rising and the Somali shilling appreciating as local businessmen scent a bonanza from the US troops poised to intervene in the war-ravaged country. Big-spending American television networks have sent up to 150 journalists, cameramen and technicians into the country, and everybody who owns or controls something is cashing in. Everything from car rental to housing, from the services of translators to armed guards riding shotgun on vehicles, has rocketed in price. Businessmen who have run Mafia-style operations throughout the two-year civil war expect a big pay-off from US military contracts. The Pentagon has estimated that the US operation will cost Dollars 300m (Pounds 197.3m) to Dollars 400m, although that figure could rise rapidly if the Americans get bogged down in a longer commitment than expected. In a city where most buildings have been looted or destroyed, a rundown four-bedroom house with no running water or air conditioning, which cost Dollars 500 a month, is now up for rent at Dollars 3,000 to Dollars 4,000. A day's car rental, with two armed guards to fight off bandits and looters, has gone up from Dollars 50 a day to between Dollars 200 and Dollars 300. Fees for landing aircraft have also increased. The only things going down in price are guns - an AK47 Soviet-manufactured machine gun which cost SSh5m last month can now be found for SSh1m. Journalists and aid workers have been almost the sole source of foreign currency coming into Somalia for the past two years apart from a few exports of looted telephone cables, copper wire from electricity lines and livestock. The biggest import trade has been the leafy natural drug, qat - the amphetamine-like narcotic stimulant grown in Kenya which loses its potency within 24 hours of being picked. At least 40 private twin-engine bush aircraft fly from Nairobi to Mogadishu every day at a cost of about Dollars 2,500 per flight. Diesel, cigarettes and even food have been imported regularly, mainly by businessmen through the southern port city of Kismayo. Kismayo and the bulk of the commercial trade of the country is controlled by Mr Osman Artoh, the principal financier of Gen Mohammed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's main warlord. Aid ships trying to offload food at Kismayo have been regularly looted. But Mr Artoh has continued to bring in ships with cargoes of diesel and food without any problem. He has also been the main supplier of so-called 'Mad-Max' trucks - four-wheel-drive vehicles with the tops sawn off and heavy calibre machine guns mounted on the back. The Somali shilling, which had maintained a value of SSh7,500 to the dollar, has strengthened in the last day to Ssh5,500. With no banking system and no national mint, Somalia has had a fixed supply of banknotes except in the north of the city controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohammed, one of the rival warlords. Four months ago Mr Mahdi managed to import Ssh150bn-worth of new Somali banknotes printed in 1990 by De La Rue of the UK. These circulate only in the 10-mile radius of territory he controls. If somebody is caught with the new notes in the south of the city, they could be shot on sight. Racketeering and extortion have been part of Somalia's greatest problem in the past two years, and with the US intervention Somalis are determined to continue their thriving trade.</p>

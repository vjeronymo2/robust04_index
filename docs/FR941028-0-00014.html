			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The parties requesting rehearing rely on a statement in the March 12, 1993 order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on rehearing of Order No. 547, which was issued after wellhead decontrol took effect, as supporting their position that affiliated marketer sales should continue to be treated as first sales even after wellhead decontrol. In that order, the Commission interpreted section 201 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as providing that all importations of natural gas and LNG, that are subject to a free trade agreement, are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, since they are deregulated first sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. In clarifying that inter-affiliate importations are first sales eligible for the exemption from Commission jurisdiction granted by section 201 of the Energy Policy Act, the Commission relied in part on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;270.203(c). The Commission stated that, while its interpretation in &sect;270.203(c) ``stemmed, in part, from a concern about affiliates' ability to circumvent the then existing maximum lawful prices under Title I of the NGPA *&blank;*&blank;* the Commission has continued to adhere to its interpretation of the statute even as the categories of maximum lawful prices waned pursuant to the NGPA.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, the Commission finding in that order was for the narrow purpose of interpreting section 201 of the Energy Policy Act regarding the importation of natural gas and LNG that is subject to a free trade agreement. Moreover, Congress itself, in that section, intended to define all such importations as NGPA first sales. Thus it appears the Commission's reliance on the &sect;270.203(c) definition was unnecessary to the results reached in that order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations Governing Blanket Marketer Sales Certificates, 62 FERC &para;61,239 (1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Id. at 62,586.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission concludes that Order No. 567 properly removed &sect;270.203(c) from the Commission's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rehearing applicants contend that the Commission failed to satisfy the requirements of the APA by removing &sect;270.203(c) without notice and comment. Under section 553(b)(B) of the APA, an agency is not required to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and provide for comments if it has good cause to find that the public notice is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In particular, a rule falls within the ``unnecessary'' category if it can be classified as either minor or emergency in character. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Texaco Inc. v.

Ordinarily the Commission may update its regulations in that manner without notice and comment, and it has done so in the past. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  And in this case, the appropriateness of the removal of the regulations other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;270.203(c) without notice is undisputed. However, in retrospect, the Commission recognizes that it might have been better to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment before the removal of &sect;270.203(c). However, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Commission does not believe that any party has been significantly harmed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Deletion of Certain Outdated or Nonessential Regulations Pertaining to the Commission's Jurisdiction over Natural Gas, 57 FR 21891 (May 26, 1992), III FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

While the parties had no opportunity to comment on that issue before Order No. 567 was issued, the parties have now had such an opportunity in their requests for rehearing. Eight parties have taken advantage of the opportunity to comment on rehearing, and discussed the issue in detail. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Of course an opportunity to comment on rehearing does not cure the lack of prior notice in all cases. Here, however, given the relatively narrow issue involved, it does not appear that providing any further opportunity to comment, at this stage, would serve any useful purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Union Pacific Resources Co. v.

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Afghan Crisis: Leader able to compromise IF ANY man deserves the credit for having masterminded the collapse of Afghanistan's communist regime and the fall of Kabul, it is Ahmed Shah Masood, the most successful field commander of the war and leader of the northern-based guerrilla alliance, writes David Housego in Kabul. Now named defence minister in the interim administration that will take over running the country, he is likely to be its most powerful member. Mr Masood is leader of the Jamiat-i-Islami and has already established an Islamic administration in the north-eastern territories under his control since 1990. He has shown a flair for diplomacy and compromise in the way he undermined the communist regime from within and built alliances with other guerrilla groups. As his strategy to overthrow President Najibullah's regime began to unfold this year, Mr Masood asked Mr Benon Sevan, UN envoy on Afghanistan, to go to see him. It was a major error by Mr Sevan that he did not take up this offer then and thus open a direct dialogue with the main mujahideen commander. Apart from a brief contact much earlier, the two met for the first time only last week at Charikar, Mr Makoud's makeshift headquarters north of Kabul. By then, Mr Masood had good reason to feel victory was his. He told journalists he could be in Kabul within two hours if he wanted, but that his priority was to establish an interim council in the capital. 'I took Charikar and Baram (the nearby airbase, the capture of which opened the road to Kabul), so it is easy for me to go into Kabul,' he said. He outmanoeuvred Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the rival Hezb-i-Islam, by contrasting his own readiness to negotiate with the belligerence of Mr Hekmatyar, who had threatened an attack on Kabul. 'My proposal to Hekmatyar is that, instead of starting an offensive against Kabul, he should go to Peshawar (in Pakistan), sit with the other mujahideen leaders and reach an agreement' on an interim administration. A Persian-speaking Tadjik from the north-eastern Afghan district of Panjshir, Mr Masood was educated at a French-language school in Kabul. He took up arms against the Kabul regime as early as 1975 in an uprising backed by Pakistan and in which Mr Hekmatyar collaborated with him. When that failed, Mr Masood stayed in Panjshir and Mr Hekmatyar made his base in Pakistan. The two men have been rivals and enemies since. In the war against the Soviets, Mr Masood emerged as the most successful field commander, cutting out a fiefdom in the north-east. He received little aid from Pakistan, which resented his independence of mind. This changed briefly in 1990 when he made a lengthy visit to Pakistan. But he has often complained of Pakistan's lack of support for him. He essentially created his army from other resources and captured Soviet weapons. British intelligence is said to have supplied his sophisticated Racal radio equipment. While controlling the north-east, Mr Masood was assiduous in building up contacts in the armed forces and within President Najibullah's regime. He wooed General Rashid Dostam, head of the Uzbek militia in Mazarr-Iasharif and one of Mr Najibullah's main supports. He warned him of the great loss of life in the war. 'How many children can an Uzbek mother bear?' he is said to have asked by way of encouragement to make peace. Ten days ago, the Uzbek militia. who had been flown into Kabul with the connivance of disaffected military leaders, blocked Mr Najibullah's departure from the country. The end of the regime was in sight. As a Tadjik from the north, in a country traditionally dominated by Pushtuns, Mr Masood will find his most difficult task in reconciling the fears of Pushtuns, who make up 40 per cent of the Afghan population. In the power struggle unfolding with Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb, the strength of the latter is that he is still seen as a Pushtun nationalist.</p>

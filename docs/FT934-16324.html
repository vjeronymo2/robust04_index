			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Judge delays Brazilian reforms BRAZIL'S constitutional revision process got off to a shaky start yesterday when an opening ceremony was delayed by a court order. The preliminary order, issued by a Supreme Court judge apparently without consulting his 10 colleagues, effectively annulled a session of Congress last month which had discussed the date for the reform process to begin. The judge ruled the session was opened without a necessary quorum and issued the order even though the actual vote on starting the revision took place at a later session, properly convened. The judge's decision was greeted with surprise. It is likely to delay rather than threaten the revision, required to take effect five years after the constitution was approved on October 5 1988. Members of Congress were trying yesterday to have the decision overturned immediately. However, the incident showed the capacity for stalling tactics from groups opposed to the process, such as left-wing politicians, trade unions and church groups, who filed the request for the session to be annulled. These groups fear the reform threatens social rights guaranteed in the constitution. The government and business leaders see change as vital to solving some of Brazil's economic problems and to allow further liberalisation of the economy. If the judge's ruling is not overturned immediately, Congress can possibly seek a full hearing of the Supreme Court or convene a new series of meetings to agree on a new date for the process to begin. Either course is likely to take some weeks. Many politicians want to complete the revision this year to keep it separate from next year's elections.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Observer: Waigel's chair Although the Germans may be rather preoccupied with their own problems at the moment, their finance minister Theo Waigel may turn out to be of greater support in his role as chairman of the EBRD than Jacques Attali, its president, may have thought. After all, finance minister Waigel is expected to throw his weight behind Attali, who this week threatened to stop all help for Russia if liberalisation moves there are shelved. A wise-cracking conservative from Swabia in southern Germany, Waigel is chairman of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, sister party to Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats, and is keen to expand his foreign policy expertise. Chairing the EBRD will improve his credentials as a possible successor to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's long-serving foreign minister. Some of the east European states to which the EBRD is preaching the message of tight budgetary control may, however, look askance at Waigel's own record. Since reunification, the finance minister has been no slouch at handing out fiscal largesse. Total net transfers from the German public sector to east Germany are estimated at DM 180bn this year, up from DM 140bn last year, with much of the money earmarked for social security rather than investment. Hardly the best example, perhaps, for the way the EBRD should be dishing out its much more scarce resources.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, secretary of state a the </F> Ministry of Defense, by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and date not  given: "We Play Seriously"]    [Excerpts] [Grochowski] The Ministry of National Defense  [MON] and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs very quickly prepared  the presentation document for the "Partnership for Peace"  program; it was then submitted to NATO representatives in  Brussels. You did not hesitate to call this a great success.    [Milewski] Perhaps this is too great a word. However, we  certainly achieved another very important stage in the  implementation of our strategic intention, which, invariably and  regardless of the activities of other states, is Poland's  integration with the NATO structures. We look upon the  "Partnership for Peace" program as a way of accelerating the  achievement of this goal.    I do not claim that Poland should achieve the status of a  regular NATO member immediately. On the contrary; I believe  that this would be rather risky for us. It would be more  advisable to employ appropriate procedures for gradually  admitting new members to NATO -- starting with the political  sphere, then the sphere of defense planning, and finally, there  would be full military integration for which our Army would then  be well-prepared. If we joined this organization without proper  preparations, the "old" members might consider us as a not fully  credible partner; this would deprive us of equal influence on  the shaping of the NATO policy. [passage omitted]    [Grochowski] What are we going to do, then, in order to  ensure democratic control over the Army?    [Milewski] It is certainly not enough to merely declare it.  Mechanisms must be created that will make it fully possible for  the parliament, for the government, as well as for the  president, who is the commander in chief of the Army, to bear  real responsibility for the Army, which is written in the Small  Constitution. In particular, the National Security Council must  be given appropriate powers. It is also necessary to define  unequivocally the degree and the kind of subordination of the  command over the Polish Army to the civilian minister of  national defense.    [Grochowski] In other words, this is an announcement of  legislative changes.    [Milewski] Not only legislative, but also organizational  changes and changes concerning internal regulations. For a long  time now we have been pointing to the need for legislative  changes concerning not only the functioning of the Army, but  also other elements of the state defense system. Among other  things, we lack legislation on the Martial Law and we also need  to thoroughly amend the law on the state of emergency. The old  legal acts come from the period of the Martial Law -- the early  1980's -- and they are absolutely unfit to be applied today.  They were supposed to make it possible for the authorities at  the time to fight with the anticommunist political opposition;  however, only to a very small degree do they create conditions  to counter local conflicts near our borders or ecological  threats, natural calamities, or mass influxes of immigrants.  [passage omitted]    [Grochowski] Poland declares readiness for greater  cooperation with the units of the NATO states during  peacekeeping missions. Does this mean an increase in our  involvement in these operations?    [Milewski] Currently, nearly 2,000 Polish officers and  soldiers are participating in these missions abroad, half of  them in former Yugoslavia. We would be prepared to carry out  the request of the UN secretariat and increase these  contingents; however, MON cannot afford this. Even though the  UN reimburses the expenses for taking part in the missions, it  does it after some time, which the secretariat justifies as  Poland's overdue membership subscription fees.    [Grochowski] Still, we envision the establishment of a  1,000-person operational battalion, capable of a fast response.    [Milewski] It will be stationed in Poland and, if need be,  it would be ready to take part in a NATO mission outside the  country. We could prepare such a battalion within a year. The  problem is that all of its members must be volunteers and must  know at least basic English. These are rather difficult  conditions; however, we hope that the experience that we gain  will be able to be taken advantage of in the restructurization  of other units. Eventually, the entire Army, as well as its  various units and formations, should be able to act under  international control within the framework of the joint forces  of NATO. One of the conditions for achieving this goal is as  follows: Our military commanders should denounce trends aimed at  rendering the Polish Army structures more autonomous. [passage  omitted]</p>

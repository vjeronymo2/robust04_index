			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Emerson agrees bid for Control - Offer of 525p a share values electronic drives group at 204m Emerson Electric of the US yesterday made a recommended cash offer of 525p a share for Control Techniques, valuing the electronic drives group at Pounds 204m. The shares, which jumped sharply last month after the Powys-based group announced that it was in takeover talks with Emerson, closed 7p up at 521p. Following the bid announcement Emerson, which already held 11.4m shares in Control Techniques, equivalent to a 29.4 per cent stake, snapped up a further 3.07m shares at 525p in the market. Directors and their families have agreed to sell their 15.2 per cent holding. As a result the US group now holds, has agreed to purchase or has received irrevocable acceptances covering a total of 20.4m shares, representing 52.5 per cent of the target's equity. Analysts viewed the deal as 'cut and dried'. Emerson, advised by Goldman Sachs, said its offer represented a premium of 36.4 per cent over the middle market closing price of 385p on November 4, immediately before the announcement of the takeover discussions. Control Techniques also announced results yesterday for the year to September 30. Based on its earnings per share of 19.7p (15.3p), the offer represents a historic multiple of 26.6. There is a full loan note alternative to the cash offer. Despite a weak first half, Control pushed up annual pre-tax profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.1m). Sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 116m (Pounds 105.3m). A second interim dividend of 7p a share, makes a total of 9.6p (7.5p). Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the outlook had changed dramatically in the space of one year. 'We are witnessing significant increases in activity levels as a result of greatly increased orders from all around the world.' Control Techniques was set up as a specialised manufacturer of drives or controllers for electric motors in 1973 and has become one of the top three in Europe in its market niche, competing with companies such as Asea Brown Boveri, Toshiba and Mitsubishi. The relationship between the two companies dates back to 1991 when Control acquired 80 per cent of ICD Drives, a New York subsidiary of Emerson, in exchange for 7.6m Control shares. ICD Drives was later renamed CT Drives.</p>

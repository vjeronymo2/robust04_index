Jim Strong, offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, is  scheduled to be interviewed today with Cal State Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy  set for Wednesday.  </P> <P> Portland State Coach Pokey Allen withdrew his name because he believed there  weren't enough players on scholarship to rebuild the team quickly enough,  Athletic Director Brad Rothermel said.

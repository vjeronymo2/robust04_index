			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Erwin Saucedo  warned on 9 June that the MBL will leave the government if the  political "agreement" is confirmed between the MIR [Movement of  the Revolutionary Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary  Movement] to exclude some MIR leaders from the final report by  the Constitution Committee on the so-called "narcolinks" case  [between the MIR and drug traffickers during Paz Zamora's  government].    The MBL deputy confirmed his position, stating that his  party  had decided to participate in the current government based on  the MNR's conviction to fight corruption in all its forms and  not to conceal such phenomenon that ruled the behavior of  several leaders of the defunct Patriotic Accord.    "I think this is a subject that can break an accord (between  the MBL and the MIR). If there are agreements and collusions not  to fight corruption or if reports on the political settlements  are confirmed, we will review the accord," Saucedo said.    The MBL deputy then reaffirmed his party's decision to begin  an impeachment process against former President Jaime Paz Zamora  if it is established that he had a criminal relationship with  presumed drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria.    However, the MBL deputy did not limit himself to that  warning, but added that MIR congressmen, Constitution Committee  members Edil Sandoval and Oliverio Iriarte, cannot throw  overboard a serious work developed within that committee to find  the truth about the "narcolinks."    Saucedo's concern stems from reports that meetings were held  several days ago between MIR and MNR members in an effort to  exclude former President Jaime Paz Zamora from the final  Constitution Committee report in exchange for support of the  government by the three MIR senators in the impeachment process  against the Supreme Court justices.    It also was said that one of the meetings was reportedly  held  over the past weekend at the house of Senate President Juan  Carlos Duran and that MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth was present  at that meeting.

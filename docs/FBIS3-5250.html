Your Majesty: Immediately after the UNTAC [UN Transitional  Authority in Cambodia]-organized elections, some people hoped  that the bloody war would come to an end and that our country  would have achieved national reconciliation and peace and  embarked on national reconstruction. But, the flames of the war  continue to flare up, burn our country, and cause massive  destruction to our nation and people.    Our nation and the world community have been aware that  immediately after it was formed in July 1993, the government  with two prime ministers began to show its force in August by  mobilizing the forces of both the Vietnamese communist puppets  and para [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] groups to  attack the regions of Phnum Chhat [Battambang Province] and  Stoung [Kompong Thom Province], inflicting untold suffering to  the local people. Entire family members were either shot dead,  arrested, or beaten on their heads; old and young women were  brutally raped; hundreds of houses or villages were burned down;  cattle were shot at and farm tools were destroyed.    Starting from September 1993, the government with two prime  ministers boisterously mobilized 70 percent of troops and 90  percent of military commanders out of their total forces in the  country with 80 percent of their total arsenal, including tanks,  artilleries, and multiple rocket launchers, to launch operations  aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] in  the region of Anlung Veng.    Foreign radio and newspapers kept reporting on this  operation  against Anlung Veng from mid-September 1993 through to 21  February 1994. Some countries even have gone so far as to  expose their arrogance because they have directly given orders  for the launching of those large-scale military operations at  the Anlung Veng battlefield.    On the one hand, the people and DK national resistance  forces  have held to their unwavering position to abide firmly by the  banner of national reconciliation of Your Majesty so Cambodia  can achieve independence, peace, and neutrality within its  territorial integrity. On the other hand, the people and DK  national resistance forces have kept their good grasp of the  situation knowing that these operations to continue kindling war  is a part of the plan and strategy of the Vietnamese communists  and the alliance aimed a seizing Cambodia for their respective  strategic and political interests. The people know they cannot  evade their sacred duty and have done their utmost to resist and  smash this strategic criminal scheme. The people and the DK  national resistance forces, with the support of the Cambodian  people from all walks of life both at home and abroad, have been  able -- despite all kinds of difficulties and obstacles -- to  inflict one defeat after another on the large-scale operations  by the Vietnamese communists, the alliance, and the two- headed  government after many months of arduous struggle carried out in  wave after wave of high spirits, patriotism, and responsiblity  toward the destiny of our nation, people, and race. This  continued until they were totally and completely smashed on 24  February.    I raise this Anlung Veng issue with only one thing in mind,  that is, to inform your Majesty that the flames of war in  Cambodia are still burning and seething. It is a war that the  Vietnamese communists and the western alliance wage through the  government with two prime ministers against the Cambodian  nation, people, and DK national resistance forces. This is not  a problem between Cambodians.    On the surface, it seems that the forces of the government  with two prime ministers are fighting against the DK forces.  But in fact, the government with two prime ministers is just an  instrument of the Vietnamese communists and western alliance  with the U.S., France, and Australia as chief perpetrators.  They have provided money and war materiel to the government  with two prime ministers for fighting in Cambodia in order to  keep the flames of war burning and to block national  reconciliation and national unity. In that way, the Vietnamese  communists can carry on their strategy to annex Cambodia while  the Western allies can have their hands in the internal affairs  of Cambodia and turn it into their forum. All of this is as  clear as day light.    At present, dignitaries from ill-minded countries have come  one after another to Phnom Penh to talk only about providing  military assistance to the government with two prime ministers.  Chea Sim went to Hanoi at the beginning of this month and,  using his capacity as acting head of state, signed with  communist Vietnam the so-called military cooperation between  Cambodia and Vietnam as in the 1979-90 period to allow communist  Vietnam to send its troops, weapons, and ammunition to Cambodia  in what they claim is a legal manner to continue the war for the  destruction of Cambodia. At the same time, Hun Sen talks only  about the plan to expand the army and attack, attack, attack.    The fact that the Vietnamese communists together with the  alliance have used the forces of the government with two prime  minister to launch large-scale operations against Anlung Veng  and other zones in an attempt to destroy the DK forces is merely  a dirty excuse. What is more important, however, is that deep  down, they oppose national reconciliation, national unity, and  peace in Cambodia.    The forces fighting against those major operations are those  of our nation and people both in the countryside and in Phnom  Penh who have been united in the struggle by all means through  all forms, each one with his or her own possibility, because  what everybody wants the most is national reconciliation, the  end of the war, national unity, and the harmony of all national  forces in all aspects.    In the past, that is, from the end of 1978 to 1991 or during  the implementation of the Paris agreement, the DK party has done  its utmost to put an end to this war as soon as possible.  National and international public opinion have been aware of the  political stand and attitude of the DK party.    Your Majesty has most graciously come up with the five-point  proposal dated 21 November 1993. The entire Cambodian nation  and people welcomed it. The DK party also welcomed and fully  supported this proposal and has taken it as the political basis  and key for resolving the Cambodian problem.    The DK party agrees to a cease-fire, to return all its  liberated zones to the Kingdom of Cambodia, and to dismantle its  own army. It calls for nothing more than the implementation of  His Majesty's five-point guideline for national reconciliation  and unity so our country will have sufficient forces to jointly  solve national and social problems now and in the future.    Despite this, the government with two prime ministers,  especially Hun Sen and the people's party of the Vietnamese  communists, disagree. They have opposed the five-point proposal  and keep demanding that the DK party fulfill the three-point  ultimatum and they carry on the war to scorch Cambodia.    So far, the national problems have not been resolved while  social problems worsen with each passing day. If this situation  is to continue, if they continue to kindle war, what will the  destiny of our nation and people and of our Kingdom of Cambodia  be?    Cambodia will face the same fate as the frog swallowed up by  the snake.    Your Majesty has already been aware of this situation and  these problems. Your Majesty has even raised your voice for the  benefit of our nation and people ever since December 1992. Your  Majesty has successively paved the way for a solution,  especially with your sacred five points.    Experiences in the past more than eight months have led the  entire Cambodian nation and people to share the same view that  under the present circumstances, Your Majesty is the only one  who can come up with the decisive answer to remedy this  situation by resorting to the celestial medicine that Your  Majesty had applied in the 1952-53 period. There is indeed no  one else than Your Majesty. Otherwise, Cambodia will turn into  a chaotic abyss where there is only fighting and strangling at  each other's throat under the evil claws of the Vietnamese  communists and the allies until our nation disappears like  Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian territory annexed by Vietnam].    Our nation and people from all walks of life in the  countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad are waiting to support  and to zealously and firmly march under Your Majesty's  five-point banner for national reconciliation and unity which  has now become that of our entire Cambodian nation and people.    Our entire nation and people are clearly aware that by  making  comparison of the forces, the forces of our nation and people  with Your Majesty's five-point national reconciliation banner  are by size the strongest that will certainly have the five  points materialized.    As for the Vietnamese communists and the alliance, they are  the foreign forces with, on their side, only a handful of  Cambodians who are rejected and opposed by the Cambodian people  everyday. The foreigners might have money and weapons, but they  do not have the people. The people categorically oppose them.  They are sinking lower and lower into the ground.    I would like to beg permission to sincerely submit the above  for the consideration of Your Majesty out of a lofty sense of  responsibility for the faith of the Cambodian nation and race  with no consideration whatsoever of the interests and power for  myself and my own party.    Please permit me and all members of the DK party to extend  best wishes to Your Majesty for a quick recovery and perfect  health so as to continue upholding your national salvation  banner to achieve national reconciliation and rally all national  forces to defend and perpetuate the Cambodian nation and race.    We wish the revered Queen good health so as to effectively  stay beside the king, especially on this historic period.    Please forgive any inappropriateness.    [Dated] 5 March 1994    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the DK party</p>

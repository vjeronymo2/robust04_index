He worked at the  scientific-research institute of measurement devices  (Novosibirsk) from 1958 to 1987 and became director of this  institute in 1970.    In 1987, Yuriy Aleksandrovich was appointed Ground  Radar Weapons Chief Designer. He coordinates the work of  enterprises in the cities of Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod,  Novosibirsk, Pravdinsk, and Murom that are developing and  producing radar systems. Prior to the breakup of the USSR, this  group also included the enterprise that is located in Ukraine  (Zaporozhye). The Chief Designer's residence is located at the  All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Radio  Equipment.    Yuriy Aleksandrovich Kuznetsov is the lead designer of  the S-300V and S-300P Air Defense Missile Systems' detection  radars and their modernization.    Yuriy Aleksandrovich has been awarded orders of the  USSR and has been awarded the rank of Lenin Prize Laureate for  contributions in the development of radar weapons.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Aleksandrovich,  you have a wealth of experience in the development of  standardized radar weapons. Please tell us what goals were set  in this work and what successes have been achieved?    [Kuznetsov] Radars are utilized by various consumers who  often make incompatible demands on them. This is one of the  reasons why it is impossible to get by with one type of radar.  Another reason consists of the fact that substantially different  frequency ranges are employed in radars and therefore radar  components that depend on frequency (antennas, transmitters and  receivers) cannot be identical. The problem of standardization  is reduced to the substantiation and development of the  minimally acceptable standardization.    The benefit of standardization is obvious: the economic  impact during development, production, operation, and repair of  radars and during the training of personnel. Therefore, the idea  of standardization has long attracted both developers and also  customers of radars. This idea is being implemented in two  directions: the development of radars that can be utilized for  different purposes and the development of standardized  components (assemblies, systems) that are designed for various  types of radars.    The first direction is fundamentally possible only in the  event that the identical frequency range is being utilized and  there is no great divergence among the requirements made on the  radar by various consumers. The second direction encompasses  assemblies of the identical frequency range that are part of  various radars and also a device that does not depend on the  frequency range being utilized (power sources, display devices,  and others). Standardization of this equipment is possible for  various radars. Implementation of standardization consists of  finding a compromise between incompatible requirements. Either a  concession to the requirements or complication of the items  (rational satisfaction of requirements) is the solution to the  task. The latter entails certain excesses in the item for each  consumer but permits us to have a single standardized item.  Let's illustrate this in the simplest everyday example.    A requirement exists for the production of an electric  shaver  with different voltages: 220V and 110V. We can produce two  items: one for 220V and another for 110V. But we can produce an  electric shaver with a power voltage switch which, naturally,  complicates the item. However, that standardization permits us  to produce one item (instead of two), to increase series  production and, on the whole -- to obtain an economic impact.    Of course, it is much more complicated for radars than in  the  example cited but the main sense is the same: standardization  can be accompanied by the complication of the radar. Therefore,  we need to decide if the end result is justified. Furthermore,  we need to take into account that its solution strongly depends  on subjective factors and on the organization of work as a  result of the compromise nature of the standardization task.    In our country, there is definite experience in the  development of standardized radars. We can cite the P-37 radar  as a positive example of standardization. The P-37 found  employment in the Ground forces, the PVO Troops, the Air Force  and in civil aviation.    We can indicate some results on the standardization of  radars  through the example of the work of the NII of Measurement  Instruments (NIIIP) at which I began my work career and where  the ideas of standardization were being realized already from  the end of the 1950's. The first airborne target detection radar  that met Ground Forces requirements was developed at the  institute. The "Bronya" Rangefinder Radar was installed on an  off-road armored tracked self-propelled vehicle and the  deployment and teardown times totaled five minutes. This radar  was dual-purpose: for utilization as part of the "Krug" Air  Defense Missile Complex and as part of a radar site.    Table 1.

Two  three-dimensional surveillance radars that are mounted on  tracked self-propelled mounts and that have a teardown and  deployment time of five minutes were developed in the  1970's-1980's.    One of them, the "Obzor-3" Radar with a 250-300 km operating  range, is being utilized as part of the S-300V Air Defense  Missile System and also at Ground Troops radar posts. The second  radar, a lighter type, "Kupol", has an operating range of  100-150 km and is a "Buk" Air Defense Missile Complex detection  and target designation radar and is part of radar posts. All of  these radars will be repeatedly modernized in the future.    The results cited have turned out to be possible primarily  thanks to organizational decisions (one customer, one  enterprise-radar developer for various applications) and through  the joint efforts of the customer and the developer to  standardize the requirements for the radar and also to minimize  the complications of the radar.    With regard to the standardization of units and systems,  that  is, radar components, I need to say the following. Many units  that are part of various radars fulfill identical functions.  Therefore, when several developments are carried out at one  enterprise or under the management of one lead designer, all of  these units, as a rule, are common for all of the developments.  When the frequency range coincides, the mutual standardization  of the radar device is higher. For example, the previously  mentioned device for the "Obzor-3" Radar and the S-300P  detection radar system was standardized by more than 50%.  A  high level of standardization can also be achieved for units  that do not depend on frequency range (power sources, displays,  and so forth).    However, when the organizational conditions are not complied  with, then the components in various developments will be  different, especially if the customer does not specially  stipulate the need to utilize standardized units and systems in  his requirements.    There were several radar customers in the USSR Ministry of  Defense and that same situation is being preserved in the  Russian Ministry of Defense. The conditions for radar usage for  various customers have their distinctive features. These are the  objective difficulties of standardization. But there are also  subjective difficulties. Each of the customers has his own  traditions, his own distinctive features, and each considers  himself to be more correct, therefore, coordination among them  is impeded. Receipt of identical technical tasks for radars from  different customers have practically been excluded. To develop a  standardized radar, it is necessary for the various customers'  primary requirements for it (target detection range, throughput,  accuracy, and operating range) to be sufficiently close.  However, I repeat, even in this case the development of a  standardized radar can not occur due to organizational  difficulties which emerge when there are several customers.  Therefore, it is necessary that the interests of all consumers  be submitted by one customer. The Ministry of Defense has  examples of that organization of work.    Furthermore, I need to point out that two lead designers,  even working on one and the same technical task, will never  develop identical radars. This is associated with the fact that  modern radars are very complex items; different experts will  assess the significance of various parameters and various  technical solutions in different ways. Therefore, the  development of standardized radars is only possible under the  management of one chief designer.    We have arrived at the conclusion on the advisability of the  following organizational regulations to ensure standardization:  a single technical task, one customer, and one lead designer.  Analysis of the capabilities, substantiation of the feasibility  of standardization and development of a single technical task is  an important phase in the work on standardization. The Chief  Designer, who heads the Lead Designers Council, along with the  customers, is called upon to accomplish these functions.  Cooperation between the Chief Designer, customers and the  developing enterprises is carried out primarily on the basis of  previously established ties since the Russian Federation  Government has so far not introduced the institute of chief  designers on equipment directions. (As of today, the activity of  chief designers is determined by an interim decision of our  department.) Unfortunately, the Chief Designer's impact on the  work of other enterprises is weak: the Chief Designer's  decisions are only recommendatory in nature for these  enterprises.    It would be more appropriate if the Ministry of Defense  concluded contracts with the Chief Designer, but then again in a  number of cases, it would be advisable to have a contract not on  an individual system but on a weapons complex, for example, a  radiotechnical company radar weapon. The Chief Designer himself  will be able to determine the developers of individual systems,  conclude contracts with them, and will coordinate their work.  Then not only would standardized radar weapons be developed but  many issues for connecting individual systems, their support by  auxiliary equipment, and the issues of the organization of  operation and maintenance would also be resolved. It occurs that  way in practice when a customer assigns the development of an  air defense missile complex to one Chief (lead) Designer. If the  customer issued a task to each co-developer of individual  elements of this complex, significant major difficulties would  arise during its development.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Aleksandrovich,  could you cover the work of the Lead Designers Council in more  detail and also the Interdepartmental Coordinating Council on  Radar which previously existed under USSR Minradioprom [Ministry  of the Radio Industry]?    [Kuznetsov] The Lead Designers Council was founded in 1988  as  a consultative organ. The Council formally existed until 1991,  that is, until the breakup of the USSR. The substantiation of  the standardization of radars that is necessary for the  development of a single radar field and proposals for the  development of standardized components for all radars was the  primary result of the Council's work. The Council's  recommendations were adopted for implementation in the project  for a single radar field and were included in the (union) Arms  Program and the recommendations on standardization of components  are being partially implemented (for example, on the development  of a secondary processing device and secondary power sources).    The Deputy Minister of the USSR Radio Industry headed the  Interdepartmental Coordinating Council (ICC) on Detection  Radars. As a consultative organ, it had a broad spectrum of  tasks on this equipment direction, including on standardization  issues. Specifically, the ICC reviewed common requirements for  standardized series of radars. However, coordination of  requirements on specific models of each series was carried out  with difficulty. Here the primary difficulty was created once  again due to the presence of several customers.    Still, we managed to implement some of these projects. Two  variants of the "Kasta-2" low-flying target detection radars  were developed. They were standardized for employment by two  consumers. Several standardized radars of another series are  being developed on behalf of various Armed Forces services.  There is a high level of inter-project standardization in the  radars being developed, although this relates more to the  developments that are being conducted at one enterprise.  However, I must say that the level of standardization for radars  on the whole can be increased even further.    Furthermore, the Ministry of the Radio Industry ICC did a  great deal to organize specialized production, beginning with  standardized base load-bearing structures (the structure of an  electronic module, unit, or cabinet) and ending with  technologically specific production (rotation drives, magnesium  casting and others), which created more favorable conditions for  employment of standardized solutions on radar components.  Similar measures, including the creation of ICC-type organs, are  timely even at the present time.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess the  technical level of our modern radars as compared to foreign  radars?    [Kuznetsov] I already discussed that in a July 1992 KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA interview. We have better results on a number of  developments. We developed metric band radars with sufficiently  high technical specifications. There are no equivalents abroad  and the metric band radar has advantages on detection of small  airborne targets and targets manufactured using "Stealth"  technology. Antiradiation missiles cannot be aimed against these  radars.    The high mobility of many types of radars, especially those  that were developed based upon a Ground Troops order, is another  of our advantages. But then again, I need to say that high  mobility has been achieved with other good specifications. So,  pulse tuning of the carrier frequency and a dual frequency  signal were already realized in the 1960's in the "Bronya"  radar. The "Obzor-3" and "Kupol" radars are 3-D radars and have  adaptive capabilities. An antenna in the shape of an original  waveguide array was employed in these radars which permitted us  to obtain the first side lobes at a level of up to minus 35-40  db and a detection zone based on elevation of up to 45-55.  Furthermore, these antennas have high technological  effectiveness.    Further, we developed good klystron [reflection  oscillator]-type transmitters. They have a broadbandness of  6-7%, have an average output of 10-20 kVt, and also  stacked  magnets instead of solenoids. We don't know of any foreign  klystrons with these specifications.    I can cite another entire series of technical solutions on  which we have an adequately high level (high-voltage power  sources and certain others).    However, we also lag behind. This is in regard to computer  equipment and circuitry items (for example, digital  microcircuits, analog-digital transformers, and powerful  semiconductor instruments). The lag in the sphere of circuitry  is resulting in a situation where some domestically-produced  radars consume more energy and their weight and size  specifications are worse than foreign radars.    On the whole, I can say that, in the sum total of  specifications, individual types of our radars have a high  technical level and, in principle, are quite competitive on the  world market. Additionally, we can play on the low unit cost of  our radars, that is, they sell for prices that are lower than  the prices of their foreign equivalents.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Continuing the last  thought, what can you say about the successes of  domestically-produced radars on the international arms market?    [Kuznetsov] We are making our first steps in this sphere.  One  and half to two years ago, we understood that, on the one hand,  we must primarily rely on ourselves and not on the state. On the  other hand, that we can earn quite a bit through sales of our  equipment on the world market and that we have something to sell  on that market.    In practice, we have participated in only two international  arms exhibitions: at "Mosaeroshow" in August 1992 and at  "IDEX-93" in February 1993. We demonstrated the following  domestically-produced radars (in the form of mockups, television  videos, and information sheets) at Abu Dhabi: "Nebo-SV", "Nebo",  Kasta-2E1", Kasta-2E2", "Obzor-3" as part of the S-300V Air  Defense Missile System, a radar post that is part of the  S-300PMU1 Air Defense Missile System, and "Kupol" as part of the  "Buk" Air Defense Missile Complex. There was a great deal of  interest in this equipment even though we didn't display any  actual models. We demonstrated actual models of the "Nebo",  "Nebo-SV", "Obzor", "Kupol" and Kasta-2E1" radars at the  "Mosaeroshow-92" exhibition.    The exhibitions taught us a great deal. First of all, we saw  that "Kasta" type radars are valued at $6-8 million on the world  market, that is, the profitability of these items will be very  high for us if we manage to sell them on the international  market.    For now, the sale of our models is being carried out without  our direct participation through specialized foreign trade  organizations. So far, the organization of arms sales in Russia  is distinguished very little from how it occurred in the USSR.  Existing foreign trade organizations are not resolving and  cannot resolve service and engineering issues. The principle has  remained as before: "Sold and forgotten". The world's leading  countries and firms don't sell like that. We must also master  the entire chain that is associated with arms sales. We need to  place the arms developer and manufacturer at the center of the  problem.    Russian law states that arms sales are a state monopoly.  This  is correct but this needs to be carried out rationally --  through the issuance of arms sales licenses to enterprises by  the state. All enterprises cannot have experts on all sales  issues. Therefore, we do not need to destroy the existing  foreign trade structures. They must be utilized but the  manufacturer must be the main actor in the sale. So far, the  issue of the developers' participation in sales has not been  resolved. Here we need to proceed from the fact that arms sales  can be successful only when we, as sellers, organize concern on  the entire life cycle of the weapon being sold. This includes  maintenance, operations training, concern about modernization,  its implementation for weapons that have already been sold, and  so forth. That approach requires the mandatory participation of  the developer. In some cases, the developer needs to assume  responsibility for many operational issues. Only professionals  can operate complex items and therefore the developing firm can  also provide radar crews. I can cite an example. The American  AN/TPS-117 and AN/TPS-124 radars are serviced by specialists  from General Electric, the firm that developed them. Naturally,  the firm supports the operation of these radars for an  additional payment.    And, finally, it would be advisable for us to sell not  individual items but series of subsystems that are united in a  system. This cannot be carried out without the developer.    Foreign trade organizations cannot organize and support this  entire weapons life cycle and complex approach.    Today, our lack of experience is being manifested in  relatively simple issues. For example, take information  servicing. A catalog of exhibition participants with the  specifications of the exhibitions was printed at Abu Dhabi.  There was no information in it on the content of Russia's  exhibitions, only the participant from Russia -- "Oboroneksport"  VO [Foreign Trade Association] -- was indicated, but it is  difficult to find in the catalog what that association is  demonstrating at the exhibition. For example, there is a "Tanks"  section in the catalog's index: all of the firms  (countries)-exhibitors are listed in it except for our  "Oboroneksport". There is not even a mention of the T-80 Tank in  the catalog even though it caused a furor at the exhibition. The  same thing occurred with other equipment. Exhibition  participants and visitors from throughout the world took the  catalog with them which does not contain all of the required  information on Russian equipment.    We are grateful to "Oboroneksport" for organizing  participation of a large group of military equipment developers  and manufacturers in the exhibition at Abu Dhabi. That was  useful. But we understand that the level of foreign sales  activity will not be raised without the direct participation of  the developers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After 48 hours of tension and silence Manuel  Camacho Solis, peace and reconciliation commissioner for  Chiapas, and the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]  released a brief communique disclosing that they are currently  working on the most critical part of the agreements but that  they expect positive results.    For eight days since the opening of the talks Camacho has  been unable to leave the area. There have been reports to the  effect that the situation inside the capital [as heard] is  difficult.    Meanwhile, the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee  General Command issued a text asserting that to achieve free and  democratic elections, the head of the federal Executive Branch  must resign and a transition government be formed. It also  calls for truly free and democratic elections with equal rights  and duties for the political organizations that are struggling  for power.    Strangely, however, the communique signed by Subcommander  Marcos is written in biblical language; it is as if they  extracted their words and phrases from the Bible. It is a very,  very strange communique.</p>

The Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers, Mr  Eduardo Faleiro, told a meeting of his Ministry's parliamentary  consultative committee today that the Government would encourage  Indian companies to set up joint ventures in countries which had  huge gas reserves to fill the gap between demand and production  of nitrogen, equivalent to 41.4 lakh tonnes of urea, at the end  of the Eighth Plan.    Efforts were already on to have tie-ups in Oman, Qatar and  Iran, he added.    Mr. Faleiro said if proper balance in the use of plant  nutrients was not ensured it would have long-term adverse  effects on soil fertility unless efforts were made to arrest the  trend.    This trend, he said, was primarily because of imbalance in  the relative prices of urea and DAP, MoP [muriate of potash] and  complexes.    Mr. Faleiro said the ratio in the use of nitrogen, phosphate  and potash had been adversely affected during the last two  cropping seasons.    This trend, he said, could not be arrested despite the  Government's concessions in the form of enhanced support prices  of foodgrains to compensate for the extra expenditure incurred  on phosphatic and potassic fertilisers, special concession of  1,000 per tonne on the sale of indigenous DAP and proportionate  concession on complex fertilisers and SSP [single super  phosphate].    The Minister said the Indian fertiliser industry was  extremely efficient and comparable to international standards.  It could produce additional quantities of urea at prices lower  than those of imported ones provided additional quantities of  gas were available.    KRIBHCO alone could add two lakh tonnes to the annual  production if it was provided with 0.5 mms cmd of gas. At  present, 70 per cent of the Indian production in urea was  internationally competitive.    Mr Faleiro stressed the need to activate extension services  and educate farmers about the benefits of balanced use of  fertilisers so that they would desist from injudicious use of  any one nutrient.    The farmers would also be educated on the cost-effectiveness  of manures and other organic fertilisers which could  successfully supplement the chemical fertilisers.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: MISFIRING IN DRIVE TRAIN CAUSES FRICTION  </P> <P> Question: I have been having a misfiring problem on my Honda and now feel  somewhat deceived by the dealer. The drive train warranty expired, though I  mentioned the problem to him several times while the warranty was in effect. I  have heard that Honda recognizes that it has a problem with oil fouling on a  pre-chamber seal. What is that? Am I now stuck with paying for the problem? --  D.L.R.  </P> <P> Answer: The pre-chamber seal is an O-ring type of seal on a valve stem. The  valve stem passes through the cylinder head into an area of the cylinder called  the pre-chamber, where the fuel and air are mixed. If the seal is bad, oil can  drain down into the cylinder and cause oil fouling of the spark plug. This is  not usually a serious problem.  </P> <P> Because oil fouling of the plug can have an adverse effect on the emissions  from the engine, the repair should be covered by the 5-year-or-50,000-mile  warranty on the emissions system. If your dealer balks at providing the  service, you should ask to speak to a Honda factory representative. If you can  document that you reported the problem before the drive train warranty expired,  I think Honda has an obligation to fix your problem.  </P> <P> Q: I have a bunch of new oil in my garage, but many of the cans indicate  different weights. Is it safe to mix single-weight and multi-weight oil  together? -- E.M.  </P> <P> A: Although mixing different weights of oil is seldom recommended, the oils are  essentially compatible with each other. It is a federal requirement for all  engine oils, regardless of make or viscosity, to be compatible, according to  Norm Hudecki, a Valvoline motor oil expert.  </P> <P> Some people mistakenly believe that such mixing will cause oil to gel, which is  not the case, he said. But one problem that you may experience is that by  mixing a number of different oil weights together you will not have any idea of  the oil weight in your engine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Update  </P> <P> In a column May 4, Your Wheels recommended a method for combatting mold in  automobile air conditioners. The process, suggested by an allergist who had  safely used it in the past, involved mixing vinegar and household bleach and  placing the solution in a pan in a car.  </P> <P> Several academic and industry experts have since raised objections to the  procedure, saying it could cause irritation in some individuals. In the worst  case, the experts said, the vinegar-bleach mixture could produce harmful or  irritating fumes.  </P> <P> In light of those potential safety concerns, I suggest that individuals not use  the process.  </P> <P> One possibly helpful procedure to combatting mold is to operate the air  conditioner fan for a few minutes after the air conditioner is turned off,  which should help dry off the system. The mold forms on the evaporator, which  is located under the dashboard and is inaccessible.  </P></p>

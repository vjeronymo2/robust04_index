			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kidder gives GE a taste of turmoil - Securities firm has been beset by speculation In the 13 years that Mr Jack Welch has headed General Electric, he has taken it into dozens of different businesses. He became one of the most respected big-company bosses in the US. But none of it prepared him for the whirlwind that has whipped around Kidder Peabody for the past two months. 'This is the first experience we have in a business where perceptions, which have no basis in fact, can become reality,' Mr Welch said yesterday. Kidder has been assailed in recent weeks by incessant speculation about its financial stability. It claims it was the victim of a large fraud with a big portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds as bond markets were falling fast - so it is little surprise there have been questions about its health. On Wall Street, where financial firms live or die by the strength of their balance sheets, rumours began to fly. Other securities firms, lacking a strong parent such as GE, have succumbed to this death by a thousand cuts. Drexel Burnham Lambert and E. F. Hutton collapsed in the face of a liquidity crisis as market confidence disappeared. Had GE not acted, it could have happened to Kidder. Mr Welch yesterday said the securities firm had not experienced any funding problems, but it might have done in time. Like all securities firms, Kidder - with assets of more than Dollars 100bn at the end of March - relies on the confidence of the markets. There were signs that some customers, particularly retail ones, were deserting, Mr Welch added. 'We didn't have any problems - yet. But it was going to get worse and worse.' The management changes at Kidder follow GE's decision to inject Dollars 200m of new capital in to the firm to plug the gap left by the phantom profits scheme allegedly set up by Mr Joseph Jett. GE disclosed yesterday that Kidder has reduced its assets by about Dollars 17bn since the end of March, to Dollars 90bn, to increase financial flexibility. Its portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds had been cut to under Dollars 10bn from Dollars 16bn, Mr Welch added. These securities - bonds whose interest and principal are backed by the payments on pools of individual mortgage loans - have aroused the greatest concerns. A GE analysis last year indicated Kidder could lose as much as Dollars 100m on these bond holdings if the market moved against it. This was a risk the company was prepared to take, given the profitability of this part of its business. With US interest rates rising since February and bond markets falling, the losses in mortgage bonds amount to about Dollars 30m. Kidder will report second-quarter losses after tax of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m, GE said. Mr Welch was unequivocal yesterday in his praise of Kidder's mortgage-backed bonds group for limiting the damage. Led by Mr Mike Vranos, reputedly one of the highest-paid traders on Wall Street, they had performed like heroes, and had done better than '99 per cent of GE managers' faced with such difficult circumstances, Mr Welch said. Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's chief financial officer, and Mr Denis Nayden, the number two at GE Capital, gave no hints yesterday about what they will do at Kidder. The firm still faces an investigation into the Jett affair, undertaken by Mr Gary Lynch, a former head of enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and due next month. It also faces an uncertain market - in the second half of this year, it could make or lose Dollars 50m, said Mr Welch.</p>

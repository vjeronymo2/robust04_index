			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Details in place for Bank shake-up The Bank of England's biggest internal reorganisation for more than a decade will come into force on Monday when the Bank's main activities will be divided into two 'wings' - charged respectively with securing monetary and financial stability. The shake-up, in preparation since December, means the departure of nine of the Bank's top 45 managers and between 10 and 15 of the 150 high-level staff immediately below head-of-division level. About 80 clerical staff will also go. But the Bank will recruit more analysts, junior managers and graduates. The reorganisation has caused considerable distress at the Bank. However, it said yesterday that there were no compulsory redundancies. Some senior staff have found jobs elsewhere, others have been offered severance terms, while a special severance scheme has been opened for clerical staff. The Bank's four existing executive directors will head the two wings, forming the top management layer under Mr Eddie George, the governor, and Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, his deputy. Five officials have been appointed to a new rank of deputy director, just below executive director level. The deputy directors - who must count as the Bank's rising stars - are Mr Graham Kentfield (chief cashier and banking and market services), Mr John Townend (market operations), Mr Bill Allen (monetary analysis), Mr Michael Foot (bank supervision) and Mr Alastair Clark (regulatory policy and liaison).</p>

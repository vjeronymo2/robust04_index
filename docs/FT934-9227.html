			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Ingham at Pounds 1.5m INGHAM, the worsted spinner and car parts distributor, returned profits of Pounds 1.47m pre-tax for the half year ended September 30. The car parts division, Transtar International and Moss Europe, acquired in September 1992 and May 1993 respectively, contributed Pounds 1.23m. The comparative figure given of Pounds 135,000 stemmed from the spinning and property trading activities. Group turnover totalled Pounds 13.55m (Pounds 2.98m), of which car parts contributed Pounds 10.26m - the division mainly retails parts for British classic sports cars. Moss Europe performed well, but Transtar continued to suffer from the recession and the sale of its direct business in the US to Milard which had the effect of reducting its turnover and profits. Profits of George Ingham, the worsted spinning activity, rose to Pounds 115,000 (Pounds 85,000) and the company still has a 'strong order book'. Exceptional credits of Pounds 256,000 (nil) mainly reflected the disposal of Transtar's direct US business. Earnings emerged at 7.1p (3.1p). An interim dividend of 1.75p (1.5p) is being paid - the directors have already announced their intention to recommend a total of not less than 4.75p.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Golf: A waste of good Cotton SIR HENRY Cotton is revered in golf, as much for his heroic performances on the course as his considerable achievements off it. Cotton did many things for the game he loved so much. He won three Opens and was among the very best in the world for a short time. He was a good writer, and several of the most popular books about the game were compilations of his photographs and accompanying text. He waged a campaign for the acceptance of the bigger, American-sized ball in Britain, believing that it encouraged better striking. And he was an outstanding teacher. Above all, he liberated professionals from their menial station in life. It was Cotton, a former public schoolboy, who made professional golf a respectable way to earn a living. He broadened its appeal to such an extent that he appeared in cabaret at the London Coliseum and consorted with kings and courtiers. Walter Hagen said he did not want to be a millionaire, he just wanted to live like one. For a while, Cotton was a millionaire and lived like one. His houses were lavish, the ne plus ultra being 74 Eaton Square in London where he kept a cellar containing only champagne and fine claret and 150 varieties of liqueur. He had numerous servants and an expensive taste in cars. From soon after his birth to his death in 1987, Cotton lived for golf. He talked enthusiastically and articulately about it to anyone who would listen. These and other attributes combined to make him a giant in his own field and one of the outstanding sporting figures of the first half of the 20th century. They are some of the reasons why a biography is long overdue. Maestro, The Life of Henry Cotton, is written by Peter Dobereiner, formerly the golf correspondent of The Observer. The blurb suggests that the book 'is the extraordinary biography of one of the great sporting individuals of the 20th century.' It is extraordinary all right. It is said to be a biography, yet nowhere in its 150 pages are we told the date of birth of Henry Cotton, nor his birthplace, nor the date of death. For that matter, there is no reference to his alleged homosexuality, which was mentioned in the press release accompanying the book. There are moments when Dobereiner reveals himself to be the maestro of the sweeping superficiality. The opening chapter lasts for nine pages. By the end of it, Dobereiner has sped breezily to the point where Cotton leaves school, aged 16. Time and again, one longs for more detail. In an afterword, Dobereiner wrings his hands self-consciously at the inadequacy of his effort. 'I determined to eliminate myself totally . . .' he writes. He seems to have used that as an excuse for eliminating the need for research. The result is a slim book. It contains an informative introduction of six pages, written elegantly by Laddie Lucas. This is followed by 139 pages about Cotton, the six-page afterword, appendices and six blank pages at the end. This is not the extraordinary biography the publishers claim. It is a monograph, more like, and it does not do its subject justice. Maestro, The Life of Henry Cotton, by Peter Dobereiner, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 14.99.</p>

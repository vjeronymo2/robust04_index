			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WINNING MAKES A BELIEVER OF BROWN IN PRO SURF FINAL  </P> <P> People were telling Santa Barbara's Chris Brown he had won the $50,000 Killer  Loop surfing tournament Sunday at the Oceanside Pier long before the judges  made it official.  </P> <P> Brown refused to believe.  </P> <P> He chose to assume he had lost, just in case.  </P> <P> But Oceanside's Mike Lambresi, the three-time champion of the Professional  Surfing Assn. of America, predicted Brown would win.  </P> <P> "He's on for the tournament, not to mention, he's the most naturally gifted  surfer on the (U.S.) tour," said Lambresi, who was eliminated in the semifinals  earlier Sunday.  </P> <P> Still, Brown wasn't taking anything for granted. At least until the winner was  announced after Sunday's finals.  </P> <P> Today, Brown can deposit a check for $7,300 -- his earnings for winning the  fifth stop on the Bud Pro Surfing Tour. He also earned 1,000 points and moved  into first place on the tour with 3,148, four more than Charlie Kuhn of Indian  Harbor Beach, Fla., who was third.  </P> <P> Fan favorite Rob Machado, a 16-year-old senior at San Dieguito High, was second  in the 40-minute final.  </P> <P> Brown, 19, won his second tour event in his first final of the season. His  first victory was in 1988 in an Irvine man-made wave pool.  </P> <P> "This is far more pleasing," he said.  </P> <P> A controversial interference call on Newport Beach's Richie Collins in one  semifinal cost him a chance to advance. Without the major penalty, Collins  probably would have won the heat. Still, he nearly won despite only getting  points for his best three waves instead of the normal four.  </P> <P> In the Body Glove Bodyboarding division, three-time U.S. champion Mike Stewart  of Anaheim won a close final over Hawaii's Harry Antipala (second place), Ben  Severson (third) and Kyle Maligro (fourth). Stewart, who earned $2,075, won for  the 27th time in 52 contests.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 1 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The number of people  participating in Mayday demonstrations in cities in the European  part of Russia and in the Caucasus varied widely. In many  places bad weather reduced the number of people wishing to  demonstrate on the streets under red banners. The number of  demonstrators in Novgorod amounted to no more than a thousand.  In St. Petersburg there were two simultaneous rallies. The  first was a rally of the Russian Communist Workers' Party  together with the "Working Leningrad" movement. About 3000  persons took part in it. Only a few dozens arrived to take part  in the rally of the united independent trade unions. The  procession in Yaroslavl was small. In Arkhangelsk, Kaliningrad,  and Makhachkala there were no more than 150 people listening to  the speakers, although it did not rain there. In Tver and  Kaluga, Mayday was celebrated by up to 2000 citizens, mainly  veterans. In Bryansk and Petrozavodsk, approximately 500 people  took part in the rallies. In every case the main organizers  were the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Russian  Communist Workers' Party, the All-Union Communist Party, and  all-Russia and local trade union organizations.    In Tula the largest rally for the last two years was held in  the center of the town. Ulyanovsk and Voronezh were  exceptional: In the first 10,000 people took part in the rally,  in the second there was an exceptionally large number both of  demonstrators and of organizers of the Mayday demonstrations.  The latter included the Federation of Independent Trade Unions,  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the trade union  of small entrepreneurs "Solidarnost", the Russian Communist  Workers' Party and the "Trudovoy Voronezh" [Working Voronezh]  movement.    At the rallies, along with slogans about the reinstatement  of  the USSR and the transfer of power to the Soviets, there were  demands to put an end to the economic chaos and chronic  non-payments, to put an end to crime, unemployment, and the  infringement of citizens' social guarantees. The demand for the  Russian Government to resign and for a change in the course of  the reforms was common to all the towns. In St. Petersburg,  Yaroslavl and Kaliningrad the recently signed Treaty on Public  Accord was criticized. At the rally in Voronezh, where various  political forces presented a united front, a resolution was  adopted which contained a number of radical demands addressed to  the Russian president, the government and the Federal Assembly.  The special feature of the St. Petersburg rallies was the  unwillingness of the trade union organizers to have anything in  common with the communist rally, a situation that almost led to  a clash.    The veterans in Kaluga were unanimous in voting for an anti-  government resolution. At the same time in Tver their meeting  was not particularly emotional. The speakers stressed that they  would not support a civil war but were in favor of the revival  of Russia. Signatures were collected at the same rally for the  repeal of the Russian-American military exercises at the  "Totskoye" test range in the Orenburg Oblast.    A peaceful atmosphere reigned on Mayday in Belgorod. The  oblast trade unions' council and the administration of the  oblast center invited the citizens to a celebration of the  spring and of labor. The motto of the holiday was: Workers'  solidarity. Its program included a brass band concert,  performances by the best amateur artists' groups, a circus  performance, meetings of veterans, and a festival "Sport for  everyone".</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Public opinion must be final arbiter on biotechnology' Revolutions in biology could be central to future wealth creation in farming, a leading agricultural scientist said yesterday. But Prof Tom Blundell, director-general of the UK government-funded Agricultural and Food Research Council, warned they would succeed only if backed by public opinion and by a shift in farmers' thinking. 'The new technologies can improve the quality of food, decrease the use of agrochemicals and assist diversification into other products such as fibres, specialist chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuels,' he said in the fourth annual lecture to the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Introduction of genes from wild plants into commercial crops to provide resistance to pests and diseases would probably be acceptable. But genetic engineering of livestock would be resisted. 'It is clearly the responsibility of the scientist to keep the public informed,' he said. 'Ultimately it must be the public that makes decisions about the use of biotechnology and evaluates its social, legal and economic repercussions.' However, there might be occasions when introduction of new genes into farm animals should be considered acceptable. 'This approach can provide very valuable models for human disease and may assist the use of animal - probably pig - organs as replacements for human organs such as heart or kidneys.' Prof Blundell said too much emphasis had been placed on food production, rather than efficiency, quality, market demands and diversification. Although farmers were beginning to respond more directly to the needs of supermarkets, the development of non-food crops would mean they would also have to 'interact with chemicals, construction and energy industries'. Prof Blundell criticised 'further savage cuts' in Ministry of Agriculture funding, which he said 'undermine the most forward-looking of agricultural engineering research'. He also said the economics of non-food crops had been misjudged. 'Any new product has substitution costs associated with introduction of new industrial plant, which in most cases is oriented towards fossil-fuel products.' 'There is also a tendency to look at opportunities for large-scale production, such as paper and textiles, rather than high value-added specialist products such as chemical intermediates in cosmetics, plastics or pharmaceuticals.'</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Ontario business community critical of budget measures ONTARIO'S nine month-old left-wing government has jolted the business community with a budget which more than trebles the provincial deficit, imposes several tax rises and greatly expands the role of the public sector in the economy of Canada's industrial heartland. Presenting a budget which flies in the face of the federal government's policy of fiscal restraint, provincial treasurer Mr Floyd Laughren said: 'We had a choice to make this year  - to fight the deficit or fight the recession. We are proud to be fighting the recession.' The provincial deficit will soar to CDollars 9.7bn (Dollars 8.4bn) in the year to March 31 1992 from CDollars 3bn last year, as a result of stagnant revenues and a 13.4 per cent jump in spending. The spending increases include a 40 per cent jump in welfare payments, loans for businesses hurt by the recession, extra low-income housing, and various other job-creation projects. The budget cuts provincial taxes on low incomes, but raises the surtax on incomes above CDollars 84,000. It imposes an extra fuel tax of 3.4 cents a litre, and lifts the capital tax on banks and trust companies. The budget measures were strongly criticised by business leaders, who warned that they would place a heavy future burden on taxpayers and fuel inflation. Mr Donald Mazankowski, Federal finance minister, and his predecessor Mr Michael Wilson also attacked Ontario's strategy, saying that it will 'slow down our efforts as a country to get out of the recession.' The Bank of Nova Scotia said that the budget measures would encourage businesses to move away from Ontario. 'Attempts to pay for new programmes and offset a softer revenue trend with tax increases will be self-defeating.' Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto yesterday put Ontario and Ontario Hydro's bonds on credit watch for possible downgrading. The two leading US rating services are also expected to review the province's credit rating. Ontario is the only Canadian province with a Triple A rating.</p>

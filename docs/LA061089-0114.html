			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIONIS FACES TRIAL WITH SUSPECT IN WAYNE ATTACK  </P> <P> Pomona surgeon Thomas A. Gionis will stand trial in the fall along with one of  the men he allegedly directed to attack ex-wife Aissa Wayne in an attempt to  gain custody of their daughter, according to two rulings in court Friday.  </P> <P> At his arraignment in Superior Court in Santa Ana, Gionis entered a plea of not  guilty to charges that he masterminded the Oct. 3 attack. Judge Myron S. Brown  set an Oct. 31 trial date.  </P> <P> And at a separate hearing, Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald -- over the objections of  defense attorney F. Lee Bailey -- decided that Gionis should be tried on  assault charges along with Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, of Burbank.  </P> <P> Hintergardt, in custody on $1 million bail, is accused of helping carry out  last fall's attack on Wayne and financier Roger W. Luby at Luby's Newport Beach  home. He, too, pleaded not guilty to the charges.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans argued that Gionis and Hintergardt  should be tried together for the sake of legal expediency. "We don't want to  make the victims and the witnesses go through the same things many times," he  said in an interview. "We want to do it one time."  </P> <P> But co-defense attorney Allan H.Stokke of Santa Ana said after the judge's  joint-trial ruling, "We think it's prejudicial that Dr. Gionis is to be tried  together with a man he's never even met and had nothing to do with."  </P> <P> Bailey, however, played down the importance of the ruling, saying that he  thought a joint trial would hurt Hintergardt more than it would Gionis.  </P> <P> The nationally known defense attorney also said he is likely to ask that the  trial be moved out of Orange County to allow his client to get a fair trial  outside the glare of local publicity.  </P> <P> A second man implicated in the execution of the Wayne-Luby attack, Jeffrey K.  Bouey, 35, of Simi Valley, has agreed to cooperate with authorities and has not  yet undergone a preliminary hearing on the charges against him.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills private detective O. Daniel Gal, 32, whom Gionis allegedly paid  to hire Hintergardt and Bouey and to coordinate the attack, remains in custody  in Switzerland awaiting extradition.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a judge has agreed to reopen the custody dispute over 2-year-old  Anastasia that prosecutors say triggered the attack on the daughter of film  legend John Wayne. The child is in the temporary custody of Wayne, with Gionis  maintaining monitored visitation rights.  </P></p>

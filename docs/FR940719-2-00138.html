			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Each of the Accounts is a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The Accounts act as funding media for variable life insurance policies issued by Life of Virginia. Life of Virginia Separate Account I has four subdivisions; Life of Virginia Account II and Life of Virginia Separate Account III each have nineteen subdivisions. Four of the subdivisions of each of the Accounts invest in one of the four investment portfolios of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Life of Virginia and other life insurance companies directly or indirectly owned by Aon Corporation may establish variable life insurance separate accounts in the future that also would need to rely on the exemptions requested herein by the Accounts and Life of Virginia. Any such future separate accounts would be registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. AAI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon Corporation, in engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management and advice to pension plans, corporations, investment companies and other organizations. AAI is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is the investment adviser to the Fund, and manages certain Plan assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Plan was authorized by the board of directors of Aon Corporation. Interests in the Plan are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 33&hyph;27984). The Plan currently offers participants four investment options: Aon Corporation common stock, interest in a pool of guaranteed investment contracts, interests in a money market investment portfolio, and interest in a balanced investment portfolio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Participation in the Plan is open to all eligible employees of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries_including Life of Virginia and AAI_which have adopted the Plan. The Plan is intended to qualify under section 401(a) and 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), and includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to quality under section 401(k) of the Code. The Plan is also subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''), applicable to defined contribution profit sharing plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Plan trustees are appointed by Aon Corporation, and currently are all employers of Aon Corporation subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Plan, Aon Corporation retains the right to appoint other individuals or corporations as trustees, including persons not affiliated with Aon Corporation. The Plan is administered by a plan committee consisting of various employees of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on May 14, 1984, and is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund consists of four series: Common Stock Index Portfolio, Government Securities, Money Market Portfolio and Total Return Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. To date, the Fund has offered its shares only to Life of Virginia (as seed money investments), the Accounts, and Life of Virginia Separate Account 4 (``Account 4''), a variable annuity separate account. The Fund offers each series of shares to corresponding subdivisions of each of the Accounts to support variable life insurance contracts (``VLI contracts'') and to Account 4 to support variable annuity contracts (``VA contracts''). (The VLI contracts and the VA contracts shall be referred to collectively as the ``variable contracts.'') <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In light of recent changes in the federal tax law which have created the opportunity for the Fund to substantially increase its net assets by selling shares to the Plan and to other qualified pension or retirement plans, the Accounts and Life of Virginia propose that the Fund be permitted to sell its shares directly to the Plan and to unaffiliated pension or retirement plans subject to ERISA and Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code (the ``unaffiliated plans'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the 1940 Act, the unaffiliated plans will not be affiliated persons of the Fund or of the Applicants or affiliated persons of such persons. Nor will the trustees and the other fiduciaries of the unaffiliated plans be affiliated persons of the Fund or of the Applicants or affiliated persons of such persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying variable contracts held in the portfolios of the Fund. The Code provides that variable contracts will not be treated as annuity contracts or life insurance contracts, as the case may be, for any period for which the underlying assets are not diversified in accordance with Treasury Department regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Treasury Regulation 1.817&hyph;5 establishes specific diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts. The regulation generally provides that, in order to meet these diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated assets account of one or more life insurance companies. However, the regulation also contains an exception to this requirement that permits trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan to hold shares of an investment company_the shares of which are also held by insurance company segregated asset accounts_without adversely affecting the status of the investment company as an adequately diversified underlying investment for variable contracts issued through such segregated asset accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. As a result of this exception to the general diversification requirement, qualified pension and retirement plans (such as the Plan or the unaffiliated plans) may select the Fund as an investment option without endangering the tax status of Life of Virginia VLI contracts issued through the Accounts or VA contracts issued through Account 4. Fund shares sold to the Plan or to the unaffiliated plans would be held by their respective trustees, as required by section 403(a) of ERISA. The Plan trustees would generally vote Fund shares that they hold for the Plan in accordance with instructions solicited from Plan participants. The trustees or other fiduciaries of the unaffiliated plans may vote Fund shares held by their plans in their own discretion or, if the applicable plan so provides, in accordance with instructions from participants in such plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Applicants also propose that, in one or more discrete instances, the Plan be permitted to purchase Funds shares using investment securities held in one of the investment portfolios currently offered to Plan participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Applicants represent that the investment objectives of the money market and balanced investment portfolios offered by the Plan are very similar to the investment objective of the Fund's Money Market Portfolio and Total Return Portfolio, respectively. Accordingly, Applicants propose that, subject to the approval of the Fund's board of directors and the judgment of the Plan trustees that the proposed transactions do not violate the prohibited transaction and fiduciary duty requirements of ERISA, the Plan be permitted to use the assets of its money market portfolio to purchase shares of the Fund's Money Market Portfolio and the assets of its balanced portfolio to purchase shares of the Fund's Total Return Portfolio. If the proposed consolidations were to occur, the Plan would initially acquire a substantial majority of the outstanding shares of these two Fund portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

Life of Virginia and the accounts request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting them as well as any future accounts from the provisions of sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder to the extent necessary for the Accounts and any future accounts to hold shares of the Fund at the same time that the Plan and the unaffiliated plans hold shares of the Fund. Life of Virginia and the Accounts submit that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

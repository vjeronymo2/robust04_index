The regulations consist of eight chapters and 79 articles.    These regulations shall apply to foreign-invested  enterprises  and foreign individuals that carry out business transactions or  earn income inside or outside the territory of the DPRK as well  as to foreign firms and individuals that earn income inside the  territory of the DPRK.    These regulations shall also apply to Koreans living outside  the territory of the DPRK who carry out economic transactions or  earn income inside the territory of the DPRK.    According to the regulations, imposition and collection of  tax on and the supervision and control over the payment of tax  by foreign-invested businesses and foreign individuals shall be  done by the financial organ.

A foreign individual who obtained the approval to stay in  the  territory of the DPRK for more than 180 days shall be registered  for tax purpose at the relevant financial organ within 30 days  from the day of the approval.    Tax payable by a foreign-invested business and a foreign  individual shall be calculated and paid in Korean won from a  foreign exchange note account.    If any tax-related agreement concluded between the  Government  of the DPRK and the government of a foreign country contains tax  provisions that differ from those stipulated in these  regulations, a foreign investor and a foreign individual may pay  taxes pursuant to the agreement.    Enterprise income tax shall be imposed on the taxable income  which is the remainder after the deduction of cost, other  expenditure and turnover tax from the gross revenue.    Enterprise income tax rates shall be 14 percent of the  taxable income in the case of a foreign-invested business  established inside the free economic and trade zone, 25 percent  of the taxable income in the case of a foreign-invested business  established outside the free economic and trade zone and 10  percent of the taxable income in the sectors of high  technologies, natural resources development and infrastructure  construction, scientific research and technological development  encouraged by the state.    Where the government of a foreign country or an  international  financial organization granted loans to the Government of the  DPRK or a state bank or where a foreign bank give loans to a  bank or an enterprise of the DPRK on favourable terms such as  with a low interest rate (lower than the libor) and a return  period of more than 10 years including a grace period, the  enterprise income tax on the interests on the loans shall be  excluded from payment.    Where a foreign-invested business in priority sectors or a  foreign-invested business engaged in manufacturing inside the  free economic and trade zone continues its operation for more  than 10 years, it shall be exempted from enterprise income tax  for 3 years from the first profit making year and it can be  reduced by up to 50 percent for the next 2 years.    Priority sectors shall include sectors using high  technologies, natural resource development and infrastructure  construction sectors as well as scientific research and  technological development sectors.    A foreign-invested business in service sectors which is  established in the free economic and trade zone and continues  its operation for more than 10 years shall be exempted from  enterprise income tax for the first profit-making year and it  can be reduced by up to 50 percent for the next 2 years.    A foreign-invested business which invests more than  60,000,000 won in total in infrastructure construction projects  such as railway, road, telecommunication, seaports and airports  inside the free economic and trade zone shall be exempted from  enterprise income tax for 4 years from the first profit-making  year and it may be reduced by up to 50 percent for the next 3  years.    Where a foreign-invested business reinvests its legal  profits  earned from its business to increase its registered capital  inside the territory of the DPRK or establishes another  foreign-invested enterprise and runs it for more than 5 years  100 percent (in the case of infrastructure development sectors)  or 50 percent (in the case of the other sectors) of the  enterprise income tax which has been paid on the reinvested  portion of the profit can be refunded or deducted from the  enterprise income tax to be payable next time.    The regulations also clarify matters concerning the payment  of personal income tax, property tax, inheritance tax, turnover  tax and local tax.

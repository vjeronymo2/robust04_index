			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / FO 'ignored' fears on Jordan FOREIGN Office officials deliberately ignored intelligence experts who were worried that Jordan might be used for diverting weapons of mass destruction to Iraq, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday. As a result, Jordan's name was obliterated from a list of suspect countries published in parliament in December 1991. Mr Simon Fuller, who headed the Foreign Office's Near East and North Africa department between 1990 and 1993, described a series of intelligence reports on sanctions-busting in Jordan as irrelevant to the country's inclusion on the list. One report said chemicals which could be used in explosives were going to Iraq through Jordan in September 1991. Another report said that officials of Technology and Development Group, the former London-based nerve centre for Iraqi procurement, were attempting to re-establish their operation in Jordan. Mr Fuller said he had supported the removal of Jordan from the list in spite of the opposition of defence intelligence experts at a Cabinet Office meeting where the matter was discussed. Three intelligence officials had left the meeting believing Jordan would be listed. In a heated exchange with Lord Justice Scott, Mr Fuller said the government would have been accusing Jordan of a 'heinous crime' had it included the country on its list. This was because the listing would suggest there had been irrefutable evidence that Jordan was diverting exports to supply Iraq's chemical weapons programme where no such evidence existed. Lord Justice Scott described his suggestion as 'fanciful'. Mr Fuller told the inquiry that he knew of only one instance since 1985 of a British military export to Jordan diverted on to Iraq. He said that the matter had been raised with King Hussein of Jordan, who promised that diversions would not happen again. Mr Fuller added that the Joint Intelligence Committee, the main Whitehall body responsible for security, had not turned up any evidence of military deliveries from Jordan to Iraq since the imposition of UN sanctions at the time of the invasion of Kuwait. He said this had been the case up to the end of 1991 and still remains to his knowledge.</p>

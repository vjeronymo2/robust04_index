			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (10): Demand and prices recover - Property No one in the Lyon property market would try to pretend that life has been easy over the past two years: but they do at least have the consolation that, having gone into recession later than their Parisian counterparts, they are recovering slightly earlier. Lyon property prices have suffered from the same problems that have afflicted those in the French capital. Demand for residential property has been depressed by the combination of high interest rates and the psychological blow of rising unemployment. The commercial sector has been hit even harder for the same reasons, and intense pressure on corporate profits has prompted even the most resilient companies to think twice before investing in new property. These problems were aggravated by the inflated state of the market at the start of the 1990s. The value of both commercial and residential property in Lyon enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Prices rose at an annual rate of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent in each of the four years until 1992, even though the Paris market had started to falter by late 1990. But the recession struck in 1992. A recent report by Jones Lang Wootton estimates that although office rents in the Presqu'ile area of the city centre - around the Opera de Lyon and the hotel de ville - have remained stable at an annual average of FFr1,200 a square metre since 1992, comparable rentals for the newer office blocks around the Part-Dieu railway station have fallen from FFr950 to about FFr850. However, the market is now starting to show signs of recovery. The Lyonnais were quicker than the Parisians to adapt to the realities of recession. New developments ground to a halt as soon as the market contracted. As a result the Lyon market has slowly been able to fill most of the surplus office space in the city, thereby alleviating the pressure on prices. The Jones Lang Wootton report noted that 'since the beginning of October demand for office space has picked up considerably, particularly from larger companies due to internal reorganisation.' Local officials hope that the situation will continue its slow but steady improvement for the rest of this year, so that the market will be in better shape in 1995 when the first phases of the Cite Internationale commercial complex and the Part-Dieu development scheme are scheduled to be ready The Part-Dieu development is a series of office buildings clustered around the railway station in central Lyon. It was conceived a few years ago when demand for Part-Dieu property was buoyant, thanks to the impact on the city's business scene of the introduction of the Lyon-to-Paris high speed TGV (trains de grande vitesse) route at the new Part-Dieu station. But the most ambitious new project for Lyon in the mid-1990s will be Cite Internationale, which has been designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who liaised with Sir Richard Rogers on the Pompidou Centre in Paris. Cite Internationale will occupy a waterfront site in the Parc de la Tete d'Or. It will include a conference centre, an hotel, a contemporary art museum - and an office complex.</p>

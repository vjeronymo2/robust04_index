			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on </F> Reform of State Enterprises" -- ITAR-TASS headline]    [Text] [No dateline as received] With the aim of ensuring  management of the state sector of the economy and effective  utilization and preservation of state assets in the Russian  Federation, I RESOLVE as follows.    1. That it be deemed necessary to implement, beginning in  1994, a reform of state enterprises that entails:    an end to the creation of new federal state enterprises  assigned and enjoying full economic rights over state assets;    conversion of a limited number of federal state enterprises  under liquidation into economically-active establishments --  treasury [kazennyy] factories, treasury plants, and treasury  economic units -- which shall assume the right to operational  management of all the assets of the federal state enterprises  under liquidation.    2. That rulings to liquidate federal state enterprises and  convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury  economic units) shall be made on the following grounds:    use of allocated federal resources for purposes other than  intended;    failure to derive profit for the previous two years;    breach of existing rules governing use by an enterprise of  state immovable assets assigned to its economic control.    In this Decree, a breach of existing rules shall be  construed  as inclusion of such assets into enterprises' authorized  capitals (subsidiaries' excepted), or their disposal by lease,  sale, or transfer to the use of other incorporated entities  without the authority of the relevant state body.    3. That rulings to liquidate federal state enterprises and  convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury  economic units) shall be applied only to industrial or  agricultural federal state enterprises:    engaged in activities reserved by federal laws exclusively  for state enterprises;    of whose products (works, services) the primary consumer  (over 50 percent) is the state;    privatization of which is prohibited by the State Program of  Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises.    Other federal state enterprises may be liquidated and  converted into treasury factories (treasury works, treasury  economic entities) in circumstances laid down by federal laws or  decrees of the President of the Russian Federation.    4. That a ruling to liquidate federal state enterprises and  convert them into treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury  economic units) shall be made by the Government of the Russian  Federation if one or more conditions, envisioned by clause two  herein are presented by either the relevant bodies of the  executive power or the enterprise itself.    Such a ruling cannot be made with regard to a federal state  enterprise not prohibited from privatization by the State  Program of Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises and  having submitted a privatization application by 1 July 1994 in  accordance with the established procedure.    5. That during adoption of a ruling to liquidate federal  state enterprises and convert them into treasury factories  (treasury plants, treasury economic units], the Government of  the Russian Federation shall:    determine the composition of the commission on liquidation  which shall liquidate the enterprise in accordance with the  legislation of the Russian Federation;    allocate means for the liquidation of federal state  enterprises;    decide on the federal body of the executive power which  immediately after liquidation will confirm the articles of  association of treasury factories (treasury plants, treasury  economic units) created from liquidated federal state  enterprises.    6. That during the creation of treasury factories (treasury  plants, treasury economic units) from liquidated federal state  enterprises, the following shall be prohibited:    reduction in the number of jobs compared to that at the  liquidated federal state enterprise upon decision to liquidate;    refusal to employ employees of the liquidated federal state  enterprise;    assignment of assets of part thereof of the liquidated  federal state enterprise to other incorporated entities or  individual persons.    All expenditure on the liquidation of a federal state  enterprise and also on settlement with its creditors shall be  from the federal budget.    7. That a treasury factory (treasury plant, treasury  economic unit) created from a liquidated federal state  enterprise:    shall be the successor to the liquidated enterprise in  respect of federal funds previously allocated and also in  respect of usage of land, natural resources, and subterranean  resources, and quotas and licenses;    shall independently market its products (works, services)  and  utilize profit, unless otherwise stipulated by legislation of  the Russian Federation or its articles of association;    shall not create subsidiaries, be a founder investor of  other  enterprises, establishments, and organizations without the  consent of the Government of the Russian Federation or an  authority appointed by it;    shall not dispose of, let, transfer use of, or mortgage  immovable state assets assigned to it without the consent of the  Government of the Russian Federation or an authority appointed  by it;    shall receive credits only against guarantees of the  Government of the Russian Federation.    8. That the standard articles of association of a treasury  factory (treasury plant, treasury economic unit) created from a  liquidated federal state enterprise shall be endorsed by the  Government of the Russian Federation.    The articles of association of a treasury factory (treasury  plant, treasury economic unit) shall define:    its accountability requirements in the forms stipulated by  the Government of the Russian Federation;    the personal liability of its director for its economic  performance;    its obligation to utilize federal funds according to their  intended purpose;    the type of business and profit-sharing procedure.    9.

That the Government of the Russian Federation shall:    by 1 July 1994 endorse the standard articles of association  of a treasury factory (treasury plant, treasury economic unit)  created from a liquidated federal state enterprise;    by 1 August 1994 define the procedure for planning and  financing the activities of treasury factories (treasury plants,  treasury economic units), including maintenance of social  amenities assigned to them, pricing of their products (works,  services), their finance from the budget and also remuneration  of their workforces;    by 1 July 1994 hear the chairman of the Russian Federation  State Committee for Management of State Property on compliance  with deadlines for consideration of privatization applications  and on the results of work to privatize state and municipal  enterprises in the Russian Federation.    11. To recommend to executive authorities of constituents of  the Russian Federation that they reform state enterprises under  their ownership, and to local authorities that they reform  municipal enterprises.    12.

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Arts: Strings and trumpets - Records THOUGH Caroline Mathilde, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies' new work for the Royal Danish Ballet, has yet to reach Britain, two other big, recent pieces are available on a Collins Classics CD (11812). His Trumpet Concerto for the redoubtable John Wallace was commissioned and premiered by the Philharmonia, but here the composer conducts the Scottish National Orchestra; for his Symphony no. 4 he has the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Confident performances; eminently serious pieces, both of them - somewhat tantalising and elusive, too. The Concerto is more overtly dramatic. There is a long, sombre orchestral introduction before the soloist enters with a florid recitative and the tempo increases sharply; after a violent climax there is a soft, ambiguous close. In the central Adagio molto the trumpet does St. Francis' sermon to the birds - the musical ideas of the whole Concerto are connected with a chamber opera-in-progress on the Saint - before he is joined in meditation by a solo horn, to striking effect. A concise final Presto allows him a crackling virtuoso display. Throughout, there are fraught pronouncements on timpani, and generous doses of excited string-tremolo. Nonetheless, by comparison with Maxwell Davies' lovely Ave Maris Stella and Image, Reflection, Shadow - respectively from 1975 and 1982, and now re-released (on Unicorn-Kanchana UKCD 2038) in the riveting Fires of London accounts - the new Trumpet Concerto and still more the Fourth Symphony have surprisingly 'traditional' surface manners. Of course the plainchant-based material is constantly rotated and transformed in the individual Davies way, and tonality has little to do with that; but the literal diction is reassuringly old-fashioned - and therefore tantalising, because the real musical argument is strictly modern. Instead of neo-Expressionism and wilful fantasy, there are square-cut phrases with a lot of even notes (sometimes recalling Messiaen's hieratic formulas), ruminative wind solos, curving duets in parallel lines, thumping little rhythmic cells and bright, familiar splashes of fanfares. One almost thinks: 'Sinfonia Academica'] Yet there is enough symphonic muscle in each work to grip the attention. Time will have to tell what that amounts to: whether the sacrifice of the fresh, immediate colours and fluidity of Ave Maris Stella and Image . . . serves the purposes of a still richer musical construction. Maybe the Francis opera, when it's done, will help to illuminate the new, shock-free Davies style. Volume 3 of the Unicorn-Kanchana survey of Elizabeth Maconchy's 13 string quartets completes the cycle splendidly (DKP 9082). For these last five works the performers are the Mistry Quartet, who maintain the level already set by the Hanson and Bingham ensembles, and enjoy the bonus of the new expressive depth in the late quartets. Nos. 10 and 11 are notably poignant, without the least relaxation of Maconchy's astringent economy. The whole set is an authentic British contribution to 20th-century music: the modest triumph of a born quartet-composer. Though her scale seems almost miniature (the Maconchy norm is 12 to 15 minutes per quartet), the laconic density, the energy and the rigorously sharp point of every piece brook no argument. It is wonderfully bracing, gutsy stuff to hear, and the new candour of feeling in the latest quartets establishes the series as a real, maturing cycle - greatly rewarding to follow, all the way from spikey, narrow-gauge early brilliance to generously sculpted utterance and dramatic polyphony. One of Debussy's closest contemporaries, Gabriel Pierne is honoured by the veteran pianist Jean Hubeau (on Musifrance 2292-45525-2) with the Quatuor Viotti in his mature Quintet op. 41, transparently indebted to Ravel's Trio but seductive and even elevated in its own way. There is also his op. 36 Violin Sonata (with Olivier Charlier), which stands in the same honourable relation to Faure's First Sonata. Less warmly, I commend the same performers' accounts of Vierne's late Quintet and earlier Violin Sonata (Musifrance 2292-45524-2) - worthily constructed period-exhibits of honest, late Romantic feeling. With some of the leading French wind-players, the pianist Pascal Roge has recorded most of Poulenc's piano-and-wind music in faultless style (Decca 421 581-2): the three late solo sonatas, the Trio and the Sextet. They miss nothing except, perhaps, a touch of cheerful vulgarity here and there (surely the Sextet invites that?) - but the whole programme is a civilised pleasure. The same can be said of Roge's new solo-piano Poulenc collection (Decca 425 862-2, which includes all the Nocturnes, the charming Theme varie and a great deal more. Together with his previous collection (417 438-2), Roge offers here virtually all the Poulenc that's worth playing, and he outclasses all competitors. Any pianist might hesitate before going into competition with the venerable Firkusny readings of Janacek's noble sets and cycles, but Mikhail Rudy brings no less sympathetic insight to them (EMI CDC 7 54094 2). His extra touch of bravura sets the pieces in a slightly different light (Firkusny is always 'inward', as if playing for himself alone), but it remains as haunting as ever: music like no one else's. Finally, two greatly deserving, under-played sonatas, by Balakirev and by Henri Dutilleux, get intelligent performances from the American pianist Donna Amato (Olympia OCD 354). More virtuoso dash would bring out the best of the Balakirev; but both works are worth discovering - and if this recording inspires some competitors with steelier fingers, so much the better.</p>

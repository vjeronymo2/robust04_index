			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Wales (6): Time-saving benefit for inward investors - Infrastructure GWYNEDD, the north-west corner of Wales that is forever Cymru, has a new benefit to offer inward investors - the time taken to travel from the Britannia Bridge across the Menai Straits at Anglesey to the county's local airport. The airport, which handles 13m passengers a year and runs daily scheduled services to Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and two to New York, is the fastest growing in Europe and is at Manchester. Mr Brian Rees Jones, the Welsh Development Agency's regional manager for North Wales, this month did the journey twice with an American businessman to prove it was no fluke to accomplish it in an easy 75 minutes. This is new. The journey was always hindered by a depressing bottleneck across the River Conwy on the border with Clwyd where traffic crawled and queues lengthened each year in the summer. In 1991, however, a tunnel under the river solved the problem. Apart from two near-completed sections of only a few hundred yards each, it is now motorway or dual carriageway all the way from Bangor to London, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester or Hull - and the ferries to Europe are less than four hours away. 'Manchester Airport is now our local airport,' says Mr Eurwyn Lloyd Evans, director of economic development and planning for Gwynedd County Council. 'We only wish they would realise this in Cardiff.' He is referring to the Welsh Office, which frequently stresses the convenience of Cardiff's airport - from where a feeder service flies to Manchester - in its promotional material for Wales in general. Gwynedd is at least four hours away from it. Completion of the A55 road from Chester to Anglesey has cost about Pounds 600m over a couple of decades. Gwynedd has felt an immediate benefit. In 1991-92, the county attracted 23 projects in terms of inward investment or expansion. It is already certain to equal the figure this year. The comparison with previous years is startling: Mr Jones says the annual average had been stuck at five since the mid-1980s. The road emphasises what has always been true about North Wales - its infrastructure runs west to east and its regional economic affinities are with north-west England. This is where many of the companies Mr Jones is now courting are based. Others are in the Republic of Ireland and, because of the airport, the US. 'Our greatest asset is now the A55. Linked to that, we have also got our act together to exploit it. The A55 has opened up this area and focused all our minds on what we want to do,' he says. The WDA, county council and Targed - the training and enterprise council for the area - are developing a strategy aimed particularly at sectors such as food and drink, health care, broadcasting and the media. Mr Huw Vaughan Thomas, the county's chief executive, has forged particularly close links with Targed, to help ensure that training delivers the sort of multi-skilling that will provide the right sort of adaptable, flexible workforce. He has culture on his side: two-thirds of the 240,000 population are fluent Welsh speakers who, by tradition, have always valued education. Mr Thomas says Gwynedd has more than half of Wales's A-level passes in information technology. 'We need more professional and technological activities to retain more young people in Gwynedd,' he says. Too many still migrate elsewhere in Britain for work. He says unemployment rates of about 12 per cent remain his biggest problem, especially since they rise to 20 per cent in parts of Anglesey and, in winter, in the Lleyn peninsula. Recent inward investors such as Thistle Trading, however, are very happy with what they have already. Thistle employs 70 near Bangor, making sweat-shirts, tee-shirts and boxer shorts for Marks and Spencer and will soon be taking on 36 more. The project is an expansion by Abbey Textiles of Nuneaton. Mr David Reardon, Abbey's managing director, says availability of labour, plus a Pounds 15,000 training grant from Targed, made him choose Gwynedd rather than Derbyshire, the Black Country or South Wales. Mr Maurice Reynolds, an Irishman, who is managing director and co-owner of McIntosh Reynolds, Anglesey's abbatoir, is particularly pleased with the infrastructure. His is the only EC-approved slaughterhouse in North Wales. The A55 now ensures easier journeys in and out. He has exploited this by selling genuine Welsh lamb - guaranteed so by being both reared and killed in Wales - to Asda in particular. The company has invested Pounds 350,000 recently and has Pounds 2.5m set aside for more improvements. It can process as many as 20,000 sheep a week and 1,500 cattle. The link to the airport is proving particularly valuable to Austin Taylor Communications which makes cable installation equipment and telephone connection components opposite the old Penrhyn slate quarry at Bethesda. The company, which was one of North Wales's first inward investments in 1947, nearly foundered recently after diversifying into switchboard equipment and coming unstuck against the giants of the industry. It is now part of Communications Systems of Minneapolis. Mr John Hudson, the managing director, uses Manchester's Chicago service regularly, as do his US colleagues. The company is coming back strongly in niche markets, employing 130 and exporting 30 per cent of its sales, which are at Pounds 6m a year and growing. Meanwhile, infrastructure improvements are begetting others. Stena Sealink is beefing up its Dublin-Holyhead services with new high-speed ferries that will cut journey times by 100 minutes to less than two hours, so as to exploit the A55. Mr Thomas says tributary roads will soon open up the Lleyn, and he wants improvements to Holyhead town centre - and its road to the Britannia Bridge made a dual carriageway - to prevent bottlenecks on Anglesey. Tourism is also being boosted, with ease of access encouraging more day-tripping from Ireland as well as north-west England. Even the by-passed town of Conwy is doing better. People now go there to visit its impressive castle and quaint quayside, not for a traffic-jammed ordeal. The local barometer is a tourist attraction on the quayside which claims to be the smallest house in Britain - it is 72 inches wide, 100 inches deep and 122 inches high; people queue to go in one at a time and mount the stairs to view the tiny bedroom. Ms Margaret Williams, an author and journalist who inherited the house from her father, says trade was 25 per cent up last year and is performing well this summer. Hers is not the only traditional Gwynedd business to be doing well out of the county's history. Alfred McAlpine's Penrhyn slate quarry recently had a repeat order it is particularly proud of: it was from Harvard University, which wanted to match the last slate it ordered from Bethesda 150 years ago.</p>

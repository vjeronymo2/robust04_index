Ozawa, a powerful figure in the coalition government, said  in  an interview with the paper that the "(ruling parties) have no  choice but to compete in (the next lower house) election as a  single party." He was quoted as saying that such a merger is  necessary to win against the primary opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in the next lower house polls to be held  under a new electoral system, which combines single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation seats.    Ozawa said the ruling parties will not form a government  with  the LDP after the election, the report said.    The politician predicted that political realignment,  including a merger of the ruling parties, would progress rapidly  after the current Diet session officially approves a package on  the new electoral system later this month, the daily said.    The package was passed in the Diet last month but because of  time constraints no date was set for implementation. The  current Diet session is slated to revise the bills.    Ozawa was quoted as saying that the new party would group  people who think Hosokawa should be kept as the leader and who  believe Japan should enact a basic security law defining Japan  as a peaceful nation with the United Nations as its lead.    Ozawa also said the new party would stress a policy of free  competition with relaxed regulations as much as possible, the  paper said. "This idea will surely have many supporters," he  said in the report.    Last summer, Ozawa defected from the LDP which surrendered  its 38-year grip on power to the current coalition in August  1993.</p>

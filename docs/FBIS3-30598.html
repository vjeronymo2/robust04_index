			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The first national commercial  television station in the postsocialist countries is Nova, a  Czech independent television company. You may be interested in  the fact that the name Nova was chosen by a lady living in  Bratislava.    The license was awarded by the Radio and Television  Broadcasting Council of the Czech Republic on 30 January 1993,  and the deadline for starting the broadcast was yesterday [4  February]. Nova is ambitious: It will broadcast on average 19  hours a day, using the former F1 [federal television] channel.  It will broadcast newsreels and current affairs programs, some  documentaries, and entertainment and musical programs. To begin  with, it owns broadcasting rights for more than 400 foreign  films, which will be broadcast dubbed. Nova will use the  opportunity to insert advertisements during film screenings, but  only with the approval of the films' authors. Also, much is  expected from daily morning programs.    An interesting program feature is a vox populi, a sort of  television Hyde Park. In the Krone department store [in  Prague], there is a television cabin where, for a fee of 10  [Czech] korunas, you can record any message you wish. [passage  omitted]    According to Vladimir Zelezny, the Nova director general,  the  viewers are expected to be average Czech citizens. There are no  unnecessarily high expectations about their viewers, but they  are not being underestimated, either. [passage omitted]</p>

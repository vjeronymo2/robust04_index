Chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] Lajos Fur  said the parliamentary elections scheduled for May will be vital  to the future of the Hungarian nation. Following the creation  of the system of political institutions, the switch to a social  market economy must be implemented in the next four years, he  said.    Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz], stressed that the opposition parties are also  committed to Hungary's membership in the European Union.    During his meeting with the Belgian prime minister, Chairman  of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] Ivan Peto, stressed  the importance of the May parliamentary elections in terms of  the young Hungarian democracy. He noted that both society and  politicians are only now learning of the consequences that can  accompany a possible change in government within a democratic  system.    Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP],  told Dehaene that the MSZP supports NATO's peace-partnership  conception. Perhaps the only objection would be that, in cases  of conflict, the consultation opportunities seem weak.    Dehaene was seen off at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport by  Chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party Laszlo  Surjan. In the course of their brief discussions, the Belgian  prime minister stressed high appreciation for the political  stability experienced, which is unique in the region.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK property becomes the des res of foreign funds: Vanessa Houlder reports on a spate of overseas investment in commercial buildings The claim that the UK commercial property market is at a turning point gains a certain credibility when sellers believe they are making disposals at the bottom of the market. 'I suspect we did it at exactly the wrong time,' says Mr Roger Wingate, chairman of Chesterfield Properties, which has been selling property to reduce its borrowing. 'The changes that we would need to see in order for the market to improve are starting to happen.' The most striking of these changes is the emergence of buyers, mainly from overseas, which are prepared to invest in UK property. The number of deals has gathered pace since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism and interest rates fell 3 percentage points. Last year's investment by overseas buyers was more than Pounds 1bn. German funds led the way, with some large acquisitions of buildings in the City of London in the last quarter of 1992. These included DGI's acquisition of Ropemaker Place for about Pounds 75m; DIFA's acquisition of Finsbury Circus from MEPC, a UK property company, for Pounds 73m; and a Pounds 78m acquisition of Plumtree Court by BfG Immobilien, from Norwich Union. The increased investment activity is even allowing agents to claim that the supply of good quality property is running out. 'From an investor's perspective, there is quite a serious shortage of good investment opportunities,' says Mr Stephen Mallen of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the chartered surveyors. An important reason for the increased activity is that interest rates have fallen to well below property yields, which allows deals to be self-financing. The devaluation of sterling has also made UK property attractive to overseas investors. But the overriding incentive to invest in UK property is the belief that values have fallen far enough. Property yields are now well above gilt yields, a situation unknown since the 1960s; and they are virtually double equity yields. UK property yields are higher than in many other markets which encourages buyers to believe that UK property values are coming to the bottom of their cycle, while other European markets have only started their decline. However, the increased interest in UK property is directed at a small group of properties, with long leases and secure tenants, which accounts for, at most, a fifth of the market. Moreover, there are strong arguments for believing that investors are misjudging the severity of the problems of the UK market. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker, says property values will continue to decline until the middle of 1994. It says prices will be depressed by the likely rise in long-dated gilt yields, the large volumes of property that are due to come on to the market and the banks' reluctance to make further loans to property investors. Also, the weakness of the economy and the record oversupply of offices in London, mean rental values will continue to fall. The disastrous record of foreign investors who had previously invested in London might be another cause for caution. The late 1980s saw many overseas buyers invest at the peak of the market, as restrictions on institutional investment were lifted. North American investors have also been deterred by the experience of Olympia &amp; York at Canary Wharf and the losses made by JMB, a US fund which bought Randsworth, a London property company that later went into receivership. Kleinwort Benson, the broker, believes the new wave of overseas investors will be as transitory as the last. The influx of overseas investors will dry up once they realise they have overestimated future growth prospects in the UK, it says. 'The risk is that once these large purchases are completed, German funds will have their weighting in London and, as the German economy and property markets deteriorate in the next two years, funds will no longer be available for overseas purchases.' It may be that the real significance of the current spate of overseas purchases is that it provides a selling opportunity for overstretched domestic investors, rather than indicating the end of the UK property crash.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Iraq holds second Briton for illegal entry BRITAIN last night vowed to exert all possible pressure on Iraq to secure the release of a second Briton being held on a charge of entering the country illegally, agencies report. The Foreign Office confirmed that the Baghdad regime was holding Mr Michael Wainwright, 41, who was arrested in Mosul, northern Iraq. He was reported to have been cycling from Britain to Australia. A week ago, Iraq imposed a seven-year jail sentence on Mr Paul Ride, 33, a British caterer who, diplomats believe, strayed across the desert from Kuwait. The detentions have further heightened tension between Iraq and Britain, just as UK forces have joined the US and France in enforcing a 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq. The Foreign Office said that Mr Wainwright, from West Yorkshire, had been held in Iraq since May. His plight emerged in a letter received last week by his parents. He said in the letter he was arrested for not having a visa. The Russian embassy, which looks after British interests in Iraq, said it had asked the Iraqis for permission to see Mr Wainwright. The Iraqis had yet to respond to the request, but it was likely to be one or two weeks before the Russians would be allowed to see him, they said. However, they had been promised a visit to Mr Ride, possibly in two to five days. Diplomats in Baghdad said Mr Wainwright was reported to have crossed into Iraq from Turkey. The Russian embassy said that, a few days ago, Mr Wainwright was being held in a police station in Baghdad, but it did not know what happened to him before or since then. Mr Wainwright's uncle in West Yorkshire said his nephew had set off on his cycling trip 'about last Christmas'.</p>

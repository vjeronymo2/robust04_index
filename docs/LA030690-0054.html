			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS  </P> <P> Question: I read the column in which you said that even people who have never  been in combat can have post-traumatic stress disorder. But does there have to  have been a physical injury before a person can say that he has such a problem?  And is there medicine to treat the condition, or is this something for which  you need a psychiatrist?  </P> <P> Answer: Physical injury is not a prerequisite for a diagnosis of post-traumatic  stress disorder. For example, a person who witnesses an automobile accident in  which a friend or relative is killed may develop the disorder.  </P> <P> Some antidepressants may be beneficial for some patients, and anti-anxiety  therapy may be helpful for others.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Neil Solomon is author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired,"  Wynwood Press. If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box  36184, Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will  answer as many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

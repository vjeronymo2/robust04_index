			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Yeltsin chief denies coup plot fears President Boris Yeltsin's administration chief yesterday insisted that the Russian president was in good health and accused opposition figures of spreading rumours about a coup plot, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Sergei Filatov, administration chief, was speaking as rumours about impending plots to overthrow Yeltsin, saying he was too ill to rule, circulated in parliament. They were contained in an anonymous document passed among deputies. Mr Yeltsin went on holiday to the south Russian coast this week, saying he planned to be away for a fortnight but could be called back early. He was off work for three weeks last month with what aides called first a cold and later flu. 'Certain opposition activists are trying to push society into an explosive state, spreading rumours either about the allegedly worsening state of health of the president or about a coup which is allegedly being planned,' Mr Filatov said. Interfax said Mr Filatov urged all opposition groups to work together to try to achieve harmony. Mr Georgy Satarov, presidential adviser acknowledged that disaffected groups of the dispossessed Soviet-era ruling class might be planning a return to power. No sooner had Mr Yeltsin left Moscow than his past and present political enemies - including former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, just released from jail - united in an anti-presidential movement dubbed Accord For Russia. Conservative opponents of President Boris Yeltsin yesterday failed to force a debate on whether to scrap the 1991 treaty which abolished the Soviet Union and set up the Commonwealth of Independent, the Interfax news agency reported. The move in the lower house of parliament, proposed by former Soviet parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov, failed because only 179 deputies backed putting it on the agenda, well short of the 223 needed.</p>

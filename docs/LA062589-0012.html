			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH STYLE: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ILANA GOOR FURNITURE  </P> <P> ISRAELI-BORN ILANA GOOR began sculpting during the '60s, while a resident in  Los Angeles. After a one-woman show in Los Angeles, her work found its way into  the office of finance minister and deputy prime minister Shimon Peres and the  War Memorial Yad le-Banim, Raanana, Israel (among the tallest sculptures in  Israel). Yet, Goor admits: "My serious stuff was very difficult to sell. Only  collectors bought it."  </P> <P> Instead, popular success has come through the sculptural metal furniture  collection she began creating five years ago. Its rugged, archeological  surfaces are the right look at the right time (coffee tables with modernist  polished chrome bases are out of style and "natural" finishes such as  verdigris, rusty iron and bronze are in). Goor's popularity also coincides with  a revived interest in art nouveau; the vinelike spirals embellishing her pieces  evoke the lush tangle of tendrils typifying the work of Tiffany or Hector  Guimard (who did the beloved entrances to the Paris Metro). Says Goor: "My  pieces look organic, as if they're growing. Everything is a little  asymmetrical."  </P> <P> Far from scheming to cash in on current trends, however, Goor came by her look  naturally. In need of furnishings for her 400-year-old house in Jaffa, Israel,  Goor took inspiration from the in-progress renovation. She fashioned the frame  for a glass-topped porch table, for instance, from pieces of concrete  reinforcing bars. To exploit her house's dramatic view overlooking the  Mediterranean, she created a lounge chair that evokes the characteristics of a  rickety old deck chair at a seaside resort. "Friends would see the pieces and  ask for one for their own house. Then came requests for lamps, tea carts and  beds," she recalls. Goor embellishes her pieces with spookily realistic bronze  birds, frogs, snails, turtles, rabbits, pigeons, eagles, cats and dogs. They  mimic the creatures who would congregate on her terrace in the morning. As the  sun rose in the sky and the day grew hotter, the animals would leave to seek  shade. Missing them, she sculpted substitutes.  </P> <P> Free of the Holocaust-laden Angst pervading her "serious" sculpture, Goor's  furniture finds the artist rolling up her sleeves and having fun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ilana Goor's furniture is available through designers at Kneedler-Fauchere at  the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles; telephone (213) 855-1313. List prices  range from $200 for a bronze bird to $2,600 for a side table to $21,000 for the  deck chair.  </P> <P> </P></p>

The projects, involving a total investment of more than six  billion yuan (about 690 million U.S. dollars), are helping  improve Tibet's investment conditions and exploiting the  abundant local resources.    So far, some of the key projects managed by the state and  local authorities have been put into use.    The Gongkar Airport in southern Tibet, upgraded by the state  to the tune of 273 million yuan, is now the only airport linking  Tibet with the outside world with its advanced runway,  communication facilities and passenger lounge.    A comprehensive agricultural development project is  providing  water to another 22,000 ha [hectare] of farmland, pasture and  woodland in Tibet with the completion of reservoirs and  diversion works last year. As a result, Tibet will increase its  production of grain by 5,000 tons and of vegetables by 500 tons  a year.    China's largest chromite base is also taking shape in Tibet,  capable of turning out 110,200 tons of ore a year.    In addition, some other key projects, including telephone  services, a hydropower station and a highway, are all making  progress.</p>

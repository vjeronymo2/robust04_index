			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TIGHTENS CONTROLS ON PESTICIDE RESEARCH  </P> <P> The state has tightened its oversight of pesticide research after finding that  researchers working for a French chemical company exposed 19 volunteers to  excessive levels of a pesticide that has made farm workers ill, state Food and  Agriculture Department officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The researchers, working under contract for Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., changed  procedures that had been approved by the state Food and Agriculture Department  and exposed their human subjects to the pesticides for twice as long as should  have been allowed, according to an investigation by the Food and Agriculture  Department.  </P> <P> The volunteers were picking grapes in a test field sprayed with the pesticide  Zolone.  </P> <P> "Without the change, a great many of the people would have been taken out of  the field and the study probably would have been ended," Jim Wells, a special  assistant in the department's Pest Management Division, said of the  Rhone-Poulenc study. "They didn't want to stop the study, so they just amended  the protocol."  </P> <P> Neither the company nor the researchers working under contract could be  prosecuted because what they did was not covered in regulations in effect at  that time, Wells said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Violations of Law'  </P> <P> "There were no violations of law," he said. "We feel it was not really ethical.  But we could not find it was technically illegal. All we could do is cry foul."  </P> <P> Ron Hansen, the California representative for Rhone-Poulenc, declined to  comment on the report Friday afternoon. He referred all questions to the  company's North Carolina headquarters, which were closed for the day.  </P> <P> The research project was conducted in Visalia in August, 1988, after the  company, under pressure from the state, stopped selling Zolone, which had  poisoned more than 70 workers in grape fields during 1987. The state said the  workers in Fresno and Madera counties suffered from headaches, nausea and  vomiting.  </P> <P> Rhone-Poulenc was trying to show in the research that its product was safe  enough to be used again in the fields.  </P> <P> Under terms approved by the state, the company sent 30 paid workers to pick  grapes in fields sprayed with Zolone and 22 to fields that had not been  sprayed. The company originally agreed to pull its volunteers from the study if  daily blood tests showed excessive pesticide exposure as detected by depressed  levels of the enzyme cholinesterase in the blood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Excessive Exposure Found  </P> <P> But months after the six-day study was completed, the company's report on the  research revealed that 19 of the volunteers had been exposed to excess levels  of the pesticide but had not been pulled from the fields.  </P> <P> "The study should have been stopped after three days," Wells said.  </P> <P> Although three other participants became ill, doctors monitoring the study for  the company determined that none suffered from depressed levels of  cholinesterase and none had been overexposed to the pesticide.  </P> <P> In response to the investigation, the state has decided to establish a special  board in cooperation with the University of California to approve any pesticide  studies involving humans and will require written approval of any future  changes in study procedures that have been approved by the state.  </P> <P> Ralph Lightstone, a lobbyist for the California Rural Legal Assistance  Foundation, said Friday that he welcomed the increased scrutiny but argued that  the Zolone study never should have been approved by the department.  </P> <P> He said the department agreed to the study even though its own research showed  that the danger to humans from exposure to Zolone was undetermined. Lightstone  said the department should have cleared the study proposal with doctors in the  state Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> "No one had any idea what the risks were of exposing these folks, and (the  Department of Food and Agriculture) went ahead and approved the study anyway,"  he said. "Of course, we would like to see the procedures tightened."  </P></p>

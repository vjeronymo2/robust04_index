			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Closure in shadow of O&amp;Y A Pounds 70m DOCKLANDS office building, in the shadow of Canary Wharf, yesterday became the latest casualty of the collapse of the London property market. South Quay Ltd, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft office block on the Isle of Dogs, was put into administrative receivership early yesterday. South Quay was established in 1990 as a separate company under a restructuring of Wiggins Group, the publicly-quoted property developer and housebuilder which had run into trouble as a result of its developments in Docklands. Wiggins' bankers, which include Midland, National Westminster and Hill Samuel, agreed that South Quay's finances should be ring-fenced so no liability would fall back on Wiggins. South Quay Ltd's only asset was the Docklands office block, which was to be divided into units and sold to investors seeking tax shelter benefits in the Docklands' enterprise zone. The banks' patience finally ran out yesterday with only 10 per cent of the building sold, 18 months after it went on the market. Mr Robin Addy and Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, the insolvency practice of accountants Coopers Lybrand Deloitte, were appointed administrative receivers. Banks are still thought to be owed more than Pounds 30m, excluding previous losses on the development, which have been fully provided for by Wiggins and the banks under the restructuring.</p>

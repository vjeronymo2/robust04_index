			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Silent enemy stalks the aisles: Neil Buckley scours the retailing horizon as warehouse clubs arrive in the UK It is being called the most important development in UK retailing since the arrival of the supermarket in the 1950s. In Thurrock, Essex, US company Costco today opens its doors as Europe's first US-style warehouse club. With six more clubs scheduled to open in the next few months, UK retailers are getting distinctly nervous. The three biggest superstore chains recently waged a costly - and ultimately doomed - legal battle to try to stop Costco opening, while another national chain has warned suppliers it may stop buying from them if they supply the clubs. The retailers' anxiety is understandable. In the US these huge sheds, which stock goods at ultra-low prices for sale to business and individual members  -in practice, almost anybody in steady employment - have been nicknamed the 'silent enemy' because of the insidious but devastating impact they have had on more traditional shops. In the UK, while their market share may be limited, they are expected to force many other retail chains to lower their prices, and persuade some of them to change their entire style of operating. 'I think it is right to talk about a new epoch in UK retailing,' says Mr Paul Morris, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. His prediction is based on research in the US, where in 10 years, warehouse clubs have taken retailing by storm. Their numbers have increased from 21 in 1983 to an expected 750 by the end of this year, and their sales from barely Dollars 1bn to about Dollars 40bn, although their growth has slowed in the past two years - one reason why club operators are looking towards Europe. While US supermarkets usually trade at a gross profit margin of about 25 per cent, warehouse clubs cut that to 10 per cent. The key to their success lies in taking an old retailing strategy - 'pile it high and sell it cheap' - to its logical conclusion. Clubs offer branded products at prices 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than high street retailers, with some up to 60 per cent cheaper. They achieve such prices by cutting costs and profit margins to the bone, with the aim of shifting huge volumes of goods. Every area of the business is examined with an eye to cutting costs. Clubs spend virtually nothing on advertising, and employ very few staff. Goods are sold in bulk off steel racking, in vast, spartan sheds built on the cheapest available sites; and clubs stock a highly selective range numbering only 3,500 items (compared with 15,000 in a typical grocery superstore), but stretching from corn flakes to computers and car accessories. A final important element is membership, on which clubs rely heavily. They typically have more than 40,000 members, each paying about Dollars 25-Dollars 30 (Pounds 17-Pounds 20) a year, and membership income can account for 80 per cent of trading profit. So far, clubs in the US have not experienced problems with non-payment of fees but it could prove one area of weakness in the UK. As they cross the Atlantic, the question facing warehouse clubs is whether they can replicate their success in rather different conditions. Sceptics argue that UK land prices are up to five times higher than those in the US, pushing up warehouse clubs' cost bases significantly; and that UK shoppers may be less willing than their US counterparts to drive large distances to shop, to pay annual membership fees, or to buy in bulk. On some of the narrow questions, consumer research is inconclusive. A recent survey by market research group Harris International Marketing found 51 per cent of UK shoppers prepared to buy in bulk to save money. But only 27 per cent said they would pay an annual fee. As to the larger question of whether clubs can have a viable future in the UK, the predictions are more positive. Verdict Research, the retailing consultancy, believes land costs will not be a problem: warehouse clubs do not demand prime retail sites, and the higher margins prevalent in UK retailing will make it easier than in the US for clubs to undercut existing shops. Verdict has identified 50 potential sites for clubs in the UK. Assuming what it regards as realistic annual sales of Pounds 65m for each outlet, that could give them a Pounds 3.25bn share of the Pounds 150bn total UK retail market by the end of the decade. Goldman Sachs is more optimistic. Taking only metropolitan areas, its retail analysts say there is scope for 51 clubs. If less densely populated county districts were considered as available sites, a further 39 could be built. The firm believes clubs could expand at the rate of 10 or more a year, and could achieve sales of Pounds 100m each, giving them a Pounds 9bn market share over the same period. Verdict's sales forecast for warehouse clubs is equivalent to only 2 per cent of the total UK retail market, while Goldman's would give them 6 per cent. 'What is surprising about the market share forecasts for warehouse clubs in the UK is they are actually so small,' says Mr Richard Hyman, Verdict's managing director. He sees one reason for constrained growth in the lack of areas with a sufficiently large population to support the clubs. With such moderate forecasts, why are rival retailers so hot under the collar about them? Part of the answer may be the clubs' expected upmarket customer profile. Although one-third of club members in the US are small businesses, the other two-thirds are individuals drawn mainly from higher income brackets. According to Nielsen Marketing Research, most club customers have an annual income of more than Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 27,000), and many earn more than Dollars 60,000. Clubs have done much to make discount shopping not just acceptable, but fashionable. That could pose a problem for some UK retailers. The high-street food discounters which have expanded rapidly in the past three years, such as Germany's Aldi, France's Netto, and the UK's Kwik Save, have tended to target poorer customers. But warehouse clubs may tempt the more affluent households which currently shop at superstores such as Sainsbury's and Safeway. The breadth of warehouse clubs' product categories means it is not just food superstores which fear they could cream off their best trade. Electricals retailers such as Dixons and Comet, consumer durables retailers such as Argos, and furniture and DIY stores such as MFI and B&amp;Q, could also suffer, according to industry observers. The most important effect of warehouse clubs, however, could be the most subtle, evolving over several years. By offering such low prices, in combination with the growth of high-street discounters such as Aldi, the clubs could set a new, lower 'price floor' across the retail trade, squeezing retailers' profit margins. This, in turn, could be bad news for manufacturers. Dixons, for example, has told its suppliers it intends to match Costco's price on any product sold by both chains - but it also says it intends to continue making its usual profit margin. The message is clear: supply Costco and you must cut your prices to us. 'Dixons is wielding the big stick,' says one supplier. 'With times so tough, they know they have the whip hand over suppliers.' Other retailers may find different ways of competing. UK foodstores may follow their US counterparts, which have attempted to fend off the warehouse club threat by offering savings of 30 to 50 per cent on bulk purchases of basic goods, often bundled together in 'club packs'. Sometimes these are sold off warehouse racking in 'club aisles', to mimic conditions in a club. Some US retailers have adopted even more of the warehouse clubs' low-cost techniques, to enable them to offer lower prices, while selling a larger, often more specialised range. The south-western chain Mega Warehouse Foods, for example, invites customers to 'Shop us like a supermarket. Save like a warehouse club.' It sells goods cheaply in club-style surroundings, but offers 20,000 items compared to warehouse clubs' 3,500 and has no membership fee. This trend may already be starting in the UK. J Sainsbury, which has the largest sales and second-highest profits of any UK retailer, is opening an annex to its existing Savacentre hypermarket at Beckton, east London, which will sell mainly own-label tinned, packaged and household goods in bulk. There have been reports in the retail trade - denied by Sainsbury's - that the store will incorporate some basic design features of a warehouse club. The opening of the annex may signal a sharp change of direction for the UK's top supermarket chains. The arrival of warehouse clubs is likely to accelerate the move away from the margin-led approach of the 1980s towards a more volume-driven strategy. But as in the US, some chains may decide they are fighting a losing battle if they try to compete with the clubs on price. Instead they could decide to concentrate on developing their strengths, such as choice, service and convenience. The result could be both lower prices and a wider variety of styles in UK retailing - and the main beneficiary would be the consumer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK projected sales and market penetration  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Forecast         Forecast share UK                            sales poundsm      retail spending (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Food        2,015                  2.4       Office supplies          405                  5.8 Clothing and textiles          200                  0.6   Electrical products          305                  2.5                 Other          325                  n/a                              3,250                  1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Verdict  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Leading Article: After FYROM THE MOST absurd, but not least dangerous, of Balkan squabbles is within reach of solution. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has retreated from the untenable position on recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia ('FYROM'), which he imposed on the EC. At last June's Lisbon summit the EC, fearing that Greece would refuse to ratify the Maastricht treaty, agreed to recognise the republic under any name not including the term 'Macedonia'. The Greeks argue that this name belongs exclusively to their own northern province, and that its use by anyone else implies the revival of a scheme, current earlier in the century, to create a larger Macedonian state including that province as well as part of Bulgaria. The leaders of the new state repeatedly abjured any such ambition, and amended their constitution so as explicitly to exclude it, but to no avail. Greek public opinion has become so inflamed that it must have taken courage for Mr Mitsotakis to announce, earlier this month, that he is now willing to accept a UN-sponsored arbitration process, leading to a name which could include the word Macedonia, with a suitable epithet to distinguish it from the Greek province. His retreat reflects awareness that international support for Greece's position, never wholehearted, is crumbling. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council is considering the republic's application for UN membership. The three EC members currently serving on it - Britain, France and Spain - have come up with an ingenious formula: the Council would admit the republic while noting that its name is still in dispute, recommend that this dispute be settled by arbitration, and decide that it will be referred to as FYROM in the meantime. Neither side has yet accepted this. The Greeks know that in practice the state would be called Macedonia (as it already is), while Mr Kiro Gligorev, the Macedonian president, fears excoriation by hardline nationalists in his parliament if he agrees to compromise. He should be encouraged to stand up to them: Macedonia has suffered enough from isolation, and the compromise amounts in fact to a moral victory. His government should now concentrate on a domestic problem which is much more serious: the tense relations between its Slav majority and Albanian minority. Greece should take a leaf out of Bulgaria's book and adopt the minuscule landlocked republic as a little sister. Even if one or both sides refuse to accept the compromise, the Security Council should still adopt it. Balkan governments which do not feel strong enough to face down nationalist passions may yet find it easier to bow to a decree from the world's top authority.</p>

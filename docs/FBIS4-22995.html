			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Smirnov, doctor of technical sciences, </F> Moscow State Architectural University: ``A New Seismic Doctrine:  the Real Danger During Earthquakes Is Not in the Soil  Vibrations, But Rather, in the Compression Shock Waves'']    [Text] According to the current official doctrine, it is  believed that buildings are destroyed during earthquakes by  their own vibrations, which are caused by ground vibrations  which are close to them in frequency. The latter are also  recorded by seismic instruments. However, the constant and  completely inexplicable failures in the struggle against seismic  damage has led to the idea that something here is not as it  seems and that the seismic engineers are protecting buildings  not from actual danger, but rather, from a false danger. The  actual danger, however, has remained unnoticed up till now.    This mistake had not been discovered only because, up till  now, the seismic engineers and seismologists have been the only  ones concerned with the most complicated problem of seismic  damage. At the same time, all the prominent specialists in the  theory of the threshold equilibrium, destruction and durability  of structures disregarded it. And it never occurred to anyone  that the patterns of seismic damage are a unique source of  invaluable scientific information about the true nature of the  seismic effect on buildings.    When I reproduced a series of standard seismic strength  analyses with due consideration of the ground vibrations  recorded at the same time, I obtained a paradoxical result. It  turned out that, in half of the instances, the buildings should  not have been damaged at all, while, in the rest of the  instances, the damage should have been completely different.  Consequently, the results of the currently used standard seismic  strength analyses do not reflect at all the actual pattern of  the phenomenon at all.    After analyzing the nature, properties and regularities of  all the seismic damage from the standpoint of structural  mechanics, I managed to reproduce the mysterious effect which  caused it. Up till now, this problem had not been solved. It  turned out that the seismic damage represented the precise  replication (or impression) of the sought-after effect and it is  only necessary to know how to interpret it. As a result, I  managed to discover some very interesting facts which had not  been known previously and which, however, are of extraordinarily  important practical value. All the damage during earthquakes  takes the highly unusual form of a ``clean shear.'' This is  completely ``abnormal'' for the behavior of reinforced concrete  columns, partitions and lintels from the point of view of  structural mechanics. Such damage contradicts the standard  properties of the flexible components which should always  fracture and not shear. Moreover, this kind of damage differs in  its nature from all known types and is not encountered anywhere  else. So far, it has not been possible to reproduce it  artificially, even by means of underground explosions. In its  form, it absolutely does not correspond to and is even at  variance with the ground vibrations which have been recorded at  the time of its appearance. Consequently, these vibrations  cannot cause the actual damage.    It follows completely obviously from all these facts that  the  main premise in the current seismic ``vibrational'' doctrine is  false. The true damaging effect which corresponds to the pattern  of seismic damage may be not the vibrations, but rather, just  the compression shock waves which are not recorded by current  instruments. It is precisely these waves which give rise to the  shear shock waves in the columns and walls of buildings and  instantaneously shear them. The columns do not even have time to  bend and the buildings do not have time to sway. This  automatically means that all the currently used quake-proofing  measures and designs are absolutely useless. They protect  buildings from ground vibrations but, in principle, they are not  capable of protecting them from shear shock waves.    For example, we frequently place buildings on flexible  columns, saving them from resonance vibrations, while, as a  result of an earthquake, these protective columns simply snap  like wooden matches and the buildings collapse without even  having had time to shake.    When there are ground vibrations and they cause buildings to  vibrate, the columns and partitions should fracture on the ends.  But one of the many seismic paradoxes is the fact that such  fractures of columns, partitions and lintels do not develop  during earthquakes. Instead of them, an oblique shear develops  in the columns (most often in the middle), as if they are being  cut in two by a giant saber. Inasmuch as there is no fracturing  of flexible structural elements during earthquakes, this means  that there are no dangerous ground vibrations there. But then,  just what kinds of vibrations, in actual fact, are the current  seismic instruments showing us? The instruments are not  recording actual ground vibrations at all, but only their own  vibrations, which have been caused by the shock waves in the  ground. Up till now, such an interpretation of the accelerometer  recordings, one disagreeable for the seismic engineers, did not  occur to anyone.    As soon as the seismologists handed over the information  about seismic ground movements to the builders for their use,  they immediately also lost the monopoly for the assessment of  its accuracy. Their mistake ``crossed'' into another's field,  one not under their control, the field of structural mechanics.  And this is one of the most experiment-based and precise  sciences. It possesses a unique ability for determining the  accuracy of the description of any external effect on a  structure (including a seismic one). The strength analyzer gives  it this ability, since it establishes the firm connection  between the initial effect and the structural damage pattern  which corresponds to it. If the damage pattern expected by  analysis does not match the actual pattern, this means that the  description of the external effect is also invalid. It is  precisely this result which occurs in all seismic strength  analyses.    So, structural mechanics indisputably establishes the  erroneousness of the seismologists' information about dangerous  seismic ground movements. As a result, we have clarified the  fact that qualitatively different principles, measures and  designs are needed to protect buildings from shock waves. The  development and experimental testing of new protective designs  for buildings of any type and constructional design (both  planned and already existing ones) have already begun.</p>

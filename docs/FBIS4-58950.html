			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "a responsible military source" at the </F> Ministry of Defense and the General Command Staff; date not  given -- read by announcer]    [Text] Our valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy, today continued their successive  victories and great advance toward accomplishing their missions  on all axes and directions where the battles are raging against  the forces of apostasy and secession rebelling against the  constitutional legitimacy in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP].    With success from God and with broad popular support in the  governorates of Aden, Lahij, and Abyan and other governorates of  the Republic, and also with the resolve of the sincere men of  our valiant Armed Forces' heroes, great victories were achieved  today. The forces of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, the 2d Armored  Brigade, and the 8th Special Forces Brigade managed to  accomplish their combat missions successfully.    Today, the al-'Amaliqah forces destroyed the Madram Brigade  and seized all its equipment. The Brigade's chiefs of staff  surrendered, and its commander fled. A large number of officers  and soldiers from the Madram Brigade and the 5th Armored Brigade  joined the forces of the constitutional legitimacy. These  brigades are still waging decisive heroic battles against the  remnants of the secessionist forces of apostasy.    Also today, the forces of the 56th Brigade managed with  great  success to storm the defensive fortifications of the forces of  apostasy and secession. The vanguards of these forces arrived  in the area of Dar Sa'd, close to the Shaykh 'Uthman  neighborhood, one of the outskirts of the governorate of Aden.  They also closed the way to the supplies heading for the camps  of the misled ones who are dominated by the forces of apostasy  and secession in the governorate of Lahij.    Our valiant forces are now continuing to wage a heroic  battle  against the forces of the Salah-al-Din camp, which are being  misled by the rebellious secessionist gang, in order to force  them into surrendering and yielding to both the people's will  and legitimacy. This force is currently in the throes of death  before the courageous heroic blows dealt by the heroes of our  Armed Forces who continue to chase the remaining dens of the  elements of the rebellious secessionist gang.    On the southern axis, our courageous Armed Forces, the  forces  of the constitutional legitimacy, managed to storm and capture  the third fortified defense line of the forces of the al-Buzah  Brigade, and continued their advance to other fortifications.  Today, Monday, 250 personnel of the al-Buzah Brigade  surrendered with their full weapons and equipment, and declared  that they joined the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy.    Large quantities of weapons, equipment, and vehicles were  seized, including eight tanks and a number of guns and armored  vehicles. Our forces are currently chasing the fleeing remnants  of the secessionist forces of apostasy in that area.    Also in the governorate of Lahij, the heroes of the 2d  Armored Brigade continued to advance steadily and accomplish  their combat missions successfully in terms of combing the  district of al-Dali' for the remnants of the forces of apostasy  and rebellion. Large numbers from the 'Abbud Brigade in the  district of al-Dali' joined the forces of unity and legitimacy.    During the combing campaigns being carried out along the  collapsing positions of the forces of apostasy and secession,  our forces found huge quantities of Marxist and Leninist books,  through which the YSP was trying to obliterate the national  identity and to distort the thought of the sons of our Yemeni  people, and to psychologically and ideologically indoctrinate  the fighters of the military units that used to be under its  control.    The heroic al-Wahdah infantry, artillery, and armored  brigades, today continued to wage battles of bravery and honor  in defense of unity and legitimacy.    In another development, our valiant Armed Forces' Air Force  today, continued its successful air attacks, during which it has  successfully bombarded the set targets. Our aircraft returned  safely to base.    The antiaircraft defenses today downed an aircraft belonging  to the secessionist gang near the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan  Governorate.    The source hailed the splendid and heroic performance of the  personnel of our valiant Armed Forces and their great triumph  for the will of the people and their option for unity,  democracy, and the defense of their constitutional institutions.    The source also lauded the high national morale, enthusiasm,  and commitment to the national responsibility expressed by the  masses of our Yemeni people against the secessionist gang, and  their support for their sons in the valiant Armed Forces.    It congratulated our people on the great victories over the  secessionist gang, stressing that the victories that have been  achieved over the gang of fragmentation, apostasy, and  secession, are attributed to God's grace, and are the fruit of  the steadfastness of the masses of our Yemeni people, their  support for the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional  legitimacy, and their confrontation of the plans to dismember  and destroy the homeland.    The source said that the losses among the ranks of our  valiant Armed Forces as a result of the fighting that has been  raging against the forces of apostasy and secession since these  forces ignited the fire of war last Wednesday and until now have  reached 74 martyrs, and 314 wounded, in addition to 17 civilian  martyrs as a result of the treacherous aggression of the forces  of apostasy and secession. There was no immediate count  available of the number of the martyrs and the wounded personnel  of the Central Security, who were betrayed by the forces of  apostasy and secession in Aden, who attacked their camp on the  sad and bloody day of Wednesday.    Up until the time this statement was being prepared, our  valiant Armed Forces, have managed, on all axes of the fighting,  to inflict heavy defeats on the forces of apostasy and  secession, and to seize huge quantities of weapons, equipment,  and serviceable vehicles. Large numbers of the troops who were  misled by the rebelling secessionist gang have also joined the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, renewing their  allegiance to the legitimacy, the constitutional institutions,  and to the one Yemeni homeland, the homeland of freedom,  justice, democracy, progress, and prosperity.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you  will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet  firmly. [Koranic verse]</p>

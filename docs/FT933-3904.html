			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Japanese business confidence 'at its lowest in 18 years' JAPANESE manufacturers' business confidence ebbed to its lowest in 18 years between May and August this year and service industries' sentiment was at its most pessimistic ever, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The results of the bank's quarterly Tankan survey on business sentiment, taking in 7,400 companies, were slightly worse than expected and show that Japan might have slipped into recession over the summer with no prospect of an early recovery, said economists. The business confidence index, which measures the balance between the percentage of companies which see the outlook as good less those which believe it is bad, stood at -51 for manufacturing industry at the end of last month. That is the lowest since 1975 and compares with -49 in each of the previous two quarters. Service industries fell to -41, from -38 in the previous survey at the end of May. This latest evidence from what is seen as Japan's most important business survey increases the likelihood that the central bank will make a half-percentage point cut in its 2.5 per cent official discount rate some time this month, said analysts. It also increases the urgency of the government's economic stimulus package, details of which will be published next Thursday. Demand is weak. A balance of 51 per cent of manufacturing companies reported excess supply for their products and 32 per cent said inventories were too high. As a result, manufacturers find their ability to dictate prices has weakened. The index of prices, which measures the balance between those expecting sales prices to rise against those forecasting a fall, declined by 10 points since May to -32. A balance of 26 per cent of manufacturers had excess capacity. On average, manufacturers plan to cut capital investment by 5.9 per cent in the tax year ending next March, having forecast a smaller 4.4 per cent in the last survey. The employment outlook is also weak, with a balance of 19 per cent of all companies believing their workforces are too large. No end in sight, Page 4</p>

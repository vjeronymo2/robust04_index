			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWTH IN SAN LUIS OBISPO  </P> <P> I'm afraid that Deasy must be confused by the incessant wind and ambient  radiation that inflicts that region of the state between Buellton and King  City.  </P> <P> There is no San Luis Obispo County. I have been told that there is a San Luis  Obispo somewhere in Mexico; perhaps along the Pacific coast. In my travels I  have usually found that region midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco  dominated by boring dry hills, twisted dead trees, an immense nuclear reactor  and the largest prison population for any region its size in the state. The  traveler is well-advised to drive I-5 when going north or south; food and  lodging are reasonable along that ever-fascinating rural wonderland.  </P> <P> ROD McDANIEL  </P> <P> Cambria  </P></p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / New Zealanders turn the tables: The electorate could take only so much When choice comes down to the devil or the deep blue sea, it is time to change the ground-rules. That, at any rate, was the message emanating from New Zealand on Saturday night - and it should give 'free market' reformers the world over pause for thought. Throughout this election, New Zealanders have been in a bind. Nine years ago, they voted in a Labour government which radically overhauled the country's economic structures and institutions. It did away with decades of heavy protectionism, deregulated financial markets, and began a stream of privatisations. In 1990, the electorate switched allegiance to the National Party, which attacked the country's cradle-to-grave welfare system, replacing 'universalism' with targeted arrangements aimed at aiding the most needy. Both governments acted in the name of international competitiveness and financial prudence, and the speed and extent of New Zealand's reforms won widespread approbation overseas. But many New Zealanders view the results differently. They see high unemployment; a rising crime rate which, arguably, is associated with the teenage jobless figures; hospital waiting-lists; and deteriorating access to decent education. So, now that the politicians have changed everything else, New Zealanders have decided to change the politicians. Not just the faces, but the entire way of conducting politics. The one decisive vote delivered on Saturday night was for a 'mixed member proportional' electoral system to replace the British-style, 'first-past-the-post' arrangement. Under MMP, the single-chamber parliament will be enlarged from 99 to 120 seats, but only half the incumbents will represent specific electorates. The remainder will be drawn from party lists, so that the composition of parliament overall reflects the popular vote. MMP was endorsed this weekend despite a massive advertising campaign by its opponents. Virtually all parts of the country were supportive. Moreover, the MMP decision came after an abnormally high voter turnout. It is easy to see why MMP, for all its obvious frailties, has triumphed. Under the new system, New Zealanders have been told, two things will happen. First, minority parties who get a significant share of the popular vote will find that they have corresponding representation in parliament. Second, and largely because of this, a process of consensus politics will have to evolve. This, in turn, should prevent the high-handed behaviour displayed by the two main parties over the past nine years. Both National and Labour pushed through their reforms without having a majority of the popular vote. Neither, moreover, had fully declared their intentions beforehand. Unfortunately, by also delivering a hung parliament under the current first-past-the-post rules, New Zealanders have ensured that consultative government starts this morning, rather than with an MMP election in three years' time. This will be messy - though quite how messy is hard to determine at this stage. For a start, the final count has yet to be established. Because of the number of New Zealanders working overseas, 'special votes' account for about 10 per cent of the total cast. It will be another two weeks before these results are added in. But some seats, held on wafer-thin margins at present, could change hands as a result. A majority of under 400 votes pertains in nine electorates, and in the case of Auckland's Birkenhead, it is just 34. Second, it is unclear what structure of alliances - if any - will be worked out between National and Labour, and the two minority parties which have a couple of seats each. Jim Anderton, whose Alliance party won 18.7 per cent of the popular vote, says that he will not 'frustrate the party that has the most seats from governing'. Even so, given the party differences over welfare issues and labour market reform, many pundits suspect that a confidence vote is eventually inevitable. The simplest solution would be to call another election under the new MMP rules immediately. For practical reasons, this is not an option. Boundary lines must be redrawn; rules drawn up to govern the party lists; Maori voters re-enrolled and the number of Maori seats determined. All this, it is estimated, will take at least 18 months - although some think the timetable is unnecessarily long. So if New Zealanders were looking for stability, they have shot themselves in the foot. But the rest of the world, so envious of New Zealand's rapid reform process, may like to reflect on the election's lessons. The situation was undoubtably unusual, in that both of the main parties were responsible for jerking a once-regulated economy into the 'free market' regime, and hence associated in voters' minds with the less palatable aspects of this process. Nevertheless, the message is clear: voters will stomach only so much upheaval, before demanding results. Mr Bolger, National's leader, plainly knew this. At one point during the campaign he was asked what conclusions should be drawn from Kim Campbell's swingeing defeat in the Canadian elections. 'If you don't deliver jobs and growth, you're down the gurgler,' he replied. His party has delivered a little of both - although the unemployment rate has only just moved into single-digit figures, and the more commendable growth figures have centred on the export sector, with domestic benefits being slow to follow through. As a result, he is still hanging on to power. But only just.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Observer: Running out of energy Whatever happened to John Moore, or Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, to give him his proper title? He maintains such a low profile these days that it's hard to believe that only seven years ago he was being canvassed as a future prime minister of Britain. Take the growing row about the financing of the new Energy Saving Trust, which he chairs. It is a central plank of the government's energy efficiency campaign but its very survival is already being threatened by Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator. Without her backing, the trust can raise only a small fraction of the Pounds 400m a year it needs to spend to meet government targets. However, in this increasingly heated debate, it is the trust's capable but little known chief executive, Eoin Lees, who has been left to fight its corner. Lord Moore's recent public pronouncements have been limited to a short introduction to the trust's latest annual report, which talked of 'an encouraging start'. His deeper views of the trust's predicament are hard to establish since he doesn't seem to like being quizzed by the press. His sensitivity to press comment, dating back to his unlucky time as secretary of state for social security, may explain his shyness. But at this vulnerable stage in the trust's fortunes, it surely needs a chairman who is more preoccupied with saving energy than his face.</p>

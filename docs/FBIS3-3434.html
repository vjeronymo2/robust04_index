			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution here today  urging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow  it to complete all the requested inspection of nuclear  facilities in the country.    During a special meeting of the IAEA's 35-member board, 25  members voted for the resolution. Some members, including  China, abstained while the other members did not participate in  the balloting.    The resolution calls on the DPRK "immediately to allow the  IAEA to complete all requested inspection activities and to  comply fully with its safeguards agreement."    IAEA Director-General Hans Blix briefed board members during  the meeting on details of the IAEA's inspection of the DPRK's  seven declared nuclear power sites earlier this month.    He said that because the inspection team was barred from  carrying out necessary inspection activities at a radioactive  chemical laboratory, the IAEA could not draw any conclusion on  whether nuclear materials had been diverted or reprocessed in  the laboratory since February 1993.    Thus, the IAEA is ready to renew inspection of nuclear power  sites in the DPRK, the director-general said.    But he stressed that there was no proof that the DPRK had  done anything suspicious since February 1993 when the last full  inspections were carried out.    The DPRK insists its nuclear program is for peaceful  purposes  only.    According to reports from the United Nations, the DPRK  issued  a statement today saying it had "accepted the IAEA inspection  necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15."    The IAEA inspection team was able to carry out  satisfactorily  all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear facilities as specified  in the Vienna agreement, it said.    The statement said the DPRK side showed "flexibility as an  expression of its good-will by agreeing to the impertinent  demands from the IAEA Secretariat" during the inspection.    "If the IAEA Secretariat tries to provoke us in an attempt  to  launch another pressure kickup against DPRK," the statement  warned, "we will have no other alternative but to respond with  our resolute countermeasures."    In a speech to the board's meeting, Chinese delegate Chen  Shiqiu said that as a board member seriously concerned with the  developments, China always hopes that the efforts to resolve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will continue and be in  the right direction until a satisfactory settlement is achieved.    China has all along been opposed to the exertion of  pressures, because any pressure will be futile, Chen said.</p>

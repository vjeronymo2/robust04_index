			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BALLOT BACKSLIDING  </P> <P> The League of Women Voters was very disappointed with the San Diego City  Council's refusal to place the recommendations of the Charter Review Commission  before the city's voters.  </P> <P> While individual council members may not agree with the commission's proposed  Charter amendments, the City Council did "declare(s) that all recommendations  made by the commission shall be placed directly on the ballot without further  council directive." Shouldn't council members feel obligated to honor that  promise made in 1988? Perhaps that promise was foolishly given, but it was  given, and the council should accept the responsibility for that action.  </P> <P> The voters should decide if the city's charter should be changed in accordance  with the commission's recommendations. The voters decided they wanted district  elections. Perhaps a majority of voters also believes the time is past due to  expand the number of districts from eight to 10. Perhaps the voters will decide  that the nonpartisan nature of electing the mayor and council members will be  protected by creating a redistricting commission to redraw council districts.  The League of Women Voters trusts the electorate. We would like to see the City  Council exhibit trust in the voters also.  </P> <P> The City Council did vote to reconsider the 13 recommendations later this  summer. Time grows short to meet that commitment.  </P> <P> ALICE B. McCAULEY  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> League of Women Voters of San Diego  </P></p>

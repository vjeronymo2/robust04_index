			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH TIDES, WINDS AND COLD PROMISE UNUSUAL WEEKEND  </P> <P> Mother Nature is pulling out all the stops this weekend in Orange County.  </P> <P> In addition to bone-chilling cold predicted by late Saturday, the county also  will be buffeted by some of the highest tides of the year.  </P> <P> The annual alignment of sun and moon will bring tides averaging 7.3 feet,  starting Friday and culminating Monday. Tides could reach as high as 10 feet in  some areas, weather forecasters said.  </P> <P> The cold weather coming in will add to that spectacle, forecasters said. The  Arctic storm could bring winds up to 25 m.p.h. by Sunday, and that could make  for monster waves on Orange County beaches, according to forecasters.  </P> <P> "The winds will be adding a couple of feet to already high tides, and that  could make for waves 9 or 10 feet tall," said Steve Burback, a meteorologist  with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> "December tends to have the highest tides of the year (for the Orange County  area) because of the alignment of sun and moon. The tides will start going up  Friday and will peak on Monday, then start going down again."  </P> <P> Burback noted that Orange County also had tides averaging 7.3 feet on Dec. 2.  The tide forecast for Monday -- New Year's Eve -- thus matches the Dec. 2 event  as the twin highest tides of the year in the county, he said.  </P> <P> Monday night also will feature the second full moon in the same month, Burback  said. "When you have two full moons in the same month, the second one is called  a blue moon," he said. "I'm not sure why it's called that."  </P> <P> Patty Schooley, parks district supervisor for the county's Environmental  Management Agency, said, "The weather forecast provided to us calls for short  periods of waves 6 to 8 feet high during the high-tide period."  </P> <P> Schooley said that short periods of waves that high pose no serious threat, but  she added that the Environmental Management Agency nonetheless has alerted its  rangers about possible problems from high surf over the weekend.  </P> <P> "We're not anticipating problems, but we'll be prepared," said Schooley.  </P> <P> Sgt. Tom Wallstrom of the Harbor Patrol office at Newport Beach said that he  does not expect waves high enough to cause serious problems this weekend.  </P> <P> "The (annual) high tides are nothing by themselves," he said. "It's only when  they come with a strong wind that they can cause some problems."  </P> <P> According to WeatherData, a mass of cold Arctic air moving south toward  Southern California will drop temperatures into the 20s by Monday. Burback  predicted that winds accompanying the cold front will be out of the northwest  and will range from 15 to 25 m.p.h. "You'll see some pretty good waves coming  on shore," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHEN HIGH TIDES WILL HIT  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:2.11IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Time  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Height  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Today  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5:37 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.3 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Saturday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7:13 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.8 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sunday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7:13 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.1 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8:02 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.3 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tuesday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8:50 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.2 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wednesday  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9:37 a.m.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.8 feet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Source: WeatherData, Inc.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Ukrainian deputies cautious on N-arms accord The Ukrainian parliament yesterday adopted a carefully worded resolution which supported President Leonid Kravchuk's nuclear diplomacy, but delayed ratification of treaties to rid Ukraine of its nuclear arsenal. The brief, two-point resolution called for 'exchanging instruments of (Start-1) ratification after concrete agreements have been reached,' referring to the still unfinished or 'secret' accompanying agreements on financial compensation, dismantlement aid and security guarantees. The MPs stressed the need for these further agreements even though, in their apparently contradictory resolution, they officially renounced the 13 conditions set on their controversial ratification of Start-1 last November. Only three weeks ago, the trilateral agreement with Russia and the US was heralded as an 'historic breakthrough' which would dismantle the world's third largest nuclear arsenal. Mr Kravchuk, who has staked his reputation on the trilateral accord, began with an impassioned appeal to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. He said this would avoid 'international isolation'. Later the president explained that parliament's main concerns would be fulfilled by the government in subsequent negotiations with Russia and the US. But parliamentarians wanted to see the compensation and security details before signalling final approval. The parliament was only presented with Mr Kravchuk's public agreement signed with Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin on January 14. According to this agreement, Ukraine is to ship over 1,600 nuclear warheads to Russia, where uranium would be extracted and then sold by the US. US officials have estimated that Ukraine would earn Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) from these uranium sales. The parliament wanted to know precise details of the agreement, wary that it has still not got compensation for the over 2,000 short-range nuclear weapons it transferred to Russia in 1992. Deputies also wanted to ensure their atomic power stations, which produce a third of the energy-starved country's electricity, would be supplied with uranium. Shortages of nuclear fuel could shut down part of the Chernobyl nuclear power station within a week and Ukraine's four other plants within months.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Beijing faces tax revenue shortfall China's revenues are likely to fall short of budget forecasts this year, suggesting a larger than expected deficit and making it harder for the government to ease tight credit restrictions. Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, said that while a new tax regime was functioning well, tax revenues had not met expectations. 'Despite the high revenue growth, the income collected during the first six months of the year was less than the projected amount,' he told a meeting in Beijing on finance and taxation. China's new tax regime, which came into effect at the start of the year, provides for fresh sharing arrangements between the centre and the provinces. It included a new value added tax. Western economists in Beijing said the complex tax reforms were highly ambitious and it seemed the authorities were encountering difficulties in implementing them. One official noted government revenues, which grew by 22.6 per cent in the first six months, were barely keeping up with inflation. China reported that cost of living increases in 35 main cities were up by 22.7 per cent in June compared with the same month last year. Retail inflation was about 20 per cent. Mr Liu told China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in March that China's budget deficit this year would reach Yn66.9bn (Pounds 5bn) but total obligations, including debt service, would exceed Yn100bn. Mr Liu disclosed that national monthly revenue averaged Yn33bn in the six months to June, well below budget forecasts. An average of Yn46.4bn would be required for the rest of the year to enable the government to meet its revenue targets. 'This would be very difficult to achieve since the highest monthly average had been Yn39.1bn in June,' Mr Liu said. He blamed 'tax evasion' and 'delayed tax payment' for some of the government's budgetary difficulties.</p>

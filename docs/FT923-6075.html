			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Bundesbank member stirs fears over EMS MR Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, yesterday sent nervous ripples through the exchange markets when he suggested that there was 'potential for realignment' in the European Monetary System (EMS). The remarks, contained in the advance text of a speech in Dusseldorf, sparked a flurry of D-Mark purchases in the morning by prompting speculation that an EMS shake-up might be in the offing. In view of the morning frisson, when he held the speech in the early afternoon at a securities market conference, Mr Jochimsen excised the passage hinting at the need for realignment. This allowed the Bundesbank to issue a statement later denying that the central bank was seeking a realignment. By then the damage had been done. Mr Jochimsen's comments in the text effectively negated the effect of large-scale Bank of England support for the pound in early European trading. Mr Jochimsen, the president of the state central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, is one of the most outspoken members of the council. His remarks added to the feeling among some currency dealers that the Bundesbank might be following a 'hidden agenda' of trying to provoke a realignment. Such a policy would be in outright opposition to the declared stance of Britain and France, which are trying to stave off any risk of a currency adjustment for a mixture of political and economic reasons. Currency dealers know the Bundesbank cannot possibly admit that it favours policies compounding the problems of the EMS. But its high interest rate policies of the last year, by adding to the constraints faced by the other members of the system, have added to the political hurdles confronting the EC's plan for economic and monetary union - a project the Bundesbank regards with well-known antipathy. Mr Jochimsen yesterday appeared taken aback by the interpretation put on his speech by the exchange markets. He has, however, earned a reputation during the past year or so for challenging the mainstream policy line of the Bundesbank's Frankfurt directorate. Last year he particularly irritated Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, for his opposition to the Bundesbank's plan to reduce the number of regional central bank presidents on the council. He was also the first council member to criticise the Maastricht deal on economic and monetary union agreed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl with EC leaders last December. On the basic question of an EMS realignment, the Bundesbank has made clear for some time that it would not oppose a currency adjustment if currencies within the system came very close to their D-Mark floors. Mr Jochimsen himself, however, does not believe that a realignment will take place during the three weeks leading up to the French referendum on September 20. Above all, the German government is at present opposed to a D-Mark revaluation. The Bundesbank believes that some currencies - above all, the lira - are overvalued. It is also concerned about the possible need to buy large quantities of foreign exchange if the present EMS unrest turns into a full-scale crisis. The liquidity created by such intervention would place a fresh obstacle in the path of the Bundesbank's efforts to lower the growth in money supply. In past years, when faced with a conflict of interest between curbing speculative inflows from abroad and submitting to pressure for a revaluation, the Bundesbank has invariably used its influence to press successfully for revaluation.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Troubled background for Buba AN ATTACK on currency speculation came from the Irish finance minister; one on the Bundesbank from Spain after its credit rating was placed under review; borrowing plans to shore up the Italian economy were promulgated; and the focus of currency speculation turned back to sterling again. All this formed a troubled background to German speculation that the Bundesbank will cut rates again after its council meeting today, writes Our Markets Staff. Dealers there expect squalls if the rate cut does not happen. FRANKFURT, meanwhile, picked up on the speculation and the rise in bunds to close with the DAX index 17.67 higher at 1,484.03, although German market turnover was still said to be thin. Bank shares made the most of the story, Deutsche Bank gaining DM7.50 marks at DM640.50, Commerzbank, helped by UK orders, DM9 to DM239 and Dresdner Bank DM8.50 to DM351. Elsewhere, carmakers regained lost ground. Volkswagen, which fell sharply earlier this week after a news magazine forecast heavy operating losses for 1992, recovered DM6.70 to DM281.90; BMW rose DM5.50 to DM471 and Daimler added DM6 at DM564.50. MADRID suffered further as Moody's, the US credit ratings agency, said that it was reviewing the rating of Spain's foreign currency debt. The general index closed down 6.94 at 186.01 while the Ibex was 3.7 per cent lower. Since the devaluation of the peseta the market has been weakening with fears that there may have to be a further cut to increase the competitiveness of the economy. Utilities have come under pressure because of the extent of their exposure to foreign currency debt. Yesterday Fecsa was Pta59 weaker at Pta524 and Sevillana lost Pta21 to Pta394. Mr Victor Galliano, analyst at Baring Securities in London, commented that there was likely to be some bargain-hunting as the general index enters the 180 level but that 'as long as the currency remains vulnerable one will see no support from foreign institutions'. PARIS fell on some disappointing interim results with the CAC-40 index shedding 12.73 to 1,724.00 in turnover of FFr2.09bn. Pernod Ricard lost more than 9 per cent following the release after Wednesday's close of half year earnings which came in at the lower end of expectations. The drinks group also forecast that net profit growth will be limited to 6 per cent for the full year, due to fluctuations on foreign exchange markets and a decline in domestic sales. The shares lost FFr38.00 or 8.45 per cent to FFr411.50. Alcatel Alsthom was another loser on the day following poor interim figures. The telecoms and engineering group closed FFr6 lower at FFr626. Peugeot lost ground ahead of results which came out just after the close, ending down FFr20 or 3.6 per cent at FFr524. Eurotunnel went against the trend on Wednesday's news that it had been successful in an arbitration case against Transmanche Link. It closed up 30 centimes at FFr36.70. ZURICH tapped into the German interest rate speculation and this, together with a decline in Swiss interest rates late in the session, left the SMI index 6.9 higher at 1,885.2. Banks reflected the theme, SBC registered rising SFr3 to SFr268. On Wednesday, Salomon Brothers said that SBC was inexpensive; a hedge against the dollar's weakness; and a beneficiary of lower European interest rates. AMSTERDAM featured a new all time low of Fl 12.60 in DAF, ahead of a brief suspension as the truck maker clarified its financial position. The group said that it was near to agreeing a Fl 210m loan from banks, and closed Fl 2.00 down at Fl 13.20. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.4 to 110.5. KLM recovered after denying reports that it planned further cost cuts and the shares lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 25.90. MILAN tried to rally on the government's final approval of a L93,000bn package of budget cuts for 1993, but a sharp fall in Montedison weighed upon the market, where the Comit index closed 0.54 lower at 363.10. Montedison's move from profit to loss in the first half of 1992 left the shares L69, or 6 per cent down at an official close of L1,076, and another L36 lower at L1,040 on the kerb. Ferruzzi Finanziaria, which controls Montedison, dropped 9.3 per cent to L1,038. Generali moved against the trend, gaining L320 at L25,150 on strong foreign buying interest; and the retailer, Rinascente, put on 5.8 per cent to L3,739 on speculation that it might be sold by the Agnelli group to finance the Fiat expansion programme. COPENHAGEN firmed again, writes Hilary Barnes, led by industrials and shipping shares as the all-share index rose by 1.55 to 64.34. Novo Nordisk put on DKr6 to close at DKr518, Danisco was ahead by DKr13 to Dkr628, and Baltica continued Wednesday's recovery with a rise of DKr15 to DKr230. Codan, the insurance company among potential contenders to take over the insurance divisions of the collapsed Hafnia group, fell DKr150 to DKr3,700. OSLO majored on shipping, the sector index rising by 4.85 per cent to 285.20 with Bergesen B NKr5 higher at 80.5. The all-share index rose 8.74 points, or 2.65 per cent to 338.62 in active trading worth NKr329.6m. In HELSINKI, the bank and finance company index jumped 11.85 as the Hex rose 14.2, or 2.3 per cent to 625.8.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - OCT 1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     11.30am  12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close  1005.29  1005.26  1004.90  1007.24  1007.87  1008.75  1006.11  1006.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High 1010.41          Day's Low 1004.39  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Sep 30      Sep 29      Sep 28      Sep 25      Sep 24       1003.44     1009.98     1016.40     1035.63     1041.31  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

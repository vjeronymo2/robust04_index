			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks unties golden share The government's golden share in Mersey Docks and Harbour was converted into a 10p ordinary share by yesterday's annual meeting, severing lines of control dating from 1970. The golden share entitled the government to appoint three directors and demand day-to-day management accounts. It was a legacy of the collapse of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board 24 years ago, when it defaulted on its bonds, forcing a government rescue. In practice, the golden share has not been exercised in any form since 1989, when the company was restructured after the government wrote off more than Pounds 100m of debts. The government's sole connection with Mersey Docks now is as its biggest shareholder, but it intends to sell eventually. The annual report shows its holding was diluted from 20 to 13.9 per cent in last year's rights issue, launched to help fund Mersey's takeover of the Medway ports. The stake is worth about Pounds 56m at present, prompting speculation that the government may be holding on until the shares are more valuable than the written-off debts. The effect then would be to transfer the cost of modernising Liverpool docks from public funds to the stock market. Shareholders questioned the sudden resignation last week of Mr Peter Vincent, the Medway chief executive, especially since his name was still on the printed agenda for re-election as a director. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said Mr Vincent's reasons were personal. He also confirmed that Mersey Docks would not be affected by litigation over the price of 250p each which Mr Vincent paid for Medway shares that were later valued at more than Pounds 37 in the takeover. Mr Waddell said first-quarter trading results were up to expectations and the company was well on its way to replacing Medway turnover lost as a result of a discontinued ferry service to the Netherlands.</p>

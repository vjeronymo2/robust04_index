			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Accounting salaries lose ground GRADUATE starting salaries in accountancy are falling increasingly behind those in other professions, while the pay of newly qualified chartered accountants actually declined last year, according to a survey of London firms released yesterday. The median salary of an accountancy student in inner London was up 3.4 per cent at Pounds 11,200 in 1991, compared with a rise of 8.7 per cent to Pounds 12,500 for a typical graduate recruit throughout industry and commerce, according to the annual survey by Casis, the recruitment arm of the London Society of Chartered Accountants. The median salary of newly qualified accountants fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 20,000 for small firms in inner London, and was flat at Pounds 22,000 for medium-size firms. It rose by 0.4 per cent to Pounds 22,600 among larger firms. Firms projected a 3.4 per cent increase in starting salaries for 1992 among accountancy firms, compared with an average increase in graduate salaries of 4 per cent across all employers. All but 2 per cent of new recruits to the accountancy firms are graduates. The vast majority of firms based increases in student salaries on market rates. Just over half offer three weeks annual holiday.</p>

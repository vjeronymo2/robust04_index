			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Glendale 28, Ventura 14: John Cicuto's first season as head coach of the  Glendale football team ended on a positive note as his recently struggling  Vaqueros knocked off Ventura, 28-14, in a WSC game at Glendale High.  </P> <P> "Coach has been telling us all season, 'Play every game like it's your last,' "  Glendale quarterback Ronnie Lopez said. "But we didn't.  </P> <P> "Once the last game came, we did."  </P> <P> Glendale (5-4-1, 5-3-1) beat a Ventura team that began the season 7-0, but lost  its last three games to finish 7-3 overall and 6-3 in the conference.  </P> <P> Glendale's defense played an inspired game, limiting the Pirates to just 30  yards passing and 178 yards of total offense.  </P> <P> Sophomore running back Sean Hampton rushed for a game-high 97 yards in 14  carries and scored two touchdowns to lead Glendale, which rolled up 440 yards."  </P> <P> "It's a relief to win because we knew we could do it all season," Hampton said.  "There's a lot of pressure to win because of the school's tradition. We finally  came together. That's a good way for all the sophomores to leave."  </P> <P> Glendale, which had surrendered 52 first-quarter points during losses to  Moorpark and Santa Barbara the past two weeks, beat Ventura by overcoming a  14-0 first-quarter deficit that resulted from two Vaquero turnovers.  </P> <P> Glendale closed the lead to 14-10 at halftime on a 24-yard field goal by David  Bowen and Hampton's six-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Bowen's 27-yard field goal in the third quarter brought Glendale to within  14-13 before the Vaqueros scored what proved to be the game-winning touchdown  on a 32-yard pass from Lopez to wide receiver Danny Perez with 1:50 left in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> Hampton scored Glendale's final touchdown when he raced 18 yards with 5:02  left.

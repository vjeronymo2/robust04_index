			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / US jobless rate falls as economy gains strength A FALL in US unemployment to 7.1 per cent, the lowest level in a year, yesterday indicated that faster growth in the economy is beginning to dent high levels of joblessness. A White House spokeswoman welcomed the figures but noted that the jobless rate was still higher than at the end of the recession in the first half of 1991. President Bill Clinton believed it was still necessary to 'kick-start' the economy because of the relatively slow pace of job creation, she said. On Wall Street, the figures and residual bullishness from the cut in German rates pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 25.4 points to another record high of 3,442.14. The January unemployment rate compares with levels of 7.3 per cent in December and a peak of 7.7 per cent last June, the labour department reported. Adult male unemployment fell particularly sharply last month, to 6.4 per cent against 6.8 per cent in December. In another sign of economic strength, the length of the average working week in manufacturing industry rose from 41.2 to 41.4 hours - the highest level in more than 25 years. The pace of job creation, however, is still relatively subdued. Non-farm employment rose by 106,000 to 108.8m last month, roughly in line with analysts' projections, but only about a third to a half of the monthly increase registered in previous recoveries. The sluggish job creation is occurring in spite of a clutch of economic indicators pointing to an acceleration of economic growth. The discrepancy reflects rapid increases in output per worker. US productivity rose 2.7 per cent last year, the biggest increase for 20 years. Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the employment report was stronger than it looked. The proportion of industrial sectors reporting higher employment had risen sharply in the past three months, suggesting that the recovery was becoming more firmly established. There had also been an encouraging decline in the numbers of workers forced to work part-time as opposed to full-time. Sectors registering employment gains last month included manufacturing, transport and the retail and wholesale trades. However, construction employment fell 37,000 last month. US stocks, Page 19</p>

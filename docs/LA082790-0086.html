All 120 employees will be offered the opportunity to move, says Univision's  director of operations, Tony Oquendo, but he expects that only 90 will head  East. One reason for the move, he says, is the earlier time zone: "Broadcasting  to the entire country is very difficult when you're three hours behind." Lanie  Jones and Lily Eng  </P></p>

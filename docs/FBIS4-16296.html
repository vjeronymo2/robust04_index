			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Union of December  12 (LDU) in parliament and former finance minister Boris Fedorov  speaking in Moscow has outlined LDU's priorities. He said LDU  must set sensible tasks, avoid giving hollow promises, wage a  resolute campaign for national interests and move to prosperity  by transforming the country's political and economic systems.  He said LDU was a group of 26 independent deputies representing  different parts of the country rather than being "an elitist  Moscow club".    One other LDU leader Irina Khakamada said the faction's name  was intended to help form its political image and reflect its  determination to merge social and market reforms with a thrust  towards the individual rather than talking about the abstract  models of a so-called market economy.    On the political front, LDU is opposed to the hardliners'  call for an early presidential election and prepared instead to  back up the idea of a coalition government provided it is  committed to further market reforms, democracy and a socially  oriented state. LDU will not oppose the government while there  is a chance for further constructive reforms, but any government  without a social basis and majority in parliament is doomed, its  platform says.    Among its potential allies, the group has named the  Gaydar-led Russia's Choice Party and the Yavlinskiy-led faction  though it is ready to cooperate with Women of Russia group and  to hold an open dialogue with all pro-democracy movements.    At the same time, it says the name of the Zhirinovskiy-led  Liberal Democratic Party does not reflect the substance and  activity of the LDP leadership which brings nothing but disgrace  to Russia. LDU says some support that LDP enjoys on the ground  is evidence of a power crisis and lack of coherent political  priorities in the country.    On the economic front, LDU's priorities include financial  stabilization, a 1-3 percent inflation rate in 1994, a sensible  budget, a one-off 15-25 percent tax cut to spur up business  activity, reduction of the amount and types of taxation and  government support for state companies yielding to modernization  and work efficiency.    In foreign policy, LDU calls for a G-8 with Russian  participation and Russia's reunification with Belarus and  Ukraine following referendums there. However, LDU is opposed to  what it calls "an absurd unification of monetary systems".  Fedorov attacked the recent monetary merger between Moscow and  Minsk calling the decision incompetent. He said economic  integration must follow trade and customs unions as it was done  in Western Europe but not start with a monetary union. In his  view, unification must take place on all fronts with clear  understanding of the purpose and price to be paid for it.</p>

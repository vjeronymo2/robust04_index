			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood loss deepens WATERFORD Wedgwood, the Irish group formed by the 1986 merger of the crystal and china companies, announced pre-tax losses for 1990 of IPounds 21.4m (Pounds 19.37m), compared to a IPounds 20.6m deficit in the previous year. In spite of the gloomy figures, the group said that there was a 'significant improvement' in operations in the second half and that there were now positive signs of recovery in overall performance. Mr Howard Kilroy, chairman, said that the group was now 'well positioned to benefit from any recovery in the economic environment'. The announcement highlighted the improvement in operating profits in the second half - up to IPounds 9.7m (IPounds 347,000). Group debt had also been dramatically reduced from IPounds 125m to IPounds 38m. The cut in debt was mainly brought about through the IPounds 80m injected into the company last March by a consortium led by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Ireland-born head of the Heinz food conglomerate, and Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The consortium now holds a 30 per cent stake in the Waterford Wedgwood group. Mr Bob Davies, group finance director, said that the recent performance of the company had been encouraging considering the problems caused by the Gulf war and the consequent downturn in tourism, plus the impact of the weakness of the dollar. (The US accounts for between 60 and 70 per cent of the company's total crystal sales and about 15 per cent of its china sales). There was also an estimated IPounds 10m loss as a result of the 14-week strike at the Waterford crystal plant in the middle of last year. 'I would express cautious optimism about group performance in the future,' said Mr Davies, though he conceded that sales had been difficult in the first quarter of this year. Total sales in 1990 were IPounds 307.9m (IPounds 349.1m). Losses per share emerged at 4.29p (6.56p). Once again the Wedgwood side performed well but the crystal operation still made losses. Wedgwood had operating profits of IPounds 17.7m (IPounds 16.3m), while Waterford suffered an operating loss of IPounds 5m (IPounds 21.3m). The group warned that in spite of new worker agreements at Waterford and reductions in production costs, further action was still needed before the crystal division could return to profitability. Alongside the results, the group also announced that a syndicate of banks - reported to be led by Bank of Ireland and National Westminster Bank - have agreed to provide loan facilities of Pounds 105m. It is believed that a large part of the loan will be invested in the Wedgwood china division.</p>

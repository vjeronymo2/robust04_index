			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Mayhew says poll was peace mandate Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday claimed that last week's European elections had given London a democratic mandate for pressing ahead with efforts to forge a lasting political settlement for Northern Ireland. Speaking on the eve of today's intergovernmental conference between British and Irish ministers in Dublin, the Northern Ireland secretary told MPs that more Ulster voters had voted for candidates 'supportive of or acquiescent in' the Downing Street declaration than for candidates who opposed it. Last week's poll was topped by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who chose to run his campaign as a referendum on the joint declaration. But his majority over Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, was much reduced. Mr Paisley nevertheless claimed earlier this week that he had achieved what he set out to do and said he had requested an urgent meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister. Today's conference, which will be attended by both Sir Patrick and Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, is expected seek progress on a framework agreement which it is hoped will be complete by mid-July.</p>

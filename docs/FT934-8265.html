			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline active There was a two-way tussle over SmithKline Beecham yesterday as a critical press article vied with good news about one of the company's products. The stock was under pressure on a selective piece of broker comment, highlighted in a Sunday newspaper article, which suggested a split between Mr Bob Bauman, the chief executive, and Mr Jan Leschly, the chairman. However, many pharmaceuticals analysts felt that any difference of opinion had been exaggerated beyond the bounds of credibility. One seasoned observer said: 'Undoubtedly they have a different background and different personalities, but I am completely confident that they have not had a rift.' Helping the stock was a statement from the company saying that trials comparing SmithKline's anti-nausea compound Kytril with Zofran, the rival product from Glaxo, showed Kytril was more effective and popular with patients. Glaxo was further affected by weekend reports that the company had sacked members of its sales force following an internal investigation into mishandling of the company's funds. The shares lost 12 to 642p. SmithKline 'A' finished 6 1/2 lower at 402p ex-dividend.</p>

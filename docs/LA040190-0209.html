			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNFAIR CONCLUSIONS  </P> <P> Your article about the visit by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to Laguna Canyon  (Reporter's Notebook, March 11) contains inaccuracies that lead the reader to  unfair conclusions. You wrote, "But no one had asked for Cranston's help in  resolving the dispute, and many found it strange that a U.S. senator would make  a special trip to Laguna Beach just to see the site of an obscure housing  development."  </P> <P> Error No. 1: The city of Laguna Beach, the Laguna Canyon Conservancy and  Democratic activists have been soliciting Cranston's help with this issue for  at least two years. A decade ago, Cranston co-sponsored a bill that would have  created a national park that would have included Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> Error No. 2: On a previous visit to discuss offshore oil issues, the senator  listened to a full presentation on the canyon, complete with maps. A follow-up  public visit to the canyon with those involved seems to be a natural.  </P> <P> Error No. 3: This is no "obscure housing development" to those of us who know  and love Laguna Canyon. On Nov. 11, 8,000 Orange County residents made history  by walking in Laguna Canyon to protest that housing development.  </P> <P> "What good came of it at last?" The wheels of government turn slowly. But today  the Irvine Co., city officials and environmental groups are sitting together at  the negotiating table to work out a way for the people of Orange County to buy  Laguna Canyon. Cranston's environmental aide, Cathy Lacey, is pursuing the  possibility of Fish and Wildlife funding since the Canyon has the only two  natural lakes in Orange County and a vernal pool.  </P> <P> Cranston's trip to Laguna Canyon may have been the critical turning point in  our campaign to preserve this incredible wilderness area for Orange County  residents forever.  </P> <P> LIDA LENNEY, Mayor  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

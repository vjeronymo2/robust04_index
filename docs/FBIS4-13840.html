			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 23, IRNA -- A rally staged by Tehran  university students outside the U.N. office here in protest at  its performance in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Saturday afternoon turned  violent when the marchers began to throw stones and eggs at the  office.    Some windows of the U.N. office have been broken and riot  police are now trying to prevent the demonstrators from entering  the building.    In the course of their rally on Tehran streets, thousands of  students chanted slogans, condemning the silence of the United  Nations and other international bodies on the massacre of  Bosnian Muslims.    The marchers strongly condemned the double standard policy  of  the United Nations and certain Western countries towards  international issues, calling for a halt to the crimes being  committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The angry demonstrators also burned the U.S. flag in front  of  the U.N. office.    The marchers, mostly wearing shroud, announced their  readiness for a rapid dispatch to Bosnia and helping the brave  defenders of Gorazde.    In a press release the marchers said the only way to end the  clashes is practical coordination of the Islamic countries for  the quick dispatch of forces to Bosnia.    "What is going on in Bosnia is also in line with the tragic  policies of the global imperialism and international Zionism  towards Palestine, Lebanon, Kashmir, Tajikistan and other  Islamic countries," the marchers said.    Meanwhile, Bosnian Ambassador to Tehran Omar Bahman  appreciated the people for their massive presence in the rally,  and said resistance of the Bosnian Muslims is indebted to the  cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    "The enemy is strong, but we will continue to resist," he  said, adding that the Bosnian people were victims of a horrible  crime which was unprecedented in the history.    In another development, the Islamic Association of the  Iranian Students in Moscow condemned the massacre of the  oppressed people of Gorazde by the racist Serbs, and castigated  the silence of the international circles and the United Nations  towards the issue.    "If the world continues its silence, and the Muslims world  does not rise up, the Serbs will totally occupy  Bosnia-Herzegovina and kill all Muslims in that country with the  help of the arms of the former Yugoslavia," said the association  in a statement.</p>

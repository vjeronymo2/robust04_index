			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Klaus-Peter </F> Siegloch in Bonn on 20 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, can one give the all-clear  signal this evening? In other words, have the Serbs completely  withdrawn their heavy artillery?    [Kinkel] No, we cannot give the all-clear signal, nor do we  know what things will be like when the ultimatum expires. The  Serbs are withdrawing, but they are having problems with the  weather. We have to wait and see. NATO is ready to carry out  air strikes. We all hope that air strikes will not be necessary.    [Siegloch] One can, at least, say one thing -- the  ultimatum, which, for the first time, was a serious threat to  the Serbs, has had a certain success. Most of the guns have  been withdrawn by now. One now wonders: The fighting in other  Bosnian towns, such as in Bihac and Tuzla, continues. The  fighting is continuing with greater intensity than before. Does  one not have to pose a similar ultimatum and say: Fighting must  finally stop there as well?    [Kinkel] We deliberately tried to pick out Sarajevo, as pars  pro toto, so to speak, as a part that speaks for all, and  because the situation in Sarajevo is particularly tragic and  bad. However, you are naturally right -- Sarajevo is only part  of the terrible military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia,  and, indeed, fighting is more intensive than ever around Bihac  and Tuzla. Therefore, after Sarajevo, one will have to think  about what can be done in these other towns. The question is  justified and must be answered.    [Siegloch] There are reports that there may soon be a summit  on Bosnia, which will be attended by Clinton, Yeltsin, and  Chancellor Kohl. What is true about these reports?    [Kinkel] Well, it is certainly correct that, in particular,  the political solution, which is and must still be striven for  by everyone, has made progress as a result of recent  developments, also because of the Russian help, because of the  Russian influence on the Serbian side. We must use this  political momentum, which has been initiated now.    Therefore, next Tuesday [22 February], the political  directors of Russia, the United States, the European states that  are involved, and the United Nations will meet here in Bonn to  think about how we can progress with this process, this European  action plan, on which the Americans have now gratifyingly  concentrated very strongly, too. Then we will wait and see what  is going to happen after this directors' conference -- perhaps  there will be further political conferences, but this cannot yet  be said definitely.    [Siegloch] What is the role of the Germans in these talks?  Are we some kind of mediators?    [Kinkel] Well, in particular, if military issues are  involved, we should exercise restraint because we are a bad  adviser in these matters due to our constitutional and our  historic situation. However, we have a very essential mediating  role. I played this role at the troika talks of the European  Union last Friday. The chancellor has played this role through  his many telephone conversations. We, together with the  Americans, are involved most strongly in the humanitarian sphere  and, by holding this conference on Tuesday, we are showing our  good role as mediators. We have particularly good relations  with the Croats and the Muslims -- that means, with two of the  parties involved in the conflict -- and we want to make good use  of that.    [Siegloch] Mr. Foreign Minister, do you think that we will  be able to adhere to this military restraint of ours for a long  time, or do we not at least have to show in one field -- by  sending paramedics to Bosnia, for instance -- that the Germans  want to get more directly involved?    [Kinkel] Well, we have already gotten involved in many areas  -- in Cambodia, in Iraq, and we got involved in Somalia.  However, we still have this constitutional brake, which, if  maintained, will harm Germany. I say this as foreign minister  and, therefore, here and now, I once again call on the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to give up its blockade. We  must become able to act in foreign policy. For that, we need  the amendment to the Constitution, and I can only say that the  SPD must participate in that, especially if it wants to become  capable of ruling.    [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.</p>

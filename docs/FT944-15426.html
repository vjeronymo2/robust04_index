			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI strong Chemicals leader ICI outperformed the leading share index smartly on a combination of positive press comment and analysts' recommendations. Initially, the shares spiked higher as one newspaper argued that any softening of commodity prices in the US would be irrelevant to European chemicals groups because of the low levels of the exports to the US. Then, securities houses UBS and Hoare Govett stressed their positive view of the stock. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare said: 'Given the forward momentum of earnings recovery the cyclical rating has scope to expand upward.' Even NatWest Securities, which has a more downbeat view of the stock, anticipates 'sparkling' third-quarter figures on October 27, given the 'dramatic product price increases coming through in petrochemicals, plastics and some bulk inorganic chemicals'. A rash of cheap buying after last week's weakness saw the shares recover 25 1/2 to 818p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 29 Apr (EFE) -- The Uruguayan Episcopal  Conference today disseminated a document warning politicians of  "dangerous divisions in leadership" and of the difficulties  created in taking dynamism away from government work.    The bishops issued a document entitled "Values, Base of Our  Development," asking candidates in the 29 November elections to  issue "proposals and programs with clarity and sincerity."    According to the bishops, the "positive economic indicators"  have not reached the country's poor.    The document was signed by all bishops. It was the result of  a compromise between different Church groups in one of the most  secular countries in Latin America.    The Church's political weight is quite small in Uruguay, a  country with an entrenched liberal tradition.    This situation is made clear by the total lack of weight of  a  political party with Catholic traditions and the great number of  agnostic and lay candidates.    The bishops' declaration does not side with any party or  candidate, but warns that "the internal logic of Uruguayan  electoral democracy carries an ethical commitment involving all  participating groups and individuals to accept and help the  candidate gaining the most votes, even after reasonable  compromises and agreements are closed, to be able to implement  the program chosen by the people."    The bishops pointed out that the electoral year "is an  occasion to meditate together about our country and to put the  election at the service of common good."    The document asks for "a review of the public education  system, to guarantee respect for all family heads," insisting on  the need for a pluralistic public school system, a school system  that is secular for laymen, Catholic for Catholics, and Jewish  for Jewish people.    The document concludes by reiterating "the decisive  importance of human life's ethical and spiritual dimension,  which is the solid foundation upon which all structures of  coexistence are based: family as well as political, juridical,  economic, social, labor, and cultural organizations, in all  their manifestations."</p>

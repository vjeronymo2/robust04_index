			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Banco Santander Madrid seems to have been overcome with nerves in marking Banco Santander down by more than 8 per cent this week. The bank has been obliged to post a Pta8bn bond against possible fines and tax charges on transactions going back to the late 1980s, but the amount is little more than 10 per cent of last year's net income. Santander could meet the sum out of general reserves without any serious effect on its remarkably strong tier 1 capital ratio of 9.4 per cent. It may take some time to establish definitively whether withholding tax should have been paid on credits assigned by the bank to third parties. Assignment was once a widespread practice among Spanish banks. By taking loans off the balance sheet, they were not only spared expensive reserve requirements; their capital also went further. The Bank of Spain clamped down in 1989, though, so Santander has not been dependent on this lucrative practice for its recent profits. The greater worry is that Santander has been singled out for political reasons. Its aggressive growth ambitions have aroused the jealousy of its peers. The case is an embarrassment which may cause the pace of innovation - it is now trying to introduce securitised mortgages - to slow. The share price may be vulnerable while the affair drags on. In the longer term that may prove to be a buying opportunity.</p>

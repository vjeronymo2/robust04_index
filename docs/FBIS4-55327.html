			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic </F> and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak by unidentified  announcer in Zagreb on 11 May; from the "Picture Versus Picture"  program -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] I am pleased to welcome Kresimir Zubak [Bosnian  Croat leader] and [Croatian Foreign Minister] Mate Granic to our  studio. Mr. Zubak, let me start by asking you about the four  agreements that have been reached. The first agreement is about  the president of the future Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  who will be a Croatian. Will you be the first president of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Zubak] Well, we did not discuss the persons who will be  president, for instance the vice president, but we agreed that a  Croatian will be the president during the first six months of  the transitional period. According to the transitional  provisions of the Federation's constitution, the constitution  should be implemented within a period of six months. However,  it is obvious that this period is too short and we are already  behind schedule as far as the election of the Federation's  president is concerned. We were supposed to elect the president  of the Federation within 30 days but we did not reach a  political agreement and that period was prolonged. Everything  should be implemented within six months, but realistically this  period will last a bit longer. However, we agreed that a  Croatian would be the president over the initial six months. If  the constitution of the Federation is not entirely implemented  within this period, then the next president will be a  Bosniak-Muslim.    We also agreed that the first president during the period  after the Federal elections should be a Bosniak-Muslim. I would  like to say that we signed the drafts of the documents today,  and that the documents will we verified and signed as draft  agreements on Saturday 14 May in Geneva. In this form of  proposals, they will be offered for adoption to the  constitutional parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] I would like to ask Croatian Foreign Minister  Granic: What is your impression of this latest map of the  internal political organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Does it  appear to you that a good political compromise has been reached?    [Granic] A very good compromise; it is a huge step forward  in  the implementation of the Washington agreement. It is also a  just one. This is a compromise that paves the way ahead. It  benefits the Bosniak as well as the Croatian people, it benefits  the federation. It also benefits our future confederal  partners, the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia, as  well as the whole world, has a great deal of interest in the  materialization of this agreement. I can say, for example, that  the United States' Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher  phoned several times during the day to ask about our progress.  In any case, the agreement was met with a great deal of  interest and satisfaction. All the more so, since it took place  before Friday, before the talks in Geneva. Many things are  clearer now.    [Announcer] I would like you to comment on the statement we  heard tonight made by U.S. special envoy Redman, according to  which the talks yielded a different result from what had been  expected, but that this result is better.    [Granic] This refers to the formation of cantons six and  seven, as they surely speed up the organization of the  Federation. This is a great step forward. This obliterates  some problems; for example, it is going to be far easier for the  EU [European Union] to take over the town of Mostar. There will  no longer be [word indistinct] problems. The EU intends to  restore the town fast, to revive its life, to return its  refugees. It will of course be the center of the canton, as Mr.  Zubak said. Hence the fact that this agreement has been reached  is of exceptional importance for Croatia. One should bear in  mind that now policies will be coordinated. This is something  which is already being carried out, not only as regards some  individual current issues such as communications, refugees, and  education, but many strategic issues, too.    [Announcer] Mr Zubak, these eight cantons we have seen, do  they constitute those 58 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's  territory with which the Croat-Muslim-Bosniak side jointly  embarks on negotiations with the Serbian side.    [Zubak] This percentage does not include...[pauses] This  also  includes the area of the city of Sarajevo, about 3 percent of  territory. Its special status ought to be under UN  administration. Hence, the cantons account for 55 percent.    [Announcer] Apart from these four agreements, is there any  agreement now on, is there a firm approach to negotiations with  the Serbian side?    [Zubak] As you can see, having established the agreement on  the external borders of the federation we departed from the  following principle: In those areas where the Bosniak and the  Croatian people are in the majority, they are really and  objectively entitled to demand that those areas should be within  our future commom state, our federation. We drafted such a  territorial organization of the federation, which includes 58  percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the proviso  that it should be pointed out that not even this covers all  those areas where these two peoples are in the absolute majority.    Let's take the example of Bijeljina: In total the Croatian  and Bosniak population is in the majority, but these people have  not been included in the federation.    [Announcer] Let's go back again to the second agreement out  of the four, the agreement on the government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will be headed by a prime minister from  the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, and out of its 17  members, 6 will be Croatians. Does it mean at least 6 or up to  6?    [Zubak] Well, you see, we came to a preliminary political  agreement in Sarajevo to have a 15-member government, including  the prime minister and his deputy. However, during the talks  and negotiations in Vienna we came to the conclusion that it  would be more opportune to have a 17-member government. As a  result, we came to a new political agreement, under which 6  government ministers would come from the ranks of the Croatian  people. Since we agreed that the prime minister should come  from the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, his deputy, under  the constitution, will at the same time be the defense minister.  In other words, the Croats have been given the right to  nominate their candidate for this post.    We also agreed that another four ministers, including one  without portfolio, should be from the ranks of the Croatian  people.    Why is this necessary? We need this in order to ensure that  the Croats are given the opportunity to realize their  constitutional right of insisting, when they deem it necessary,  that in other words one-third of the ministers will have the  right to ask that, in the case of issues considered to be of  vital importance, decisions be made through voting and  consensus. It was therefore necessary to ensure that one-third  of the government comprises Croatians, providing one of them is  prime minister or rather deputy prime minister.    [Announcer] To continue in the same vein, can you tell us  how  the implementation of the agreement will proceed.    [Zubak] When we first of all signed the framework and then  the entire agreement in Washington, various comments were made,  various views and forecasts expressed, various expectations were  voiced, about how the agreement could be implemented on the  ground. Through organized political action we have succeeded in  persuading and explaining to the people on the ground all the  advantages of the agreement, that it is an historical necessity,  that it will be instrumental in realizing all the political  goals of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of the  Croatian people in general. With this approach we succeeded in  persuading the people that this is the best solution and, at the  current juncture, of historic importance for the Croatian  people. I believe that through a politically synchronized and  coordinated action we shall succeed in explaining and persuading  the people, political officials, and leaders of the people that  this solution -- the cantonal arrangement -- will serve the  political and all other interests of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the same time, the cantonal arrangement neither threatens  nor questions the interests of the Bosniak people. In the areas  where we failed to achieve greater territorial divisions,  tensions between the two peoples would most likely have deepened  if a solution had not been reached. We see this as a compromise  that will make it impossible for either one or the other people  to be outvoted. They are both absolutely equal and in such an  atmsophere...    [Announcer, interrupting] In other words, you do not expect  changes or problems on the ground?    [Zubak] Well, there will probably be resistance. However, as  I said, through a synchornized, coordinated, and planned action,  I think we will succeed in explaining and persuading the people  that this solution is a good one.    [Announcer] Mr. Granic, a new ministerial conference is  expected in Geneva on Friday in which America, Russia, the EU,  and the United Nations are to take part. What is the importance  of this agreement, its completion, and its signing, for further  peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Granic] The picture now is more complete. In any case, it  will help in achieving a final solution. Without this agreement  the issue would have remained less clear. In light of this  agreement, it is certain that the position of the United States,  which has invested most to have this agreement reached, and of  some other states, especially Germany, will be clearer in the  search for a final solution. This means that the pressure on  the Serbs will definitely be stronger.    [Announcer] What can we expect now? It seems that it is the  Serbians in Bosnia-Herzegovina who are under greatest pressure.  A fresh conference is being prepared, the Croats and Bosniak  Muslims have reached an agreement. Do you feel that this is the  turning point and that the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is about  to be solved?    [Granic] Well, in the light of our experience of many  conferences, it is nevertheless realistic to expect that this  will be the most serious of the meetings, that it has been  approached seriously, and that it takes place with an agreement  in place between the Bosniaks and the Croatians. In other  words, preconditions exist for a serious conference.    I would like to add that, as far as the Republic of Croatia  is concerned, this agreement will considerably strengthen the  position of the Republic of Croatia, in particular in its  negotiations with the international financial institutions, with  the EU, and that in any case, this is yet another step further  in strengthening Croatia's international position, since Croatia  is seen here as a confederal partner. Of course, the  negotiations were between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, Mr.  Silajdzic and Mr. Zubak, but we are cosignatories of both the  preliminary and the final Washington agreement. Accordingly,  our responsiblity for implementing this agreement is great.    [Announcer] Mr. Granic and Mr. Zubak, thank you for taking  part in this evening's edition of Picture versus Picture. I  wish you a great deal of success in implementing the Vienna  agreement.</p>

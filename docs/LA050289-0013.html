			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG BABIES  </P> <P> These people, those who would prosecute pregnant and substance-abusing women  for crimes against their unborn children, are nothing for the individual "drug  baby," let alone the addicted and ill mother ("Drug Babies Push Issue of Fetal  Rights," Part I, April 25). They seek only to legislate morality out of a sense  of self-righteousness and neo-moral indignation. Regardless of their motive,  what these people propose is constitutionally intolerable. Their motivation,  however, makes their position utterly repugnant.  </P> <P> HOLLY A. HUNT  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHIP FLAWS FORCE COMPAQ TO HALT COMPUTER SHIPMENTS  </P> <P> Compaq Computer Corp. will delay shipments of its new Deskpro 486-25 personal  computer because of a faulty Intel Corp. chip, officials said Monday. It is the  second problem found in the advanced microprocessor.  </P> <P> "About a week ago, on Monday, we were contacted by Intel just saying that there  was an errata discovered in the 486 chip," said Nora Rice, media relations  administrator for the Houston-based computer manufacturer.  </P> <P> She said Intel said that it was working to find a solution to the problem but  that the trouble will delay introduction of the new machine.  </P> <P> "We were targeting shipping the computer Feb. 1," Rice said. "But with this new  errata, it will delay the ship date.  </P> <P> "It's important to understand what's causing the problem before you put in a  fix or a work-around" that configures the computer differently, she said.  </P> <P> Compaq discovered another problem with the advanced chip last fall, before  Intel had begun shipping the microprocessor.  </P> <P> When Compaq unveiled the Deskpro 486-25 last November it called it the most  powerful desktop computer yet.  </P> <P> Intel's 486 chip, introduced last April, is so powerful that it will allow  personal computers to do certain jobs now done by engineering workstations,  minicomputers and even mainframes.  </P> <P> The most recent trouble could affect other computers using the Extended  Industry Standard Architecture, or EISA, 32-bit bus, Rice said.  </P> <P> Compaq has not released any of its other 486-based machines, Rice said.  </P> <P> "I think they will be delayed, but it's safe to say they will be out within the  first quarter."  </P></p>

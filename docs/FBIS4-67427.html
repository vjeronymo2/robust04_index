			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- The 1993 State of Forest Report, which  is the fourth assessment of forest cover based on visual and  digital interpretation of satellite data between 1989 and 1991,  reveal that the forest cover in India in two years has increased  by just 22 sq kms. This means an annual increase of just 1100 ha!    When the National Wasteland Development Board was set up in  1985, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced that five  million hectares would be greened every year. Subsequently this  target was dropped as too tall and unrealistic an order. At the  forest ministers conference on Monday, Environment and Forest  Minister Kamal Nath said only 2 million ha a year could be  greened. But going by the Forest Survey of India report even  this is a tall order.    This indicates that the survival rate of the new plantations  is not as glorious as recorded and the amount of forest land  being diverted for so-called development projects is more than  what is planted.    While the forest cover in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh  Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Tamil  Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andaman and Nicobar islands  has increased, it has decreased in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal  Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa. Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh,  Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalayas, Mizoram and Orissa.    Reports from the seven North Eastern States are in  particular  depressing. While the dense forest cover (crown density of 40  per cent) increased by 31 sq km between 1991 and 1993, there was  a decrease of 666 sq km in the open forest cover (crown density  of 10 to less than 40 per cent) area. The worst culprits are  Assam, which has 243 sq km less of forests, Mizoram -- less by  156 sq kms, Meghalaya -- less by 106 sq km, Arunachal Pradesh --  less by 96 sq km.    In all North Eastern states forests continue to be  devastated  by shifting cultivation of jhoom [rotational crop planting]  operation despite the Central government's efforts to stop  jhoom. While 702 sq km of forests was lost in these states to  the traditional practise of shifting cultivation, 281 ha was  lost due to other reasons. However there was regeneration in 315  ha which had been felled for cultivation.    The total forest cover in the country is 6,40,107 sq km  (excluding tea gardens), which is 19.47 per cent of the total  geographical area of the country.</p>

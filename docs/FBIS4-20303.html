			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Five Major Characteristics of the </F> Functioning of the Consumer Goods Market Nationwide"]    [Text] 1. The trajectory of the movement of the total  volume of retail sales is wavelike. Business is not really slack  during slack seasons and is booming in busy seasons. A prolonged  peak-selling period is a prominent characteristic of the  consumer goods market as a whole. Last year the total volume of  retail sales of the country as a whole was 1,359.3 billion yuan,  an increase of 23.6 percent over the previous year, thus growing  6.8 percentage points faster than the previous year. An  adjustment of the figure for inflation shows that the amount of  physical goods increased by around 9 percent. In terms of  development dynamics, the growth rate was 16.2 percent for the  first quarter, 27 percent for the second quarter, 23.9 percent  for the third quarter, and 26.9 percent for the fourth quarter.    2. The consumer goods market is basically characterized by a  situation in which supply exceeds demand, and selecting good  merchandise to purchase has become people's usual consumption  behavior. According to domestic trade agencies' ranking of the  supply and demand situations of 680 commodities in the second  half of 1993, supply and demand were in basic equilibrium or  supply exceeded demand in the cases of 91.6 percent of the  commodities; supply was smaller than demand in the cases of 8.4  percent of the commodities. The supply of light industrial  products and most agricultural and sideline products is  abundant, mainly because the continued growth of industrial  production and the steady development of agricultural production  in 1993 has resulted in a situation in which the supply of goods  for the market is abundant and in which the total supply of  goods exceeds the total demand for goods. For the year, the  value of output of light industry increased by 22.3 percent over  the previous year, and the ratio of the total volume of retail  sales to the value of output of light industry was 1:1.24,  slightly higher than a normal year.    3. The rapid growth in effective demand on the domestic  market has invigorated the consumer goods market. According to  estimates, the per capita living-expense income of the urban  residents for the year was 2,323 yuan, representing a 10 percent  growth in real terms after being adjusted for inflation; the net  per capita income of the rural residents was 880 yuan,  representing a growth of around 2 percent in real terms after  being adjusted for inflation. The rapid growth in people's  income has led to strong demand on the market. Urban markets  have continued to boom. "Stressing nutrition in regard to  eating, stressing comfort in regard to clothing, and stressing  having high-grade goods in regard to articles for daily use"  have become a consumption trend prevalent among urban residents.  The quality of consumption has been markedly raised, and the  transition from the quantity type to the quality type is very  obvious.    4. All kinds of market actors are developing rapidly, and  the  regulating role of the market has been further enhanced. With  the increasingly important role of the market mechanism in the  circulation sphere, market competition has intensified, and the  various sectors' shares of business have continued to change. A  prominent manifestation of the change is the decreasing of the  state commerce sector's share of business and the increasing of  the nonstate commerce sector's share of business. The pace of  price reform has quickened. Currently procurement and selling  prices of grain and oil have been decontrolled in over 90  percent of the regions. Prices for services such as those  provided by hotels, bathhouses, and barber shops and repairs  have also been further decontrolled, and the market-regulated  proportion has continuously increased. According to statistics,  the share accounted for by market-regulated prices of the total  volume of retail sales has increased to around 95 percent;  state-set prices account for only 10 percent of the total volume  of agricultural products sold by the peasants.    5. Policy factors have large impacts on the consumer goods  market. Since the beginning of last year, the state has adopted  some consumption-stimulating measures, such as decontrolling  grain and oil prices in most regions, raising the merchandizing  business tax, and adjusting exchange rates; as a result prices  of some goods have increased, and people have again demonstrated  the consumption mentality characterized by an inclination to  purchase goods for value-preservation purposes; media  discussions of the postponement of "the resumption of GATT  membership" have released the purchasing power which has been  accumulated over a long time.</p>

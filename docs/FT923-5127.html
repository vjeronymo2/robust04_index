			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: CIBC reorganisation to include key management changes CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce will unveil a corporate reorganisation tomorrow in an attempt to improve profitability and avoid a repetition of its costly exposure to troubled companies such as ailing developer Olympia &amp; York. The bank is expected to announce several senior management changes as part of a plan to reduce head office staff, integrate its investment and corporate banking divisions, and focus on its business in North America. CIBC is Canada's second biggest financial institution with assets of CDollars 128bn (USDollars 107.5bn). It has had the misfortune, however, to be a prominent lender to several of Canada's most troubled companies over the past decade, including farm and industrial equipment maker Massey-Ferguson, energy producer Dome Petroleum and, most recently, Olympia &amp; York. Mr Al Flood, who took over as CIBC chairman in June, has indicated to his senior management team that lending criteria will be tightened, even at the expense of growth in assets. The bank will also release its third-quarter earnings tomorrow. CIBC wrote off the bulk of its CDollars 860m exposure to O&amp;Y in its second fiscal quarter ended April 30. As a result of these and other loan loss provisions totalling CDollars 1.2bn, the bank suffered a second-quarter loss of CDollars 440m, compared with earnings of CDollars 186m a year earlier. Mr Flood has already made several key management changes. Mr John Hunkin, former chief executive of Wood Gundy, the bank's securities arm, is now in charge of investment and corporate banking.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Konstantin Eggert: "Defeat in Bosnia Unites </F> Russia and West"]    [Text] Geneva-Bonn-Moscow -- For a long time to come  Russian diplomacy will be branded "pro-Serb," although, judging  from the results of the Russian foreign minister's talks with  his U.S., French, and FRG counterparts, there are fewer grounds  for this than before.    The peaks and troughs of the last few months seem to have  had  a sobering effect on both Russia and the West. The Kremlin has  been shamefully humiliated by the Serbs, while Europe and the  United States have shown themselves to be confused and  ineffectual in their use of military force. The spirit of  defeat has closed the gap between Moscow and the Western  capitals, compelling them on the one hand to engage in what one  might call "mutual face saving" and on the other to try a  general onslaught to get the Bosnian problem moving.    Andrey Kozyrev's trip to Geneva and Bonn was undertaken  straight after Russia submitted its initiative for the creation  of a so-called "contact group" involving representatives of  Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United  Nations. Its task is to get the Serbs and Muslims to sign an  agreement suspending hostilities forthwith and then work toward  a Bosnia-wide agreement on the principles for a settlement.    By the minister's own admission, when he went to Switzerland  he did not expect his Western partners to agree so quickly to  Russia's idea of stepping up the quest for a political solution  to the crisis in Bosnia. In this respect the meeting with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher was of particular  importance. Their positions have moved appreciably closer:  Moscow is no longer saying that air strikes are categorically  inadmissible, and moreover it acknowledges that they are  advisable when the civilian population is under threat.  Washington in turn agreed on the need to direct attention  primarily to diplomatic means of influencing the parties to the  conflict.    The meeting with Alain Juppe, head of the French Foreign  Ministry, was even more upbeat than the talks with Christopher,  which is easily explained: Russia's views were previously  extremely close to the Europeans' viewpoint. On leaving the  Russian mission in Geneva, where he spoke with Kozyrev, the  French minister said: "The contact group will not only tackle  Bosnia."    The work of the contact group began with a minor sensation.  It was announced that Aleksey Nikiforov, first deputy director  of the Foreign Ministry's First European Department, would go to  Sarajevo and Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, instead of Vitaliy  Churkin, the Russian president's special representative. Agency  and newspaper reports immediately appeared saying that Churkin  had resigned. Talking to journalists in the aircraft en route  for Bonn, Vitaliy Ivanovich joked: "The press was in a hurry to  deprive me of a job." Following Kozyrev's talks with German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Churkin flew off to Oslo to meet  with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN secretary general's  representative. Aleksey Nikiforovich's visit to Bosnia is quite  justified: After Churkin's very harsh words about the leaders  of the Bosnian Serbs two weeks ago, describing them as people  "seized by the madness of war," his meeting with Radovan  Karadzic would hardly be productive. Churkin is not opposed to  passing on his work in Yugoslavia to someone else, however,  according to an informed Russian diplomat, "only the president  has the right to relieve him of this post. Yeltsin may do that  tomorrow, but he may also do it in a year's time."    If the contact group's work goes successfully, the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and  Germany may meet next week in Geneva or one of the Scandinavian  capitals. According to Kozyrev, it is quite possible that an  interim agreement would be concluded following the general  suspension of hostilities in Bosnia, an agreement recording  primarily the territorial disagreements between the communities.  After that they would be able to argue for a year, but over a  map, not in the trenches. At the end of the interim period the  remaining unresolved questions could be handed over to  international arbitration.</p>

Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team of Sino-  Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, made these remarks at a news  conference here this afternoon.    Guo said that in 1993 Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Vice-  President Rong Yiren and other senior officials had paid  official visit to Portugal and Portuguese foreign minister and  several other governmental officials had also visited China.    He said he was convinced that the high-level contacts  between  the two governments would further promote the consolidation and  development of the Sino-Portuguese friendly relations of  cooperation and enhance Macao residents' confidence on  Sino-Portuguese cooperation in guaranteeing long-term stability  in the territory.    Guo said that in 1993 both sides of the Sino-Portuguese  Joint  Liaison Group had initially consulted with each other and made  marked achievements in handling affairs in the transitional  period of Macao by observing the Joint Declaration and on the  basis of mutual respect and mutual understanding.    In addition to the three major questions in the transitional  period, namely the localization of public servants and law and  officialization of Chinese language, and question about Macao's  entry in international organizations, the two sides of the Joint  Liaison Group also exchanged views on retirement pay for public  servants, participation of Bank of China in note-issuing in  Macao and others, Guo said.    He pointed out that the three questions are the major  factors  which have significant influence on the overall situation of the  transitional period, saying that China has and will extend more  efforts in pushing forward the settlement of the three major  questions and others concerned.</p>

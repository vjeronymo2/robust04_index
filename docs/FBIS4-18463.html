			<p>BFN     [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The Media Trade Union has  reacted with dismay to the assassination of German journalist  Lissy Schmidt. A statement of the Main Executive Board on  Tuesday [5 April] says that, according to the trade union's  information, Schmidt investigated inroads of the Turkish  military and intelligence service on the territory of northern  Iraq. The 35-year-old photographer, member of the Media Trade  Union, and her Kurdish companion had been shot in an ambush in  the northern Iraqi part of Kurdistan on Sunday.    The Media Trade Union appealed again to the Turkish  Government to guarantee the protection of journalists who  exercise their occupation in Kurdistan and their free and  unhindered reporting. It called on the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  to request the Turkish Government to observe the freedom of the  press.</p>

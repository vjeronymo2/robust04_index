According to RESPUBLIKA (THE REPUBLIC), Shushkevich has  become disagreeable to everybody in the parliament.    "The parliament majority was not satisfied with his strongly  negative attitude to the treaty on collective security, his  uncertain stance on prospects of uniting Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems, as well as on what sort of state system should  be created in Belarus, and his keep-away from economic problems.    "On the other hand, Shushkevich was objectionable to the  parliament opposition who has shifted to radical nationalist or  apparently pro-western views", the newspaper says.    In RESPUBLIKA's opinion, another reason for ousting the  unconvenient leader was that it was necessary to find and  publicly demonstrate the major "culprit" of the delay in  drafting a new constitution to masque the parliament's own  failures. Otherwise, the parliament would face a threat of  early elections, no faction in the parliament was interested in.    However, according to the newspaper, Shushkevich's removal  can hardly solve the parliament's problems, it will rather  generate new ones. A "buffer" policy of the former speaker,  though not facilitating the work on the draft constitution,  sometimes made it possible to find a compromise between  different factions and groups in the parliament.    We cannot say with certainty that this will be possible  insofar, as the parliament is now broken into two uncompromising  camps, the newspaper concludes.    "Shushkevich appeared a weak politician, who failed to  realize until the very end that he does not fit the post",  Anatoliy Maysenya, president of the centre for strategic studies  "East-West" said in an interview with the SEM DNEY (the SEVEN  DAYS), one of the most popular weekly papers in the republic.    "His (Shushkevich's) permanent complaints about the lack of  powers, about a relativity of the very post of the speaker only  prove this", he added. "Genuine politicians never ask for power,  they struggle for it and take it, and this is the essence of  policy-making".    "He has become a sort of stationary scenery picturing  democratic hopes on the Belarusian political scene, over which  both those marching to the right and those going to the left  have become stumbling with an increasing frequency. Nothing has  changed with his ousting".    "Stanislav Shushkevich failed to protect himself and his  values", Maysenya resumes.    However, the Belarusian press does not give much attention  to  Shushkevich, being more concerned over the future. "People are  tired", chief editor of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA (the SOVIET  BELARUS) Igor Osinskiy writes addressing both the speaker and  the deputies.    "Our politicians are living in the vacuum, they do not hear  and understand not only each other but the people on whose  behalf they are acting and to whose opinion they like to refer.    "If they could hear people, the former speaker would be  ashamed to state that the Belarusians whole-heartedly welcomed  the Mishkuli agreement. If they could hear people, the  parliament opposition would know that the Belarusians are  against the imposed Belarusification and break of relations with  Russia."    "You have exhausted the patience of the people, gentlemen.  Go home", Osinsky says.</p>

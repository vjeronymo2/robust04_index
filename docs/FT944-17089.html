			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (6): Top of the waiting list - Daniel Green says frequent flyer programmes have reached maturity The business of frequent flyer programmes (FFPs) has in the past year moved from adolescence to maturity. The vast majority of business travellers in Europe belong to at least one scheme. To keep them, individual schemes are being forced to compare their own incentives with their rivals' and improve them where necessary. A more subtle change is taking place, too. Passengers are recognising that earning the right to do yet more air travel in their spare time is not necessarily the best reason for joining such a programme. Other benefits such as priority in the waiting list on overbooked flights is more important. And redeeming points for leisure flights seems to be less important than it was. Airlines are heeding these signals as they prepare the next round of incentives for their scheme members. Most FFPs work by offering scheme members 'points' or 'miles' in rough proportion to the distance travelled and multiplied by a factor relating to the class of travel. These points can be exchanged for free flights, seat upgrades or other benefits. After some scares in the 1980s when the schemes were new - the now defunct Pan Am was reportedly giving away so many miles that some aircraft flew without a single fare-paying passenger on board - airlines are careful not to give away too much. They can do this because on average, the world's aircraft fly about two-thirds full. Airlines are happy to use the empty seats as a marketing tool. They use computer forecasts of demand to allocate what they believe will be unsold seats to the FFP. The effect, as anyone who has tried to cash in points will have found out, is that it is easy to get a free ticket with your frequent flyer points on the 0650 from London to Amsterdam on a Saturday but not on a Monday. And to make sure that passengers do not accumulate so many points as to risk a deluge of point redemptions on a holiday weekend later in the decade, European FFPs have time limits. Members who fail to cash in their points within two or three years lose them. In the case of British Airways, leisure travellers get a poor deal: they do not earn points unless they have paid full price for their tickets. US carriers offer points for almost all trips and BA has been forced to do the same for its US-based members. In spite of these limitations, FFPs are a huge success in Europe. Some 86 per cent of European business travellers belong to a frequent flyer scheme, up from 82 per cent last year, according to market research to be published later this year by the Official Airlines Guide. Among the busiest travellers - those making more than 20 trips a year - an astonishing 97 per cent are members of at least one scheme. The research found virtually the same level of membership in the UK, France and Ger- many. But though in each case, the national airline's scheme was easily the most popular, there were wide differences in different countries between favourite FFPs. In the UK, 52 per cent of travellers said BA's FFP was the best, compared with 47 per cent in Germany who picked Lufthansa, while in France only 34 per cent said Air France's beat its rivals. This may have been because of the success of competitor airlines in winning business from Air France. Popular among French travellers were schemes offered by US carriers Delta and TWA, neither of which figured in responses from UK travellers. Air France has recognised that there have been problems with its FFP and earlier this year revamped it. Unlike BA, for example, cut-price economy fares qualify for points, and two free tickets can be had for only 1 1/2 times the points required for one ticket. Carriers still vary somewhat in the levels of reward that they offer. Between BA, Luft- hansa, Air France, American Airlines and Delta, for example, it takes between one and five business class trips between Europe and the east coast of the US to earn enough points for one free economy flight between London and either Frankfurt or Paris. The best deal comes from BA because it skews its points allocations in favour of north American routes. You may feel that after business class flights to Sydney, Australia, and back, you deserve all the points you get. In fact, a round trip to Boston would have earned you three times as many. There are interesting dif- ferences between what airlines count as a European flight. It takes six London to Tel Aviv business class flights on BA to earn one London-Paris return, but only two trips via Paris on Air France. For short-haul rewards in Europe, you may be best off with Lufthansa or Swissair, whose minimum number of points can be exchanged for free flights that will take you to most countries in western Europe. It is little wonder then, that four out of five European business travellers belong to more than one FFP. The average number of member- ships is about three. A glance at the main reasons for joining an FFP soon ex- plains why multiple member- ship is the logical thing to do. While 54 per cent of travellers rate free flights as 'very important', 72 per cent said their top priority was to be at the head of the waiting list for overbooked flights. Too many regular travellers know both the pain of being denied boarding after a hard day's work and that the decision about who flies and who does not is taken on the ground a few minutes before departure. Any lever to improve the chances of getting aboard is to be grasped. Naturally, this has led quickly to a series of refinements as FFPs are used to retain the loyalty of the airline's best customers. Lufthansa's frequent flyers earn automatic upgrades to bigger rooms in several hotel chains, including the Hilton, Sheraton and Regent. Holders of BA's gold card are guar- anteed a seat on most BA flights if the reservation is made more than 24 hours in advance. The unsaid corollary is that those who fail to meet these specifications risk being bounced off the flight if it is full. There are new ways of redeeming points, too. The US is in the advance guard here with American Airlines FFP points exchangeable for flowers or restaurant meals. For the airlines' best customers, some benefits are as attractive as free flights and new ways of earning points are an agreeable way to top up their scores. FFP operators are therefore likely to put an increasing part of their creative energies into their programmes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   THE FREQUENT FLYER'S FREE FLIGHT GUIDE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Transatlantic business class returns to US east coast for one free London-Paris or London-Frankfurt return flight  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Carrier                 Number      Comments  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Air France                2         Any UK airport to any in France.

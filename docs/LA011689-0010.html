			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST NORTH  </P> <P> The fortuitous conjunction (on your Op-Ed Page, Jan. 9) of Cal Thomas'  excellent expose of Jim and Tammy Bakker and Conrad's cartoon showing Reagan  and Bush toasting North's brilliantly manipulative lawyer (Brendan Sullivan)  drove me panting to my word processor.  </P> <P> Thomas quotes C.S. Lewis: "The safest road to hell is the gradual one . . .  without signposts." Sullivan's self-righteous jerking around of the legal  system is both embarrassing and to be feared. This blatant manipulation of the  legal system has only one purpose -- freeing an admittedly guilty man.  </P> <P> But then, the outgoing Administration has a well-earned reputation for  defending the clearly guilty.  </P> <P> A thought for our times might be: "If it glitters, if you believe it in your  heart, and if you can get away with it, it must be right." And, oh yes, we need  people of stature to lead the way.  </P> <P> With people like Jim and Tammy and Sullivan and North leading us on the path of  righteousness, we should arrive in hell no worse for the stress and trouble of  getting there.  </P> <P> ALLAN RABINOWITZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

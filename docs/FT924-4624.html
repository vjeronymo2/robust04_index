			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): What Clinton needs to know MEMOS TO THE PRESIDENT: A GUIDE THROUGH MACROECONOMICS FOR THE BUSY POLICYMAKER by Charles L. Schultze The Brookings Institution, Dollars 24.95, 323 pages THE US president-elect Bill Clinton is undoubtably a busy man right now as he prepares to take over in January. One thing is for sure; he is not short of advice, or free from special pleaders, or just from those wanting a job on the Clinton bandwagon. The campaign rhetoric and promises are almost history; what Clinton needs is sound, experienced advice. Economists, officials, commentators and hangers-on are offering solutions, but the man himself needs to understand what they are telling him. Enter Charles L. Schultze and his timely Memos to the President which provides an essential, easy-to-read guide in language, to quote Herbert Stein of the American Enterprise Institute, 'which even the President (presumably it also goes for the President-elect) can understand.' Touche] Schultze, now a senior fellow in the Economics Studies programme at the Brookings Institution, was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) during the administration of the last Democratic Party president, Jimmy Carter, and director of the US Bureau of the Budget during the Johnson presidency - not bad qualifications to advise an arriving president. The old Washington fox has embarked on a personal fantasy, his own description: 'I imagined a new president (in the 1990s) promising the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to devote an hour a week to learning about the key economic relationships that a president ought to understand as a background for making macroeconomic policy judgments. My fantasy then had the president instructing the CEA to prepare a series of weekly memoes that would accomplish that purpose.' Schultze adds a qualification about his president, and a comment about economic advisers of seemingly conflicting ideological persuasions. He imagines that his hypothetical president and adviser come from near the middle of the political spectrum, thus excluding the convinced supply-siders of the early Reagan years or the left wing of the Democratic Party (that should clear Clinton), and Schultze is not convinced that any one hundred economists will have an equal number of macroeconomic prescriptions. Noting his ten year association with the CEA, he observes that - nuances of language and emphasis apart - the advice given presidents by both Republican and Democratic CEAs was remarkably similar on about two-thirds to three-quarters of the relevant issues. 'If one thinks of the views of first-rank professional economists about issues of public policy as arrayed across a spectrum of 180 degrees, from left to right, the middle third of the spectrum would probably contain four-fifths of the economists.' Having claimed for himself this broad middle ground, Schultze with admirable clarity divides his 29 memos to the president into a three-part scheme. The first four set the groundwork, with the nasty aside that many politicians and journalists, and perhaps some professional economists, carry on the public debate about macroeconomic policy in terms of what those policies will or will not do to gross national product (GNP), but with only the foggiest notion of what GNP is. The next 15 notes deal with inflation and unemployment and explain how economic forces produce short term changes of total demand and spending in the economy; how these changes in demand, interacting with a more stable and slowly changing supply, can generate inflation and unemployment; and how economic policies can help keep total demand and supply more nearly matched so as to avoid those consequences. The nine memoes in the final part (memo 29 is a concise summary) are the most interesting. They identify the principle forces that determine the pace of long-term supply growth and consider the possibilities, costs and limitations of government policies to promote it. Schultze acknowledges that a host of microeconomic policy measures can affect the growth of output supply: trade policy, environmental regulations, minimum wages, agricultural policy. But he concentrates on three macroeconomic contributors: national savings and investment in new plant, equipment and infrastructure; the amount and quality of education embodied in the labour force (here he finds the US educational system wanting); and technological advance as it can be influenced by government support for research and development. The author writes that short-run changes in a country's economic fortunes are dominated by changes in aggregate demand; policies to stabilise demand can contribute to improving America's well-being by minimising periods of high unemployment and inflation. 'In the long run, however, demand management is far less important than policies to promote the growth of supply. Unlike stabilisation measures, such policies typically produce gradual if initially imperceptible changes in the nation's ability to produce goods and services. But these changes can accumulate over the decades and generations and generate substantial improvements in living standards. Continuing progress in the nation's living standards depends heavily on growth of capital, improvement in the skills and knowledge of workers, and scientific and technical advances.' True, but what new president wants to hear such a long-term scenario? Yet Schultze is correct when he says that getting economic policies at least roughly right can make a big difference in the prosperity and growth of the nation. In turn, understanding how the economy works is a prerequisite for policymakers choosing the right policies. This book is an excellent starting point.</p>

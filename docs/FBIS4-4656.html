			<p>BFN     [Text] With the start of its new fiscal year, Daehan Kyoyuk  Insurance Co. has set its sight on creating a powerful financial  group by 2000.    Yi Chung-hoe, president of the insurance company, said  Friday  that Daehan Kyoyuk will create a financial group with its main  pillars being a bank, an insurance company and a securities  company. "We will become the largest independent financial group  (independent of industrial capital) in the nation by 2000," Yi  said while unveiling his company's projects for fiscal 1994.    Daehan Kyoyuk, which took over an insurance company last  year, plans to take over a commercial bank this year, said  another official of the insurance company. The insurance company  is the first financial institution in the nation to declare that  it will create a financial conglomerate after top government  officials said last month that the government will foster  financial groups independent of industrial capital.    Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential secretary for economic  affairs, said last month that the government will raise the 8  percent ceiling on the ownership of equity stakes in a  commercial bank by a person, his relatives and those with  certain close business relation to him. Such a measure would be  the first step taken to help create financial conglomerates  powerful enough to challenge foreign financial behemoths in the  face of wider market opening. Pak said the government will  change commercial banks from quasi public institutions to  genuine private businesses and help make some of them lead  companies of planned financial conglomerates.    The Korea Tax Institute, which recently conducted a study on  fostering financial groups at the request of the Ministry of  Finance, also proposed in its report last month that commercial  banks become lead companies of financial groups.    While the general consensus is that financial groups should  have nonbank financial institutions clustered around commercial  banks, Daehan Kyoyuk would have to take over a commercial bank  to create a financial group. One of the takeover targets is  Citizens National Bank, which the government plans to put on the  block this year. An official from Daehan Kyoyuk said his company  will bid for the commercial bank.    Daehan Kyoyuk, which has an investment consulting company as  well as a securities company as its subsidiaries, also plans to  acquire a merchant bank, a credit union and other financial  institutions. Preparations by Daehan Kyoyuk are expected to set  in motion mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions.    In addition to Daehan Kyoyuk, Shinhan Bank and Korea Long  Term Credit Bank are expected to unveil their plans to form  financial groups soon. The two banks, many government officials  said, are strong candidates to become lead companies of  financial groups.</p>

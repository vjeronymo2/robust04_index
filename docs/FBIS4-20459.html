			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tan Keyang [6223 0344 2254]: ``USTND Develops </F> `Expert Data Base System': Major Achievement in State `863 Plan'  Intelligent Computing Technology Research'']    [Summary] The ``Expert Data Base System'' software tool  developed over a 4-year period as a State 863 Plan (Intelligent  Computing Technology area) project by the Computer Institute at  the University of Science and Technology for National Defense  (USTND) recently passed formal technical appraisal in Changsha,  where an expert panel judged its technical performance to be  world-class. This tool tightly couples intelligent software  research with traditional computer software technologies; it  organically fuses logical inference, modularized structure,  object-oriented techniques, intelligent objects, and advanced  graphical user interface techniques. Developed under the  guidance of USTND Prof. Wu Quanyuan [0702 3123 3293], this new  system has applications in areas such as defense research,  energy resources exploration, iron and steel smelting, financial  services, and logistics management.</p>

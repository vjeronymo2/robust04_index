			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Republic of Tatarstan State Committee on </F> Statistics and the Republic of Tatarstan Center for Social  Problems: "In the Next Few Months, Life in Tatarstan Will Be  Better Than in Russia"]    [Text] We continue the publication of materials on  the standard of living of our republic's population. Let us  recall that in these materials the standard of living is  appraised by the criterion of the population's purchasing  capacity as a ratio of income to the cost of living. The cost of  living is determined by the system of consumer budgets. At this  point, we are looking at only two of the entire range of  consumer budgets: the subsistence minimum and the minimum  consumer budget.    In February the subsistence minimum across Tatarstan  increased by 16.1 percent (by 4,672 rubles [R] in absolute  value) and amounted to R33,716 as compared to R29,044 in  January, while the value of the minimum consumer budget amounted  to R121,595.    According to data of the Republic of Tatarstan State  Committee on Statistics, in the consumer market prices for  consumer goods in February rose by 11 percent--a 1.5-fold rate  increase as compared to January (7.8 percent). Prices rose for  both foodstuffs (11 percent) and nonfood items (10.9 percent).  Prices and fees for for-fee services for the population  continued to rise at an anticipatory rate (44.4 percent).    At the same time, February is the month when the main  indicators characterizing the standard of living--the cost of  consumer budgets and income--fall into a predefined ratio; when  income grows faster than prices for basic consumer goods and  services included in the subsistence minimum. We remind the  reader that throughout 1993 the republic was able to contain the  anticipatory rise in per capita income in relation to increases  in the cost of the subsistence minimum. For instance, on 28  January we published in IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA the data that over  12 months of last year the value of the subsistence minimum  increased 7.3-fold (from R3,400 in January to R24,900 in  December) while per capita income increased 9.7-fold (from  R7,500 to R72,800). In January of this year, however, per capita  income fell to R53,400 (we wrote about the reasons for this in  IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA 1 March 1994), but in February the picture  began to change gradually: Per capita income rose in February by  40.2 percent and amounted to R74,870. The curve of changes in  per capita income and the subsistence minimum are presented in  the graph. One can see from the graph that over the entire last  year per capita income in the republic rose at a higher rate  than the cost of the subsistence minimum--a steeper "per capita  income" curve in relation to "subsistence minimum" curve.  Specialists of the Center for Social Problems have forecast the  data for March-May. As we can see from the forecast, over the  next two to three months, despite the general worsening of the  economic situation in the Russian Federation, the republic will  be able to maintain the trend of anticipatory rises in per  capita income in relation to the rate of price increases for  goods and services included in the subsistence minimum.</p>

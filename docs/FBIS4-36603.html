As of today, Thursday,  curfew hours will be from 2200-0500. Thus, all businesses and  activities in all cities can proceed in accordance with this new  schedule, which must be complied with.    The ministry wishes to explain that any party, institution,  or individual whose jobs necessitate moving from one place to  another during the curfew hours must obtain a special license  from the Ministry of Interior.

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK discounts fresh treaty MR DOUGLAS HURD, the British Foreign Secretary, yesterday discounted reports that France and Germany supported the drafting of an alternative treaty for European union in case Denmark and Britain did not ratify the Maastricht treaty. He was referring to reports that the European Commission had begun work on the draft, following a secret agreement between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France to pursue European integration with the Benelux countries if the Maastricht treaty proved to be a dead letter. Mr Hurd told members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that, if the treaty was not ratified, there was clearly a danger that some EC states would decide, 'after a time', that the benefits of working together were such that there should be a new framework. 'However, it is clear to me that the federal chancellor (Mr Kohl) and the French president (Mr Mitterrand) are not interested in that approach. But whether there are people chattering on these lines in the background, I cannot possibly say,' he said. After the recent Anglo-German dispute over Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, and Chancellor Kohl will attempt to mend their fences at a working dinner in Birmingham on Thursday, on the eve of the Community's one-day emergency summit. How to put flesh and bones on the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the Maastricht treaty - that the centralised EC institutions should only deal with matters which cannot be decided more effectively at national level - will also be high on the agenda. Both Downing Street and Mr Hurd poured cold water on any expectations the summit would produce substantial results. It was the hope of the British EC presidency that the meeting would decide on clear instructions to the Community's council of ministers on how to define subsidiarity. The council would present its definitive conclusions to the full EC summit in Edinburgh in December.</p>

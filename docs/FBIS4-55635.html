			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The visit of the Russian  prime minister to Budapest at the end of March, and the six  agreements signed, could promote Hungarian-Russian trade and  capital transfers already taking place between the two countries.    Hungarian exports to Russia were valued at $945 million in  1993, imports from there $1.7 billion. This was compensated for  by the delivery of 28 MiG-29 fighter jets, to a value of $713  million, as the first tranche of Russian, ex-Soviet, state debt  owed to Hungary.    Russia is Hungary's second largest foreign trade partner,  after Germany, while Hungary is seventh among Russia's partners.    In 1991, Russian-Hungarian turnover fell by some 70 percent  when the trade switched to U.S. dollar accounting. In 1992,  turnover rose by 17 percent, mainly due to Hungarian grain  deliveries of 3 million tons. Last year, total turnover was  valued at $3.35 billion, 6 percent less than in 1992. Hungarian  imports remained at the same level, but exports to Russia  declined by 17 percent.    In 1993, three-quarters of Hungarian imports were petroleum  (6 million tons), natural gas (5.3 billion cubic meters), and  electric energy; 15 percent was other raw materials,  semi-finished products, and components. The proportion of  imported consumer goods rose slightly, to 6 percent.    The structure of Hungarian exports shows a major change. In  1992, food accounted for about 50 percent, and the proportion of  machines and equipment did not even reach 20 percent. Last  year, the proportion of agricultural and food products declined  to 30 percent, while that of machinery rose to 30 percent, and  consumer products stood at around 20 percent. Compared to 1992,  the Russians purchased 40 percent more machinery, vehicles, and  medicine. The decline in Hungarian exports in 1993 was wholly  due to the drop in agricultural exports.    Hungary has independent economic agreements with 20  territories within Russia, also helping trade. In 1994, Hungary  made such agreements with the Komi and the Udmurt Republics,  Bashkiria, and the Ivanovo territory.    Exports to Russia accounted for 10.6 percent of Hungary's  total exports in 1993, imports from there for 14.3 percent of  total imports. The Hungarian Ministry of International Economic  Relations prepared a development program to promote trade and  investment with the former Soviet successor states, mainly with  Russia. The program provided some $1 million to Hungarian  exporters in 1993.    Prime Ministers Peter Boross of Hungary and Viktor  Chernomyrdin of Russia signed an agreement in Budapest at the  end of March on avoiding double taxation. The sides are  negotiating an investment protection agreement. Both aim at  increasing mutual investment, currently at a low level. At  present, 1,000 Hungarian firms trade with Russia, where 900  Hungarian-Russian joint ventures also operate, mainly engaged in  trade. There are 50 Hungarian-Russian joint ventures in  Hungary. The products of several major Hungarian joint ventures  -- Orion telecommunications plant, the Petroleum Equipment  Factory of Nagykanizsa (southwest Hungary), and the Ikarus Bus  Factory of Szekesfehervar (west Hungary) -- have Russian buyers.    A government agreement of outstanding importance concerned  the settlement of the remaining, some $900 million worth, of  debt owed by the former Soviet Union. The agreement on  repayment designates five areas: military technology, civil  transport, Hungarian participation in Russian privatization,  Russian participation in Hungarian privatization, and the  expansion of tourism links.    The Hungarian side would like to participate in Russian  privatization to a value of at least $200 million. Hungarian  entrepreneurs would invest in Russian petroleum or natural gas  firms, or possibly in railway vehicle reconstruction, as a form  of debt repayment. Talks are in progress on setting up trading  houses. The Russian side is considering the delivery of iron  structures for the Budapest World Expo, and participation as  sub-contractor extending the Budapest underground. In civil  transport, the Hungarian side would mainly welcome ships,  machinery and chemical products.    The ministers in charge signed cooperation memorandums  covering telecommunications and post, and a supplementary  protocol was signed to the 1966 agreement on setting up the Paks  Nuclear Power Plant in Hungary. The most important parts of the  latter agreement are that Russia will take back the burnt-out  fuel rods from the power plant, for which Hungary will pay some  $40 million, and it will deliver nuclear fuel to the Hungarian  plant for an additional annual $45 million.    The foreign trade ministers signed a protocol on mutual  deliveries in 1994, which, unlike earlier agreements, no longer  contains quantitative stipulations, merely recommendations for  each product group.    The Hungarian side wishes to match 1993's trade volume in  1994, and believes Hungarian exports could go up by 10 percent  with deliveries of agricultural products, food, medicine, and  buses.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> TAX THAT WON'T SLOW YOU DOWN  </P> <P> Will the passing of another year make a difference in the willingness of Orange  County voters to tax themselves for important transportation projects? The new  leadership of the Orange County Transportation Commission believes that it will  and has made an important decision to try again for authorization to put a  measure on the ballot in November that would provide a half-cent sales tax  increase for transportation improvements.  </P> <P> This sentiment arises in part from polling that suggests the voters in tax-wary  Orange County are ready at long last to pay to improve their own transportation  system. There also are some signals in what happened to two recent propositions  in Orange County, 108 for rail bond money and 111 for transportation  improvements. The first passed here and the second was defeated here, but close  enough to offer encouragement.  </P> <P> Orange County doesn't need more taxes, but it must help itself. For example,  the county won't qualify for its share of Proposition 108 money unless it  passes its own sales tax measure, the way other urban counties have. As for  Proposition 111 money, Orange County shouldn't expect miracles there, either.  The state decided that it could not afford the entire Santa Ana Freeway  improvement project and left it to local officials to do the rest.  </P> <P> Without taxing itself for road improvements, Orange county will get half a loaf  and a long list of unfinished business. The defeat of Measure M last year left  on hold, for example, the reconstruction of the Santa Ana-San Diego freeway  interchange, the creation of a 220-mile network of super streets and the  planned widening of the Riverside and Orange freeways to include new car-pool  lanes. Most of those projects would get moving again with a new transportation  measure.  </P> <P> So the estimated $3.1 billion that would come over 20 years from a sales tax  measure would be money well spent.  </P></p>

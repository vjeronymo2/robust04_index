			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rawlings hails Ghanaian mine project AT THE official opening of Iduapriem, Ghana's newest gold mine, yesterday President Gerry Rawlings hailed the development as another success for his liberalised mining investment laws, which have attracted Dollars 900m of new capital and quadrupled the country's gold production since 1986. The place where the president made his speech was until two years ago a remote patch of thick forest in the western region, some 300 km (185 miles) west of Accra. The mine is owned and operated by Ghanaian Australian Goldfields, a joint venture between the International Finance Corporation (20 per cent) the Ghanaian government (10 per cent) and Golden Shamrock Mines (68.95 per cent), the Australian group controlled by Mr Oren Benton's Denver-based Concord group which trades 70 per cent of the world's uranium. After an initial investment of Dollars 10m by GAG, the IFC connection enabled it to develop Iduapriem with a Dollars 55m loan from a syndicate made up of the Swiss Banking Corporation, NIG bank of the Netherlands, the European development agencies DEG and FMO and Ecobank, the West African regional trade bank. It started production last September and is producing gold ahead of its target rate of 120,000 troy ounces a year, worth about Dollars 40m at today's prices. The ceremony at Iduapriem marked another step in the development of Ghana's mineral resources, which are concentrated in the Western and Ashanti regions. Once known as the Gold Coast, this area's wealth had declined since independence because of inadequate funding until a new mining investment law in 1986 began to bring back foreign capital and expertise. In the past five years, Ghana's annual gold production has increased from 250,000 ounces to more than 1m ounces, and even at today's depressed price of about Dollars 330 an ounce gold has overtaken cocoa as the country's principal export. Mr Kwami Prepreh, the acting Minister of Energy and Mines said that the government aimed to double production to 2m a year by 1997.</p>

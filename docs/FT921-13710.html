			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Early poll date option kept open by prime minister MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday kept open the option of an early general election by signalling that the government was no longer awaiting a 'feel good factor' among voters nor prepared to stimulate a 'short-term, artificial boom' for electoral reasons. The prime minister used a wide-ranging television interview to stress that the fall in the inflation rate and a rise in the number of job vacancies showed that conditions for a sustained recovery were in place, awaiting only a revival in consumer confidence. He delivered another strong hint of a possible tax cut in the forthcoming Budget and specifically ruled out plans for an increase in value added tax. Conceding that confidence was an 'intangible factor', he said the slowdown in the world economy had 'delayed the speed of recovery that we previously had imagined.' But Mr Major emphasised the government's prudent policies demonstrated its determination to hold down inflation and maintain stable exchange rates. 'To throw away the chance of actually putting all those essential bedrocks of a good economy in place would be absolute folly - and we won't do it,' he told Mr David Frost in a confidently delivered 40-minute pre-recorded interview with TV-am. 'And if that means I have to argue in the general election (that) if we put things in place but every aspect of the feel-good factor isn't there, well, so be it.' Mr Major argued that increased public spending and tax cuts were compatible, repeating earlier hints that the Tories will take action to encourage a 'capital owning' democracy. In response, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, immediately led a series of opposition counter-attacks on Mr Major, stressing earlier Tory promises that an upturn was on the way. 'It is a terrible indictment that having hung on for 18 months hoping that the economy improves, he still has to go to the country without an economic improvement,' he said. Mr Major's comments came amid widespread expectation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce the date of the Budget in Wednesday's debate on the Autumn Statement on public expenditure. While Downing Street insists that March 3 remains an option, Treasury officials have indicated that March 10 and 17 are much more likely. With Labour thrown on the defensive by last week's attacks on its tax policy, some senior ministers say the Conservatives could go to the polls as early as April 9 after a tax-cutting Budget again puts taxation at the centre of political debate. Yesterday opinion polls in The Observer and the Sunday Express showed the parties neck and neck, with Labour just one point ahead. Tory campaigners made clear that there would be no let up in the attacks on Labour as the party of 'higher taxes, higher inflation and higher interest rates.' Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, used an independent poll of Labour MPs to claim that 57 per cent favour increases in basic income tax rates of 1p or more to finance the party's public expenditure programme. The poll was conducted in the autumn. Tomorrow, Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary, will publish revised costings of Labour's programme, alleging that it will exceed Pounds 35bn. By contrast, Labour plans to regain the initiative by switching its focus in daily press conferences to the Conservatives' record in office since 1979. A senior Labour campaign official said there was a firm conviction in the party that the Tories had played their principal electoral cards too early. 'By the end of next week they will have said all they have to say on public expenditure, yet we are level pegging with them in the polls without even raising our 'winning' issues like health, education and the poll tax,' he said.

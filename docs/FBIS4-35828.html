			<p>BFN     [Text] On the death anniversary of His Eminence Imam  Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, last night the tomb of the  great leader was the scene of a large number of people who had  gathered there to mourn him and to pay homage to him.    Speaking to the mourners, Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri pointed  out that five years after the death of the founder of the  Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeyni's line and path are continuing  strongly, he said that the secret behind the success of the  Islamic revolution is the bond between the ummah and the supreme  leader. He added: With all the knowledge that it has of the  Imam, the Islamic Republic can still not fully understand the  various aspects of his character. The Majles speaker said: It  is a source of pride for the rule of the supreme leader and for  the Islamic Republic to have victoriously stood up for eight  years in front of the entire world of arrogance to defend its  religion and homeland.    Later in his remarks, Nateq-Nuri stressed that our  government  and nation would defend the country's territorial integrity with  its life and said: We believe that regional security is  beneficial to all the regional countries and that irresponsible  remarks and satanic overtures by some regional countries would  not benefit peace and security in the region.    The head of the legislative branch referred to the stances  of  the esteemed leader in support of the Muslims and the oppressed  of the world and said: As far as Palestine is concerned, the  only alternative is that the Zionists leave the occupied  territories and that the Palestinians' sovereignty be  established over their land.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Brussels targets poorest states: Draft budget would double aid to four countries over five years EUROPEAN Community aid to its four poorest members - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - would double over the next five years under budget proposals broadly agreed by the European Commission at the weekend. The overall EC budget, set at Ecu66bn (Pounds 47.38bn) for this year, would rise from its current statutory limit of 1.2 per cent of Community gross domestic product to between 1.35 per cent and 1.45 per cent for 1993-7, according to senior officials. The Commission intends to finalise these proposals on February 11 and announce them to the European parliament the following day. The final decision rests with the 12 heads of government, either at a special summit - probably in May - or at the Lisbon summit in June. However, the larger part of Saturday's special Commission meeting was devoted to the EC's fast-growing financial obligations abroad, particularly towards eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Officials say there is as yet no consensus on external aid, or on the wish of Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, for an industrial restructuring fund to help the EC's defence, car, electronics and textiles industries. The doubling of fiscal transfers to the four poorest countries would be done though big increases in the so-called structural funds, aimed at helping laggard and industrially stricken regions catch up, and through the 'cohesion fund' agreed at December's Maastricht summit. This fund, introduced at Spain's insistence, is to help these countries meet EC environmental standards and improve transport links. The structural funds were doubled in 1988 to Ecu63bn for the 1989-93 period, to help poorer EC areas prepare for next year's single market. The new effort is a shock absorber for economic and monetary union, for which Maastricht set 1999 as the latest date. What has not yet been decided, officials say, is whether the doubling would be for the four countries overall, or each of them individually. 'There is still a lot to play for,' one remarked. Ireland, for instance, receives per capita about double the EC aid Spain receives. The final overall size of the budget will also determine whether industrially declining regions - like Tyneside and Scotland in the UK - have their level of aid increased by a third or a half. There were no clear conclusions, or numbers, attached to the external aid policy debate. According to one official, the Commission is moving towards placing foreign aid as a separate line in the budget, rather than as now, in a miscellany which makes setting priorities difficult. Such a line would have a permanent reserve, enabling Brussels to respond much to emergencies more quickly. Officials say there is little backing so far for any industrial restructuring fund, which would in part regroup existing spending on research and development, training and long-term unemployment. The new budget package has yet to deal with the common agricultural policy, which absorbs nearly three-fifths of EC spending. Well-advanced reform plans envisage higher short-term farm outlays, but the impasse over farm subsidies in the Uruguay Round trade talks has led to doubts whether the reform will survive intact.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Management buys Budge mining side for Pounds 106.5m A Pounds 106.5m management buy-out of the mining division of AF Budge, the civil engineering and open-cast mining group, was completed over the weekend. The buy-out of Budge Mining, the biggest of the open-cast contractors to British Coal, was headed by Mr Richard Budge, one of the two brothers running the AF Budge group. Finance of over Pounds 45m for the buy-out was underwritten by a consortium of investors including Schroder Ventures, Midland Montagu Ventures, Charterhouse Development Capital and Prudential Venture Managers. They are the shareholders of the new mining company, together with its senior management and Mr Budge, who will remain managing director. Debt finance of Pounds 40m was underwritten by Bank of Scotland and Morgan Grenfell. Mr Tony Budge, chairman and managing director of the AF Budge group, said yesterday that the disposal of the mining division was consistent with the Budge board's strategy of concentrating on civil engineering, where the group was a major UK road builder. The buy-out would considerably reduce the group's overall borrowing level, he said. The group was currently tendering for a number of major motorway and building contracts and it was anticipated that turnover for 1992 would be in the region of Pounds 200m. In 1991 it was Pounds 270m, of which Pounds 80m came from open-cast mining. He said that type of mining was very capital intensive and involved equipment costs of Pounds 70m. However, he thought that demand for open cast coal would still be strong. The buy-out was the result of an amicable arrangement between the two brothers. Mr Richard Budge relinquishes his position as deputy managing director of the group, but would still be on the board of Sheffield Airport, where it was proposed to build a short take-off and landing airfield.

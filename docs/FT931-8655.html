			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: Dress sense in Antarctica Trudging to work in February may present as much of a challenge as many of us ever want in finding suitably warm clothing. But for Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Michael Stroud, who have just completed a record-breaking crossing of the Antarctic, suitable clothing required more than just comfort. 'When you're walking across the Antarctic comfort becomes less important than performance,' points out Les Jacques, textile centre manager for ICI Fibres. 'It's a question of life or death.' The performance requirements of polar explorers are peculiar. 'They don't carry a single waterproof item,' explains Oliver Shephard, who accompanied Sir Ranulph on many of his explorations. In the South Pole it simply does not rain. Nor, for the most part of the day, do the explorers require very warm clothing. 'Pulling a 450lb sledge you get mighty warm,' Shephard points out. Instead the main requirement on a continent where winds can reach speeds of up to 200mph are for clothes that are windproof, and 'breathable' - so that perspiration is not held against the skin. If that does happen the moisture can freeze when the garment is removed. That can be life-threatening, as the human body loses heat six to eight times more quickly when the skin is moist, burning up calories. All the fabrics worn by the explorers were man-made. They included specialist 'breathable' underwear, topped by thick, wind-proof trousers and a shirt. Thick jackets, resembling duvets, would be put on each morning. Once the men became warmer the thick jackets would be swapped for lighter, windproof outer clothing. Socks and gloves are made of specially treated fibres to ensure no sweat is retained next to the skin. The technology to produce fabrics incorporating 'moisture management', as it is known, has been pioneered in the sports and ski-wear industry. Aerobic outfits, for example, can be lined with a coating, such as ICI's Tactel, to take the moisture away from the skin and prevent post-exercise chill. Gore-Tex has proven particularly popular as a fabric coating to protect from wind and rain, for mountaineering equipment or ski-wear. Other coatings are being developed: these days some garments are even coated with Teflon, more popularly used on non-stick saucepans. 'It is very easy to make things which are waterproof, windproof or breathable,' says Andrew Geere, marketing manager of Berghaus, which makes mountaineering and other outdoor equipment. 'It's getting all three into a fibre which is very difficult.' Given the effectiveness of the latest high-technology fabrics it is perhaps surprising that recent expeditions have still favoured the duck-down sleeping bed as the favoured form of night-time insulation. And Shephard is rueful that pressure from animal rights groups means explorers can no longer wear animal skins. Wolf-skins, he points out, are far more effective than their synthetic imitators. 'If it keeps the wolf warm just think what it does for you.'</p>

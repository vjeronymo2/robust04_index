			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants may prepare and submit their own request for registration, or have someone act on their behalf. Regardless of whether an application is submitted by the applicant directly, or is assisted by an attorney, friend, relative, etc., only one application may be submitted in the name of each person. Only one notification letter will be sent for each case registered, to the address provided on the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. What Are the Requirements for Education or Work Experience?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law and regulations require that every applicant must have at least a high school education or its equivalent or, within the past five years, have two years of work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years training or experience. A ``high school education or equivalent'' is defined as successful completion of a twelve-year course of elementary and secondary education comparable to that of a high school degree in the United States. Qualifying work experience shall be based upon the most recent edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles published by the Employment and Training Administration of the United States Department of Labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documentary proof of education or work experience should NOT be submitted with the application, but must be presented to the consular officer at the time of formal immigrant visa application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. How Will Cases be Registered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the National Visa Center all mail received will be separated into one of six geographic regions and individually numbered. After the end of the application period, a computer will randomly select cases from among all the mail received for each geographic region. Within each region, the first letter randomly selected will be the first case registered, the second letter selected the second registration, etc. It makes no difference whether an application is received early or late in the application period; all applications received within the mail-in period will have an equal chance of being selected within each region. When a case has been registered, the applicant will immediately be sent a notification letter, which will provide appropriate visa application instructions. The names of all selected applicants will be chosen by July 1, 1995. The National Visa Center will continue to process the case until those who are registered are instructed to make formal application at a U.S. consular office or at an INS office in the United States in the case of those who are entitled to apply for change of status. The National Visa Center will provide additional instructions on what steps to take to pursue their applications for DV&hyph;96 visas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. May Applicants Adjust Their Status With the INS?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes, provided you are otherwise eligible to adjust status, if you are physically present in the United States you may apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for adjustment. Applicants who adjust, however, must first mail completed forms OF&hyph;230, Part I, and DSP&hyph;122 to the National Visa Center. Applicants should ensure that INS can complete action on their cases before September 30, 1996, since on that date registrations in the Fiscal Year 1996 DV&hyph;96 program terminate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Will Applicants Who Are Not Registered Be Informed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No, applicants who are not registered will receive no response to their registration request. Only those who are registered will be informed. All notification letters are expected to be sent within about three months of the end of the application period. Anyone who does NOT receive a letter will know that his/her application has not been registered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10. How Many Applicants Will be Registered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are only 55,000 visas available for Fiscal Year 1996 but more than that number of individuals will be registered. It is likely that some of the first 55,000 persons who are registered will not pursue their cases to visa issuance. Registering more people than there are visa numbers should ensure that all DV&hyph;96 numbers will be used, even though it also risks some registrants being left out. All applicants who are registered will be informed promptly of their place on the list. Each month visas will be issued, according to registration lottery rank order, to those applicants who are ready for visa issuance during that month. Once all of the fiscal year 1996 visas have been issued, the program for the year will end. Registered applicants who wish to receive visas must be prepared to ACT PROMPTLY on their cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

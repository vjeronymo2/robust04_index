			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / British officials pessimistic about BA/USAir deal British officials were last night pessimistic that Mr John Major would secure US government approval for British Airways to buy 44 per cent of USAir during talks with President George Bush today, writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor. As Mr Major arrived last night in Ottawa on the first leg of his North American trip, the officials said the US administration appeared unlikely to drop its opposition to the Dollars 750m (Pounds 476m) deal. The prime minister would press Mr Bush to accept the deal, designed to further BA's ambitions to become a global airline carrier, and would stress that Britain was offering greater access to UK airports for US carriers.

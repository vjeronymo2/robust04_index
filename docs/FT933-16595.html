			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Warburg top in survey SG WARBURG Securities took the title of top stockbroking research company for the third year running in Extel's 1993 Survey of Financial Analysts. James Capel, which dominated the awards for the entire 1980s, reclaimed the number two slot from NatWest Securities which slipped to third. Extel had replies to its survey from 122 fund managers who collectively manage Pounds 725bn of funds. UBS slipped furthest, from 4th to 6th position and was voted as having shown the most deterioration in quality of research. Credit Lyonnais Laing (10th) and Smith New Court (7th) showed the greatest quality improvement and were only a few votes short of UBS. Kleinwort Benson's water team won Extel's 'all stars' team award for the highest number of votes in any sector.  --------------------------------- THE 20th EXTEL SURVEY LEAGUE TABLE  --------------------------------- 1  (1)SG Warburg Securities 2  (3)James Capel 3  (2)NatWest Securities 4  (5)Kleinwort Benson Securities 5  (6)Barclays de Zoete Wedd 6  (4)UBS Limited 7  (7)Smith New Court 8  (8)Hoare Govett Securities 9  (9)Goldman Sachs Intl 10 (10)Credit Lyonnais Laing  --------------------------------- 1992 positions in brackets  ---------------------------------</p>

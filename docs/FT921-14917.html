			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Delhi approves GM components venture GENERAL MOTORS of the US is to set up an Indian joint venture with Hindustan Motors to manufacture auto components, the Indian government said yesterday. The venture will involve an investment of Rs8bn (Pounds 165m), with GM holding a 30 per cent stake. It will export auto components from India to GM's subsidiaries and associates throughout the world. Later the plant will manufacture light commercial vehicles and fuel-efficient cars within Hindustan Motors' existing licensed capacity. The project is one of seven approved by the government yesterday, and brings to 10 the number of big foreign investment proposals since India liberalised its investment laws last July. A foreign equity inflow of Dollars 120m (Pounds 67m) is expected from the 10 proposals. Approval of the seven projects - which include Coca-Cola's re-entry into India after winding up its operations there in 1978 - is a signal to foreign companies that India now welcomes investment. Under the liberalised foreign investment policy, companies can win 'automatic approval' for their proposals, provided their equity share is limited to 51 per cent. A number of areas closed to foreign companies have been thrown open. Coca-Cola will re-enter India through a deal with Mr Rajan Pillai, an Indian resident in Singapore, who controls Britannia Industries. An offshore company incorporated in Hong Kong has been set up, in which Mr Pillai has a 60 per cent share and Coca-Cola 40 per cent. The venture will have a total equity of Rs269m, of which the foreign equity will be Rs177m. Among other proposals approved yesterday was one by General Electric to set up a joint venture with Godrej, the Indian business house, to manufacture white goods such as refrigerators and washing-machines. The total equity of Rs1.2bn includes General Electric's investment of Rs480m. Suzuki Motors' proposal to increase its investment in Maruti Udyog by Rs220m will enable the existing joint venture, in which the government has a share, to increase its capacity, mainly for export. Also approved was Francis Klein's proposal to set up a venture with Gerb of Germany to manufacture specialised vibration-isolating systems for use in power plants.</p>

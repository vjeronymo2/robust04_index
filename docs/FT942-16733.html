			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: O'Reilly to retain Independent stake Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher and businessman, has decided to keep his large minority state in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the The Independent and the Independent on Sunday. Mr O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, paid Pounds 23m for a 29.9 per cent stake in the lossmaking newspaper group. The Irish company could have made a Pounds 1m profit today if it had decided to accept the offer for the shares made by the consortium which controls The Independent. The consortium includes Mirror Group Newspapers, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy. Mr Liam Healy, chief executive of the Irish group, said yesterday he believed that The Independent could be turned around and the investment would be a good one for his shareholders. 'We see considerable scope for both cost and revenue improvements which should transform Newspaper Publishing into a profitable company,' said Mr Healy, who added that his group intended to be a long term and supportive shareholder. If, as seems likely, Newspaper Publishing will have to raise an additional Pounds 20m in some form, the Irish may have to put up another Pounds 7m.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Buderus plans to raise DM165m BUDERUS, the German building materials, heating and kitchen equipment and stainless steel producer 99 per cent owned by Metallgesellschaft, the mining and industrial group, is raising DM165m (Dollars 101.2m) via a share issue. The new shares were offered for sale yesterday by a consortium of seven banks, led by Deutsche Bank, at DM430 a share. This is the first of several 'spin-offs' to be launched by Metallgesellschaft following the purchase last year of the non-paper activities of Feldmuhle Nobel from Stora of Sweden for DM1.45bn. It is likely that the next partial flotation, probably of the Dynamit Nobel plastics and explosives business, will take place later this year. Metallgesellschaft, which owns the stake in Buderus via 80-per cent controlled MG Industriebeteiligungen, will not be taking up its entitlement to new shares. Together with two German banks which own the remaining 20 per cent of the holding company, Metallgesellschaft will receive some DM50m as a result. One reason for the flotation is to make the company's shares more widely available. The company also wants the cash to strengthen its capital base and help finance planned capital investment of DM450m in 1992 and 1993. Buderus had a turnover of nearly DM2.9bn in 1991. For the nine months to end-September, it expects sales of DM2.1bn and pre-tax profits of DM124m. The dividend for the nine-month period will be DM9 per share.</p>

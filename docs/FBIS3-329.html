			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Rebuttal" issued by Mulongo Mukalai and Mpondo Wabanga of </F> the Katanga Parliamentary Group; place and date not given]    [Text] The Katanga parliamentary group of the High Council  of the Republic [HCR] was surprised by the publication of your  article "Katanga Withdraws From the Premiership Race." We found  it surprising because there is no indication whether the author  of the article is Katangese. Moreover, the author's anonymity  is not even disturbed when he speaks on behalf of all members of  the HCR. This is why we insist on making the following  clarification:    Members of the HCR from Katanga Province of all shades of  opinion have formed the Katanga Parliamentary Group governed by  a bureau, which is the sole organ authorized to speak for them.  No decision of the kind mentioned in the article has been made  by its plenary session. A decision to engage in or withdraw  from the premiership race is the responsibility of the plenary  session of their parliamentary group, which acts freely and  independently in matters under its jurisdiction. We therefore  categorically deny this information, which is likely to harm  Katanga's interests. We call on you to publish our rejoinder in  the same place the original article was published for the sake  of justice.    [Signed] For the Bureau of the Katanga Parliamentary Group:  Copresidents Mulongo Mukalai, HCR member, and Mpondo Wabanga,  HCR member</p>

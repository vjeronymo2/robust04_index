			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Serbs to face UN pressure on peace plan THE international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for endorsement if Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic signs up to it - even if Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, holds out against the plan. Such a move, discussed by EC foreign ministers in Brussels after a briefing from Lord Owen, co-chairman of the UN-mandated peace negotiations, could lead to pressure on the Serbs to implement the plan, according to EC ministers and officials. It forms part of renewed efforts to bring greater pressure on Serbia and Bosnian Serbs to agree peace terms. 'You can't apply serious pressure in a vacuum,' Lord Owen said. He judged that 'the most likely next signature is of President Izetbegovic,' adding: 'I don't think Karadzic will sign without a lot of pressure.' Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia have all accepted constitutional principles and defence agreements in the plan, but only the Croats have agreed on a map setting up 10 semi-autonomous areas. 'If we're only held up by Mr Karadzic's signature on the map, it is perfectly justifiable to take that package to the UN Security Council,' Lord Owen said. He got full backing from the 12 for this stance. Lord Owen said he and his co-mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, had ruled out any further changes in the map dividing Bosnia. He believed he could persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia that 'it is a fair settlement'. Mr Karadzic had previously accepted the rest of the plan under pressure from Belgrade. Lord Owen went out of his way to be conciliatory, as well as firm. 'We don't want the Serbs to become pariahs,' he said. 'They are a proud and great nation who have the right to live in Europe,' but had to conform to its rules. Senior officials said that implicit in yesterday's discussions was the possibility of force being used to impose parts of the plan. But the US, Britain and France yesterday rejected suggestions that UN member states should be prepared to use force to implement a peace plan, even if the Bosnian Serbs did not endorse the settlement. In Washington, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said the US would consider using troops only to enforce a negotiated agreement to which all warring parties had subscribed. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said a 'good deal of planning had still to be done' on implementation, but 'no government is talking of fighting your way to a settlement'.</p>

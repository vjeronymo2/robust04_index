			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export, Technology and The Environment 1993: Suddenly the tables are beginning to turn - After a dismal decade, the climate for British exporters has brightened, thanks to new finance facilities and a more competitive sterling exchange rate A DECADE of complaints from British exporters that the government ignores their needs has quietly ended. In recent months, an array of policy reforms have not only answered exporters' demands, but in some cases have been drawn up by the exporters themselves. They range from cheaper export credit insurance premiums and larger sums available for cover in promising markets in developing countries, to a new approach to export promotion campaigns and the appointment of 'national champions' to advise the government on strategy in sectors of export strength. Combined with a devaluation of sterling which has greatly enhanced British export competitiveness, and interest rates that are among the lowest in Europe, they have given exporters a fillip that competitors in many other countries can only envy. 'If a company can't export now, then you have to question whether it should be in business in the first place,' commented a senior official at the Confederation of British Industry. Behind the government reforms is an emerging consensus that the only route to non-inflationary growth, and fresh job creation, is through exports. At a less abstract level, many industrialists talk approvingly of a new mood created by Mr Michael Heseltine and his terrier-like minister of trade, Mr Richard Needham. First signs of a change of heart in government came in autumn last year, when export insurance cover was boosted in a number of 'concentrated markets' - developing country markets such as China, Indonesia or Malaysia where export success had led to the Export Credits Guarantee Department banging its head against country lending ceilings. This was followed early this year by two new export promotion campaigns, one in the European single market, and the other targeted at the US. These were distinctive not just because they included some novel features but because they were the direct result of close consultation between government and industry. Most original was the three-year 'North America Now' campaign, launched early in March, and intended to boost the UK share of US visible imports from 3.8 per cent at present to 5 per cent by 1995. This would boost exports in money terms by about Pounds 3bn a year from the current level of Pounds 12.2bn. Among its innovations are the targeting of 20 US sectors, including services, giftware, mail order, food and drink, airport equipment, construction and clothing - all areas of UK export strength. A total of 50 events are planned in North America over six months focused on export opportunities in these sectors. For major exporters, the campaign will involve discussions intended to pinpoint where the government can best assist in overcoming trade barriers, or define overall trade and investment strategies. For small and medium sized companies, the campaign includes a 'strategic alliances' initiative under which Price Waterhouse has been appointed to work with about 50 companies a year with the aim of introducing them to a prospective US partner. The aim will be to forge between 10 and 15 successful partnerships each year, generating a Pounds 30m contribution to the UK balance of payments. A third fillip for exporters came in the budget, when Mr Norman Lamont announced an average 7 1/2 per cent cut in export credit insurance premium rates, and added Pounds 1.3bn to the credit cover available in 'concentrated markets' over the next three years. Exporters now generally accept that the cost of export insurance premiums has fallen back into line with those offered to competitors in Germany, France, Italy and the US. They continue to complain that high rates over the past two years - often three of four times higher than rates available to competitors - have cost them dear. The most recent reforms intended to aid exporters involve the reorganisation of the Overseas Project Board inside the DTI, the job of which is to ensure close links between the government and industry in bids for big export projects. The government is to appoint 'national champions', mainly drawn from the private sector, who will head 'sector groups' inside the OPB focused on power, water, airports, transport, and oil and gas. They will aim to pinpoint UK export strengths, identify priority export markets, seek joint ventures in infrastructure projects, and look for opportunities for collaboration in developing countries, particularly as they privatise sectors of their economies. Most radically, these 'national champions' will aim to prevent UK exporters competing against each other in efforts to win a foreign contract - a potentially controversial and anti-competitive move which matches practices in countries such as Japan and France which have been fiercely criticised in the past. The aim of the initiative is highly specific - to boost the annual export earnings of large contract exporters from an expected Pounds 10bn this year to Pounds 20bn by the end of the decade. With the specific exception of 'strategic alliances', these changes appear to address the complaints of Britain's 'big industry' much more directly than those of small and medium sized companies - in spite of the fact that the Confederation of British Industry, and other industry organisations, often complain that too few companies account for too large a proportion of British exports. Last year, Britain's top 20 exporters accounted for overseas sales of Pounds 29bn - almost one third of all exports. Changes of greater importance to small and medium sized exporters, such as capital investment write-downs, cuts in corporation tax, an exporters' loan guarantee scheme and bankers' export guarantees, have so far been resisted. Exporters also complain that some of the potential benefits from these various reforms will be lost because of government refusal to reverse plans to withdraw from reinsurance of exporters' political risks, and because of a continuing squeeze on interest margins provided to banks to enable them to remain active in engineering financing packages for exporters. On the reinsurance issue, which leading short term credit insurers such as the Cardiff-based NCM say is forcing them to turn down requests for cover worth about Pounds 4bn a year, negotiations are likely to begin this summer with the ECGD. The dispute over bankers' interest margins - called 'fixed rate export finance', or 'frefs' - is also likely to be settled soon - whether for good or ill. Bankers say the paring of margins demanded by the Treasury in 1987 has led to many banks withdrawing from the export finance field, and put profits under pressure among the dozen banks which remain active. They insist that a further paring back would lead to fresh withdrawals, the main casualties being exporters, who will no longer be able to find bankers on the ground in developing countries to arrange the finance that often forms a critical part of any contract bid. One area where exporters and government are likely to remain at loggerheads is the use of aid to boost export efforts. Britain's own 'Aid and Trade Provision' (ATP) remains small by international standards, with increasing pressure to use limited aid funds for clear-cut aid purposes - like disaster and famine relief. Vigilance has been sharpened at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development against the use of 'mixed credits' - the dilution of commercial loans with grant aid - to help exporters to the developing world. OECD governments agree that the competitive use of aid to provide exporters with subsidised finance is a costly and self-defeating process which ultimately neither helps exporters nor channels aid effectively to developing countries. But exporters continue to press for ATP to be increased, referring constantly to instances where foreign competitors have allegedly tapped aid finance to sweeten the financing of strategic contracts. These efforts to sharpen the export competitiveness of 'UK Inc' face the constant danger of becoming over-simplified and counter-productive. For example, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign investment is a critical precondition for enhanced trade flows. A policy that aims to boost exports without paying close attention to foreign investment and the option of foreign joint ventures is likely to be flawed. There is also a bemusing problem in defining 'UK Inc', such as when GEC, through its partnership with Alsthom, is as well placed to manufacture in France as in the UK, or where Trafalgar House can use a subsidiary in the US to bid for a contract in a foreign market. It is notable that in 1991, 37 of Britain's top 100 exporters were foreign-owned. They include Ford, IBM, Nissan, Kodak and Rhone-Poulenc. Government help for such exporters will help to secure jobs and skills in the UK, but will at the same time boost the profits of these foreign companies. The gains from visible exports are in part offset by the invisible drain of profits and dividends remitted to the parent company, and to investors overseas. The simple lesson is that the interests of multinational corporations do not coincide with those of national governments, and that earnings from invisibles cannot be wholly ignored in the quest for visible exports. These are conundrums that neither UK exporters, nor a government newly-converted to the cause of boosting the nation's exports, care to ponder - at least for now.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY               LOCATION          GOODS AND SERVICES EXPORTED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AES Engineering: Rotherham and         Rotherham, Bradford branch       S.

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (2): Decade of structural change predicted - Sales Forecasts NEW car sales worldwide are expected to contract by 3.0 per cent to 33.02m this year, the second significant decline in the last three years under the impact of sharply falling demand in west Europe and in Japan. Global sales are forecast to recover next year, however, with a 5.4 per cent rise to 34.8m. Continuing steady growth in the following years is expected to take worldwide new car sales to 41.3m by 1998 according to the latest World Automotive Forecast report by DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts. Worldwide new car sales were virtually unchanged last year at 34.05m after peaking at 35.01m in 1990. Sales fell by 3.3 per cent in 1991 to 33.9. Much of the growth next year is forecast to come from North America, Asia and east Europe. Car sales are already recovering in North America this year with an increase of 4 per cent to 9.55m forecast to be followed by a further rise of 6.1 per cent in 1994. The strongest growth worldwide is expected to come from outside the leading traditional car-consuming regions of west Europe, North America and Japan, however. While the DRI report forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand from 1992 to 1998, the main impulses for this growth are expected to come from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and east Europe during the rest of the decade. 'The 1990s are expected to be a decade of structural changes in the pattern of global car sales towards newly developing markets,' says DRI. The US is already a mature market where new car sales are increasingly a function of replacement demand, and the same will be true of west Europe by the end of the decade. The DRI report claims that the best prospects are in Asia-Pacific, where the density of car ownership is still low, and strong economic development is leading to rising disposable incomes. New car sales in China more than doubled in 1992 to 321,000 from 145,000 in 1991, and sales are expected to triple in the next six years to reach 1.05m by 1998. A similar development is forecast for Thailand with sales jumping to 540,000 by 1998 from 121,000 last year and 66,000 in 1991. Latin America and east Europe also offer good growth prospects, says the report. By the mid-1990s, the Latin America is expected to be more than 2m, nearly double the level of the mid-1980s. As east Europe develops and used car imports fall away, new car sales in the region are expected to grow by over 50 per cent in the next five years to 2m a year. The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main focus for growth in car production for the rest of the 1990s with output set to jump from 2.25m last year to 4.81m in 1998. China will account for a large part of the increase with production forecast to rise from 171,000 last year to 950,000 in 1998. After falling steeply for the last three years, car output in east Europe is forecast to recover strongly for the rest of the 1990s with production increasing from the low point of 1.47m last year to reach 2.65m by 1998. The growth in newly developing markets has been unable to compensate in recent years, however, for the downturn in demand in the main industrial countries. The long upward trend in worldwide new car sales, was halted at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s first by the fall of demand in the North American market and then by declining sales in Japan and now in west Europe. West European new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this year to 11.3m from 13.5m in 1992. The outlook for next year is also gloomy with the prospect of only a minimal recovery. The decline in west Europe in 1993 will be steeper than during the recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. Sales in Germany, the single largest market in Europe, are forecast to plunge by 22 per cent, with demand expected to fall by 21 per cent in Italy, 26 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in France. The only market in west Europe that is showing any growth is the UK, albeit from a very depressed level after three years of recession, with sales forecast to rise to 1.77m from 1.59m in 1992. There is little prospect of any sustained recovery in 1994 with sales in west Europe forecast to rise by only 2.9 per cent next year to 11.66m. Modest increases in demand in the UK, France and Spain are expected to be offset by further small declines in Germany and Italy. West European car production is set to fall by 2m vehicles or 15 per cent this year to 11.4m from 13.4m in 1992, says the DRI report. Output is unlikely to regain the 1989 peak of 13.7m until 1996 with the start of a stronger recovery delayed until 1995. The UK is an exception, however, with output boosted by the development of the three Japanese car plants established by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. UK car production is forecast to rise from 1.3m in 1992 to a record 2.1m in 1998. By 1998 Japanese car production in the UK is expected to reach 800,000 cars a year - accounting for around 37 per cent of total British car output and allowing the UK to move from fifth to third place in the European production league ahead of Spain and Italy. Japanese carmakers have fallen under unaccustomed pressure in their domestic market, where sales this year are suffering an unprecedented third successive annual decline. The DRI report forecasts a six per cent drop this year to 4.19m following declines of 8.5 per cent in 1992 and 4.6 per cent in 1991 from the peak of 5.1m cars sold in 1990. Car production in Japan is expected to fall this year by 6.7 per cent to 8.75m from 9.4m last year and the peak of 9.95m in 1990. The impact on production of weak domestic demand has been compounded by lower exports. Shipments from Japan are being affected by the increase in Japanese carmakers' overseas production in particular in North America and in Europe, and also by the weakness of demand in Europe. The Japanese car industry is in the lead in taking advantage of growth elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, however, and shipments to other Asian countries, led by China and Thailand, are becoming much more important in terms of volume. Japanese manufacturers 'will generally be looking to increase output in locations outside of high-cost Japan, certainly as far as supplying exports markets is concerned,' says DRI. 'At the same time, domestic market demand will grow only modestly in the medium-term.' In the US, fragile consumer confidence continues to threaten the pace of recovery from recession, but car sales are rising again in 1993 after four years of decline. Car sales (excluding light trucks) are forecast to rise by around five per cent to 8.79m in 1993 but will still be nearly 3m units below the 1986 peak. The US light passenger vehicle market has been marked more and more by the American fondness for light trucks, however, with four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles, mini-vans (known as multi-purpose vehicles or MPVs in Europe), and pickups increasingly substituting for family saloon cars. US light truck sales are expected to jump by 14 per cent this year to 5.3m units, easily surpassing the previous peak of 4.8m in 1988. While annual car sales are forecast to rise by only 1.1m units from 1992 to 1998, light truck sales are predicted to jump by more than 1.4m in this period to exceed 6m by 1998.

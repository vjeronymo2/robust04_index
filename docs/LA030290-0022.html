			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE TO FACE FORMER TEAMMATE IN 5-AA FINALS  </P> <P> If you can't join 'em, beat 'em.  </P> <P> That would be a fitting motto for Lynwood High senior Linda Watson to carry  into tonight's Southern Section 5-AA girls basketball final at UC Irvine  against top-seeded Morningside.  </P> <P> Tip-off is scheduled for 8:30.  </P> <P> Watson, a Parade All-American last season and Lynwood's leader, transferred to  Morningside as a junior but changed her mind and went back to Lynwood prior to  the 1988-89 basketball season.  </P> <P> Now an opponent, Watson will be the focus of the Lady Monarchs' defense  tonight, as Morningside seeks its third consecutive CIF crown.  </P> <P> "We know her; we know she's a good player," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said.  "Wherever she goes on the court, we're going to try and have a defender in her  face."  </P> <P> Morningside (27-3) hopes to use its height advantage to neutralize Lynwood's  high-scoring guards, Watson and Nicole Sanders. Watson averages 21 points, and  Sanders averages 15 for the second-seeded Lady Knights (25-1).  </P> <P> Morningside's strength is in the front court, led by 6-5 Lisa Leslie (26.2  points, 15 rebounds, 6.5 blocks) and 6-4 sophomore Janet Davis (10 points, 10  rebounds, four blocks).  </P> <P> Lynwood's tallest starter is 5-10 forward Kim Barfield.  </P> <P> "I don't think they match up too well with us inside," Scott said. "We want to  make them go to the perimeter shot. With Lisa and Janet on the inside, we think  it's going to work to our favor."  </P> <P> Scott is also confident that point guard Princess Murray, averaging eight  points and 10 assists, can hold her own with Lynwood's back court.  </P> <P> Morningside has won all three of its previous CIF finals, including a 60-55  victory over Lynwood in the 1988 4-A championship game. The Lady Monarchs beat  Fontana, 71-48, for the 5-AA title last season before going on to capture the  State Division I crown.  </P> <P> Win or lose, Morningside figures to earn a spot in the Southern California  Division I regionals starting Tuesday.  </P> <P> West Torrance (23-4), which finished second to Morningside in the Ocean League,  will play in its first Southern Section girls basketball final at 6:45 tonight  at Cal Poly Pomona when it faces La Quinta of Westminster (26-3) for the 4-A  title.  </P> <P> La Quinta boasts one of Southern California's top players in 6-2 center Amy  Jalewalia, the leading scorer in the Southern Section each of the last two  seasons. The UCLA recruit is averaging 34.2 points.  </P> <P> Jalewalia scored 32 points last week to lead La Quinta to a 60-49 victory over  North Torrance, the third-place finisher in the Ocean League.  </P></p>

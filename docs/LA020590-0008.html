			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> I couldn't help noticing the irony of the photo you printed with the article  "Getting a Grip on Graffiti" (Metro, Jan. 25). It showed a billboard with the  message "HELP US CRUSH GRAFFITI" as backdrop for student volunteers in their  effort to erase graffiti.  </P> <P> By size and quantity billboards create more visual clutter than graffiti (not  to mention the 10 top billboard advertisers are either tobacco or liquor).  </P> <P> If cities really want to take care of their visual environment they should deal  with billboards first. In recent years many enlightened cities across the  country have done just that by banning the erection of more of this worst form  of visual pollution. These include Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Tucson,  Phoenix, Fort Worth, Little Rock, Charleston, Virginia Beach, Jacksonville,  etc. Here in California, Beverly Hills, Santa Barbara and Palm Springs are  among the many cities that never did allow billboards.  </P> <P> TED WU  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

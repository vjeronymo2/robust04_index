			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels meets forecast with 32% rise RESORT Hotels increased its pre-tax profit by 32 per cent to Pounds 6.05m in the year to April 30, in line with the estimate made with the Pounds 20.6m rights issue. The improvement, from Pounds 4.58m, came on turnover of Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 12.2m) and after a net Pounds 428,000 (Pounds 127,000) interest receivable. Earnings per share, however, were depressed to 8.02p (8.98p) as the average number of shares jumped from 48.1m to 66.9m and the tax rate doubled to 11 per cent. The 1-for-2 issue, announced on April 30, will raise the number of shares in issue to about 99m this year. Mr Roland Lewis, finance director, said the tax rate would continue to increase to about 13 per cent. It had been kept low by tax losses in acquisitions and the large capital spending programmes of previous years. This year expenditure would fall from more than Pounds 11m to about Pounds 5m. Resort, launched in 1984 with the backing of Business Expansion Scheme funds and floated (initially on the USM) in 1988, said trading conditions last year were 'among the most difficult we have ever encountered'. It owns 14 hotels and manages more than 30 others, of which 11 in the County and Country Resort chains are to be bought for shares over the next two years, with the rights issue proceeds cushioning the debt to be brought on board. Mr Lewis said this would amount to Pounds 7.5m this year and about Pounds 20m more next year, with gearing estimated to run up to 18 per cent. The immediate effect of the rights issue - the fourth in less than four years - was to wipe out year-end debt of about Pounds 22m, gearing of 40 per cent. Resort said no further calls on shareholders were anticipated in the foreseeable future. Mr Lewis said the profit improvement came from additional management contracts and improved trading in refurbished hotels. Opportunities kept arising to pick up management contracts, especially as the recession led to banks repossessing hotels - a recent example being the Holiday Inn in Daventry. About Pounds 3m of last year's turnover had come from management fees. The occupancy rate at its predominantly three-star hotels was around 60 per cent, a drop of three percentage points in the last six months although that was on a larger stock of bedrooms. A final dividend of 2.25p makes a total of 3.45p (3.4p). The shares gained 2p to close at 57p yesterday, compared with the rights issue price of 63p.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Florence Griffith Joyner, who caused a sensation with her fashion creations in  track and field, will design new uniforms for the Indiana Pacers.  </P> <P> Flo-Jo dazzled the sporting world with the one-legged body suits and  brilliantly colored outfits she wore during the U.S. Olympic trials at  Indianapolis. She set world records in the 100- and 200-meter dashes in 1988  and won gold medals at Seoul in those events and the 400 relay.  </P> <P> "We made an agreement that what looks good on Florence won't necessarily look  good on Greg Dreiling and LaSalle Thompson," said Donnie Walsh, the Pacer's  president at a press conference in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Griffith Joyner said she already has come up with about 13 designs for Walsh to  review. The new uniforms will not be used until the 1990-91 season, after the  league has had a chance to display them in its merchandise catalogues.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEC STOPS COMPANY FROM TRADING IN PENNY STOCKS  </P> <P> In the latest round in a decade-long struggle with penny stock mogul Meyer  Blinder, federal regulators on Friday suspended the firm he founded, Blinder  Robinson, from trading in the low-cost, high-risk securities for 45 days and  from underwriting such offerings for two years.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an administrative action, also  barred Blinder himself from associating with any registered broker-dealer for  at least two years.  </P> <P> Lawyers in Washington for the firm and Blinder were out of their offices  Thursday afternoon and had not returned a reporter's telephone call for comment  by evening.  </P> <P> Lawyers in the SEC's enforcement division were at a conference Friday and also  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Normally, however, such findings are appealable either to the full commission  or to a federal judge.  </P> <P> Blinder, 69, of Denver, and four associates were indicted in February on  racketeering and securities fraud charges by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas.  The indictment followed a 1988 Internal Revenue Service raid on Blinder  Robinson's Denver office.  </P> <P> Blinder Robinson was once the nation's largest penny stock brokerage.  </P> <P> Penny stocks are low-cost, high-risk securities, usually trading for less than  $3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges and thus reliable,  up-to-the-minute information about them is hard to obtain.  </P> <P> That makes penny stocks -- which typically are used to raise capital for new or  small companies -- prone to fraud by unscrupulous traders and promoters.  </P> <P> The SEC action dates back to the early 1980s and has see-sawed through hearings  in the federal courts in Denver and Washington, as well as administrative  actions before the full commission and administrative law judges.  </P> <P> The SEC has accused Blinder and the firm of fraud and manipulative practices  involving the securities of America Leisure Corp., a firm that told investors  it planned to build and operate an Atlantic City, N.J., casino-hotel. However,  it only owned 1.72 acres of land in Atlantic City, an area deemed too small for  such a venture.  </P></p>

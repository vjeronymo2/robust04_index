The foreign  minister spoke to reporters in Jerusalem at a joint news  conference with the vice president of the European Commission,  Manuel Marin. Steve Linde reports:    [Begin recording] [Linde] Foreign Minister Peres said the  talks that would lead to a free trade zone between Israel and  the European Commission will begin on the 21st of February.  Peres said the new trade agreement would represent a new  chapter in relations between Israel and the European Union, and  he spelled out the implications of the agreement:    [Peres] In addition to be raised in the rank so we shall  become an associated member of the European Economic Space,  specifically what we want are the following: to be a full  member of the research and development community. The second  point, economically speaking, is that we would like to be able  to produce in Israel products that will be considered as  products of the Common Market. Thirdly, we would like to extend  and enlarge our participation and the participation on a mutual  basis of the Common Market in public tenders and governmental  tenders. Fourth, we would like to have a slight improvement in  the quota of our agricultural exports, particularly when we are  opening our markets -- as the minister of agriculture has  mentioned already -- to the products of the people of the  territories.    [Linde] The vice president of the European Commission,  Manuel Marin, said the agreement being offered to Israel was  unique and could not apply to any other country.    [Marin] At the end of the negotiation we are going to have  with Israel a free trade zone. Well, this specific situation  concerning trade, industry, research, and technology, etc.,  etc., is only possible to have with Israel, not with another  neighbor, because of the different economic development.    [Linde] The new agreement will replace the more limited  cooperation accord concluded in 1975 between the EC and Israel.  Marin said it was made possible by the Declaration of Principles  signed between Israel and the PLO and reflects the Union's  backing for the Middle East peace process. [end recording]</p>

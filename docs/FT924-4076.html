			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Twelve find an answer to the Danish question 'THE key to re-establishing the whole process of European integration is the Danish question,' a senior European Commission official said yesterday. Although legal and political details remained to be cleared up, it seemed last night that the conundrum raised by the Danish No to Maastricht six months ago could be on the point of resolution. The British plan put forward yesterday to meet Danish reservations on the treaty - and allow a second referendum to go ahead next year - was a delicately worded compromise. It avoids tampering with the text of the Maastricht treaty, but would allow Denmark to remain outside key areas of the treaty such as monetary union and European defence. The general welcome given to the proposals last night - above all from France - indicates that EC governments realise they cannot afford discord over the Danish issue souring next week's Edinburgh summit. The four-point plan involves three clarifying 'declarations' and one 'decision' by the Twelve. Although there was still uncertainty last night over the precise legal status of the package, the latter part of the proposal would exempt Denmark from being bound to follow the key goals of the Maastricht treaty. Critical in this respect is the provision that the special regime for the Danes 'should apply exclusively to Denmark, and not to other existing or acceding member states'. This means that accession negotiations with Denmark's Scandinavian neighbours and Austria and Switzerland would require them to accept not only existing EC law but the full Maastricht treaty. As part of the planned inter-governmental accord between the Twelve, the UK proposal would also require Denmark to give up its right to block its partners' advance towards integration. Article B of the intergovernmental part of the draft accord not only enshrines Denmark's opt-out from a single currency, but establishes that 'Denmark will not, in any way, prevent other governments from proceeding with the realisation of Economic and Monetary Union in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union'. There was, however, apparent disagreement over the crucial point on whether the Danish requirement for exemptions from monetary union, a future European army and EC citizenship would be 'legally binding.' One senior EC diplomat said the Danes were 'softening' this demand after the other members spelt out the risks of Denmark torpedoing the Edinburgh summit. But Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said the UK proposals would provide the legally binding guarantee Denmark is demanding. Danish opposition politicians, who will have their say, also expressed reservations. Mr Bjorn Westh of the Social Democratic Party said: 'There is much that needs to be formulated otherwise and more satisfactorily.'</p>

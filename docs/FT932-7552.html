			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Where zeros came first - The six year record of Scottish National Trust / Doing the Splits THE STRUCTURE of split capital investment trusts can make all the difference. Two trusts might have identical investment records, but with different structures, investors can enjoy (or endure) wildly divergent returns. The experience of Scottish National is a case in point. It moved to a split structure shortly after River &amp; Mercantile in 1987, but with a different, more aggressive structure. When Scottish National's split structure was created, there were several old splits from the late 1960s and early 1970s still in existence. According to Lewis Aaron, analyst at S G Warburg Securities, the problem with the old trusts was that the assets had risen so much over the years, that the trust had more than enough funds to repay the income shares. There was thus no gearing left on the capital shares (gearing in this instance means that when the assets of the trust rise, the capital shares rise even faster). According to Aaron, the idea was that new split capital structures should have 'permanent gearing'. Scottish National was therefore the first trust to create zero dividend preference shares. By growing at a steady rate per year, the zeros were rather like the crocodile in Peter Pan, which relentlessly pursued Captain Hook. The trust manager, like the Captain, is doomed forever to glance nervously over his shoulder, as the zeros doggedly follow him. Only if he wins the race, can the capital shareholders profit. The new structure was launched in the heady days of early October 1987, when the stock market seemed set to rise at 15 per cent per annum forever. Within two weeks, the Crash had ruined that assumption; and the early 1990s saw a slump in the performance of high-yielding shares, which were the major investment area for the trust. The trust's managers have done a good job growing the assets, according to Lewis Aaron, and investors in some classes of the shares have done extremely well. But the gearing has not worked out for the capital shareholders - who have lost nearly 80 per cent of their original investment. As the graph shows, the net asset value of the capital shares has fluctuated enormously, falling from 148.8p at the end of September 1989 to 2.8p at the last year end. In fact, if you allow for the full repayment value of the other shares, the capital shares have no asset backing at all. Scottish National has a small amount (Pounds 1.5m) of 6 per cent cumulative preference shares. But the main classes of shares are: stepped preference, zero dividend, income and capital. The stepped preference shares are entitled to a 5 per cent increase in dividend and asset backing per year. Issued (like all the other major classes of share) at 100p, they are entitled to be repaid at 171p in 1998. At the current share price of 151.5p, the shares are on a gross redemption yield of 8.2 per cent, according to manager Peter Kennedy. In the year to September 30, the net dividend per share was 6.08p. The zero dividend preference shares receive no income but will be repaid immediately after the stepped preference shares. Their scheduled repayment value in 1998 is 325p, equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 11.3 per cent per annum from the 100p issue price. In retrospect, this combination of high growth (which is taxed as capital gain) and security was a fantastic deal. Accordingly, the zeros have more than doubled since issue and the gross redemption yield at the current price of 208p is 8.8 per cent. The trust has sufficient assets to repay the zeros (at the final repayment price) 1.25 times; what in the jargon is called a 'cover' figure of 1.25. Warburg's Aaron reckons 'the zeros and the stepped preference shares are around the right price'. The income shares receive all the revenue of the trust after the stepped and cumulative preference shares have had their fill. Their entitlement to assets steadily grows from 50p per share on issue and will reach 100p at wind-up. The income shares received a net dividend of 8.85p per share in the year to September 30, 1992. However, the trust has forecast that the dividend will fall to 7.5p per share this year, putting the shares, at 91.25p, on a flat yield of around 10.25 per cent. The capital shares receive no dividend but are entitled to all the assets of the trust after all the other classes of share have been repaid. Were the other classes of share to be repaid at their 1998 wind-up value, there would currently be nothing left for the capital shares. According to Lewis Aaron 'you would have to be an extreme bull, not only of the market, but of the high-yielding sector, to buy the capital shares.' He says asset growth of 5.2 per cent per year is needed for the capital shares to get any return at all; 5.75 per cent per year to get back the current price of 23p. There are also warrants which allow the owner to buy capital shares at 300p, but it would need asset growth of 12.5 per cent per annum for these to be worth exercising. Like many other split trusts, the manager Peter Kennedy of Gartmore Scotland has a high portfolio yield (1.5 times the All-Share Index - around 6 per cent at present) in order to offer the income shareholders a good return. He has 15.6 per cent in gilts and 8.7 per cent in convertibles to help produce this income and his list of 10 largest stocks contains several utilities: BT, Shell, Lloyds Bank, BAT, North West Water, Welsh Water, Prudential, Scottish Hydro, Commercial Union and South Western Electricity. Key facts The trust has a market capitalisation of around Pounds 369m and assets of Pounds 343m, so the combined share package stands at a premium to asset value. Gartmore Scotland is paid a management fee of 0.35 per cent of net assets per annum. Board Sandy Struthers, the chairman, is also chairman of J &amp; A Gardner. Other directors are: Charles Connell, executive chairman of the eponymous shipowning company; Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Managers; Peter Runciman, executive chairman of Shanks &amp; McEwan; Gordon Waddell, executive chairman of Fairway (London); and Archie Walker, a director of merchant bankers Singer &amp; Friedlander. Savings scheme details The minimum investment is Pounds 25 per month or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. Buying and selling charges are 1 per cent (plus 0.5 per cent stamp duty on purchases). Gartmore no longer has a Pep specifically tailored to Scottish National.</p>

Zhou Zhekai, secretary general of the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait, will replace Lin Keping as head of the  co-ordination department of the Hong Kong branch of the New  China News Agency (Xinhua), Beijing's de facto embassy here,  according to sources.    Zhou will be in charge of "united front work", which means  liaison and control of "friendly" local organisations in the  territory. Lin, who came to Hong Kong to replace Yang Sing in  1990, is expected to retire. Zhou Zhekai, who is in his early  forties, is a protege of Wang Zhaoguo, a rising party leader who  heads the party's United Front Work Department in Beijing. Zhou  plays a key role in cross-strait negotiations with Taiwan. This  week, he is hosting a round of "unofficial" talks with his  Taiwan counterparts.    Zhou worked with Wang in Fujian Province in the late 1980s,  then moved with his mentor to Beijing when Wang became head of  the party's Central Office for Taiwan Affairs. As a Taiwan  affairs expert, Zhou poses a potential threat to Wang Zhenyu,  the head of Xinhua's Taiwan affairs office.    A reshuffle is also under way within the State Council's  Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Offce (HKMAO). Though not yet officially  announced, this could be the most significant shake-up since  1990, at the time of the promulgation of the Basic Law for the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In 1990, Ji Pengfei  and Li Hou, director and deputy director of the HKMAO, retired  to make way for Lu Ping and other middle-aged cadres. This  time, Wang Fengchao will be made a deputy director, replacing  Wang Qiren, who has been named president of the Bank of China.    Wang's appointment suggested an attempt to maintain a  balance  of power among competing factions, sources said. Wang is  considered relatively moderate compared to Chen Ziying, the  other deputy director, who is in charge of foreign affairs and  negotiations with Britain over the new airport at Chek Lap Kok.  But his appointment does not necessarily mean that Beijing will  modify its hard-line stance on Hong Kong.    Wang's responsibilities will include negotiations on  political reforms and preparatory work leading up to the 1997  transition. He was previously a deputy director of the  Institute of Journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social  Science, but he became involved in policymaking on Hong Kong and  Macao affairs during the late 1980s and participated in last  year's Sino-Hong Kong talks on political reform.    His wife, Lei Yuping, deputy chief of the All China  Journalists' Association, is in charge of dealing with Hong Kong  and Taiwan journalists in Beijing. Her father, Lei Yingfu,  accompanied the then Chinese Communist Party leader, Zhou Enlai,  during the 1946 negotiations with the Kuomintang in Chongqing.    In addition to Wang, three young cadres educated in  Guangdong  in the early 1980s are due to receive promotions. Chen Zuoer, a  department head at the HKMAO, will replace Luo Jiahuan on the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group in Hong Kong, sources in  Beijing said.    Chen Guangming, also a department head, will be transferred  to the Taiwan Affairs Office of Guangdong province, clearing the  way for a promotion for his deputy, Xe Ze, who was Lu Ping's  assistant during the drafting of the Basic Law.    Zheng Liandong, who was involved in drafting the Basic Law,  will also be promoted. In 1990, Zheng was sent to Hong Kong to  join the Chinese team of the JLG as first secretary and later  studied in Britain for one year. Guo Fengmin, leader of the  Chinese side in the JLG, is expected to retire soon. He will be  replaced by Zhao Jihua, director of the separate Foreign  Ministry office handling Hong Kong and Macao affairs.</p>

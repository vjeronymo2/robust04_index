			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Slide show dance - Clement Crisp reviews 'The Percys of Fitzrovia' THE PERCYS of Fitzrovia is the latest confection from Matthew Bourne for his Adventures in Motion Pictures troupe. In his earlier piece Town and Country, and more clearly in Deadly Serious, Bourne set up an Aunt Sally - urban and pastoral life, Hitchcock films - and proceeded to shy his dance grenades at it. His aim has not, so far, proved of the best, but at least his audiences could see the target, and some point, to the exercise. With The Percys of Fitzrovia, the butt of his awful little jokes is unclear, the humour lacks edge, and the movement (for Motion Pictures read Slide Show) minimal and dull. Six characters are shown to us: three male, two female, one (a being in pink knickers and a strawberry blonde bob) undecided. They are the denizens, Bourne would have us believe, of his Fitzrovia - un-mapped territory, as far as I know - and toilers in the field of art. They are not the Bloomsburies, though Ally Fitzpatrick could pass for Carrington, but they posture, flail their arms, and involve themselves in tiny storms of agitation that might pass for artistic ecstasy without infringing on the idea of choreography as anything more than feeble tableaux vivants. Bourne's favoured structural method - popular music as accompaniment to unconnected and vaguely emotional episodes - seems thin, unconvincing. Performances look, not surprisingly, unclear, amateurish. The whole affair is too like family charades for display to a paying public. A thread of sexual ambivalence runs tediously and humourlessly throughout. At his best - in his recent Nutcracker - Bourne has managed an astute blend of organised movement and day-to-day action. The shifts between invention and actuality give such a language its savour, and this, I feel, is lacking in The Percys, which remains obstinately pedestrian. The evening - 90 minutes, but seeming longer - is completed by a re-working of Bourne's Infernal Galop. This started out three years ago as a joke about France, but has now acquired idees audessus de sa gare. There are the voices of Mistinguett, Trenet, Piaf; a vespasienne (which occasions the best gag in the piece), and too much mooning about by performers to songs that have pertinent and potent lyrics which are dutifully ignored. Andrew George is very funny in a mermaid impersonation to Trenet's La mer, as are the three chaps in the vespasienne - peering rather than peeing - but elsewhere the piece takes itself seriously. Perfide Albion. Adventures in Motion Pictures are at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith until Jan 16</p>

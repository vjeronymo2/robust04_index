			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others]    [Text] If in terms of politics the Group of Seven has grown  into a Group of Eight, in economy this is going to happen only  when Russia actually becomes an inseparable part of the  international economic system. This was stated in a Wednesday  interview with Interfax by Sergey Chestnoy who is in charge of  economic cooperation with G7 at the Russian Foreign Ministry.    He said an economic G8 is out of the question now because  Russia is not a full member of the GATT or the OECD. Neither  should it be forgotten that Russian economic reforms have still  a long way to go, Chestnoy said.    The diplomat believes the economic G7 can expand to G8 in  the  foreseeable future. "If everything goes O.K., such a  transformation is possible already in three years", he said.    The official told Interfax that on July 9 the Naples summit  is going to discuss economic matters. On the following day it  will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin and focus on political  problems, in particular the situation in Bosnia, Iraq, the  Korean peninsula and Southern Africa.    Chestnoy also said that after the political debate the  leaders of eight countries will focuss on the situation in  Russia and the progress of reforms. At the end of the meeting  the Italian representative chairing the meeting is going to make  a political statement on behalf of the rest stating the main  points of the debate, the diplomat reported.</p>

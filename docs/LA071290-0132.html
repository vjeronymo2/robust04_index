			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE BLOCKS BAN ON FOOD HANDLERS WITH AIDS VIRUS;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: SEN. HELMS HAD SOUGHT TO MAKE THE EXCLUSION PART OF THE  DISABILITIES ACT. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT LISTING OF DISEASES THAT COULD POSE A  THREAT.  </P> <P> The Senate, facing a second showdown on an emotion-laden issue, reversed itself  Wednesday and rejected an attempt by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to bar persons  infected with the AIDS virus from working as food handlers. The vote was 61 to  39.  </P> <P> While Helms warned that the result might force some restaurants into  bankruptcy, his opponents countered that there was no evidence that AIDS, or  the human immunodeficiency virus that causes it, could be transmitted through  food.  </P> <P> On a 99-0 vote, however, the Senate decided to require the federal government  to draw up a list of diseases that could be spread by food handlers and also  decided that pending anti-discrimination legislation would not override state  or local laws dealing with public health regulations for restaurants.  </P> <P> A Senate-House conference is completing final revisions to the landmark  Americans with Disabilities Act, which would guarantee access to jobs and  public facilities for 43 million disabled persons, and the votes Wednesday were  on measures that would instruct Senate conferees.  </P> <P> Helms argued that restaurant owners and other employers should be allowed to  transfer workers who have AIDS or are HIV-infected from food-handling jobs  because of public perceptions about the disease.  </P> <P> "Call it hysteria or whatever you want, but the vast majority of people who eat  in restaurants don't want their food prepared or handled by someone who has  AIDS or HIV," Helms argued. "They'll stay away in droves. It's a matter of  survival for many, many restaurant operations."  </P> <P> Then, simulating a cook cutting lettuce, Helms said: "A chef with AIDS is  chopping up a salad and he cuts his finger. Do you want to eat that salad? I'd  like to poll the members of the Senate to see who would."  </P> <P> But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a conservative who often sides with Helms,  argued that there is now no scientific evidence to show that AIDS can be  transmitted through food.  </P> <P> "Let science govern," Hatch urged the Senate. "Do what is right. . . . Should a  homosexual be discriminated against? The answer to that is no."  </P> <P> Helms, however, countered: "Science doesn't know the full story."  </P> <P> Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) charged that Helms' proposal was  "based on ignorance, prejudice, myth and fear" that would legitimize  discrimination against persons with AIDS or the HIV virus.  </P> <P> The outcome was a reversal of an earlier Senate vote on the issue. On that  occasion, the Senate went on record 53 to 40 in support of a move by Helms to  instruct Senate negotiators to accept a similar House-passed provision  concerning food handlers.  </P> <P> Another obstacle to final approval of the disability bill was overcome when the  Senate decided to apply the bill's provisions to the Senate itself, while  requiring those complaining of discrimination to use an internal system rather  than filing lawsuits in federal court.  </P> <P> Some senators had argued that they should be subject to the same court  processes as state and local governments and private businesses. A strong  majority disagreed, maintaining that lawmakers could be subject to harassment  by federal judges if such a provision were adopted.  </P> <P> The House also decided to use an internal dispute-settlement board to resolve  complaints of discrimination by disabled employees. By congressional tradition,  each chamber decides for itself on such questions.  </P></p>

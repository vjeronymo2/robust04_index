			<p>BFN     [Text] The World Food Program [WFP] has suspended all  humanitarian aid flights in Angola, because the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has not authorized  the planned flights into areas under its control. The negative  effects of the WFP's measure can already be seen. Mercedes  Sayagues, WFP spokesman for the southern African region, says  that at least two cities are currently facing considerable food  shortages, but the WFP will only resume the flights if UNITA  gives security guarantees.    [Begin Sayagues recording] Yesterday the WFP canceled all  its  humanitarian flights in Angola because UNITA has not authorized  the weekly flight plan. A document will be presented to the  government on 15 June and between 15 and 16 June it will be sent  to Huambo for UNITA's approval. Without this approval the WFP  cannot sent its personnel or aircraft to war zones, risking its  personnel and aircraft. [end recording]    The aid is still being distributed by road in safe areas,  but  Mercedes Sayagues says this corresponds only to a third of the  needs. This is the first time this year that WFP flights have  been totally suspended in Angola. This organization is  supplying about 70 percent of humanitarian assistance  distributed in Angola.</p>

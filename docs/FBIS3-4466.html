With the approval of the Central Military Commission,  a forum on grass-roots political work in the entire armed forces  opened in Beijing. Comrades in charge of political work in  major military units of the entire armed forces and armed police  units as well as representatives from relevant departments  gathered together bearing along their research achievements. To  properly implement the new "Program on Strengthening Grass-roots  Units in the Armed Forces," they studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  thought on Army building. Guided by Chairman Jiang's five-point  instructions of "being politically qualified, acquiring perfect  military skills, having a fine style, abiding by strict  discipline, and ensuring adequate maintenance and supplies,"  they analyzed the situation, exchanged experiences, discussed  problems, and offered many good opinions and measures. The  participants said that the topics discussed at the forum were of  major significance; the forum was held in a timely manner; it  was a mobilization and arrangement for the entire armed forces  to implement the "program"; they were more firmly oriented, had  reached unanimity of understanding, acquired a clear idea of the  key points, and cleared up their train of thought.  <H3>  In Implementing the "Program," There Is a Need To Hold Firm  to the Five-Point Instructions--The Soul and Nucleus of the  "Program" </H3>   Using Chairman Jiang's "five-point instructions" to  standardize and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots  units is the soul and nucleus of the "program" and is also a  prominent characteristic of the "program." The participants had  complete unanimity of understanding on this point. They said:  The "five-point instructions" give full expression to Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period,  reflect the demand of the new situation and tasks for army  building, conforms with objective laws governing the work of  strengthening grass-roots units, and includes the main component  of this work. Therefore, the higher authorities and the lower  levels in the entire armed forces should solidly establish the  concept of using these "five-point instructions" to standardize  and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots units, so that  it will take deep root in our minds. In formulating plans,  assigning tasks, summing up experience, and making performance  appraisals, we should carry out and give expression to the  "five-point instructions." This is the key to implementing the  "program."    Many participants said: The "five-point instructions"  constitute an inter-related organic entity forming the basic  factor of the armed forces' combat effectiveness; they must be  comprehended as a whole and carried out in an overall manner.  Leading institutions should take the overall situation into  account and proceed with their work according to the "five-point  instructions," instead of improperly stressing their work.  Facts have proved that if leading institutions "concentrate on  one thing only," the lower levels will follow suit; if leading  institutions act recklessly, the lower levels will get into a  muddle. Some participants said vividly that if you want to keep  the fire burning, you must poke it from time to time, but not in  a disorderly manner; if everyone pokes it as they like, the fire  will be put out. This is the same with implementing the  "program." Only when the "five-point instructions" are  followed, party committees take charge of the overall work, and  leading institutions and departments coordinate with each other,  provide scientific guidance, and form a combined force, will  companies be able to carry out self-improvement vigorously.    On how to comprehensively strengthen grass-roots units  according to the "five-point instructions," the participants  suggested properly handling these three relations: First are  relations between immediate and long-term interests. In all  tasks, there is a need to make persistent efforts and prevent  eagerness for quick success and instant benefit. Second are  relations between breaking through key points and making overall  improvement. Namely, attention should be paid to weak links in  grass-roots units, one or two key points should be resolved  during a certain period, and at the same time overall  improvement should be taken into account, to promote coordinated  development between various tasks and prevent "concentrating on  one thing only." Third are relations between fulfilling  priority jobs and performing routine work; in routine work,  attention should be paid to cultivating the ability of military  units to fulfill priority jobs and prevent stressing one point  to the neglect of others.    The participants also pointed out that the "five-point  instructions" not only serve as guidance for strengthening  grass-roots units in the new situation, but have also set very  high demands on them. To meet the requirements of "being  politically qualified, acquiring perfect military skills, having  a fine style, abiding by strict discipline, and ensuring  adequate maintenance and supplies," a great deal of meticulous  work and prolonged efforts are necessary. We should acquire a  new attitude and style, should always aim at this objective, and  should not remain content with just being able to prevent  incidents.  <H3>  To Implement the "Program," It Is Necessary to Strengthen  Party Branches </H3>   A company's party branch is its core in exercising unified  leadership and maintaining unity. Strengthening party branches  is not only an important component of the "program," but also an  important guarantee for promoting the fulfillment of other jobs  and serves as a key link in strengthening grass-roots units.  Before attending the forum, many participants conducted special  surveys on the strengthening of grass-roots party branches.  They discovered that in the last few years, with the efforts of  leaders at various levels, grass-roots party branches had made  new progress in strengthening themselves, party members quality  improved, grass-roots party organizations became more perfect,  and their meetings on criticism and self-criticism were ensured.  But there are still many problems. Prominent ones include the  quality of some party members being low and some party branches  being unable to properly fulfill their role. For this reason,  it is necessary to put into effect the 14th CPC National  Congress instruction of "exercising strict management over the  party," to make great efforts to "improve its quality and  fulfill its role," and to do a good job in implementing the  "program."    The participants made the following analysis: The low  quality of party member results from many factors, but the main  factors are that there is no guarantee for education and no  effective enforcement of management. Sometimes, political  education is conducted in substitution for party member  education, during which education aimed at the actual mental  states of party members is lacking. In some units, education is  separate from party members organizational activities,  management, and supervision, therefore education lacks  principles and militant spirit. In the participants' opinion,  to improve the quality of party members, there is a need to  conduct education and exercise strict management simultaneously.  In conducting education, the most important point is to arm the  minds of party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to fundamentally  improve their political consciousness as well as their  determination and awareness in maintaining unanimity with the  party Central Committee and exercising the party's basic line.  In the meantime, in light of party members' special needs,  intra-party education should be carried out with specific  purposes in mind. The party study course system must be upheld  for frequent education on the party's nature, aims, and tasks,  as well as party members' criteria, rights, and duties, so that  they will seriously learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang,  and other fine party members, and constantly improve their party  spirit. This year, in accordance with requirements of the  General Political Department, education will focus on  strengthening faith in communism, upholding the party's basic  line, and wholeheartedly serving the people. In exercising  management, there is a need to persist in the party's regular  activity system so that party members can take part in such  activities, party organizations can boldly exercise management,  and party members are willing to accept such management.    How should the role of a party branch as a combat bastion be  brought into play? Participants' opinions on this can be summed  up in three points: First, attention should be paid to party  branch secretaries and deputy secretaries. In implementing the  "program," stress should be laid on party branches and  prominence given to party branch secretaries and deputy  secretaries so that they will improve their sense of  responsibility for their jobs. In handling the relation between  "being able to do something" and "wishing to do something," it  is necessary to resolve the problem of "wishing to do  something." If someone has a strong sense of responsibility for  his work, he will learn how to do it and can finally do it well.  Some participants, in light of the specific experience of their  units, proposed bringing about three transformations, namely  transformation from assigning adequate numbers of cadres to  assigning good-quality and highly-capable cadres; transformation  from fragmentary to systematic training in terms of training  methods; and transformation from organizational perfection to  ideological stability in terms of strengthening armed forces  units. Second, the mood of observing principles must be  strengthened. Great efforts must be made to remove difficulties  in conducting criticism, to increase the ideological contents  and principles of intraparty activities. We must be bold in  dealing with wrong ideas and unhealthy tendencies, instead of  tolerating them, and we must not allow fellow-villagers'  relations, favoritism, or personal interests to replace normal  intraparty relations. Appraising party members is a good method  to strengthen intra-party supervision. This should be upheld as  a system and the appraisal content and method should be  constantly improved. Third, help should be provided for the  less advanced. It is important to promote the advanced, but the  less advanced should not be neglected. Less advanced party  branches should be given assistance and guidance. If this  proceeds in a planned way and step by step, we will be able to  effectively overcome our weak links and raise the entire level  of grass-roots party organizations.    In Implementing the "Program," the Ability of Cadres  to Train Soldiers Should Be Improved    At the forum, some participants analyzed the causes of  offenses and incidents in their units and pointed out that  following the change in the social environment and soldiers'  backgrounds, many new problems have cropped up in how to train  soldiers. But a host of facts have proved that whether or not  an armed forces unit can train soldiers well generally depends  on the officers and not on the soldiers. There are many factors  causing offenses and incidents, but most of them are related to  the ineffective education and improper methods of cadres. This  suggests that improving the ability of grass-roots cadres to  train soldiers is a subject to be urgently studied and resolved  in strengthening grass-roots units.    How should soldiers be trained well in this new situation?  The participants pointed out that the most important point is  to inherit and carry forward the Army's fine tradition in  training soldiers. Despite the change in the era, the Army's  experience in training soldiers has not changed, and this  experience portrays the Army's fundamental characteristics.  Regarding "separation from soldiers" of some grass-roots  cadres, some participants said that to improve their ability to  train soldiers, their basic attitude toward soldiers should be  changed and they should be made to understand soldiers' feelings  and love them. Cherishing deep feelings is in itself a coherent  force. Present-day young people have strong concepts about  making their own decisions and democracy; they should be  understood and respected instead of being abused or given  corporal punishment. Only when you have close feelings for  soldiers, will they regard you as their brother, tell you about  their feelings, and listen to what you say. Some participants  cited an example of cadres unfairness in treating soldiers, to  prove that cadres must establish an image of uprightness in  improving their ability to train soldiers. If cadres are not  honest or upright, soldiers will resent it. Particularly on the  questions of joining the party, learning technology, studying  for degrees, switching to professional noncommissioned officers,  promotion to higher levels, and other issues involving soldiers'  interests, cadres must treat soldiers equally without any  discrimination and must not practice favoritism.    How should strict management be combined with patient  persuasion? This is also a question to be resolved in improving  the ability of cadres to train soldiers. Some participants said  that another noteworthy point is that whenever soldiers have  shortcomings, faults, or errors, they are punished instead of  being given patient persuasion. This is an irresponsible  attitude and is quite harmful. Strict management over soldiers  is necessary, but there must be a limit. We should be  reasonably and logically strict; we should follow rules and  regulations and must not formulate local policies which are  different from these rules and regulations. Our strictness  should also produce results, uniformity should be achieved  between motive and result, and patient and meticulous persuasion  is a must.    The participants said that leading institutions undertake a  heavy responsibility for improving the ability of grass-roots  cadres to train soldiers. Some armed forces units have provided  all kinds of training courses to help cadres master the basic  method of training soldiers; some leaders frequently go to the  grass roots to lecture on traditions in training soldiers; and  some have purposely put pressure on grass-roots cadres so they  can gain experience through practice. All these are worth  propagating. Some participants also said that in helping  grass-roots cadres improve their ability to train soldiers, it  is also necessary to assist them in studying new situations and  resolving new problems. As of 1 March, the entire armed forces  began to introduce a five-and-a-half-day work week system. On  the one hand, soldiers' rest time must be guaranteed and must  not be willfully used for other purposes; on the other,  management must be strengthened, and during their rest time,  soldiers can be organized to study scientific and cultural  knowledge and carry out healthy and useful recreational  activities.  <H3>  In Implementing the "Program," Leading Institutions Must  Cultivate the Idea of Serving the Grass Roots </H3>   The "program" has not only clarified the criteria and tasks  for strengthening the grass roots, but has also set explicit  demands on how leading institutions should make a success of  grass-roots work. In a sense, leading institutions have heavier  responsibilities. Reviewing the practice of improving the grass  roots, participants pointed out that in the last few years,  leading institutions at all levels had done a great deal and  made achievements in improving the grass roots; but they should  not relax their efforts. Busily engaging in courtesy activities  with people at the higher level, some leaders cannot concentrate  their efforts on improving the grass roots; others lack  unremitting efforts and are unwilling to do prolonged and solid  basic work; still others have set low requirements, concentrate  their efforts on their work only when problems crop up, and  relax their efforts when the situation turns for the better.  All these suggest that these comrades do not have an adequate  understanding of the importance of the basic position of the  grass roots or the prolonged nature and arduousness of improving  the grass roots and laying a foundation. Improving the grass  roots is a process of gradual and continuous development. It  takes prolonged and unremitting efforts to improve the grass  roots and lay a foundation. We frequently speak of "unshakeable  barracks with changeable soldiers." A company's personnel,  tasks, and environment keep changing; old problems may have been  resolved, but new contradictions will arise; some jobs are  fulfilled today, but on other occasions some jobs are left  unfinished. Now there are many new situations and new problems  to study and many difficulties and weak points to resolve.  There is a need to keep improving the grass roots all the year  round and to consolidate the foundation all the year round.    The participants had this same feeling: In the final  analysis, leading institutions should serve the grass roots.  With service in mind, they will work out measures and methods  and go into action. Some comrades said: "When you do something  heart and soul, you can think out all kinds of methods." In  serving the grass roots, one should not pay lip service only,  the important thing is action. There have already been explicit  regulations and requirements on reducing checking, assessments,  and appraisals; on strictly controlling the number of meetings  and high-level courtesy activities; on sorting out all kinds of  registration books and statistical reports; on prohibiting the  higher level from asking companies for written material; on  leaving some room for work assignments; on prohibiting the  retention of funds, equipment, books, and magazines to be  delivered to the grass roots; on ensuring annual vacations for  grass-roots cadres; and on prohibiting leading institutions from  borrowing grass-roots officials and soldiers to help with their  work. Now the most important thing is to put these into effect.  As long as we really keep the grass roots and our soldiers in  mind, we can think out more methods and do more for the grass  roots.    Many participants said that brigade- and regimental-level  institutions are the forefront headquarters and are the leaders  and organizers in improving the grass roots. Divisional-level  leaders and institutions must step up their efforts to  strengthen brigades and regiments and bring into play the role  of brigade and regimental party committees as well as their  institutions. They should take this as an important link in  implementing the "program" and improving the grass roots. Years  of experience suggest that for brigades and regiments to display  their role as the "forefront headquarters," they must do a good  job in these two aspects of work: The first is to be good at  carrying out integration. Some brigades and regiments like  either to cram the grass roots with the higher authorities'  instructions or return the instructions to the higher  authorities after circulating them from one institution to  another. This is an important reason why job fulfillment is not  ensured and confusion occurs at the grass roots. We frequently  say that there are several thousand threads above, but there is  only one needle below. Brigades and regiments should be good at  acting as go- betweens. Brigades and regiments must have  uniformity between their responsibility to higher authorities  and their responsibility for lower levels. They must be good at  creatively working out methods to implement the instructions and  requirements of higher authorities in light of their specific  conditions. The second is to exercise face-to-face leadership,  so that brigades and regiments can obtain information from the  forefront, carry out inspection and supervision over the  forefront, resolve problems in the forefront, and provide  service and supplies to the forefront.    Representatives from major armed forces units and armed  police units briefed the forum on how they implemented the  "program" and their future plans. Huang Jianhong, Tian Shugen,  Tang Guangcai, Yuan Shoufang, Wang Tongzhuo, Lei Mingqiu, Jiang  Futang, Hu Yanlin, Xu Chengdong, Wang Hongfu, Xu Ruichen, Zhang  Yuzhong, Hu Guiyou, and Yang Deqing spoke at the forum. Zhao  Changshan and Zhou Erjun delivered written speeches. Dang  Zhongkui, Mao Fengming, and Song Wenjiu attended the forum.</p>

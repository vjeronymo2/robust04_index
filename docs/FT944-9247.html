			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Piper European net assets slip Piper European Smaller Companies Trust, which aims to achieve capital growth through a portfolio of companies, excluding the UK, valued at less than Pounds 250m, had a net asset value of 92.6p per share at September 30, against 94.4p at mid-April's launch. Directors stressed, however, that the 1.9 per cent fall represented an outperformance of the trust's benchmark - the James Capel Smaller European Companies Index (4th Quartile) - which dropped 5 per cent. Net revenue was Pounds 59,000 for earnings of 0.58p per share.</p>

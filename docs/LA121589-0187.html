TRANSIT TO HIKE FARES 15%  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted today to increase transit  fares, raising the New York City subway fare from $1 to $1.15.  </P> <P> The new fares, most of which represent an increase of about 15%, take effect  Jan. 1.  </P> <P> They range from the 15-cent increase for subways and buses to a 50-cent rise to  $4 for express buses in Queens and Staten Island and an 85-cent increase to  $6.35 for the JFK airport express train.  </P> <P> The board approved the changes as demonstrators waved signs protesting the fare  hike and chanted, "Do the right thing!

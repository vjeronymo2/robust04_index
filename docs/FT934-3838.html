			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: EDP slips to Pounds 4.67m as interest income falls Electronic Data Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software and services group, reported slightly lower full year profits reflecting a decline in net interest income. Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 slipped to Pounds 4.67m, compared with Pounds 4.88m, as net interest receivable declined to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 784,000). Earnings per share were 35.14p (38.4p), partly reflecting a higher tax rate, but the proposed final dividend is increased to 3.5p, making a total of 5.5p (5.1p). The group also plans a 2-for-1 scrip issue. Turnover fell to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15.5m), including Pounds 1.1m from last November's US acquisitions. The fall reflected the continued sharp decline in computer equipment prices. Recurring service revenues, including the licensing of the group's Merchant software package, continued to run at about Pounds 8m a year while system and solution sales fell from Pounds 6.64m to Pounds 5.8m. Operating profits increased to Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 4.09m) despite a Pounds 540,000 increase in research and development expenditure to Pounds 1.41m. The US acquisitions, Via Systems and Open, incurred a Pounds 106,000 loss, but are expected to break even this year. Mr Michael Heller, chairman, said the most significant development was the introduction of UniVision, an advanced database management system.</p>

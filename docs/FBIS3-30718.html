			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the National </F> Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ, by Anita  Elo; place and date not given: "According to Szajer, the  Agreement With the Alliance of Free Democrats Is Not in Danger  -- The FIDESZ's Goal Is To Replace the Coalition and To Defeat  the Socialists"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Elo] Four years ago, you  firmly opposed the government's policies. Has the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] or the Federation of Young Democrats  [FIDESZ] changed since then?    [Szajer] If we compare [FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban's  budget speeches, we can see that the 1993 speech was a much  tougher criticism of the government than the 1990 one.  Presumably, in 1990, the press more markedly emphasized that it  was a speech in opposition to the government.    [Elo] We can hear the FIDESZ mentioned together with the MDF  increasingly frequently. Does this mean that you are starting  to befriend the party in power? Is it a gradual withdrawal from  the opposition role?    [Szajer] Anyone who, three months before the elections,  expects to get into power through the MDF is making a  miscalculation. Hungarian citizens will have this government  coalition replaced at the next elections. It can only harm us  if we are seen to be on the same platform as the MDF. What  would be the point in befriending a party in power that will  only last a few weeks or months?    [Elo] Then what is the reason for the change? I do not  suppose you want to attribute this to the media's  manipulations....    [Szajer] No, I do not, but somehow it has become a public  view, although there is no basis for it.    [Elo] Let me remind you of Orban's mental experiment when he  drew the picture of a coalition to be formed with the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the MDF.    [Szajer] In Hungary, it is accepted that a so-called social-  liberal coalition will have to be formed after the elections.  All Orban said was that at least another five other versions  are also possible and the coalition possibilities should not be  predetermined.    [Elo] Nevertheless, this means that you would also enter  into a coalition with the most criticized government parties.  Do you not feel this as a significant shift in the FIDESZ's  policies?    [Szajer] The FIDESZ's goal continues to be to replace the  current government coalition and to end up in front of the  socialists. This was our goal in 1990, but we did not manage to  achieve it. We are criticizing the MDF government just as  firmly and severely as in 1990. In 1993, a new element was  added with the increase of the socialists' chances to get into  government. We are very strongly criticizing several elements  of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] policies because, in  the future, they can be detrimental to the country, and we  cannot forget about past experiences, either. At the same time,  I can perceive a shift to the left in public opinion; therefore,  someone who remains in the same place appears to be moving to  the right. [passage omitted]    [Elo] The liberal bloc has not even made its election  agreement and conflicts have already surfaced. In fact, some  people even think that the FIDESZ's agreement with the Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is in danger.    [Szajer] We initiated this agreement a year ago. We have  always had some friction between the two parties and will always  have them since we are two independent organizations. [passage  omitted]    [Elo] What can the FIDESZ expect from cooperation with the  Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party?    [Szajer] Through this, the liberal bloc almost covers the  whole society. The FIDESZ has a disposition of a people's party  and it can talk to the country's citizens regardless of which  strata of society they belong to. The SZDSZ mainly has a basis  among the intelligentsia. The Entrepreneurs' Party represents a  very important group in the economic change of the regime, and  the fourth is an agrarian party.

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Kow-towing to the Chinese: The historical context of Douglas Hurd's visit to Beijing DOUGLAS Hurd is a man with a keen sense of history, so I imagine that he is well aware of the historical echoes resonating around his current visit to Beijing. It is 200 years, almost to the month, since the first attempt by the British government to establish relations with China. While Hurd was meeting only his opposite number, the Chinese foreign minister, Qian Qichen, his predecessor of 1793, Lord Macartney, sought nothing less than an audience with the emperor, the 83-three-year-old Qianlong. Macartney wished to open China to British trade, and to establish a British embassy in the Celestial Kingdom. Hurd merely aspires to smooth over the difficulties in negotiating the condition in which Britain hands Kong Kong back to China. Macartney had a much bigger incentive than Hurd will ever be given for diplomatic breakthrough. King George III had promised him an earldom if the mission was a success. Macartney failed, because he omitted to do something which the British foreign office has since learnt well. He refused to kowtow to the emperor. The kowtow, as Qianlong's mandarins attempted to teach the British emissary, involved kneeling and prostrating before the emperor, not once but nine times. Macartney proposed that he should treat the emperor as he would his own sovereign: stoop on one knee and kiss hands. This suggestion outraged the court of the Manchu emperor. In particular, the idea that anyone should dare to touch Qianlong was blasphemous. Macartney believed he was representing a sovereign of similar stature to the Chinese ruler. Indeed, in terms of geographical extent if not population, the British empire was greater than China's. What Macartney failed to understand was that the Manchu court considered China, the Middle Kingdom, the only true sovereign power on earth; the emperor was the earth's divinely appointed ruler. Any other potentate could aspire only to the status of vassal. Macartney and the other 700 members of the British delegation, were 'paying tribute' to their true ruler. So when Macartney referred to George III as Qianlong's 'friend and brother,' the Chinese Emperor told his mandarins that this was 'unpardonable nonsense.' Macartney finally left Chinese waters in 1794, angry and disillusioned, although he was fortunate, perhaps, not to have experienced the fate of the first Portuguese ambassador to China, who had died in a Chinese prison, having been convicted of 'disrespect for customs.' By 1839, nothing had changed. When the Chinese finally stirred themselves to impound opium which the British were attempting to export to China, the mandarin responsible, governor-general Lin Tse-hsu, wrote to Queen Victoria: 'Honourable chieftanness - We have heard that in your honourable barbarian country the people are not permitted to inhale the drug. How can your seeking profit by exposing others to its malefic power be reconciled with the decrees of heaven? You should immediately have the plant picked up by the very roots . . . 'Then not only will the people of the Celestial Kingdom be delivered from an intolerable evil, but your own barbarian subjects will be safeguarded against temptation. On receipt of this letter let your reply be speedy, advising us of the measures you propose to adopt. Do not evade or procrastinate. Earnestly reflect hereon. Earnestly obey. And then, displaying a devout sense of duty and a clear apprehension of celestial principles, you will have the approbation of the great sages, and Heaven will ward away from you all calamities.' Lord Palmerston kept this corker of a letter from Queen Victoria. Within two years, however, the Manchu empire got a response. The emperor's summer palace was sacked by a British force and Britain seized Hong Kong as a base for the export of opium into China. Now Hurd, barbarian emissary of honourable chieftanness Elizabeth II, is in Beijing trying to hand Hong Kong back in a manner acceptable to the court of Deng Xiaoping. I hope he has packed his knee pads. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Brcko, May 22 (TANJUG) -- Colonel Slavko Guzvic of  the Bosnian Serb Army on Sunday insisted with the command of the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina  to publish an official report about the attack on the Serb town  of Brcko in northern Bosnia on Saturday [21 May]. A team of the  U.N. military observers in Brcko, headed by British Captain Sean  Fawcett, on Saturday inspected the scene of the attack and  established from where it had come, Colonel Guzvic told TANJUG.    While inspecting the place where the first shell had landed,  Captain Fawcett and his team found the remnants of a rocket  fired from a multiple rocket launcher which had visible Croatian  Army markings on it. Five people were seriously wounded,  including a one year-old girl, in the simulataneous shelling of  Brcko from the Croat-held village of Vucilovac eight kilometres  west of Brcko and from the territory of neighbouring Croatia.    Brcko is situated at the neck of the strategic corridor  along  the Sava river which links the western and the eastern parts of  the Bosnian Serb republic. The material damage from the latest  attack is considerable.    Captain Fawcett declined to comment on the attack and said  he  would submit a detailed report on it to his command.</p>

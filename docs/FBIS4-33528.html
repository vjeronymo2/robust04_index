			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Former Argentine  Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who is the OAS and UN special  envoy to Haiti, stated today -- 6 June -- that there is very  little time left to find a peaceful solution to the Haitian  crisis.    Upon urging 34 foreign ministers of OAS member countries who  are attending the 24th OAS General Assembly to issue "a  diplomatic ultimatum" to the Haitian military to relinquish  power, Caputo said: "We do not have a year left; we only have a  few more weeks to resolve the crisis peacefully."    Caputo, who gave a detailed account of the Haitian situation  and reported numerous human rights violations in that country,  stated that the international community must issue an ultimatum  to the Haitian military because "we only have a few more weeks  to resolve this peacefully."    Caputo indicated that if the international community  continues to let time go by without taking action, armed  intervention in the Caribbean island will become necessary. He  said: "Just as we condemn armed interventions, we should also  condemn the lack of action that is leading us to a void. We  cannot simply condemn intervention while doing nothing to  prevent it."    Speaking at an ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers on  Haiti, Caputo bluntly stated that it is "intolerable that only  7,000 armed men (the Haitian military) are forcing the will of  the entire international community."    Caputo, who admitted to having overlooked diplomatic  practice  to urge the OAS states to decree an ultimatum against the  Haitian military, stated that the UN sanctions and those  recommended by the OAS are not yielding the expected results.    He added that action should be taken to enforce those  measures adopted earlier, which are not being observed, before  discussing the adoption of new ones.    After reviewing the Haitian situation and the Haitian  military's persistence in staying in power, Caputo stated that  three main objectives must be accomplished: force the generals  to leave power, reinstate democratically elected President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and send an international mission to the  island to guarantee protection to the new authorities and  provide assistance to the population.    Caputo reported that the mission of human rights observers  to  Haiti reported 210 out-of-court executions from 1 January to 13  May this year, and that there are countless cases of other human  rights violations committed by the military forces.    Commenting on the Haitian domestic situation, Caputo stated  that the appointment, a month ago, of a provisional president by  the military was not supported by leading Haitian businessmen  themselves, who have been allies of the coup plotters, thus  showing that there is no consensus within the island.    Caputo added that the worst thing is that General Cedras "is  convinced that he will remain in power until 1997 -- when  Aristide's constitutional term expires -- and that no one, not  even the international community, will force him to relinquish  power."    In his closing remarks, Caputo said that he believes "there  is still room for a diplomatic solution," but there is not much  time left to achieve it.    Caputo added that the sanctions that have been adopted must  be enforced, and that an ultimatum must be given to the  military. Caputo said: "We must make the Haitian military  understand that we are giving them a last chance, and that if  they do not leave...."    Caputo noted that if the international community fails to  find a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, it would be  proof that "we have failed in building the much-desired  international system to defend democracy."    Caputo addressed the ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers  a few minutes after President Aristide suggested the need for an  armed action against the coup plotters who usurped power in 1991.    Speaking to the OAS foreign ministers, the Haitian  constitutional president stated that the international community  must take quick, powerful action to overthrow the military who  had forced him out of power.    The other speaker at the special meeting was OAS Secretary  General Joao Baena Soares himself, who advocated a peaceful  solution to the Haitian crisis.</p>

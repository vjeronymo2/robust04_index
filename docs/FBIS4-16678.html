			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Slobozhanyuk "Military Observer's Notes": "NATO </F> Is Coming To Teach Us"]    [Text] These two reports, which created serious alarm  among our readers, came close together. First the press  provided information on the upcoming joint exercise by the U.S.  3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th Motorized Rifle  Division for the purpose of rehearsing cooperation in  peacemaking actions. A little later we learned of the bombing  strikes by U.S. peacemakers in the south of Bosnia. The  southern Urals and southern Bosnia are separated by many  thousands of kilometers, but the upcoming event and the past one  are tied up in a tight and intricate logical knot.    Our own correspondent Ivan Gavrilenko reports that the news  of the military maneuvers on the Totskiy range elicited a  sharply negative reaction from the peasants of Orenburg Oblast,  which was singed by the flash from the first atomic explosion  conducted in the Soviet Union.    Until recently the Totskiy range, where the exercise is  planned, was top-secret. This region also has other military  installations which are of undoubted interest to foreign  specialists, and it has to be thought that the Pentagon will  certainly not be sending new recruits to Russia.    We have managed to ascertain from the Ground Forces Main  Staff that the measure is being conducted in accordance with the  plan of contacts between the armed forces of Russia and the  United States. No more than 250 servicemen will be involved on  each side. The Americans will land up to 50 units of wheeled  equipment at the Totskiy Training Center, where they have  already been to reconnoiter. Joint actions will be rehearsed as  part of a peacemaking force from 6 through 14 July.    A detail of some importance: In the opinion of the military,  this measure will not require of us any unplanned expenditure,  since one of the 27th Division's regiments is due to hold a  planned exercise at precisely that time. But the Americans will  have to fork out $2 million. They will pay our military to  operate engineer equipment and for fuel, lubricants, water,  food, and all the services provided. So there is even an  opportunity to earn a little currency.    In general, the Russian military leaders have, at first  sight, undertaken a good and profitable thing. It is  undoubtedly necessary to strengthen and develop contacts between  the two countries' armies. But how are we to avoid the  importunate questions of fellow citizens? Why do the Americans  need to send over their aircraft together with servicemen and  hardware from the German city of Wuerzburg, where the 3d  Infantry Division is stationed, right over to the Urals, deep  inside Russia? Would it not be simpler to hold exercises of a  very simple nature at Khodynskoye Pole, for example, or  somewhere in Moscow Oblast?    Interest is also aroused by the NATO division's highly  original service record. It performed "peacemaking" combat  operations in Korea and Iraq. Where will future itineraries  take it? To the former Yugoslavia, maybe. General M. Rose,  commander of the UN troops, needs just such decisive combined  units. The whole world shuddered at the blasts of the bombs  dropped by NATO aircraft in southern Bosnia, but the general is  insisting on new strikes. The U.S. President has pronounced a  sentence which sounded roughly as follows: We work closely with  Gen. Rose, and I believe that his aggressiveness is a good thing.    Here are peacemakers for you!    Our newspaper has already written about the political  aspects  of the recent NATO action. Let us touch on the military  aspects. We are seeing for the umpteenth time that NATO has  very mediocre airmen in its ranks. Obviously embarrassed, a  White House official spokesperson recently declared on  television that one of the U.S. pilots tried to drop four bombs  on the Serbs, but succeeded in releasing just three, and two of  them did not explode. It also is not entirely clear what was  destroyed as a result of the bombing strikes -- a tank or a  medical vehicle. It is perfectly clear that peaceful people  died as a result of those raids.    It is worth recalling that U.S. pilots were also  distinguished by similar results in Iraq three years ago: They  aimed at military targets but hit peaceful houses and even their  own positions. Incidentally, they have also distinguished  themselves during these days: They downed two of their own  helicopters with accurate rocket fire and dispatched 26 officers  to the next world.    The punitive actions undertaken by the United Nations  without  coordination with Russia have sharply exacerbated the situation  and galvanized combat operations by the opposing sides. But  maybe the politicians will realize that neither bombs nor  missiles can bring the Serbs to their knees. Only a peaceful  way out of the crisis will be productive.</p>

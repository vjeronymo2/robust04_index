			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'FLATLINERS' PARTY TO BRING REAL STAR POWER TO FESTIVAL  </P> <P> THERE'LL BE some real star power at the Deauville Film Festival in France. For  instance, Columbia's hot hit "Flatliners," which is No. 3 at the box office and  has made $30 million in just two weeks, will field producer Michael Douglas,  director Joel Schumacher and two of the movie's most fascinating actors, Julia  Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland.  </P> <P> They arrive in France on Sept. 1 to "make nice" with the press and to make a  little whoopee.  </P> <P> MORE MADONNA: Gloria Ruiz, a reader of this column, has taken me to task  because I criticized 2 Live Crew and not Madonna.  </P> <P> I don't always like Madonna's off-color jokes from the stage. (One she told her  French Riviera audience was in gaspingly bad taste and anti-female, but I  figured maybe Madonna didn't realize what she was saying.) However, for all her  crotch grabbing and exhibitionism, underneath Madonna's popular image is a  humanist one.  </P> <P> Madonna doesn't encourage a society that abuses women physically, nor one that  attacks gays or blacks. Even in her outrageous "Blond Ambition" tour recently,  she made sure there were references to safe sex and condoms. Despite the  controversy she arouses and those she offends, she is still a responsible  performer who cares about issues -- AIDS, the environment, racism. She speaks  out for causes.  </P> <P> There's a big difference between "trashy" behavior (that's in the eye of the  beholder, I guess) and rapping about physically damaging women during the sex  act. And how much "fun" it is to do so. Children are more likely to be hurt and  to hurt others from the latter.  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about the "literary ladies" coffee to which Eleanore Kennedy  invited women in the Hamptons so that they might meet her pal Ivana Trump.  </P> <P> The ladies were asked to wear miniskirts. Some of them did.  </P> <P> EVEN IN crisis, there are jokes. The Washington gag goes that President Bush  will name Roseanne Barr as our new ambassador to Iraq.  </P></p>

Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was  received in the Vatican this morning by the pope. Giuseppe De  Carli reports:    [De Carli] Mate Granic knows that the pope is not going to  give him an easy time during their talks. He also knows that  the Holy See's position is not the same as two years ago when  the Vatican encouraged Croatian Catholic separatists by  recognizing the new republic. At the time, it was a question of  freeing Croatia from central Communist control in Belgrade, but  no one expected the breakup of the multi-ethnic state to lead to  the horrors of Bosnia- Herzegovina.    On several occasions the Vatican has rebuked Bosnian  Croatian  Catholics who, together with Bosnian Serbs, are involved in  dividing up the country. John Paul II has reiterated the ideas  expressed in the Justice and Peace Committee's recent document:  The international community cannot stand back and impotently  look on as minorities are expelled or peoples exterminated.    According to semi-official sources, the Vatican has  reportedly asked Granic for explanations about the direct  involvement of Zagreb's regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Granic's reply was the same as the one he had given in talks  with members of the Italian Government. Finally, a development  confirmed by Navarro-Valls, director of the Vatican's press  room, has caused a sensation -- the pope wants to visit former  Yugoslavia, Sarajevo included.</p>

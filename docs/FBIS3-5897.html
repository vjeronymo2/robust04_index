			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yi Chang-sop from the "Special </F> Report" section: "US Urged To Scrap Retaliatory Bill"]    [Text] Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong yesterday expressed  a serious concern over negative effects the U.S. "retaliatory"  financial bill will have on the domestic and foreign financial  markets. A passage of the bill will result in contracting,  rather than expanding, the domestic and global financial  markets, Hong said in an interview with THE KOREA TIMES.    He said Seoul will dissuade Washington from introducing the  bill on the Fair Trade and Financial Services, often called the  Riegle bill, as it will be used as a tool to put pressure on  Korea and other countries to open their financial market wider.  He said, "I can not exclude the possibility of the passage of  the bill, which will reciprocate against countries which do not  guarantee full national treatment to American financial services  firms."    Washington has threatened to use the bill to restrict the  American operations of international financial institutions  until and unless foreign countries committed to opening their  markets to U.S. financial institutions. A passage of the bill  will arm the Treasury Department with more leverage to put  pressure on Korea for opening its financial markets, he said.    Hong excluded the possibility that Washington might use the  forthcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance  ministers meeting as an opportunity to pry open financial  markets of the other countries. "The meeting, scheduled to be  held in March 18-19 in Hawaii, is a forum for discussing  multilateral issues, not bilateral ones," he said. "The APEC  meeting is to share our experiences with other members, not to  discuss bilateral issues," he said, adding that APEC finance  ministers will discuss multilateral issues to addresses some of  the challenges facing the region, including ensuring  non-inflationary regional growth, financing investment,  infrastructural development and promoting capital market  development. He did not specify when Seoul will raise the  foreign stock ownership ceiling, currently set at 10 percent for  each individual issue. Under the nation's Five-Year Financial  Reform Plan, Seoul committed itself to raising the ceiling  sometime between this year and next year, he said.    The government will decide, after June, the timing and the  extent of the ceiling expansion. He, however, said that  foreigners can expand "indirect investment" in Korean stocks.  "The government will soon permit such country funds as Korea  Europe Fund in London and Korea Asia Fund in Hong Kong to  increase capital. Additionally, three Seoul-based investment  trust companies will be allowed to set up more funds to help  foreigners expand indirect investments in Seoul shares."    His remark appears to be a clear indication that the  government will, at least for the time being, encourage  foreigners to make "indirect" investment rather than direct  investment. Hong said despite positive effects foreign portfolio  capital has on the Korean economy, it is true that such capital  influx has strained the nation's monetary &amp; foreign exchange  policies as well as inflation.    The minister said the government intervened in the stock  market three times this year as it showed signs of overheating,  adding, however, that this does not mean Korea is backpedalling  in its financial internationalization program. He said "Most of  our stabilization measures include `deregulating' old rules that  were adopted in the late 1980s to boost the stock market, adding  that the recent measures do not necessarily mean introduction of  `new rules.'" He said that Seoul will pursue a capital market  development program consistently as was stipulated in the  Five-Year Financial Reform Plan. He added that the government  will make multi-pronged efforts to balance demand and supply in  the stock market. He was replying to growing foreign criticism  that Korea's arbitrary intervention in the stock market has  overshadowed its reform process and scared away foreign  investors.    The minister said sometime this year, Korea will implement  part of the third-stage of the interest rate liberalization  program, which may include extension of maturity of certificates  of deposit (CDs) and the lowering of its minimum face value of  50 million won. The minister said Korea will come out with a  comprehensive plan to activate foreign direct investments by the  end of May. "If our program is implemented, there will be  qualitative and quantitative expansion in foreign direct  investments in Korea," he said.    Hong said the timing of Korea's joining the OECD  [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] will not  be linked to the nation's pace of financial reform when he was  asked to comment whether Korea must delay its OECD membership as  the OECD views the speed of the nation's financial reform is  "slow."    He said by the time Korea joins the OECD around 1996, "Our  liberalization ratio will be raised significantly." Korea will  continue to liberalize the financial market even after joining  the OECD as market-opening and liberalization is a dynamic  process, he said.    Preconditions for OECD membership is not to what extent a  country is liberalized, but whether the country is willing to  implement its pre-announced liberalization schedule after  gaining membership, he said. There has emerged a view that Korea  may be forced to delay the OECD membership as it may be tough  for Seoul to meet all of the OECD requirements, especially those  on foreign exchange and capital flows.    He said depending on each country's economic situation, it  can delay meeting part of the OECD requirements when it applies  for a membership. In negotiations with the OECD, "we will fully  explain to it why Korea must delay liberalizing specific  restrictions," he said. He said the Korea Stock Exchange [KSE]  will be authorized to handle stock index futures trading from  1996 in accordance with the pre-announced program but he did not  say whether Korea will create another futures exchange which  will compete with the KSE for stock index futures contracts.</p>

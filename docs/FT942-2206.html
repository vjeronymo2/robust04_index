			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Swedish call for more telecoms competition Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's minister of industry, yesterday called for a rapid introduction of competition in the provision of telecommunications networks across Europe. Addressing an FT conference in London on European telecommunications, Mr Westerberg said the liberalisation of telecoms services, as agreed by the EU, was insufficient to give Europe a competitive edge over the US. 'Competition in the infrastructure is also necessary,' he said. Pointing to the potential for a new generation of multi-media services using fibre-optic networks, he argued that prices had to be cost-based. 'For this to happen I believe there must be competition in infrastructure as well as in all kinds of service.' Sweden, whose application to join the EU now rests with a national referendum, already allows infrastructure competition. Within the EU only the UK has adopted the same course. The European Commission has yet to announce its proposals on the issue, but appears to be leaning towards infrastructure liberalisation. Mr Wim Dik, chairman of KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts and telecoms company, supported the liberalisation of infrastructure, saying he 'welcomed' the prospect of competition at home. He stressed the importance of alliances between national operators to the future of Europe's telecoms industry as international competition advanced. 'If there is more competition in your home market, you have to go abroad, and multinationals are driving the international market,' he said. KPN has formed an international joint venture, called Unisource, with the state telecoms operators of Sweden and Switzerland. Telefonica, the Spanish operator, is an associate member. Mr Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu Ruiz, chairman of Telefonica, told the conference that Telefonica was set to join Unisource as a full member next month. 'We share its philosophy' he said. The addition of Telefonica will strengthen Unisource in its current negotiations for a partnership with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator. AT&amp;T is anxious to enter the European telecoms market after the success of its smaller US rivals MCI and Sprint in forging alliances with the larger European operators. However, Mr Dik and Mr Ruiz clashed over the question of universal service obligations on national telecoms operators, an issue slowing progress towards full telecoms liberalisation in the EU. Mr Dik said market forces should broadly determine telecoms service levels, with any subsidies thought desirable for rural dwellers paid directly to the subscribers. However, Mr Ruiz argued that national operators should continue to receive subsidies to provide telecoms services to poorer or rural communities. They should either be allowed to subsidise such services from other activities, or competitors should be obliged to pay them a fee to cover loss-making social obligations. The issue is controversial in Spain, which has recently agreed to forego an EU concession allowing it until 2003 before licensing 'voice' telecoms competitors to Telefonica. Competition in Spain will start in January 1998, as in most of the rest of the EU.</p>

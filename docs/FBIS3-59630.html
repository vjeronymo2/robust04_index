Bencard, Ines Bronowski: "Costly </F> Compromises"]    [Text] The district attorney's office in Halle and the  criminal police in Eisleben are now bringing charges for subsidy  fraud in connection with the cleanup of ecological contamination  in the new laender. As far as is known, millions have been paid  out from the Trust Agency and land treasury through Trust  Agency-owned Mansfeld Umwelt- und Recycling GmbH and the  nonprofit cleanup company Mansfelder Land to the Eisleben  recycling company MFD, without the corresponding work having  been done.    What was brought to light in the Mansfeld region indicates  what is in store for the federal government and the laender from  the regulation on financing the ecological pollution. This  business of the cleanup billions, which the taxpayers have to  come up with, has triggered a boom in a highly profitable  market--and for dubious suppliers as well. After the Mansfeld  scandal came out, Hettstedt district administrator Hans-Peter  Sommer, for example, demanded that Trust Agency chief Birgit  Breuel impose public oversight of contracts, performance, and  payments.    Here things are not so good. In many cases Birgit Breuel's  Berlin agency has issued insufficient regulations for the  treatment of ecological pollution in privatizations, criticized  the Federal Supreme Auditing Institute in its most recent annual  report:        -  In the privatization contracts the concept of  "ecological pollution was predominantly not unequivocal and not  uniformly applied;" even the cost of cleanup, restoration, and  maintenance costs was extra.    -  In one out of every two contracts signed by the end of 1992,  the Trust Agency did not limit its cost liability.    -  As late as the second half of 1992, in four out of 10  contracts  the Trust Agency had not locked in "the participatory rights  which, among other things, assure the authorization and followup  of ecological pollution measures by the Trust Agency."       The agency is trying to play down the whole thing. "The  Auditing Institute," dismisses Heiner Bonnenberg, among others,  head of the Trust Agency's Directorate for Environment and  Pollution, "criticizes everything we do." He has to admit,  however, that "oversight is in fact our problem." The reason:  According to Bonnenberg, many privatizations were completed  under "time and quantitative pressure." Without compromises many  interested buyers would probably simply have turned away for  fear of incalculable pollution risks.    The Trust Agency often had to make pragmatic decisions. For  this reason the Trust Agency, before the 22 October 1992 Federal  Government-Laender-administrative agreement on sharing the  cleanup costs, agreed to participate extensively in the cost--in  some cases up to 90 percent. About 3,000 contracts, perhaps even  1,000 more, contain such agreements.    No one knows what the actual cost of the cleanup will  ultimately be. To be sure, with its "pollution assessment"  instrument the Trust Agency has tried to achieve an overview of  about 3,000 cases within two years. Without clearly defined  opportunities for cooperation and control, however, that will  scarcely be enough.    In the Trust Agency's "planned final balance" of 270 billion  German marks [DM], Trust Agency head Breuel insists that, out of  precaution, she has reserved funds amounting to DM 12 to 15  billion for environmental cleanup. Will that be enough? "There  are always surprises," Birgit Breuel concedes.    Another uncertainty factor in the billion-mark poker about  pollution is the definition problem: How far should the cleanup  actually go? At least in the privatization contracts, the  Federal Supreme Auditing Institute charges, there are no such  specifications.    This problem could be expensive not only for the Trust  Agency. Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, at any rate, fears  that for the billion-mark amounts which various expert  estimators mention "one could probably return the soil of the  entire ex-GDR to its virgin state." Cleanup can thus mean only  one thing to Toepfer: Making subsequent utilization of each  surface possible without danger for humans and environment.    The minister therefore urgently requests passage of the  Federal Soil Protection Law, which exists as a draft bill and is  now being sent around for comment. The draft bill provides for  nationally uniform specification of the demands for pollution  cleanup by means of legal regulations. This would pave the way  for the Technical Soil Directive demanded by Toepfer, which is  to establish exact criteria for the condition of the soil for  certain applications.    It has not even been clarified how, after the Trust Agency  concludes its operational business in 1994, the pollution  agreements are to be continued. "Whether another successor  institution will be created," says Bonnenberg, "or whether a  department of the Federal Ministry of Finance will take over,  has not yet been determined."</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Quebec hints at compromise QUEBEC'S prime minister, Mr Robert Bourassa, has shifted his government nearer constitutional compromise, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Mr Bourassa hinted after a Quebec Liberal Party policy session at the weekend that if the federal government made a favourable offer in May on greater autonomy, his government would resume talks. Mr Bourassa has indicated that the new federal package must go further in ceding jurisdiction to Quebec and declaring the French-speaking province a distinct society.</p>

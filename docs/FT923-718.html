			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Central TV jumps to Pounds 15m CENTRAL Independent Tele-vision announced a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 15.1m in the half year to June 30. Mr Leslie Hill, the chairman and chief executive, attributed the higher-than-expected profits to continued pressure on costs combined with an increasing share of ITV advertising revenue. Overheads were reduced by 8 per cent while expenditure on programmes increased by 15 per cent. Central's share of ITV advertising rose from 14.04 per cent to 14.83 per cent. 'Given our excellent first half result, we expect to have a successful year, despite the outlook for advertising revenue remaining uncertain', Mr Hill said. Analysts expect Central to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 41m for the full year, the last before the new ITV licences begin, when the Midlands ITV company will have to pay to the Treasury the money it bid for the new licence - Pounds 2,000 a year plus 11 per cent of its advertising revenue. Unlike many ITV companies Central did not benefit from this year's reduction in the turnover-based Exchequer Levy from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Its charge fell by only Pounds 200,000 because of a higher profits-based levy charge. Turnover rose to Pounds 159m (Pounds 140m) with advertising revenue contributing Pounds 115m (Pounds 102m). Earnings increased from 7.9p to 34.7p and the interim dividend is 10p (7.5p). Central, which has children's programmes such as Woof, running on US television, said it planned to increase expenditure on developing programme pilots and new ideas. The aim was to keep Central's programme sales to the ITV network high when it becomes an open market next year. 'We intend to stick to our knitting,' said Mr Hill in a reference to the company's intention to expand only within the television industry. The Central chairman also renewed his appeal for the government to act on what the company believes are unfair takeover rules. Central's share price closed 70p up at Pounds 14.45.</p>

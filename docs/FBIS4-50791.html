			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Newsletter by XINHUA reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429): </F> "Together Open Up a New Vista of Sino-Belgian Cooperation -- Li  Ruihuan Visits Belgium's Brynar (name as received)  Pharmaceutical Research Center"]    [Excerpts] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- May is the rainy  season in Belgium. Nevertheless, when Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National  Committee, arrived at the Brynar Pharmaceutical Research Center,  affiliated with Belgium's Chemistry Union, the sun suddenly  broke through the clouds, coloring the green earth with golden  rays. The distinguished Chinese guest brought "sunshine" to  Belgian enterprises, punned Mr. (Jacob), president of the  Belgian Federation of Enterprises and concurrently executive  chairman of the League of Chemistry, who had been waiting for Li  Ruihuan by the research center's gate.    No sooner had Li Ruihuan stepped out of the car, than Mr.  Jacob told him about the Chemistry Union. [passage omitted]    Mr. Jacob, who has been reputed as the "boss of the bosses"  of Belgian enterprises, was very good at marketing. According  to him, the medicine for cranial nerve system, developed by the  center in cooperation with China, has been selling briskly.  Therefore, he hoped to expand the cooperation and jointly  manufacture allergy medicine. He said: The world market's  demand for these two medicines is growing, and the prospect for  development is bright.    With a sense of humor, Li Ruihuan said: "I am one of the  `consumers' taking your medicine. The medicine for treating  cranial nerve ailment [zhi liao nao shen jing ji bing di yao wu  3112 4070 5207 4377 4842 4014 4016 4104 5522 3670], developed by  your center in cooperation with China, sells well in China,"  adding that China has adopted a positive attitude toward  importing advanced production technology from abroad as such  technology is good for the Chinese people's health. Citing the  successful example of "Shike [name as received]" company, a  Sino-U.S. joint venture for manufacturing anthelmintic and cold  medicines, Li Ruihuan urged Belgian enterprises to develop new  medicines which can cure ailments without side effects.    Accompanied by Jacob and other union executives, Li Ruihuan  viewed the center's production assembly lines for pharmaceutical  products, showing great interest in the advanced production and  packing technology. He said: China has a long history of  producing traditional Chinese medicine for counter-sale, but  still lags far behind Western nations in the production of  Western medicine. He hoped that Belgian pharmaceutical  enterprises would cooperate with China in not only technology  exportation but also joint development of new medicines.</p>

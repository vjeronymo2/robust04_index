NPF&hyph;87 and NPF&hyph;89, for the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, located in Somervell County, Texas, operated by Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would change the technical specifications to allow a one-time extension of emergency diesel generator and related surveillance testing from 18 to 24 months. These changes apply to Unit 2 only <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are a one-time extensions. The proposed changes only extend the surveillance test intervals and do not alter the function or operation of the equipment and are consistent with the philosophy of Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;04. The surveillances relate to mitigation features and have no impact on probability of an accident. The only impact on consequences would result from the component or system reliability. The reliability of the affected systems and components is not being affected since the same testing will be performed but with a one-time extended test interval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many features are tested more frequently by other surveillances and the ESF [emergency safety features] actuation surveillances (response time tests) have historically been successful, therefore, any increase in probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident would be insignificant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are one-time extensions. No new accident scenarios are being introduced because neither the testing nor the methodology itself are been affected. Only the interval between testing is being changed consistent with the intent of GL 91&hyph;04. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are one-time extensions. Margin of safety is not significantly affected because no test functions are being omitted and many attributes of the systems will continue to be verified in other surveillance tests. The increased time between surveillances, which could result in a slight decrease in assumed equipment reliability, is mitigated by the facts that many features are tested more frequently by other surveillances and by the relatively short duration of the extension. In addition, minimizing train outages during refueling outages and using demonstrated test procedures reduces the risk of events occurring during the outage and improves safety. Overall, because the potential impact on equipment reliability is small and because of the reduced shutdown risks, this license amendment request does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety but potentially increases the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

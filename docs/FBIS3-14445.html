			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Ilyas al-Hirawi received Robert  Pelletreau, assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle East  affairs, at the Presidential Palace this morning. The following  is a dispatch from our correspondent at the Presidential Palace:    Mr. Pelletreau expected Arab-Israeli negotiations to resume  toward the end of April. After meeting the president he  stressed that American support for the Lebanese Government as it  moves to bolster Lebanese national unity will continue.  [passage omitted]    Earlier, Pelletreau visited Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz.  [passage omitted] At the end of the meeting, Minister Buwayz  made the following statement:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has Mr.  Pelletreau brought any new positions on the bilateral peace  negotiations [words indistinct]?    [Buwayz] Mr. Pelletreau's visit is part of new American  efforts to get the peace process moving. It follows various  consultations with the parties involved in the negotiations.  The United States is willing to give a new impetus to this  process. Perhaps this needs additional intensive consultations  at the level of the U.S. secretary of state.    [Correspondent] Have the discussions dealt with the  explosive  situation in the south?    [Buwayz] Yes. The talks touched on this situation and on  repeated Israeli aggression, through which, we believe, Israel  is (?harming) the peace process at the same time it is engaged  in negotiations. There are also suspicions about internal  interferences in this regard.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Buwayz] There is a climate that effectively means holding  contacts [words indistinct] officials. I do not think that this  round has been decided yet.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did you discuss the continued  U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon?    [Buwayz] I believe that the latest American decision  includes  some signs that the American position is changing. These  include the period [word indistinct] the decision, which is  shorter than that of earlier decisions, and certain phrases that  suggest that this period will be used to reconsider the ban.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, it is known that you are  leaving for Cairo today to attend the Arab League Council  meeting. The Arab boycott against Israel is on the agenda.  What do you expect from this?    [Buwayz] We believe the boycott was a result of a state of  war. Lifting it should be a result of a state of peace. Making  progress at the negotiations and reaching a declaration of  principles that makes us believe that peace is becoming final  and real will effectively and legally end the boycott. But  abolishing the boycott theoretically while the state of war in  the Middle East continues, I believe, will be only a  (?theoretical) decision. At any rate, we believe that the  boycott is a feature of the Arab-Israeli conflict and must be  discussed within a comprehensive framework for peace.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the foreign ministers of  the Arab cordon states in Cairo?    [Buwayz] It is customary for the meetings of the cordon  states to be held independently from other regional or  international meetings. This, however, does not mean that  consultations or preparatory meetings in Cairo are not possible.  But I think that any such meetings will only be in preparation  for a coordination meeting, which may be held either in Cairo or  in [words indistinct] independent from the Arab League meeting.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, is it true that Washington  asked Lebanon to calm the [word indistinct] situation through  negotiations?    [Buwayz] The U.S. policy toward this subject is steady; [?it  always asks] the Lebanese Government to calm the situation and  control things in the south. This is nothing new, but there is  no exceptional interference in [words indistinct]    [Correspondent] Do you think the internal security situation  will affect the negotiating delegation or the Lebanese-Israeli  negotiations?    [Buwayz] Since the beginning of the negotiations, we have  been eager to secure for the negotiating delegation a sort of  immunity against all internal changes. I believe this climate  is necessary for the delegation to continue the negotiations in  the best way. Anyway, I believe [words indistinct] or negatively  affect the performance.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you share the view that  the private radio and television newscasts threatened state  security?    [Buwayz] I believe a country like Lebanon, which is living  in  the middle of a volcano in this region, cannot continue to have  a disorganized security, media, and democracy. From this  perspective, I think that we cannot live in a more easygoing and  freer atmosphere than in Switzerland, France, or Britain. We  live in a very turbulent area. Therefore, I believe that  organizing the media through a clear and frank law will return  matters to normal and to an acceptable level of freedom and  democracy commensurate with the internal situation and the  homeland's security. In any case, I believe this principle is  not new or exclusive to Lebanon. Freedom, if it is abused,  hurts others. There is an acceptable level of freedom that  guarantees the freedom of others, their rights, and the rights  of the homeland. Therefore, a well-studied law that is based on  the principle of freedom and democracy -- which are basic in  Lebanon and are the pillars of this homeland -- and that will  place controls and checks to ensure that this freedom will not  become an attack on the homeland will resolve this situation.

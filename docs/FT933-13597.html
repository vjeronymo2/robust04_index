			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The undoing of EFIM: Liquidation exposes Italian economic fault lines - The government's ability to handle its ambitious privatisation programme will be put to the test THE FAULTS and weaknesses of the Italian economic system have been exposed by the liquidation of Efim, the state industrial holding, which will cost taxpayers at least L17,000bn (Pounds 7.2bn). A year after a hurried decision was taken by the then government of Prof Giuliano Amato to place the chronic lossmaker in voluntary liquidation, Efim is still very much alive - rather than half dead as it should be by now. The first asset disposal of the holding's 120 companies is due to be concluded this week with the L210bn sale of Siv, the glassmaker. But the liquidation process is unlikely to meet the ambitious two-year deadline of July 1994. This is not surprising since Efim, with L18,000bn in outstanding debt and the livelihood of 37,000 employees at stake, constitutes the biggest voluntary liquidation in post-war Europe. Efim's odd assortment of activities range from aluminium smelting, armaments and helicopters to manufacturing mass transit systems, owning health spas and construction. The sheer size and diversity of the group has complicated the operation. But despite the difficulties, the Italian authorities need to complete the liquidation successfully to offer convincing proof of efficient administration and a genuine desire to curb the dominant role of the state. Failure to do so will reflect on their ability to handle smoothly the ambitious privatisation programme, as many of the problems encountered are similar. Among the more significant factors that have slowed and complicated Efim's liquidation are: A crowded government agenda: the Amato government and its successor, headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, have had their hands full first with a currency crisis, and then tackling the public sector deficit against a background of collapsing traditional parties. Nationwide corruption scandals: five Efim companies are implicated in kickback investigations, the most serious being Agusta, the lossmaking helicopter group, and Efim's finance subsidiary, Nuova Safim. Bureaucracy: three ministries have been involved (Treasury, Industry, and State Shareholdings), paperwork has been complex and liquidators have been hampered by the government as shareholder dictating policy via inflexible decrees, only alterable by fresh decrees. There have been four. Recession: the sharp decline in industrial activity, especially in defence, has caused constant adjustments in the liquidation plans, while rising unemployment has increased the social pressure to curb the level of job losses. Up to 40 per cent of Efim's workforce is regarded as surplus. Inexperience: liquidation has been an infrequent instrument, and Italy lacks both the juridical tools and the technical expertise. An additional factor has been the comportment of Mr Alberto Predieri, the 72-year-old liquidator and a leading bankruptcy lawyer and former Olivetti board member. To the dismay of creditors, he has retained his consultancy in Florence, been difficult to contact and delegated extensively. As a result, those affected by the Efim liquidation are exasperated and angry. 'The liquidation of Efim is the greatest fraud ever perpetrated by a government in Europe,' says Mr Giustino Bello, who acts as co-ordinator for 400 small and medium-sized Italian and foreign creditor companies owed more than L400bn. 'We are dealing with a state holding which a year after being put into liquidation has not paid a single small creditor, at least 30 of whom risk going under as a result,' he claims. The supplier creditors, owed L4,000bn, should have begun to be paid in early April. Last week the Ciampi government promised 30 per cent would be paid 'rapidly'. The small suppliers, lacking in muscle, remain sceptical and have initiated in Turin a court action to impugn the Efim liquidation decree, converted into law on February 17, as unconstitutional. They have also suggested that they be paid in the form of tax credits, discounts on VAT and relief on social security payments. The banks, owed L8,800bn, are in no better a position. The Amato government badly damaged Italy's international credibility by failing to consult foreign or local banks in advance of the liquidation and by seeking to impose a two-year moratorium on what the banks assumed to be sovereign debt lodged with Efim and its subsidiaries. 'The handling of this was the greatest error of my government,' Prof Amato freely admits. After a series of acrimonious encounters, the foreign bank creditors owed L3,500bn have obtained satisfaction on the terms of payment. But they have received no money because of the controlling veto of Brussels. The closure, rationalisation and sale of the holding's companies was initially thought likely to cost L10,000bn-L12,000bn. However, the burden will be much greater, with interest charges at 13 per cent, the need for fresh capital to sustain viable company operations and the cost of shedding labour and almost certainly maintaining some companies beyond the programmed two-year liquidation timetable. The Ciampi government is being obliged to allow some L4,000bn in 1994, according to those familiar with the liquidation process. They also say if all debts are to be honoured the ultimate cost could exceed L17,000bn, a figure that includes the offsetting income from asset sales. Given that so much public money is involved, remarkably few questions have been asked about how the group was allowed to get itself into such a mess. The simple answer may be that Efim had been long regarded as a dustbin into which lossmaking industries were tipped and kept alive to promote political patronage with lavish use of state funds. Efim was an emblem of the politico-economic system that embedded itself in Italy from the 1950s. Created in 1962 as an industrial hospital aimed primarily to sustain companies committed to expanding in the Mezzogiorno, Efim was loosely managed and politically manipulated from the outset. As part of a political deal, Efim was allowed to be a Socialist fief, while IRI, the larger public holding, was in the hands of the Christian Democrats. Thus at the time of liquidation Mr Gaetano Mancini, cousin of the most powerful Socialist politician in the south, was chairman and his deputy was Mr Mauro Leone, a Christian Democrat and son of a former president of the Republic. Mr Leone was arrested in March on charges of fraud in connection with the running of Nuova Safim. Breaking the political hold on Efim and reshaping the entire role of the public sector in the economy was Prof Amato's prime objective in liquidating the holding. Indeed, as a Socialist linked to the then leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, he saw getting rid of Efim as a demonstration of his own impartiality and concrete proof that the state was set to reduce its interventionist role in industry and would no longer underwrite lossmaking businesses. Throughout the 1980s Efim's finances deteriorated, weighed down by losses in the aluminium industry (Alumix accounted for almost half the 1991 loss of L1,176bn) and the increasing crisis in the defence industry. But all the businesses were sustained by an unquestioning belief from suppliers, creditors and managers that the state was behind Efim. 'We thought it was gilt-edged dealing with Agusta: it was military helicopters, Euro-defence and state-owned,' observed one disillusioned British supplier. When it was placed in liquidation Efim was losing L37 for every L100 of turnover, and of the 120 companies only 33 were in profit. Mr Predieri commented recently: 'All the others were running at a loss, many for years, despite attempts to massage their balance sheets to obscure losses.' As liquidator Mr Predieri has had to follow awkward twin paths of trying to satisfy creditors and guarantee the survival of those companies considered viable. Efim has some good assets like Efim Ferroviarie, the mass transit manufacturer. But the danger throughout has been to avoid the state being saddled with a rump of lossmakers that are seen as necessary to maintain, either because of their regional importance (like aluminium smelting in Sardinia) or because of their 'strategic' nature, as with the seven defence companies. This danger, plus job losses, will be the main issue in the coming months - provided creditors start getting paid soon and the dispute with the EC is resolved.</p>

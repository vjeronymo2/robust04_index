			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel </F> by station editor Eva Hulkova; "Conversations at Lany"--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, the fact that the  National Council of the Slovak Republic passed the vote of no  confidence in Premier Meciar's government is undoubtedly event  number-one. In a way, I would say that this is the development  of paramount importance in Slovakia's recent history.    [Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has  been continuing on the Slovak political scene for some time now.  It is difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is  probable that early elections will take place, and, until then,  it is to be hoped that some kind of lower profile but efficient  government should be formed rather soon. I imagine this would be  a semicaretaker government, one that would span the transitional  period and contribute to calming the situation. This is in the  interest of the Slovak citizens as well as of all of us who are  not indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [passage omitted]    On the whole, let us hope that the situation in Slovakia  will  stabilize after the elections, which are evidently going to go  ahead. Let us hope it will calm down and that Slovakia will  embark on a true path of building a democratic political system  and market economy. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Mr. President, I always thought that Slovak  President Michal Kovac was unlikely to make a strong imprint on  his country's history. But now I feel that his moment has come.  After all, it is he who controls a lot of things.    [Havel] It should be said that I personally began to respect  President Kovac because we often met and discussed in a very  businesslike and frank manner various issues of interest. It  should be said that President Kovac has developed into an  outstanding and independent politician who acted when he felt it  was his duty to act. What he did was very courageous and risky.  What he did was not commonplace. No matter what the given  constitutional system is, it is not usual that the head of state  should enter into such open confrontation with the prime  minister or the government.    Nevertheless, Mr. President Kovac probably knew what he was  doing, and he knew why he was doing it.    [Hulkova] I have always been under the impression that  speculation about further developments in Slovakia is at this  time evidently premature. However, I would like to ask one  question: Do you think that whatever happens next will be less  clear than what happened in the past? Although we often  disagreed with these developments, we knew what was taking place.    [Havel] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar, whom I know  very well from the time of the [Czechoslovak] federation, is a  very self-styled, original person with a special method of  ruling. It is true to say that, if a modus vivendi or a contact  is established with him, he is a politician who can be to a  certain extent understood. Having said that, I do not claim he  is the best possible politician. It is possible that the  situation will become less transparent now because several new  political groupings have been formed. The political stage  became fragmented in a certain way. [passage omitted]    Much will depend on whether these new parties will manage to  unite before the elections and create some kind of a wider  formation with a clear policy or whether they will fight each  other. Policy fragmentation is a great misfortune in political  life.    [Hulkova] And one final question on Slovakia: In your  opinion, is a third comeback of Vladimir Meciar possible?    [Havel] I would not like to make any prognosis in this  matter. Really, I do not know, but anything is possible in these  fledgling democracies.    [Hulkova] Mr. President, let us now recall your trip to the  Vatican and Strasbourg at the beginning of this week. Deputy  Foreign Minister Bratinka said it could not have been more  successful. I would like to hear your personal view, if you  care tell me, of the impressions you had.    [Havel] I find it difficult to answer this question, but,  because you have asked, I have no choice but to say that in my  view it was successful. I thought the second leg of the trip,  the Strasbourg one, was particularly successful. [passage  omitted]    As for my trip to the Vatican, my hour-long conversation  with the pope was, as usual, very valuable for me because I have  good rapport with the pope. The pope radiates a special sort of  kindness and understanding, and one draws strength from this  kind of conversation. But this would be a small reason for my  going on a state visit there. The main thing is that the visit  boosts our good relations with the Vatican. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Mr. President, you have already mentioned how much  you valued the outcome of the Strasbourg leg of your trip. I  would like to know whether you were at all worried about the  reception of some passages of your speech by the deputies of the  European Parliament?    [Havel] I was completely surprised at how favorable the  reception of my address was. Afterwards, during various  discussions and chats with deputies, including the gala lunch  and so on, many chairmen or vice chairmen of the individual  groups or committees told me that they were so swamped by the  everyday technical and administrative duties they had to tackle  that a certain overview and awarness of a deeper meaning of  European integration and European union escaped them. They said  they were very grateful to me for voicing this and for bringing  up these points. They told me directly that they needed it.  This pleased me, of course. [passage omitted]</p>

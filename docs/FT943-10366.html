			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigerian election was not 'deeply flawed' Sir, Your editorial, 'Time to help Nigeria' (August 3), is well-meaning, but rather confused. On the one hand, you acknowledge that the general strike is backed by 'many Nigerians driven to despair by mismanagement, corruption and falling real incomes'. Yet you insist that General Sani Abacha, who has been a principal actor in the military governments that have brought this situation about, must be a part of any new dispensation aimed at solving the current political crisis. What the protesting Nigerians are saying to the world is that arbitrary military rule, which they have been unfortunate enough to endure for 24 out of their 34 years of independence, has done their economy irreparable harm and they want none of it. Contrary to your belief, the election of June 12 1993 was not 'deeply flawed'. It was hailed by both international and foreign observers as free and fair. That earlier candidates had been disqualified was not the fault of Moshood Abiola or his opponent, Bashir Tofa, but of the military. The candidature of the final two was approved under the existing electoral laws. Having gone that far, it was morally, politically and legally wrong for the military then to 'annul' the result of the election and give no reason. A lot of southern Nigerians think that, if Tofa, a northerner, had won, no annulment would have taken place. If you dismiss the bitterness created by this, you can never understand why the current situation is so dangerous and could tear the country apart. You are entitled to your view that Abiola's qualifications for the presidency are 'dubious'. But don't you think it is patronising to suggest that you can determine better than the huge Nigerian electorate who is qualified to rule them? Abiola is a chartered accountant who graduated with honours from the University of Glasgow. What are the qualifications of the British prime minister, for instance? In a democracy, the final word lies with the electorate and that is why John Major is prime minister. Nigerian voters are saying that their votes must be equally respected. As they have proved, they are prepared to back that right with action, even if some of them die in the process. It is a noble struggle to enthrone 'people's power' and deserves the support of all democrats.

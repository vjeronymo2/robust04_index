			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Japanese firms coping with high yen Most Japanese companies believe they have made the adjustments to their workforces necessary to cope with the high yen, according to a survey released by the labour ministry yesterday, Gordon Cramb writes. Of about 1,000 employers it polled in mid-July, only 4 per cent said they had taken steps to shed jobs since the currency began its renewed climb in June. A further 6 per cent were planning such meas-ures. A previous survey conducted last August, when the yen first touched the Y100 level against the US dollar, showed 10 per cent of companies had taken recent action and a further 10 per cent intended to do so if the exchange rate stayed at current levels.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Upstaged: Joan Collins returned to the London theater in Noel Coward's "Private  Lives," only to leave the audience and the critics raving about a supporting  performer, Sara Crowe.  </P> <P> "A star is born and steals the show from Joan Collins," The Daily Mail said  after the Wednesday-night opening at the Aldwych Theater. Critic Jack Tinker  said Crowe "gave this show's most bankable star a runaway lesson in the  essential elements of a classic Coward performance." How was Crowe taking it?  Said her publicist: "How would you like to be known as the actress who upstaged  Joan Collins?" Collins, 57, was last on the London stage a decade ago. BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: EBRD funds Dollars 60m credit facility for Czech bank The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has provided a Dollars 60m seven-year revolving credit facility to the Czech Republic's Kommercni Banka. The floating-rate funds will be used to finance Czech exports to western and developing countries, particularly in Asia. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but an EBRD official said that Kommercni Banka, which is 51 per cent state-owned, would be paying a market-related premium over Libor, the London interbank offered rate. The official added that the facility would give medium-sized companies in the private sector access to long-term funds, which were in limited supply in the domestic market. The EBRD hopes to provide similar facilities to banks in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Russia and other states in the former Soviet Union during the course of this year.</p>

The agreement emerged from the bilateral "framework" trade  negotiations under way in Tokyo, and will be officially  announced after the meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton slated for February 11  in Washington.    Under the scheme, Japan will give 3 billion dollars and the  U.S. 9 billion dollars over the seven years.    The sums compare with 70 million dollars in annual financial  aid extended by Japan for such purposes and 600 million dollars  by the United States.    The sharply boosted aid will be used to try to find an AIDS  cure, supply developing nations with condoms, and enlighten  people there about the disease.    The money will also finance projects designed to spread  knowledge of family planning and help poor countries compile  more reliable population statistics.    According to data by the World Health Organization (WHO),  the  world's HIV carriers number 14 million at present and are  projected to rise to 30-40 million by the year 2000.</p>

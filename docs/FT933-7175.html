			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Poland warned on gas deal POLAND'S sovereignty could be endangered by a proposed plan that would supply Russian natural gas to the country along an east-west pipeline, Mr Jan Olszewski, a former prime minister, warned yesterday. He was speaking on the eve of a two-day visit to Poland by the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, during which an agreement to build the pipeline is to be signed. Mr Olszewski, whose right-wing Coalition for the Republic is one of more than a dozen political groups contesting parliamentary elections on September 19, alleged that the pipeline would 'nullify chances of obtaining gas from other sources such as the North Sea'. Russia currently exports 6.5bn cubic metres a year of natural gas to Poland. The pipeline would carry 67bn cubic metres a year 4,000km from the the Arctic Circle to western Europe.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Well tuned in Perigord - Martin Hoyle visits the festival While France's most internationally famous festival flounders into financial and administrative troubles at Aix, the smaller Festival du Perigord Noir has just completed its 12th flourishing season. Set on the edge of the Dordogne, the musical junket in the territory of pate, confit and truffle profits from both compactness of vision and flexibility of lay-out. The six-week festival is sub-divided into themes under the general division of Baroque and Romantic. Different series of concerts overlap; venues include the region's Romanesque churches and at least one massive chateau; and the organisation is flexible enough to relocate at short notice a concert from a cultural centre to a medieval cathedral in the event (as on my first evening) of the heat causing both performers and strings to wilt. Of notable interest to English readers is the festival's British presence. This year the Tallis Scholars prompted no nervous thoughts of that famous murderous ledge on the cliff-face of Roque St-Christophe's troglodyte city-fortress, still gleefully pointed out as the Englishman's leap. More Anglo-Gallic cordiality from the master-classes with a resident chamber ensemble under the benign tutelage of Martin Lovett, from our own Amadeus Quartet of revered memory. A performance of the Schubert String Quintet revealed that rare thing, a young French ensemble actually devoted to the idea of chamber music, not merely a collection of soloists manques, with a young first violin of potentially international standard. The ability to cut the festive coat according to the financial cloth which, according to the ebullient artistic director Jean-Luc Soule, distinguishes Perigord from the top-heavy and over-ambitious Aix, was seen in this year's operatic offering. While previous festivals have seen Haydn productions with orchestra, this year modestly fielded a three-hander by Adolphe Adam, Le Toreador, which proved enchanting. Best known in this country for his ballet music (Giselle), Adam's bubbling score for this little descendant of the vaudeville chugs tunefully somewhere between Rossini and Offenbach, though unexpected modulations and a typically French vein of drowsily chromatic sensuality look forward to Poulenc and Satie - underlined by the happily minimal rescoring of the accompaniment for flute and piano. The frothy plot of amorous intrigue, misunderstanding and bluff unfolded against Michel Ronvaux's wittily ingenious designs: black and white panels that could be reversed or blossom out in the manner of pop-up picture books. As the young flautist whose knee-trembling impact on another man's wife resembles Alfred's tenorial terrorising of Rosalinde in Fledermaus, Yves Coudray deployed a graceful lyric tenor that may be heard at Wexford next year. Edwige Bourdy's soprano leggiero in the Mady Mesple mode did justice to the sweetly tootling variations on 'Ah] Vous dirai-je, Maman' that form the basis of a charming trio. The enthusiasm, high spirits and stylishness of Mireille Larroche's staging illustrated the French gift of weaving elegance out of the slenderest resources. The bat that had dive-bombed the opera in the courtyard of the Chateau de Hautefort brought his mate for next evening's indoor song recital. Edda Moser froze in mid-Brahms with a look that combined outraged majesty and hurt little-girl bewilderment, drawing all eyes to the frisking chauve-souris above our heads. 'I go, I come back,' she muttered, sweeping off the stage. Much waving of arms, opening of windows and one waggish cry of 'Die Fledermaus]' from the audience before order and the diva were restored. Moser's soprano has lost colour and richness in the lower register. She now excels in characterisation and dramatic declamation. Her final Strauss group showed why she now sings Salome. Moser remains an opera star, gestures and expressions slightly too large for the concert platform; can Elektra be far away? Dinner in the courtyard afterwards, with a lightning storm illuminating the dark panoramic sweep of the countryside as seen from the castle's hilltop eyrie; and the French gift of catering to both high art and the inner man had never seemed more admirable.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Salim Ghazi: "Terrorism: The Women It Kills"; </F> first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] At a time when all the women in the world are  celebrating their day on 8 March, Algerian women are unable to  dry their tears or separate themselves from the bereavement they  have been feeling for over two years. Murderous bullets snatch  husbands, sons, brothers, or fathers from them in the daily  violence. In Algeria today, as in Kabul, Afghanistan, women  cannot properly celebrate their day because dozens of their  sisters are being raped and killed by terrorists.    The list of victims is a long one, and the story of their  tragedies is terrifying. Since the criminal attack that took the  life of Mrs. Bougtache and her husband, a police captain, in  Algiers' Notre Dame de l'Afrique district on 17 November 1992,  the list of women being killed every day by murderous bullets  has been growing steadily longer.    On 1 April of last year, in the very center of the main  thoroughfare in Belouizdad, a 30-year-old dressmaker named Zahia  was kidnapped from her home by a group of armed individuals.  Some time thereafter, her kidnappers let her go after having  subjected her to the worst humiliations. Six days later,  terrorists struck violently in Eucalyptus. A girl employed in  the company benefit office at the DGSN [Directorate General of  National Security] was killed in front of her home. Named Karima  Belhadj, she was only 17 years old. She had been engaged for  over a year and was planning to be married within a few months.    On 18 May of the same year, this time in Bouira in the Maala  region, an armed group consisting of about 10 individuals broke  into the home of an imam. Unable to find the person they were  looking for, the terrorists collectively raped the imam's wife.  Despite the trauma, the woman told her husband about the horror  she had just experienced. He immediately lodged a complaint. At  0200 on 7 July 1993, a group of armed individuals broke down the  door of a house located in the village of Benkhellil in Boufarik  that belonged to Saheb Oubelaid and his wife Rachida. After  killing the husband, the criminals pursued his wife Rachida, who  had fled with her three small daughters through the emergency  exit in an attempt to get help from the neighbors, and shot her  several times in the head in front of her children.    A month later, this time in the locality of El Attaf (Ain  Defla Governorate), the terrorists killed Mrs. Haddad Oum El  Kheir, a 39-year-old fortune-teller. The victim was five months  pregnant. On 12 August, another woman, 50-year-old businesswoman  Allel Aouicha, was killed by an armed group inside her home in  the locality of Ouled Slama in Blida Governorate.    Also recalled is the horror experienced by the family of  police officer Zermani Redouane in Haouch Gros in the Boufarik  region last 13 July. A group of about 20 terrorists armed with  Kalashnikovs and dressed in combat uniforms came looking for the  police officer. They turned heavy fire on the members of his  family, killing the mother immediately and seriously wounding  the two sisters, aged 24 and 20 years. In the locality of Mendaz  near Relizane on 5 December, two sisters, B. Fadela and B.  Fatma, were kidnapped from their home in front of family members  by a group of armed individuals.    They were released a few days later after being raped and  undergoing the worst cruelty. Ten days later in Kherrouba in  Boumerdes Governorate, an elderly clairvoyant--60 years of  age--was mistreated and raped before having her throat slit by  armed terrorists. In Meftah and Larbaa, two cleaning  women--Meloufi Aicha, 40, and Mansour Yamna, 36--were killed at  point-blank range by terrorists using sawed-off shotguns. On 25  December, the mother of a police officer was beaten to death by  terrorists. She was about 50 years old. On the 28th of that same  month, another woman, 40-year-old Ikhlef Fadela, had her throat  slit in Bouira.    This year, the terrorists are increasing their ferocity and  stepping up their murders of women. Last 5 January, for example,  the sister of a police officer was kidnapped from her home in  front of family members by a group of armed men in the locality  of Ain Lahdjar, Ain Temouchent Governorate. She was released a  few days later after being mistreated and raped. Four days  later, Mrs. Bouchelaghem Aicha, 47, the mother of nine children,  had her throat slit by individuals in Sidi Moussa (Blida).    On the 23d of the same month, Mrs. Diroueche Mimouna, a  28-year-old mother of five children, was decapitated in front of  her family at her home in Frenda, Tiaret Governorate. On the  same day, this time at the Bouziane estate in Douaouda, Tipaza  Governorate, a group of terrorists set fire to the home of Mrs.  Maameri Fatma, the mother of four children.    On 4 February, 80-year-old Garmit Kheira was killed by  bullets to the head after refusing to turn over her savings to  10 or so armed individuals who had broken into her house at  night. In Bourouba on the 17th of that same month, terrorists  used shotguns to kill a mother, 50-year-old H. Cherifa, and her  25-year-old daughter.    In Sidi Bel Abbes the next day, Mrs. Boudjar Keltoum, 94,  had  her throat slit by 10 terrorists. Twenty-four hours later in  that same governorate, a girl named T. Naima was kidnapped and  then released after being mistreated and raped. On the 21st of  the same month, when a police officer they wanted to kill could  not be found at home, three armed terrorists raped his sister in  the terrified presence of her father at his home in Senia  (Oran). Three days later, the 72-year-old mother of the DEC  [expansion not given] in Bordj Emir Khaled had her throat slit.  In Medea the next day, another woman, 73-year-old Lounis Safia,  met the same fate. And in Sidi Bel Abbes that day, two sisters,  G.M. and G.Z., aged 15 and 12 years, respectively, were  kidnapped and raped before being released in the Tighalimet  Forest.    In Algiers two days later, the principal of a CEM [College  of  Intermediate Studies], Mrs. Meziane Zhor, 54, the mother of  three children, was killed by three bullets fired by terrorists  in her office. In Gue de Constantine that same day, the wife of  customs official Hami Boubakr was killed along with her husband  inside their vehicle a few meters from their home.    Bengana Katia, a 17-year-old lycee student, died when she  was  shot by a terrorist in Meftah, Blida Governorate. On 3 March, an  old lady, 69-year-old Hadjou Samia, had her throat slit in  Tlemcen, while in Blida, Mrs. Bernarbia nee Tebeni Barkahoum,  44, was killed by a group of criminals who intercepted her while  she was driving home in her vehicle.    Foreign women are not spared, either. Last 5 December, Mrs.  Ayadi Larissa, a Russian national aged 55 years, was also shot  to death in Diar El Afia in Algiers. On the 18th of that same  month, a Frenchwoman married to an Algerian, Meme Afri, was  killed a few dozen meters from the French Consulate in Algiers,  where she worked.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Smith calls for Leyland Daf help MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday challenged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to demonstrate his commitment to Britain's manufacturing sector by ensuring a future for Leyland Daf. He contrasted the moves by the Dutch government to preserve as much as possible of the company's plants in the Netherlands with the insistence of British ministers that the receiver should be left to decide what could be salvaged. Mr Smith told the north-west regional conference of the Labour party in Blackpool that the Dutch government had been willing to invest in the company because it recognised the value to the economy of its technology and the skills of its workforce. Dutch workers knew their plants were secure, while British workers still did not know what would become of them, he said. A planned demonstration tomorrow to protest against alleged government refusal to help Leyland Daf was understood to have been called off last night after being attacked as 'ill-conceived' and a 'cheap trick' by the Leyland Daf dealers' association. Both the administrative receivers of Leyland Daf, and management teams staging separate buy-out attempts for the vans operation in Birmingham and truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, are understood to have been dismayed and irritated by the planned protest and a poster campaign which sprang up yesterday throughout the UK.</p>

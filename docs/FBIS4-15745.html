			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>   [Text] Strasbourg April 12 TASS -- "The Zhirinovskiy party  is a party of one individual, and no one empowered him to speak  for millions of Russian people," Federation Council Chairman  Vladimir Shumeyko, who is leading the Russian delegation to the  parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said commenting  on the address of the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of  Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to the parliamentary assembly  session.    Shumeyko told journalists that Zhirinovskiy "is adroitly  using the national idea" to reach his own political ends. He  said that after the disintegration of the Soviet Union many  Russian people found themselves beyond Russia's boundaries and  are extremely sensitive to the situation.    In his address, Zhirinovskiy declared that "Russia has its  own idea of democracy and the majority of Russians are against  the country's participation in the Council of Europe and NATO".  He stressed that Russia needs no "teachers of democracy" and  added that "we have our own standards and we will not permit the  West to experiment with Russia".    Zhirinovskiy shocked the audience by saying, "NATO flyers  are  now bombing Bosnia, but it is not ruled out that a time may come  when other pilots will bomb other targets".    Before the beginning of the plenary session, Zhirinovskiy  was  so active in attracting the attention of reporters and cameramen  to his own person that the chairman had to ask him to leave the  room. He added that "the Council of Europe is not Hollywood,  thank God".    Zhirinovskiy's speech was repeatedly interrupted by  outbursts  of indignation, and when he finished the chairman of the State  Duma's international affairs committee Vladimir Lukin said the  other members of the Russian delegation do not share  Zhirinovskiy's views.</p>

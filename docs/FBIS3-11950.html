			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have learned that the Galis Bay allegedly left  Haiti today at noon bound for the Dominican Republic. The Galis  Bay, a French humanitarian aid ship carrying 530 tons of food,  arrived offshore on 25 March but could not dock, sources say,  because National Port Administration [APN] officials refused to  grant permission. Several people, notably members of the  Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti,  have been demonstrating in front of APN offices since 25 March  to protest the arrival of this ship.</p>

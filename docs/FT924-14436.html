			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Bloodied heavyweights fight back - Philip Stephens on the likely course of the economic debate in John Major's cabinet MR Norman Lamont has set out his stall. But around the cabinet table, the intense debate over the government's economic policy promises to continue. In the turmoil that followed sterling's ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16, one of the most important political consequences has been missed. The management of the economy can no longer be the prerogative of the Treasury alone. On that fateful day, Mr John Major invited the cabinet's three heavyweights  -Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine - to put their hands in the blood left by the collapse of his economic strategy. They had arrived at Mr Major's temporary headquarters in Admiralty House purely coincidently, summoned to discuss the Maastricht treaty. They stayed willingly, ready to emphasise that the decision to suspend sterling's membership of the ERM had been a collective one. All three believe that on that single day at least neither Mr Major nor Mr Lamont could have played the hand differently. In retrospect, they seem uncomfortable with the fact that the Treasury and the Bank of England had confronted the politicians with a fait accompli. The issue they discussed on that day was not whether Britain could stay in the ERM but how it might withdraw with the minimum damage. By sharing the responsibility for the disaster, the troika have bought themselves an important say in how the wreckage is eventually reassembled. It is a role that they will not cede easily. The troika was not and will not be consulted on the detail or the day-to-day operation of the monetary strategy which Mr Lamont began to set out yesterday. But anyone listening to Mr Hurd, Mr Clarke or Mr Heseltine doing the round of the television and radio studios in Brighton could not escape the conclusion that on the broad principles they are determined to have their say. In a curious reversal of roles, those in the Tory party who a decade ago earned the label 'wet' (and that applies to the three of them) have emerged as the strongest opponents of any move to use a floating pound as an excuse to cut and run on interest rates. They are afraid that the gain on inflation bought by the pain of the ERM may now be frittered away. It is the traditional 'dries' - the monetarists of the early Thatcher years - who believe that deflation rather than inflation is now the principal threat to the British economy. So only minimal textual analysis was needed this week to discern that the troika is unhappy with the sharp fall in the pound's value over the past few weeks; that it is urging Mr Major to ignore the calls from the right of the party for a rapid ratcheting down in interest rates; and that it wants and foresees re-entry into the ERM in a year or so. Mr Lamont's position will not discourage the shift to more collective decision-making. The chancellor's long-term future remains uncertain. He had an unenviable task yesterday and accomplished it without obvious mishap. But the respectful rather than enthusiastic reception offered by the party faithful was at best neutral. At worst, it will reinforce the belief that he is a lame-duck chancellor, promised the keys of No 11 Downing Street only until next year. Mr Major, meanwhile, needs experienced shoulders to lean on as he begins the painful process of rebuilding his political authority. He has to carry the heavyweights if he is to carry his cabinet. Entirely coincidentally, another change over the past month has reinforced the influence of Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke over the shaping of economic policy. When the new cabinet committee - EDX - was established to handle the public-spending round, the assumption was that it would simply be a mechanism to deliver the Treasury's public-spending targets. In fact, it is proving also a vehicle for the other ministers to play a prominent part in the shaping of spending priorities once set almost randomly in the bilateral bargaining conducted by the Treasury. There are no prizes for guessing who in EDX is arguing that big infrastructure projects must be protected as far as possible from the spending axe. But it is the ERM - or rather whether the British economy can promise sufficient convergence with its stronger European partners to allow the pound's eventual re-entry - that will continue the politics of economic management. And here the men who put their hands in the blood on September 16 will demand their say.</p>

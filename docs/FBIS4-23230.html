			<p>BFN     [Text] In Guinea, a member of the National Electoral  Commission [CEN], the Alliance for National Renewal [ARENA], has  withdrawn from the commission. ARENA's leader, Dr. Sekou  Koressi Conde, told our correspondent Ben Daouda Sylla in  Conakry the reasons for this decision:    [Begin Conde recording] Indeed, we do not accept the fact  that the CEN is an appendage of the Interior Ministry because  that is unconstitutional. Second, we believe that we have some  obligations toward the people who support our political action.  As far as we are concerned, we have an obligation of loyalty  toward them which does not allow us to participate in any  tricks. We have requested the setting up of a constitutional  council and a state council. We accept the fact that the  Supreme Court should be the highest body but we also say that we  want the setting up of a constitutional council, even if it has  consultative functions. The CEN's present composition is  outdated, therefore, the ARENA is withdrawing from it. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Equity Markets: Unanswered questions in energy sector - New York The share prices of the big energy companies could defy a falling oil price for only so long. However, Friday's knee-jerk stock market reaction to last week's Opec meeting, which saw all the big US oil groups marked down, left two questions unanswered: which companies will come through the downturn the strongest, and has the stock market now factored in a sustained slump in the price of oil? The companies likely to do best are those that are least exposed to the US, and those which have the biggest downstream (refining and marketing) operations, says Mr Constantine Fliakos, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Profits from non-US operations tend to hold up better because in some countries (such as Nigeria) oil companies trade on fixed margins, whatever the price. Also, higher production taxes outside the US leave foreign taxpayers picking up a higher proportion of any oil price fall. Integrated oil companies, meanwhile, can recover in higher downstream margins some of what they lose in lower upstream profits. It is difficult to predict how much downstream operations will benefit from lower prices. If the oil companies were unable to recover any of the oil price fall through higher downstream margins, a Dollars 1 drop in the price of a barrel of oil would take between 6 per cent and 7 per cent off the net income of Exxon or Royal Dutch/Shell, compared with a 14-15 per cent hit to British Petroleum or Texaco, estimates Mr Fliakos. Last week's share price movements seem to reflect a belief that the oil price will rebound again. 'If you thought this price was going to hold for the long term, you would mark the sector down a lot more,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. Mr Fliakos at Merrill, meanwhile, does not believe oil stocks have hit bottom yet. 'I would like to see some more damage done before I upgrade them again.' Another 10 per cent off share prices would do, he says. The US Christmas shopping season got off to its official start last Friday - the day after Thanksgiving - with market expectations high for a solid, if not a bumper, year for most retailers. The retail stocks have already benefited from signs of stronger consumer demand during the third quarter. Also, analysts do not want to repeat their mistakes of last year, when most were unprepared for the sharp post-election rise in spending at Christmas. Mr Ed Johnson, at brokers Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan, says he is conservative in predicting a rise in sales of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent over last year. The market will be watching the behaviour of shoppers carefully to see if expectations such as these are being fulfilled.</p>

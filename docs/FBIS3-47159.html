			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok predicted Monday that Pyongyang will agree to resume  inter- Korean talks once enough time has passed.    "Pyongyang will soon recognize that mutual nuclear  inspection  between South and North Korea to implement the South-North non-  nuclear declaration is an unchangeable position of South Korea  and the United States as Pyongyang-Washington negotiations make  progress," Yi, who is also unification minister, told the  National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification  Committee.    The two Koreas were negotiating an exchange of special  envoys  when working-level contacts were abruptly suspended by the North  in early November last year. Seoul had asked that the special  envoys discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and summit  talks, but Pyongyang insisted they should only talk about a  summit.    "We cannot rule out the possibility that an exchange of  special envoys to settle North Korea's nuclear problem can be  realized and that, with gradual settlement of the nuclear  problem, inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation in the fields of  personnel and materials will be promoted little by little," he  said.    Yi said he also expected North Korea to propose a contact  and  exchange of personnel with private organizations in South Korea  in a bid to weaken the government's position.    North Korea, which has reinforced its underground military  facilities and saved enough war materials to fight without  outside help for up to five months, is expected to maintain its  war mobilization posture this year, he said.    "North Korea is developing a SCUD-E (Nodong-2) missile as a  strategic weapon and has expanded its SCUD regiment to a SCUD  brigade," he said.    Yi explained the government's basic policy on the North and  said that the government, if it judges that North Korean nuclear  transparency is secured, will begin putting into practice the  projects contained in the basic and attached North-South  agreements.    "The reunion of divided family members, which could help  alleviate their agony and sadness, should not be delayed any  longer. It is a basic human matter transcending ideology and  political system," he said.    To bring about reunions, Seoul will establish a meeting  house  in Panmunjom where members of separated families from South and  North can meet and a post office where mail can be exchanged, he  said.    The South will actively push ahead with consultations with  the North on ways to allow old people to visit their birthplaces  in the other half, Yi said.</p>

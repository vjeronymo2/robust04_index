			<p>BFN     [Text] Italian Ambassador Umberto Pestalozzi [name and  title as received], Swedish Ambassador Andreas Aadahl [name and  title as received], and Gerald (Hamilton), the CSCE commissioner  in Latvia, met President Guntis Ulmanis today. This time all  three supported the CSCE's opinion regarding the Latvian  citizenship bill. They stressed that they supported the  interests of the Latvian state and saw that much has already  been achieved after independence was regained. However, parts  of the bill, which do not meet CSCE requirements, are now  causing a certain anxiety.    The Swedish ambassador acknowledged that it was impossible  to  achieve in three years what other European countries have  achieved in the whole post-war period, and that the issue of the  presence of ethnic minorities in Latvia was also the issue of  survival for the Latvian people.    The Italian ambassador stressed that not everyone presently  fully understands the particular significance of the citizenship  law and the consequences that may follow if the bill is passed  in its present version. That will also complicate Latvia's  joining the European Council.    The CSCE commissioner, for his part, noted that the part of  the draft law, which lays down naturalization quotas, was  considered the most critical point. He said experts from the  Council of Europe were currently in Riga and they will help the  Saeima work out a suitable version that international  organizations, including the Council of Europe and the CSCE,  will be able to support.</p>

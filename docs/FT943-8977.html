			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: A blind case of self-parody - Alastair Macaulay reviews Brian Friel's new play 'Molly Sweeney' in Dublin If Tale of Two Cities were a new play by Brian Friel, this is how it would begin: 'I remember Ballybeg. It was the best of times, oh yes, the best. Oh hadn't we the gaiety at Phil the Fluter's ball, hadn't we just - and what gaiety. Joy, such joy. I remember dancing - dancing with no sense of time, no sense of place, just dancing, liberated in the moment - and I remember thinking we could never stop. And then I thought Phil was somehow less happy than he was allowing us to see. Because, though it was the best of times, the best, it was also the worst. Certainly for Phil, the worst. I remember saying 'You were never lovelier' to him, and he said to me 'Your sense of reality is a sense only of external reality.' Anyhow, anyhow . . . I crib most of this parody from Friel's Molly Sweeney. Why? Because this new play - which opened in Dublin's Gate Theatre on Tuesday - is mere self-parody. Granted, the beloved author of Dancing at Lughnasa, Translations, Philadelphia, Here We Come], and others, has turned to new subject-matter here. In Molly Sweeney he gives us the case-study of a contentedly blind married woman. When an operation partially restores her sight, she cannot cope with her new plenitude of sensation. She withdraws both from seeing and from consciously acknowledging the world around her. Questions of inner v. external vision, specifically attached to Bishop Berkeley's 1709 Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision, are raised. So what does Friel do with all this new stuff? He trots out all his corniest old tricks. You may recall that one New York critic, unjustly but memorably, dubbed Dancing at Lughnasa 'the memory play from hell'. Well, in Molly Sweeney Friel has plunged many circles lower into the memory-play inferno. For its first two hours and a half, all its three characters do is remember. Molly, her ophthalmic surgeon Mr Rice, and her husband Frank tell us their memories; and they digress plenty too. (Anyhow . . . ) They never converse with each other. Then, in the final five minutes, Molly switches into the present tense. At last] But then you realise that her continuous 'present' is an inner world compiled from - guess what? - memories, memories we have already heard. It is astounding how sluggishly, and with what bathetic repetitions, Molly Sweeney tells its tale. Its essential dilemma - a heroine confronted with an uncomfortable new take on reality - is the same as addressed by Harold Pinter with far more bite in his brief playlet A Kind of Alaska. Friel adds a woolly sub-feminist filter; he shows us that Molly's doctor and husband, less utterly interested in her than she supposes, are preoccupied by other aspects of their own lives. All three characters were always stuck in their own private worlds, you see, and Molly, retreating into memory, is actually less selfish than the men. I hope it is only by accident that Molly Sweeney in several features resembles another Pinter play Landscape - which was revived with such distinction in this very theatre in May. Here too the heroine speaks of light and shade, of the shadow of a window, and of the direction from which light is coming; here too her sensuous interest in the world is contrasted with petty male power-games; here too she retreats into memory; here too nothing happens except in the past. Accident or not, Friel has stripped his play of drama (whereas Pinter's plotlessness intensifies his drama). Other Friel plays have have created stage events that haunt the beholder long afterwards, such as the great ceilidh in Dancing at Lughnasa in which the sisters release their primitive impulses, or the dialogue between English soldier and Irish girl in Translations, speaking to each other in their own languages, never knowing that they are voicing desires diametrically opposed. Joe Vanek's set is most eloquent: it has a triangular front area where the three characters sit (occasionally rising) and talk, a rear, petal-laden area into which Molly finally withdraws, and a glowing, blurred garden view that looks like Odilon Redon's idea of the garden at Argenteuil. TP McKenna, the best of the three actors in the best role, makes the most of Mr Rice's few ironic complexities. The role of Molly, however, contains little but monochrome, lyrical, reflective charm: as Catherine Byrne's performance reveals. As for Frank Sweeney, Mark Lambert carries on like a cheap cartoon of misdirected energy; the role isn't much, but it is slightly more human than this. Maybe we should blame the director: namely, Friel himself. In one passage, Molly recalls her utter pleasure in swimming when blind, swimming in all its tactile and sensuous delight, swimming so fully enjoyed in her sightlessness that she felt that the pleasure felt by swimmers with vision must be a less complete pleasure. This might be a telling image, but what it tells has been told by Friel before. Viz: all the benefits of civilisation do nothing but educate us away from our most innocent and fulfilling instincts. Ballybeg - locale of so many Friel plays - may have had its troubles over the centuries, but in each play it starts out as a carefree Garden of Eden. Then the inhabitants of Ballybeg eat the fruit of the tree of progress. I remember Ballybeg, oh yes; I remember the paradise I lost. At the Gate Theatre, Dublin. It will transfer to the Almeida Theatre, London.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Harbin remembers medical atrocities THE most notorious site at Harbin, in north China, lies 20km south of the city in the village of Pingfang, where a secret Japanese research establishment experimented on living human beings from 1936 until the Japanese surrender in August 1945. During that time at least 3,000 people, mostly Chinese, Russians, Mongols, and Koreans, were injected with deadly viruses, exposed to poison gas, frozen slowly to observe the effects of frostbite, and dissected alive. Unit 731 of the Japanese army was assigned to germ warfare research, exposing people in north China, then the puppet Japanese state of Manchukuo, to plague, dysentery, anthrax and tuberculosis. When the Americans reached Pingfang at the end of the war, they freed the perpetrators of these terrible crimes in exchange for all the research data that had been collected. None of the 3,000 Japanese officers and men was ever bought to trial. One thousand were medically qualified personnel like the commander of Unit 731, Ishii Shiro, who died in his bed in 1959. Jing Chengmin receives foreign guests to the little museum, opened a few years ago to commemorate the victims and keep alive the memory of the atrocities committed. It is housed in what were the offices of Commander Shiro. The former headquarters building is used by Harbin Middle School number 17. Mr Jing, of Korean nationality, speaks Japanese and Korean and receives 6,000 foreigners to the museum a year, 4,000 of them Japanese. More than 40,000 Chinese come here every year. Mr Jing says the Japanese people know about these atrocities, but not very much. The Japanese government still tries to pretend these things were not done, but 'inside they know'. It has taken decades to arrive at an official Japanese acknowledgement, made last month, that the Imperial Army procured Asian women, most of them Korean, as prostitutes. To better inform the Japanese people what happened at Pingfang, a two-week exhibition was staged in Osaka in 1988. With the collapse of Japan in 1945, Unit 731 tried to destroy all evidence of its activities, blowing up the research centre and the central prison where victims for live experiments were held. The animal houses were also destroyed but Chinese claim that, before retreating in defeat, the Japanese freed the infected animals, and 103 people in the surrounding area died of the plague. Among live testimony, recorded on video and sold by the museum, a former Chinese forced labourer at Unit 731 recalls seeing the Japanese transport victims by rail to the camp. A former Japanese soldier with the Unit describes the horror of seeing people experimented on alive. They were tied to trees a few metres apart and a bacterial bomb was exploded beside them. 'Sometimes you could not bear to watch it.' The little museum, soon to be replaced by a larger, grander and perhaps less effective building, sells souvenirs and fashion patterns, furs, necklaces, scrolls and graphic black and white photographs of Japanese war crimes against Chinese. With suspected Nazi war criminals still being brought to trial in the west, I asked Mr Jing how he felt about the fact that no Japanese involved with the crimes against humanity perpetrated at Pingfang had ever came to trial. 'We should let bygones be bygones,' he said. 'This affair is history.'</p>

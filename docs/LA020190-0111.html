			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> TEACHERS CALL FOR SANCTIONS IN YEAR-OLD CONTRACT TALKS  </P> <P> Teachers in the Compton Unified School District have asked the California  Teachers Assn. to sanction the district for what the teachers say is a refusal  to negotiate.  </P> <P> "We've been trying to negotiate a contract with this district since last  February," said Muriel Brooks, president of the Compton Education Assn., which  represents the district's 1,085 teachers.  </P> <P> In December, the district asked for a state fact-finder, a move teachers  branded as stalling because the fact-finding report will not be ready for a  month. Sanctions, Brooks suggested, could include a plea to university job  placement bureaus not to refer new teachers to Compton.  </P> <P> The CTA executive board is scheduled to take up the sanction request at its  two-day meeting that begins today. However, CTA dropped sanctions from its  bylaws a decade ago and CTA President Ed Foglia said he did not know what  action the board would take.  </P> <P> The request, Foglia said, "points out more than anything that there's a real  chronic problem we've had in Compton in labor relations and we think it affects  the school program."  </P></p>

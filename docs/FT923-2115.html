			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions traditionally, where the first show of economic recovery is evident - directors at four companies have been buying. Sir Oswald Davies, a non-executive director of AMEC, purchased 50,000 shares at 59.5p while the chairman, chief executive and finance director of Taylor Woodrow all acquired shares at prices between 36.5p and 41p. The company had announced interim results earlier this week. Newman Tonks, the building materials group, has seen its share price fall from over 160p at the beginning of the year to about 90p. Both the chief executive and finance director bought a total of 25,008 shares at 94p. At Norcros, another building materials and property group, the entire board of eight purchased stock at prices between 73-74p, thus increasing their holdings by a fairly sizeable proportion. Fisons, in the health and household sector, reported interim results affected by continuing problems of supply and regulation in the pharmaceutical division. The chairman bought 26,500 shares at 151p, which now accounts for the majority of his holding. Shandwick, a public relations company, saw sizeable buying by three directors at prices between 2.75-3.25p. Since the end of last year, the share price has collapsed from around 140p. But following the announcement of director dealing, the price rallied to 5p and director activity has continued.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            No of Company                   Sector    Shares    Value    directors  -------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Burtonwood Brewery         Brew     50,000       60         1 Dartmoor IT                InTr     35,000       32         1 Leslie Wise                Text    500,000      280         1 MacDonald Martin           Brew     15,750       82         1 Nobo Group                 Misc    200,000      200         1 Reliance Securities        BuSe      8,000       22         1 Sainsbury J                FdRe     34,883      157         1*  -------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- AMEC                        C&amp;C     50,000       30         1 Banner Homes                C&amp;C     93,750       15         1 Black Arrow                Misc     83,518       16         2 CRH                        BdMa      7,000       14         1 English China Clays        OthI     36,800      142         2 Evans Halshaw              Motr     33,000       55         3 Fairhaven                   O&amp;G    100,000       19         1 Fisons                     Hlth     26,500       40         1 Haden MacLellan            EngG    162,250       44         3 Hambros                    Merc     10,000       21         1 Hillsdown Holdings         FdMa     20,000       20         1 Newman Tonks               BdMa     25,008       24         2 Norcros                    OthI     61,568       46         8 Pegasus                    Elec     20,000       30         1 Shandwick                   Med  3,846,152      115         3 St Modwen                  Prop    225,000       29         1 Taylor Woodrow              C&amp;C    147,000       57         3 Thorn EMI                  Hotl     11,380       77         1 Tinsley Robor              Pack    515,000       28         3 Transatlantic BCvPf        InsL     25,000       17         1 Williams Holdings          OthI      5,000       12         1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

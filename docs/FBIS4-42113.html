			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, May 27 (CNA)--Russia and Cyprus held talks  this week in Moscow on bilateral issues concerning  telecommunications and postal services.    The talks were conducted between Communications and Works  Minister Adhamos Adhamidhis and Russian officials during  Adhamidhis' eight-day visit to Moscow, which ended this morning.    Discussions focused on the possibility of amending an  existing bilateral agreement on air transport to allow an  increase of the respective national carriers, from one to two.    A Russian delegation is expected to visit Cyprus soon to  examine in detail the repercussions of such a move.    Direct satellite telecommunications links were also on the  agenda of the talks, during which the two sides expressed  satisfaction with this facility.    Cyprus suggested that its network is used to link Russia  with  Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Greece, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The  matter will be discussed further at a later stage.    The ministers decided to organise a joint philatelic  exhibition and possibly issue a common series of stamps.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fokker blames interest charges for 37% plunge FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker in which Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany is to take a 51 per cent stake later this year, yesterday blamed higher interest charges for a 37.5 per cent decline in first-half profits and for an expected fall of more than 50 per cent in full-year results. First-half net profit fell sharply to Fl 26.3m (Dollars 15.9m) from Fl 42.2m the year before, as net interest costs jumped to Fl 56.9m from Fl 38.9m in the first six months of 1991. The increase in interest payments - which reflects delays in deliveries of completed aircraft as well as a slowdown in the receipt of new orders and advance payments - is also expected to cause 1992 net profit to fall to roughly Fl 40m from Fl 87m the year before, the company said. Mr Rennie Hendriksen, Fokker's finance director, said they had arranged new credit facilities of Fl 1bn with a consortium of Dutch and British banks. The rise in first-half interest charges was also partly the result of the postponement of a planned Fl 500m issue of new shares. Under an agreement reached last month, Dasa will now take up the entire share issue as well as purchase the 32 per cent stake in Fokker held by the Dutch government. The exact price which Dasa will pay for these Fokker shares has not yet been fixed. In response to queries, Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, Fokker's chairman, said prices frequently quoted in the Dutch press, such as Fl 38 per share, were 'low'. Fokker's shares have recently fallen to around 12-month lows of Fl 22, due partly to the fact that Dasa will not be launching a public bid to attain its controlling 51 per cent stake. Minority shareholders have criticised the deal because their shares will be worth less than the government will receive for its holding. However, Mr Hendriksen said the transaction 'was not a dilution but an enrichment', arguing that Dasa, as part of the Germany's Daimler industrial group, would be able to provide financing for Fokker, thereby avoiding the need for interest payments in future.</p>

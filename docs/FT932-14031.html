			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Receivers revive half of companies NEARLY HALF of all com-panies entering receivership emerge asviable businesses, a survey by the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency shows. More than two-fifths of employees whose companies enter insolvency proceedings retain their jobs, providing evidence that the practitioners can help save businesses. The survey, released yesterday, covered 1,686 corporate insolvencies handled from April to September last year by 168 practitioners who are members of the society, the leading trade body. 'We are corporate surgeons and not undertakers,' said Mr Mark Homan, president of the society and head of corporate reconstruction at accountancy firm Price Waterhouse. The survey showed that of all companies entering receivership, 53 per cent ended up with a break-up sale of assets. The figure was 33 per cent for companies in administration and 19 per cent for those in company voluntary arrangements. The rest of the companies were divided between full survival, and full or partial sale as a going concern to their management or third parties. Most insolvencies related to smaller companies, with 81 per cent accounted for by those with between one and 14 employees. Just 4 per cent were companies with more than 50 employees. For companies with more than 400 employees, 93 per cent of jobs were saved following insolvency procedures, compared with 17 per cent of jobs for companies with up to 14 employees. Based on the assessment of the insolvency practitioners, more than a third of company collapses were the result of management failures. A further 31 per cent were the result of the loss of markets. Just 4 per cent resulted from the loss of long-term finance and 19 per cent from a lack of working capital or cashflow. Fraud accounted for 2 per cent of cases. Mr Homan said the insolvency profession needed to study how to increase the survival rate for smaller companies. He said insolvency procedures needed 'fine tuning', by finding ways to make them cheaper and less tied to court proceedings. Observer, Page 25</p>

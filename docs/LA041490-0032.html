			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : A 'BIG DAY' FOR SLATER  </P> <P> "I don't think my agents tell me when plays come up," jokes Helen Slater, who's  taking a break from her busy film and TV schedule to play nervous bride Moey  Bowes in Douglas McGrath's new comedy, "The Big Day," opening next Sunday at  the Pasadena Playhouse. "I get to fall apart and be emotional," says the  actress, 26, who's married in real life to film editor Rob Watzke. "There's  also a big surprise, but I'm not allowed to talk about it."  </P> <P> Slater's other projects are less secretive. The film "Happy Together," in which  she stars opposite Patrick Dempsey as mismatched college roomies, opens locally  on May 4. After "The Big Day," she's off to Texas to film the dark comedy "In  Deep," playing a lawyer who gets romantically involved with her client, a black  man. And she's just made her TV debut on the new ABC series "Capital News," as  bright-eyed, bushy-tailed cub reporter Anne McKenna.  </P> <P> Research for that role included hanging out with a Times Metro writer and  talking with reporters at the Washington Post, on which the series is loosely  based. "I think it's amazing," she says of the journalist's life. "As a  reporter, you have carte blanche to ask any question. And you'd have to have an  unusually pessimistic nature to be constantly dealing with deception. I think  it would be wearing after awhile."  </P> <P> Born on Long Island, raised in Maryland and Manhattan, Slater attended New  York's prestigious High School for the Performing Arts -- before Hollywood  beckoned with roles in "Supergirl," "The Legend of Billie Jean," "Ruthless  People" and "The Secret of My Success." As for acting, "I love doing it . . .  but 80% of the time you're not working. My real desire is to return to school  and get a degree. If I could choose any career in the world? I think I'd be an  elementary school teacher." JANICE ARKATOV  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister </F> Yuriy Kostenko "specially for VYBIR"]    [Text] The Ukrainian parliament's decision to lift the  moratorium on nuclear power engineering development and to  continue operation of the Chernobyl NPP [nuclear power plant]  has given rise to a number of important questions. The main  question is: Was that decision scientifically grounded from  economic and ecological points of view or will it lead to the  situation when, in 10 years, we will have to build several  "sarcophaguses" like the one we have in Chernobyl today? To  answer this question, I will try to briefly analyze the state of  affairs in our nuclear power industry and the prospects of its  development in Ukraine and elsewhere. There are 14 nuclear  power units in Ukraine which are located in five sites,  involving 10 VVER-1000 reactors, two VVER-440 reactors, and two  notorious RBMK-1000 reactors of Chernobyl type. As far as the  unit number is concerned, Ukraine occupies the seventh place in  the world and the fifth in Europe. As for the nuclear capacity,  equalling 12,880 MW [megawatts], Ukraine exceeds Great Britain,  being inferior in Europe only to France, Germany and Russia.  Despite that, our country remains part of the once single  nuclear power complex and cannot exist outside it. Having  become an independent country, Ukraine had a unique opportunity  to set up the state of the art nuclear safety system allowing  for domestic and world experience. However, unwillingness of the  Ukrainian officialdom to solve this problem in a comprehensive  manner, also the pressure on the part of pronuclear  parliamentarian lobby created the situation when today we have  the same obsolete system of the bodies responsible for nuclear  and radiation safety, the system that existed in the USSR. This  fact, also inadequate industrial infrastructure and  scientific-technological support prevent Ukraine to ensure  adequate safety of its NPP's. On the other hand, almost  complete dependence of this country on Russia in the NPP  operation domain makes it possible for the latter to regulate  the development of Ukrainian nuclear power industry in its own  interests. This is very important for Russia today when there  appear cardinal changes in its nuclear power complex  characterized by drastic labor cuts and closure of nuclear  industry enterprises as a result of reduction in financing of  military nuclear programs. Given this, the Russian Government  tries to reorient its nuclear industry to fulfillment of civil  programs. This is proved by the latest decisions of the Russian  Government on financing of construction of new NPP units. The  Russian Nuclear Engineering Ministry is going to promote both  Russian and Ukrainian nuclear power programs, to support the  relevant decisions taken by the Ukrainian parliament involving  continuation of Chernobyl NPP operation and completion of  construction of six new VVER-1000 units. Why? Because such  decisions help provide new orders for the Russian nuclear  complex and said ministry. So, it is hard to answer for whom  our NPP's work -- Ukraine or Russia? Ukraine boasts rich  deposits of uranium. We also have zirconium, hafnium, niobium,  other rare-earth elements required for nuclear fuel cycle. The  Ukrainian plants produce "heavy water" as well. We have a  powerful scientific potential. It is worth underscoring that  the fulfillment of the Ukrainian nuclear program depends on  solution of the following main problems:     -  Improvement of competitiveness of domestic nuclear  industry;    -  Raising the nuclear safety to the level excluding the  possibility of grave accidents at the Ukrainian NPP;    -  Safe  handling of radioactive wastes.     It is more profitable for our NPP's to use not enriched but  natural uranium. For instance, fuel cycle of the Canadian  reactors of CANDU type, that utilize natural uranium, is much  simpler, cheaper and ecologically safer versus that of VVER or  RBMK reactors which employ enriched uranium. There is no need  to enrich uranium while the waste fuel in such reactors has a  very small number of fissionable isotopes thus facilitating  solution of the fuel storage and burial problem. Besides, CANDU  reactors can be used to burn the fuel from VVER reactors.  Usually, service life of nuclear reactors is 30-40 years but,  in fact, it is about 15-20 years taking into account the safety  requirements. For instance, today in the world, some 80  reactors, that had worked 17-20 years, have been removed from  service. The nuclear boom of the 1960's has been replaced in  many countries by a "terrible hangover" in the form of closure  of quite a few NPP's. This involves the growth of relevant  expenses and the problem of nuclear waste utilization.  According to the State nuclear power committee, removal of  Chernobyl NPP from service will cost $2 billion. If this is  true, the idea of nuclear power engineering development in  Ukraine becomes rather doubtful. In the NPP's with VVER-type  reactors, steam generators should be replaced in 7-12 years. As  regards the CANDU reactors, their horizontal fuel channels must  be replaced in 11-12 years, not in 40 years as the reactor  designers believed. The RBMK reactor requires full replacement  of fuel channels after 20 years of operation. We annually spend  10-15 percent of our budget to fight against Chernobyl  aftermath. One should also take into account the huge  contaminated area and Chernobyl hazardous effect on human  health. Chernobyl proves that there exist certain critical  economic and geographic dimensions when the accident of such  scale is capable of ruining the country's economy.    NPP's heat discharges twice exceed those of ordinary heat  and power stations since their heat cycle efficiency is 30  percent versus 50 percent of heat and power stations. This fact  and the necessity to use the closed water circulation systems  require creation of big cooling water reservoirs near NPPs which  change ecologic balance there. An example of this is location  of the Zaporizhya NPP close to a heat and power station which  enhanced the negative effect of sulfur oxide and nitrogen  discharges. Situation with radioactive wastes in Ukraine is a  real catastrophe. Huge amounts of such wastes were produced by  Chernobyl. There are over 100 radioactive sources whose use in  national economy is not controlled adequately, more than 70  million cubic meters of wastes stored in mining industry dumps.  Such wastes are used as the fuel for NPP's but, at the same  time, they are a powerful source of environmental contamination.  Most radioactive wastes are generated by NPP's. Experts warn  that absence of adequate technologies and national centers for  treatment and burials of such wastes prevents to ensure proper  safety of NPP's. The problem is aggravated by absence of the  state strategy and infrastructure for handling the wastes.  Solution of such problems is the chief prerequisite for  development of domestic nuclear power industry. First of all,  it is necessary to define the notion of the waste nuclear fuel.  Experts from some countries (Russia, Great Britain, France,  China, Japan etc.) maintain that this notion includes such  valuable materials as uranium, plutonium, isotopes and  rare-earth elements. Other experts (Canada, Sweden, United  States) regard this fuel as radioactive wastes. It is evident  that in the first case it would be unprofitable for Ukraine to  give such valuable [materials] to Russia free of charge. On the  other hand, at any time, Russia may refuse to accept such  materials from our country. Should this happen, we must  construct our own temporary "dry" storages where the wastes may  be kept from five to 120 years. Then we can start thinking  about the ways of wastes utilization and burial. Our efforts  today should be channeled to raising the NPP safety and wastes  utilization. Urgent measures in this field include:  replacement of Chernobyl reactors by more reliable and safe  VVER-type reactors in Zaporizhya, Rivno and Khmelnytsky NPPs;  construction of temporary storages for nuclear wastes;  production of fuel assemblies by the Ukrainian enterprises that  will help improve the NPP safety. All of us are responsible for  "nuclear future" of Ukraine -- either it will be bright or  covered with radioactive clouds.</p>

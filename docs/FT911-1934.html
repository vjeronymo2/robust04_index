			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Some cars 50% dearer in Britain says MMC SOME pre-tax car prices charged in the UK are more than 50 per cent higher than those in certain other European markets, according to a confidential study prepared for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The commission, which is investigating claims that car makers charge excessive prices in the UK, has provisionally concluded that at least two so-called 'complex monopolies' exist in the supply of new cars, which 'prevent, restrict or distort' competition in the UK. These are: The 'gentlemen's agreement' between the British and Japanese motor industries which in effect has restricted imports of Japanese cars into the UK to less than 11 per cent of the market, and; Car makers' selective distribution systems. The MMC has written to 46 UK car makers and importers outlining its provisional conclusions and detailing the supporting evidence it has gathered in the last 12 months. The industry will have a last chance in coming weeks to respond to these findings and influence the final report, which is to be presented to Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, by early August. The MMC has still to decide whether the 'complex monopolies' it has identified operate against the public interest and whether the government should take action but its provisional findings are likely to meet fierce opposition from the motor industry. The line of attack taken by the inquiry threatens to undermine long-entrenched restrictive car pricing and distribution practices in the UK and could lead to a revolution in the 1990s in the way cars are retailed. The present restriction on Japanese car imports to the UK is already expected to be abandoned at the end of 1992 as a result of the creation of the European single market. The controversial pricing study prepared for the commission by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive consultants, quotes, as one example, the October 1990 pre-tax prices, adjusted for differing equipment levels, for a 1.1 litre Ford Fiesta. The prices range from Pounds 5,828 in the UK to Pounds 5,451 in Ireland, Pounds 4,359 in Germany, Pounds 4,311 in France, Pounds 4,057 in Belgium and Pounds 3,788 in the Netherlands. The British price is nearly 54 per cent higher than the equivalent Dutch price. Another example, on the same basis, shows the price of a BMW 318i varying from Pounds 9,086 in France to Pounds 9,960 in Belgium, Pounds 10,027 in the Netherlands, Pounds 10,053 in Germany, Pounds 10,547 in the UK and Pounds 12,673 in Ireland. The study compares car prices in six European markets and seeks to make comparisons between pre-tax prices, as well as between post-tax on-the-road prices. The scale of price discrepancies found by the study varies considerably from model to model and from car maker to car maker. Car producers and importers in the UK are expected to contest vigorously the study's findings. The industry has claimed that previous studies, such as those made by European consumer organisations, have failed fully to take account of key factors that distort prices across Europe, such as varying car tax rates, differing model specifications, exchange rate movements and discount levels. Pricing is a highly sensitive issue for the car makers, which are currently facing two investigations, the MMC's study and a parallel inquiry by the European Commission. The two investigations are expected to play a vital role in the European Commission's review of the present 'block exemption', which allows car makers to employ selective distribution systems in Europe contrary to EC competition regulations. The 10-year block exemption, granted until 1995, is conditional on pre-tax car prices not varying between EC member states by more than 12 per cent in the long term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year. The MMC claims that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association the UK and Japanese motor industry trade associations, constitute a 'complex monopoly' which limits competition. The MMC letter says that discussions between the two trade associations have taken place regularly since 1975 and have consistently led to imports of new Japanese cars into the UK being limited to 'a specific share by volume of the forecast total UK supply'. Under the selective distribution 'complex monopoly' it questions a series of car makers' existing practices. These include: The granting of exclusive sales territories. Limits placed on the number and locations of dealerships allowed to individual car retailer groups. Prohibitions on selling competing makes at the same site. Refusing to supply new cars for resale except through the supplier's franchised dealer system. Offering in the UK only part of the car range available in other parts of the EC. Offering specified classes of customers discriminatory discounts unrelated to cost. Editorial Comment, Page 22</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Newly-started phone-in  programs have given Beijing residents easy access to TV and  radio to voice opinions and vent feelings.    A group of passengers called in to tell the Beijing-based  CCTV, China's only national TV station, that they intended to  sue a domestic airline over a delayed flight.    Three days after CCTV covered the issue in a peak-hour  program called "Focus Moment," the Civil Aviation Administration  of China (CAAC) put out new rules for airline companies to  compensate delayed travelers.    "Focus Moment," whose hot-line paging number is publicized  nation-wide, received hundreds of telephone calls from all over  the country.    Zhang Haichao, producer of the program, said that it is one  of the most popular programs in the capital because ordinary  people want to have their own voices on the air.    Like CCTV, all TV and radio stations in Beijing are  government sponsored. Most of them have broadcast phone-in  programs in the past two years, which enjoyed wide popularity  that promises good returns.    Wang Liang, director of the Beijing Communications Radio  Station, said that these programs are encouraged by the  government because they are "close to the people and to life."  The government has stipulated that in a market economy, the  media must operate both with good social efficacy and good  economic returns.    Wang, former director of the Beijing Economic Radio Station,  opened the first live phone-in broadcast program in Beijing a  few years ago.    He said that in such a program, the studio speakers are open  to questions from all kinds of people, regardless of the  callers' age, literacy or background.    People found a vent for their anger at some problems in  daily  life through such phone-ins.    Recently, many people called in to the traffic radio station  to complain about chronical traffic jams at a busy fly-over in  west Beijing.    The radio station reported: "the bridge design is  inefficient," and it suggested drivers should go by other  routes. Many people took the advice and the jam at the bridge  improved. The complaints have dropped off.    Most of the radio and TV stations learn in what topic the  audience are most interested through letters and phone calls.  They also do regular or occasional surveys to see what is their  share of the potential audience.    Some hot-line programs are done from the site of an  incident,  so people can get information from the background sounds and  pictures. Sometimes, candid cameras are used to record illicit  activities.    Beijing residents like these programs better than the  others.  A CCTV survey showed that its hot-line program "Oriental Time  and Space" has the second slot in audience rating among all its  programs, beaten only by the news.</p>

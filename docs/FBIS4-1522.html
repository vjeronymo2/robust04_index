			<p>BFN     [Text] Lunan Cement Plant, China's first modernized large  cement enterprise to use domestically produced equipment  designed in China, and to be furnished with two new production  lines, formally passed the state acceptance test on 30 March.  This is a breakthrough in China's large cement industry as well  as a milestone in the history of developments in the building  materials industry. This has also put an end to China's long  history of importing modernized cement production lines from  abroad. The construction of the Lunan Cement Plant is a key  project of the state during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period.  All the major equipment of this plant was produced by China  itself. The two new production lines with a daily production  capacity of 2,000 tonnes of clinker [words indistinct] are  designed to produce 1.3 million tonnes of cement annually.    Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council; and Wang  Guangying, Lei Jieqiong, and Lu Jiaxi, vice chairmen of the  National People's Congress Standing Committee, wrote  inscriptions for and congratulated Lunan Cement Plant on its  receipt of state approval. Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the  provincial party committee, sent a congratulatory message to the  plant. (Zhang Renwei), director of the State Building Materials  Bureau, and Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, attended the completion ceremony.</p>

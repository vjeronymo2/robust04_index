			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TECATE: BEER IMPORT THAT'S NOT FLAT;  </P> <P> RETAILING: SALES OF THE MEXICAN BREW ARE UP 12%. DEMAND FOR FOREIGN BEVERAGES  OVERALL HAS LEVELED.  </P> <P> These are tough times for beer importers, but one Mexican beer is bucking the  trend. And no, it doesn't come in that familiar clear glass bottle.  </P> <P> After years of growth, sales of imported beer slowed for the first time in  1989, and industry analysts are predicting a continued decline in 1990.  </P> <P> An exception to the declining popularity of imports is Tecate, a Mexican lager  beer that saw its sales jump 12% last year to $32 million. Tecate's growth came  at the expense of its once-trendy rival, Mexico's Corona beer, which saw its  sales plunge 23% in 1989.  </P> <P> Tecate has benefited from its popularity with Latinos consumers, according to  executives of Wisdom Import Sales Co., an Irvine firm that distributes Tecate  and several other brands of Mexican beer -- not including Corona -- in the  United States.  </P> <P> Wisdom executives said Tecate is particularly popular among new immigrants from  Mexico, and the company targets promotions to the Latino community.  </P> <P> "The Hispanic community in Southern California drinks Tecate because it is a  national brand in Mexico -- a brand many Mexican immigrants are familiar with,"  said John Lennon, Wisdom's marketing manager. "When they move to the United  States, it is something they can identify with life at home."  </P> <P> Another important factor in Tecate's success has been the growing buying power  of Latinos in the United States. "The more they earn, the more they tend to  consume products from Mexico," said Manuel Rubiralta, the Mexican-born  president of Wisdom.  </P> <P> Tecate's growth has made it one of the 10 best-selling imported beers in the  nation. Of the top 10 imported beers, however, only Tecate, Labatt's Blue of  Canada and Amstel Light of the Netherlands managed to post sales increases in  1989.  </P> <P> In the first five months of 1990, beer imports were down 2.7% from the same  period last year, according to the National Beer Wholesalers Assn. in Falls  Church, Va.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say a weak dollar has raised the price of imported beers for  U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, importers and distributors have responded to  shrinking sales by trimming their advertising budgets.  </P> <P> According to Michael Mazzoni, vice president of Chicago-based Barton Beer Ltd.,  which is one of two Corona importers in the nation, sales of Corona beer  nationwide are expected to drop between 6% and 10% by year-end.  </P> <P> Tecate's sales, in contrast, were up 18% during the first six months of 1990,  the company says.  </P> <P> While Corona gained wide popularity among beer drinkers in the 1980s, analysts  say the brand failed to catch on with Latino consumers. Mazzoni blamed the  sales decline on more aggressive marketing efforts by U.S. beer makers and a  nine-week strike by Corona employees in Mexico City. But Peter Reid, editor of  the trade publication Modern Brewery Age, faults Corona for failing to step up  its marketing when its customers were defecting in droves to domestic labels.  </P> <P> Another reason for Tecate's sales growth, analysts say, is price and packaging.  A six-pack of Tecate currently sells at wholesale for about $4.50, compared to  $5 or more for a six-pack of Corona. Analysts also note that canned beer has  been growing in popularity, while sales of bottled beer have declined. Tecate  is sold in both cans and bottles, while Corona is available only in its  distinctive bottles.  </P> <P> Analysts also praise Wisdom management for making a far-sighted decision in the  mid-1980s to expand distribution beyond 13 Western states to all 50 states. The  move was intended to capture the Latino market as well as convert others at a  time when Mexican food was gaining popularity.  </P> <P> "There's more acceptability of Mexican brands in the American market and, with  that in mind, we decided to distribute nationwide," Rubiralta said. "We found  that when people eat Mexican food, they inevitably drink Mexican beer."  </P> <P> Rubiralta, 46, is seen as another reason for Tecate's success.  </P> <P> In a bid to become one of the nation's top beer importers, Rubiralta engineered  the merger in 1987 of his company with Cibco Importer Inc. of Houston, which  owns the distribution rights of Tecate beer in the East Coast.  </P> <P> At the time, the move made Wisdom the third-largest beer importer in the  nation. Following the merger, Frank Wisdom, the company's chairman, promoted  Rubiralta to president of the firm, the first non-family member to run the  company. Wisdom, which was sold three years ago to Grupo Visa S.A. of  Monterrey, Mexico, is currently the country's fifth-largest beer importer.  </P> <P> Besides Tecate, Wisdom's list of Mexican imports include Carta Blanca, Bohemia  and Chihuahua beers. Last year, the importer sold 6 million cases of beer in  the United States, worth about $60 million. This year, the company expects  sales to reach about $72 million.  </P> <P> But while sales are up, Rubiralta is troubled by some recent developments.  </P> <P> "There's a trend among beer wholesalers to merge, which makes it difficult for  us to distribute our beers," Rubiralta noted. With 410 foreign brands competing  and a shrinking number of distributors, wholesalers are swamped, sometimes  delaying deliveries of the beers to retailers, he added.  </P> <P> 10 BEST-SELLING IMPORTED BRANDS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:4.42IN:2.55IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Country  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Market  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rank Brand  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Importer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> of Origin  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Share  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.Heineken  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Van Munching &amp;

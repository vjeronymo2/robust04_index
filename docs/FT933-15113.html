			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / If you protest in the woods today . . .: The implications of an environmental victory For one glorious moment this week, the UK's environmentalists thought they had witnessed the unimaginable: the greening of the Department of Transport. In a move that took almost everyone by surprise, the government tore up long-standing plans to build a new crossing over the Thames in Greenwich, south-east London, because one of the approach roads would have cut through a clump of old and much-loved trees. Conservationists were astonished. In Britain, as in many other countries, protesting against unpopular road schemes is a national pastime, but few who indulge in it do so with any expectation of success. The Department of Transport is nicknamed the Department of Roads, and it is axiomatic in the roadbuilding business that, given a choice between the economic benefits conferred by a new motorway and the environmental benefits conferred by a local beauty spot, the economic arguments tend to prevail. So what went wrong with Oxleas Wood? True, some might have though it a pity to see one of London's last pieces of ancient woodland disappear under a few thousand tonnes of Tarmac. But as far as the department was concerned, plans for an East London River Crossing dated back to the Abercrombie Plan to rebuild London after the last war, and the Pounds 283m project would have formed a long-overdue and badly needed link between the London-Dover road and the capital's North Circular orbital road. Part of the explanation for the turnabout must lie in the sheer doggedness of the protestors. Led by a campaigning group called People Against the River Crossing, their story is one of a prolonged and bloody-minded refusal to be defeated. The group itself came into being when the first public inquiry into the scheme was held between September 1985 and December 1986. In 1989, it complained to the European Commission that the UK government had not carried out a proper environmental assessment of the scheme. (The case has yet to be heard.) In 1990, when the road scheme was altered, a second public inquiry was held. In 1992, nine local campaigners challenged the scheme in the High Court; and when the judgment went against them earlier this year, they took the matter to the Court of Appeal, where it was due to be heard in November 1993. Dot Lawrence, the group's 66-year-old secretary, says the Oxleas Wood campaign has taken over her life. Her garage and two bedrooms of her three-bedroom house are filled with paraphernalia from the campaign: papers, leaflets, T-shirts, maps. She says: 'I was a very minor person in the campaign at the beginning, looking after my mother and a job. I still don't understand a lot of it. As you grow up with it, you know more, you become more self-confident. In the end you start to live the whole damn thing.' Parc chairman Dr Barry Gray, a hospital consultant, attributes the group's success to perseverance and determination. It was, he believes, essential to have a hard core of 40 activists, who would outlast hundreds of other supporters whose interest was less constant, and the support of the local authority, Greenwich Council, which spent Pounds 1.5m pounds on fighting the scheme in public inquiries and the courts. Oxleas Wood gave a peculiar character to this planning dispute. Although opponents of the road scheme were also concerned about the proposed demolition of 240 homes, about the loss of other open spaces and about noise and air pollution, they focused attention on the wood itself. With emphasis on the rich diversity of species in the woodland, the campaigners succeeded in persuading national environmental organisations such as Friends of the Earth to give unprecedented backing to a specific, local campaign. With the help of these national groups, the campaigners distributed thousands of leaflets, asking people to pledge themselves to non-violent direct action in a Beat the Bulldozer campaign. To the politicians and the road lobby, that must have raised the frightening prospect of repeating the scenes witnessed on the M3 construction site at Twyford Down, in Hampshire, where earlier this month protestors staged a mass invasion. Perhaps the last straw came in May when the British Road Federation, a lobbying group which campaigns for more roadbuilding, swapped sides to join the anti-road protestors. Suddenly, the government found there was virtually no one left prepared to stand up and say they thought the road should go ahead. Mr Paul Everitt, the British Road Federation's assistant director, says his organisation's move came out of a recognition that the scheme as proposed would never be built in the face of such fierce opposition - particularly since the site's location in London put it within easy reach of television crews. There was also, he adds, a sense of ritual sacrifice about the affair. 'For many people it was a case of assuaging their guilt. They don't really like to think of their driving as detrimental to the environment, so Oxleas Wood was a symbol by which they would demonstrate their commitment to the environment.' All that apart, it is possible to read a slightly more political aspect into the change of mind. It is not surprising that a government with a thin parliamentary majority and a record low rating in the popularity polls should back away from such an unpopular project. There was also the matter of the EC's legal action against the government initiated by People Against the River Crossing in 1989. The government claims it was under no obligation to carry out an environmental assessment of the road scheme under a 1985 EC directive because the scheme was already in the pipeline when the directive was issued. But the government's case looked shaky, and a defeat would have been a severe embarrassment. It is also illuminating to consider the identity of the MP whose written Commons question voicing concern over Oxleas Wood provided the peg for the government's U-turn. Mr Peter Bottomley, the Conservative member for Eltham, recently emerged as one of the ringleaders in a Tory backbench rebellion over the government's controversial railway privatisation legislation. With the Railways Bill facing its gruelling final passage through the Commons after the summer recess, the government may now be hoping to find itself with one fewer rebel. How much significance the Oxleas Wood campaign holds for other planning disputes is therefore open to debate. Environmental campaigners are already drawing up a list of battles to fight over other sites but, in reality, Oxleas Wood looks like an isolated case. Transport ministers, it seems, have not gone green: they have merely gone pragmatic.</p>

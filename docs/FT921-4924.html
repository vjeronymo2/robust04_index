			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Coalition in Sind under pressure THE Pakistani government was last night seeking to hold together the ruling coalition in the troubled province of Sind following the death yesterday of Mr Jam Sadiq Ali, the chief minister. His 18-month rule was notorious for a political vendetta against opposition activists led by Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister. At the same time, Mr Ali managed to hold together an alliance of independent MPs and a smaller regional party to form the government in Sind even though Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party emerged as the largest single group after elections in October 1990. Sind is the home base of Ms Bhutto, and events there are also seen as crucial for the Pakistani economy. The coalition plans to nominate the provincial minister for co-ordination and home affairs, Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, as the next chief minister. However, Ms Bhutto met party aides in Karachi, as government leaders were attending Mr Ali's funeral, to see whether her party could now form a government.</p>

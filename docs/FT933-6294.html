			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hagemeyer turns in 20% first-half gain HAGEMEYER, the Dutch trading company, is on course to achieve higher full-year net profit after posting a 20.2 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Fl 50.6m (Dollars 30m), writes Ronald van de Krol. The company, which is owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong and markets and distributes branded products, said North American results showed a substantial increase, reflecting strong growth in consumer electronics and a better performance in speciality foods. Results in Asia/Pacific were good, while profits improved slightly in Europe. Overall, sales were up 2.6 per cent at Fl 1.66bn. Pre-tax profit on normal business operations rose by 10.7 per cent in the first half to Fl 77.2m, while Hagemeyer's tax bill fell by 6 per cent to Fl 17.9m. Lower interest rates helped cut financial costs to Fl 9.8m from Fl 13.5m.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAY JOHNSON; FORMER CONVICT TURNED TALENTS AGAINST CRIME  </P> <P> Ray Johnson, 62, an ex-convict who dedicated the last 20 years of his life  trying to prevent the kind of crimes that had landed him in California jails  and prisons since he was 7, has died at Scripps Memorial Hospital.  </P> <P> Johnson, who was born in New York and moved to San Diego with his family when  he was 1, died Sunday of kidney failure. He had been in poor health for the  past year, said Steve Casey, a longtime friend and spokesman for the San Diego  district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Once characterized by a judge as a man "too dangerous to be at large," Johnson  emerged from the California correctional system as an example of a  rehabilitated felon who went on to make a contribution to society.  </P> <P> Paroled from Folsom Prison in 1968, Johnson wearied of living outside the law  and transformed his criminal expertise, developed primarily from burglaries and  armed robberies, into a tool for fighting crime. He became an anti-crime  consultant for such firms as the Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven  convenience stores, and was an internationally known anti-crime lecturer. His  efforts were credited by 7-Eleven with a 20% decrease in robberies and  burglaries.  </P> <P> Johnson was recognized in 1978 by then-San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson for his  community service and for maintaining a crime-free existence for 10 years. In  1988, Mayor Maureen O'Connor presented Johnson with a similar honor,  celebrating 20 years of anti-crime behavior and service.  </P> <P> The reformed felon co-authored an autobiography in 1975 and appeared on the  "Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson on at least 30 occasions, said Casey, a  former newspaper reporter who met Johnson when he covered San Diego courts and  jails.  </P> <P> When he died, Johnson, a resident of Del Mar, was working on an anti-robbery  program for small businesses and a similar program for the elderly, Casey said.  </P> <P> Johnson is survived by his wife, Joanna.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held at El Camino Mortuary in San Diego at 1 p.m.  Monday.  </P></p>

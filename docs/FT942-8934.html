			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's It is the composition rather than the scale of Lloyd's loss for the 1991 underwriting year that gives greatest cause for concern. Business actually written in 1991 showed an underwriting loss, but notably less than the previous year. If that improvement continues, policies now being written should be profitable. Yet Lloyd's syndicates felt obliged to add Pounds 1bn to reserves to cover claims on policies written many years before. That is 70 per cent more than was set aside in the 1990 underwriting. While the pain from old years continues to mount, Names will not feel the benefit of business now being written. How much more pain is to come remains a matter of conjecture. Proposals for reform of US Superfund legislation could help reduce pollution claims. But the timing and impact of any reform is impossible to judge. Claims in areas such as asbestosis and professional indemnity insurance show no sign of abating. While Lloyd's appears to be better reserved than many US insurance companies, there is no way of knowing whether its reserves are sufficient. The plan to ring-fence old liabilities within a new company still looks the best hope of solving the problem. If there are not enough reserves set aside already to make the ring-fence secure, though, Names will again be asked to contribute. An audit of liabilities and reserves across Lloyd's should give a clearer picture. The results of that audit, together with haggling in the US Congress over Superfund, will determine whether Lloyd's can escape the legacy of the past.</p>

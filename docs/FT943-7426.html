			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Competition adds fire to battle in the air - How Brazil's three airlines are struggling to survive Brazil's three main airlines are cutting costs and seeking international alliances in a drive to counter the harsh economic environment. The carriers - Varig, Transbrasil and Vasp - have been hit by weak demand and by partial, but long-overdue, deregulation which has put pressure on revenues through increased domestic competition. On international routes the airlines face excess capacity and fierce competition from US carriers. To add to the pressures, lack of co-operation among the three has blocked some attempts to cut capacity and reduce costs. These problems have forced the carriers to reduce costs in radical restructuring programmes. Thousands of jobs have been cut, aircraft have been returned to leasing companies, and leases are being renegotiated. In March, Varig, Latin America's largest airline with sales of Dollars 2.5bn last year, suspended lease payments on 50 of its 80 aircraft and cut 2,600 jobs. Since then it has agreed to return four wide-bodied aircraft to leasing companies and is negotiating the return of another five. These measures are saving the airline Dollars 16m a month, according to Mr Rubel Thomas, chairman. He forecasts that, after losing Dollars 97m in the year to December 1993, the company will return to operating profit next year. Varig, controlled by an employees' foundation, has lost more than Dollars 1bn in the past six years. Varig, says Mr Thomas, has cut capacity by 14 per cent in the past year and is making money on domestic routes, where it has a 50 per cent market share. Competitors say its success is due to its ownership of half the busy Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro air shuttle and its dominance in overseas flights allows it to act as a feeder airline within Brazil. Mr Thomas says Varig must also improve its international performance since it relies on those operations for more than half its revenues. Traffic between Brazil and the US has increased from 900,000 passengers in 1989 to an estimated 1.5m this year. The increase has prompted Brazilian and US carriers to increase weekly flights from 40 to 61, hurting margins. Brazilian carriers have also faced more aggressive competition from American Airlines and United Airlines, which began flying to Brazil after the US renegotiated an air services agreement in 1989. Brazilian governments have always backed Varig, but officials say airlines can no longer rely on government support. Varig has linked with a US partner, Delta Airlines. It began a code-sharing agreement with Delta in June, and is now flying daily to Delta's Atlanta airport hub with connections to about 250 destinations in North America. The agreement, which also involves Varig in Delta's frequent flyer programme, is expected to improve the Brazilian carrier's international profitability, analysts say. Brazil's other two main airlines have been less successful in finding international partners. Transbrasil plans to cut 1,500 workers from its 5,000 workforce, and founder Mr Omar Fontana says he is considering the sale of 40 per cent of the company to a consortium of Brazilian and European banks. Vasp, which the state of Sao Paulo privatised in 1990, had a negative net worth of nearly Dollars 400m at the end of last year. It cut its workforce by 2,000 last year, and returned nearly half its fleet of 59 aircraft to leasing companies. This has led to a big cut in financing costs, but there are still uncertainties about how it can continue to service its net debt, which last year approached Dollars 400m. The shake-up follows years of over-regulation, when Varig was the only Brazilian airline allowed to operate internationally and Vasp and Transbrasil were given protected routes in the domestic market. This closed shop was partly opened in 1991 and 1992 under former president Mr Fernando Collor, who deregulated air fares and allowed regional airlines to offer non-stop routes between big cities. Marilia acute accent on first i (TAM), have been profitable in recent years. Unfortunately for the three main carriers, the deregulation coincided with a continuing fall in domestic demand. Due to Brazil's economic problems the market shrunk from 15bn revenue passenger kilometres in 1989 to 11.2bn last year and has fallen by another 5 per cent in the first half of this year, says Mr Sergio Kuczynski, Transbrasil's planning director. But the airlines have largely refused to co-operate on rationalising flights. Mr Gandra says the DAC has been unsuccessful in calls for more codesharing and cutting domestic capacity. Hopes that an economic stabilisation plan, launched this month, will boost demand led the airlines to postpone further capacity cuts at a meeting with the DAC in June, says Mr Thomas. Although the companies are attempting to tackle their problems, analysts believe the restructurings are overdue and that further cuts will be needed to secure their long-term future in an increasingly turbulent environment.</p>

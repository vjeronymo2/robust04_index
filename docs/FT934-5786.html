			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Water festival leaves Phnom Penh businesses adrift: Officials found a perfect excuse to oust riverside traders and residents The owners of floating restaurants and brothels along the riverside in central Phnom Penh have little to celebrate at Cambodia's water festival this year. They have been ordered by the city council to move their businesses to make way for spectators at boat races this weekend. Dozens of small businesses and hundreds of people living in shacks along the river bank have also been told to move as part of a 'make Phnom Penh beautiful' campaign. The water festival marks a bizarre annual event in Cambodia, when the Tonle Bassac river reverses direction. During the summer, the waters in the lower reaches of the river back up and it flows away from the sea towards the vast inland lake, Tonle Sap. Then, in November, the river reverses direction and again flows out to sea. Every year this is the cue for a weekend of national celebrations and for fiercely competitive boat races in the capital, Phnom Penh. For months, the Phnom Penh authorities have wanted to move the dozens of boats and shacks along a mile-long stretch of the river in front of the Royal Palace. The festival provided a perfect excuse. At the start of the week, all the people living and working along the riverside were told they had to move their boats and abandon their shacks and buildings by the weekend. They held out, but yesterday scores of police arrived, backed up by armed police and bulldozers, to clear the area. They towed away the remaining boats and demolished shacks and small buildings, while people scrambled to gather up their few belongings. The only buildings to escape were three petrol stations, which would have been too hazardous to destroy, and a restaurant in a solidly built house, which the owner's neighbours said he had bribed the police to leave. By evening, the only remain evidence of the thriving businesses on the river bank were a handful of signboards and a few unprotected electricity cables. The city government says it wants to turn the mile-long stretch of river into a city garden, to complement the large square outside the Royal Palace. Several months ago, environmental consultants were asked to draw up a plan to clear the river area of dwellings and small businesses as part of a fight against pollution. Most prominent among the businesses which have been ordered by the city to clear the area is the Phnom Penh Floating Hotel, a luxury cruise ship which has been moored on the river bank for two years. The ship, which is owned by investors from Thailand, is one of the most expensive hotels in Phnom Penh. Its owners were given just three days' notice to pull up their anchor and leave their river-front site before the weekend festivities. However, they discovered that they could no longer start the ship's engine, so talks with the city authorities are continuing. In previous years, a few floating restaurants have been forced to leave their sites for the three days of the water festival, but have then been allowed to return. This year, the city council is determined that they will not be allowed to come back. Many owners of floating restaurants and brothels along the river are determined to return to their prime locations and have pledged that they would petition the council on Monday. According to one policeman sent to clear the site: 'If they pay enough, they will be allowed to come back. This is Cambodia.'</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (9) - Business is the very fabric of Dubai / Ethos / A relative absence of red tape reflects the commitment to attract more investment and enterprises. According to Dubai's glossy literature, there is no better place to do business There is some good reason why expatriates should refer to this Gulf port as 'Do Buy' rather than in impeccably correct phonetic Arabic. If people here are not selling things, they are as often as not selling the marketing to sell them better. Business is the very fabric of Dubai and the fabric of business itself is sold as hard as the cotton garments which are made up locally, sewn with designer labels and shipped off towards America, Europe, Iran, Pakistan or anywhere else that can pay. Believe the glossy literature, much of it pumped out with abandon by the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, and there is no better place in the world to do business. No taxes, no recruitment problems, no currency restrictions, efficient services, abundant energy, hassle-free bureaucracy and a market of over 1bn people (if you include places within range of Dubai's airport, that is). Much of it is true. But - and it is a sizeable 'but' for anyone unrehearsed in Gulf ways - there are some things the brochures do not mention about business in Dubai which a visitor will notice well before he or she spots the market of 1bn people. Getting into Dubai is the first small hurdle. Only Gulf nationals and Britons, whose privileged status is a relic of empire, require no visa. Everyone else must apply for entry visas before arrival. Obtaining one from a United Arab Emirates embassy is usually just a formality, but the process can be expedited considerably by seeking a visa through either the Commerce and Tourism Board (whose overseas offices are listed in this survey's Business Guide) or a hotel in the emirate (also listed). Along with visas, Dubai also requires visitors to have sponsors, which again can usually be best arranged through either hotels, the board or, if you have one, a good local business contact. That leads to a second proviso. Nothing in Dubai can be accomplished with reasonable speed without having a good local Arab or Arab-speaking contact. Although 'who you know' matters less in Dubai than anywhere else in the Gulf  -and arguably than anywhere in the Middle East - it still counts for a lot. There is no shortage - rather a glut - of advice available about how to enter Dubai's business world, mainly from the Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board. Moreover, the emirate's way of business is so wholly western in approach that there is very little about the place which appears foreign. Dubai's government ensures that this so by paying some people good salaries. That, in turn, raises the question of Dubai's government, and the issue of bureaucracy. Some established local businessmen will tell you with a grin that Dubai has no government. Some newer enterprises, still unravelling residual pieces of red tape, are less positive on this score. It is certainly true that Dubai's government - essentially the Makhtoum brothers together with their respective offices and ministries - appears to do everything in its power to cut to a minimum the sort of form-filling and foot-tapping bureaucracy for which other Gulf states have become legendary. Earlier this year, it established a ministry of the economy, headed by the youthful Mr Mohammed al-Abbar who spent six years running a government property company in Singapore. Its specific purpose is to eliminate bureaucratic delay, collect and collate useful economic data and, generally, to be a 'service-oriented company'. More than this, Dubai also set up in the early 1980s the Jebel Ali free trade zone, a sprawling 67-berth port 30 minutes' drive from Dubai in which 410 companies have already established themselves as 100 per cent owners. They pay no corporate taxes for 15 years - a holiday renewable for a further period of the same length - can repatriate all profits and benefit from cheap power, ample land and cheap labour, and a smart resort hotel. The whole concept was revolutionary in the Gulf. As a result of it, Dubai won few friends in the region but many friends from elsewhere. But even doing business in 'hassle-free' Jebel Ali can suffer from delays. For instance, one new arrival disputes marketing claims that gaining a licence to operate in Jebel Ali takes only 30 days. He says that it took him three times as long and he could accomplish nothing until he had obtained it - no telephone, and so no headed notepaper or business cards; not even a driving licence. 'It's a shock when you come from a European system', he observes. Nevertheless, Jebel Ali is probably as bureaucracy-free as anywhere in the Middle East. Indeed, the local rule of thumb in Dubai is that red tape proliferates the further one ventures from this free port into the surrounding Gulf. Anyone setting up a company in Dubai proper must do so with a local partner owning a majority share, as is the practice elsewhere in the Gulf. The forms of ownership, agency agreements and company structures vary widely and are negotiable up to a point and apparently binding rules can be side-stepped but with some assistance. A new commercial law has been expected for some time. Its aim is to codify all forms of joint venture or corporate arrangements in the United Arab Emirates. But its details have still to be formulated adding an element of uncertainty to launching a new enterprise. The effects of this uncertainty should not be overstated. Dubai is too eager to invite new investment and fresh business to allow much to discourage them. And whatever vestigial delaying Gulf practices remain, the emirate's business culture is essentially western in feel. For most practical purposes, for example, not a single Berlitz Arabic phrase is required - nearly all transactions can be conducted in English. While Jebel Ali is a corporate nirvana in the Gulf, Dubai is a manageable hinterland, albeit one muddied by 'a quagmire of clerks', in the words of one local. The UAE federal government, the next grudgingly conceded layer of authority and one referred to usually as Abu Dhabi, is viewed by many natives of Dubai as a rather strange place up the coast without a golf course.</p>

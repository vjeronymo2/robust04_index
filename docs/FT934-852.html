			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas settles C-17 dispute McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, said yesterday that it had accepted a Pentagon plan to resolve a long-running dispute over development of its controversial C-17 military transport aircraft. The company will take a pre-tax charge of some Dollars 450m in the fourth quarter to cover the settlement. There will be no significant adverse cash impact. The Pentagon revealed the outlines of the settlement on December 15, when it placed McDonnell Douglas on 'probation'. The Pentagon said that unless the company improved the performance of the C-17 programme, which has been plagued by problems, it would buy only 40 of the aircraft, instead of the 120 planned. As part of the settlement, McDonnell Douglas has dropped about Dollars 1.2bn in claims against the government. The company announced last October that the settlement would probably mean a Dollars 450m charge.</p>

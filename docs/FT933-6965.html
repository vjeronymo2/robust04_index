			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Kohl party draws up EC reform PLANS for radical reforms of the main institutions of the European Community, including new rules for majority voting in the council of ministers, have been drawn up in Germany in a fresh attempt to create a streamlined, less bureaucratic European union. The parliamentary leaders of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats yesterday approved a blueprint for German foreign policy, clearly identifying their national interest with European integration - leaving an open door for the democratic states of eastern Europe eventually to join the EC. They also spelt out the need for institutional reform of the EC, to ensure that an enlarged Community, with 16 or more members, remains capable of decisions. Their ideas may form the basis of a German government initiative to maintain the momentum towards European integration, just when doubts about economic and monetary union, and the Maastricht process, are spreading. Germany wants the new institutional reforms to be discussed at October's extraordinary EC summit to celebrate ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The proposals drafted by Mr Karl Lamers, CDU parliamwentary foreign affairs spokesman, include: a 'double-majority' voting system in the council of ministers requiring both a majority of member states and a majority of their populations to take decisions; a maximum 10-member European Commission, to be selected by the Commission president from nominees by the member states, and approved by both European parliament and the council of ministers; there are currently 16 commissioners, two for each of the four larger member states and one each for the remaining eight; a new rotation of member states holding the council of ministers presidency, scrapping the alphabetical system, and leaving it up to member states to nominate large and small states alternately; a ceiling on membership of the European parliament, regardless of the number of member states, to prevent it becoming too unwieldy; possible creation of a 'senate' representing national parliaments directly, in a sort of upper house of the elected parliament. The plans meet the need for new thinking on institutional reforms to maintain the decision-making balance of the EC, between the large member states and the smaller ones. Enlargement to 16 member states will upset that balance.</p>

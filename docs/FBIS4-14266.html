			<p>BFN     [Text] The ambassadors of 11 countries currently on a  four-day visit to Kashmir were yesterday briefed in Srinagar by  senior Army officers about the Pak-sponsored militant activities  in the valley. The ambassadors were told that the militants  indulged in killing of innocent people, burned government and  private property, and also misbehaved with women. Ambassadors  of Peru, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iran,  Argentina, Brazil, Jordan, and Oman were shown the arms and  ammunition seized by the security forces during their  anti-militant operations.    The ambassadors also met some foreign mercenaries who  admitted that they were misled by false propaganda that a lot of  atrocities were being committed on the Muslim population of the  valley of Kashmir but when they came there they found that  nothing of this sort was happening there. The militants said  they were disappointed now. The ambassadors saw some wounded  militants being treated by Army doctors.    The visiting ambassadors today called on the Jammu and  Kashmir governor, Mr. K.V. Krishna Rao, at the Raj Bhavan.</p>

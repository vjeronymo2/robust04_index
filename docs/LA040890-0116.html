			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE TURMOIL, SOME JUNK BOND ISSUERS OK  </P> <P> While junk bonds have recently accompanied a succession of companies down the  road to ruin, there continues to be evidence that the low-rated, high-yield  paper can help build healthy businesses.  </P> <P> Among the junk-funded companies that are looking good to bond analysts:  </P> <P> * Vons Cos., the El Monte-based supermarket chain, is carrying about $839  million in debt but last month reported its first net profit in more than a  year and appears to be getting stronger. The company, No. 1 ranked in Southern  California with a 25% market share, took on heavy debts when it bought 162  former Safeway Stores 20 months ago.  </P> <P> * McCaw Cellular, one of two big players in the mobile phone business, has $1.7  billion in long-term debt and junk bonds that yield a sobering 17%. But the  company's asset values are high, particularly after its recent acquisition of  Lin Broadcasting.  </P> <P> * MCI Communications, the long-distance phone company, used a $3-billion Drexel  Burnham Lambert junk issue to raise money to build the world's first  fiber-optic telephone network. It has a 12% share in the long-distance market,  and earnings have been at record levels.  </P> <P> * Turner Broadcasting System, Ted Turner's cable-TV and entertainment company,  took on heavy debts during the 1980s to finance the purchase of the MGM movie  library. But with the Cable News Network and the TBS cable network doing well,  the company has restructured debts so that the average TBS bond interest rate  is 10.9%, down from 14.5%.  </P> <P> * Levi Strauss, the jeans maker, was led back to financial health with help  from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. junk bonds. The San Francisco company's bonds are  today trading above par, in sharp contrast to most of their junk brethren.  </P> <P> * Kroger, the nation's No. 2 supermarket chain, restructured in 1988 to elude  an attempted takeover by the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. buyout firm. But  though it took on debt of $5.5 billion, including $1.9 billion in junk,  analysts consider it a more efficient company today.  </P></p>

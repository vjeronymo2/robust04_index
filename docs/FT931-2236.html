			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: Brave cultural mixture - Deanna Petherbridge admires the controversial 'In Fusion' exhibition ARRANGED on a crude metal factory stand are grimey crates stencilled 'Product of Chochreh Feyzdjou'; alongside is a gigantic rack supporting rolls of stiff fabrics, and scrolls of unintelligible broadsheets are arranged on a wall. The installation suggests a workshop, perhaps a print workshop. But on looking more carefully, you become aware that the blackened objects so carefully arranged in boxes are in fact hair, feathers and other substances blackened with grease, not the tools of a mysterious trade. Chochreh Feyzdjou, like the other artists in the brave and important exhibition In Fusion at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, is a New European with a tale to tell that embraces both native and adoptive cultures. Born in Teheran but educated in Paris, Feyzdjou evokes the history of the in-between; not a personal history, but a mock-industrial history of impossible processes and never-to-be invented artefacts that could be placed in Iran, in Europe, in this century or that. The objects so carefully arranged in the boxes to simulate usage are the fetishised products of displacement. She applies the language of systems to things of the imagination. Systems of order are also the subject matter of Carlo Capelan. Stiff pieces of European furniture are formally placed within a mud-walled room. Display cases, a machine-made Turkey carpet, couches and desks are the pompous intruders in this 'ethnic' space, where piles of textbooks around the periphery of the room are held down with stones. On the mud walls are quotations from post-colonial theory and ethnology: James Clifford, Jonathan Friedman, Luis Cannitzer, Gerardo Masquera. Within the old-fashioned cabinets are museological displays: nail parings, wax spills, twigs, wax-stoppered bottles containing the ashes of burned books. Some of the texts on the wall have been blanked out. At the entrance is a pathetic little mosaic image: 'Mi casa es tu casa' - your house is mine. The messages in this installation are obvious, yet by some sleight of hand the piece is neither gruesomely rhetorical nor aridly illustrative. The low light renders the room and its intrusive furniture as a sort of anti-shrine, which is evocative and moving. Capelan, born in Montevideo and a political refugee from Chile, has found asylum in Sweden. His work, like Feyzdjou's, is influenced by Joseph Beuys, the ultimate shaman, whose sojourn as a refugee dead) in his native country, Germany, was theatrical and manipulative. Here, Beuys' sham language takes on the ring of truth. Installation and video are the global media of the 1980s and 1990s, and the artists in the In Fusion exhibition are right up front. They prove the often repeated statement of social analysts such as Stuart Hall that the periphery is now in the centre, and the cultural implosion has been a creative one. There is often something desperately bogus about Old Europeans trying to come to terms with the problems of the periphery, but these artists - and they do not all deal with political or social issues - are streetwise and thoughtful. They have been there, they care, and they are using the language to hand to express themselves. Benni Efrat's videotape 'Ararat Express Summer 2043' is almost unbearable to watch, as it dins its way in repeated images on a bank of video screens. The tape narrates a journey through France; video screens have been strapped to side-saddles of a troupe of pack-ponies, and the actual journey with its solemn procession of ponies, grooms and bewildered spectators is intercut with the images on the pack-screens: mass exodus and its related sufferings. As the ponies are unharnessed for the night and the videos are laid out in rows in fields, the other narratives are overlaid; feeding the starving in Zambia, Botswana, El Salvador, the perilous journeys of Vietnamese boat people and their arrival into despair. We have domesticated such scenes of suffering in our scrolls through television, but here the repeated image of a Vietnamese mother with the emaciated corpse of her child - dead on arrival  -is harrowing. It is a piece about global responsibility using the technology of global communication. The exhibition is jointly organised with the South Bank Centre, and therefore is part of a generous sponsorship programme by BT. It is a depressing comment on Birmingham's Tories, that Councillor Alan Blumenthal and Bernard Zissman, leader of the Conservative group, should have joined in the row in the Birmingham press about BT sponsoring such 'rubbish'. Other works on the exhibition are jollier, particularly As M'Bengue's larged impasto paintings, bursting with musical rhythms and witty fusion of images from his native Senegal with mock scientific diagrams, texts from 'official journals' and occasional bits of classical sculpture. Ying Liang, born in Peking and now living in Hamburg takes the traditional language of Chinese brush painting on paper, and relieves it of its preciousness by inserting rude graffiti into a flower painting or drawing deliberately crude brush notations of women's suits on crushed Jap paper. Ohannes Tapyuli, an Armenian artist living in Germany, points a light finger at consumerism in his enormous framed shirts in a wall installation entitled 'We are Rich.' Gavin Jantjes, a South African artist who lived in Germany before coming to Britain, has written the major catalogue essay. He notes that by the year 2000 an estimated 50m people with extra-European cultural roots will be living in Europe, and he questions the 'Kulturwurst' definition of culture - ethnic Europeaness stuffed into a geographical package. The future identity of Europe 'should be accompanied by a willingness to investigate complex matters of diversity and difference.' Maastricht signals more than an assembly of traditional nation-states; it is also the home of the New European.

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (12): Preparing for the big asset sell-off - Robert Graham discusses the biggest and most concentrated disposal of state assets in banking and industry planned by any country in continental Europe during the next two years / Privatisation in Italy PRIVATISATION in Italy over the next three years is set to change not only the nature of corporate ownership but considerably expand activity on the Milan stock exchange. The Amato government's plans for privatisation envisage total sales close to L40,000bn by 1995, if the timetable is followed. In any event Italy will witness the biggest and most concentrated sell-off of state assets in banking and industry of any country in continental Europe. This in turn will have a significant impact on the Italian corporate presence in the FT500. Until now this has been limited largely because of the dominant state presence through entities such as IRI, the holding group, and ENI, the state oil concern, which were not joint stock companies. Italy's public enterprises are larger than any other EC member. At the same time, the private sector has been dominated by a handful of companies such as Fiat, Ferruzzi-Montedison, Olivetti and Pirelli, with little between them and the myriad of small companies - the traditional motor of economic growth. Almost two thirds of all Italian companies employ fewer than 100 people compared to only 20 per cent in France, Germany and the UK. Through privatisation and changes in the fiscal treatment of mergers, the government believes it can create a core of some 15 industrial groups of international stature. On another level, the privatisation process will determine the extent to which Italian companies are willing to embrace foreign ownership. Apart from Japan, Italy is the one large industrialised nation with the least penetration by foreign capital. This reflects both the lack of incentives for foreign capital and the underdeveloped state of the stock market. The Milan bourse has proved so far able to raise money on average only the equivalent of 5 per cent of total market capitalisation in one year or under L10,000bn. The change in attitudes to state ownership began with the Amato government and was set in motion last August when IRI, ENI along with INA, the insurance institute, and ENEL, the electricity authority, were transformed into publicly quoted companies. The treasury became the sole shareholder. The disastrous state of public finances with a budget deficit equivalent to nearly 11 per cent of GDP, and EC restrictions on state transfers, have in effect forced privatisation on Italy. The treasury as shareholder cannot pump in any more funds into state companies. Yet IRI and ENI alone will require at least L12,000bn over the next two years for investment, recapitalisation of subsidiaries and debt restructuring; thus they will have to raise funds through divestment and flotation. Undercapitalisation has been a large problem, partially concealed by state ownership and the ability to rely on special transfers from the treasury. The ratio of debts to turnover in Italian companies in key sectors has generally been much higher than their European counterparts. For instance, in the case of Ilva, the state steel group, financial charges represent 11.3 per cent of turnover, compared to 1 per cent with British Steel and for Finmeccanica, IRI's main industrial subsidiary, they represent 12.6 per cent against 1.6 per cent in Siemens. Analysts are split on the value of these state-held assets. While many companies in the state portfolio have been conservatively valued at historic cost, the precise nature of debts and potential losses has been poorly assessed and often underestimated. The latter point was made in a special treasury analysis accompanying the government's privatisation proposals in November. IRI is starting with the sale of its banking interests. It holds 67 per cent of ordinary stock of Credito Italiano capitalised at L800bn, 37 per cent of Banca Commerciale Italiana capitalised at lire L1,050bn and nearly 35 per cent of Banca di Roma capitalised at L1,600bn. The first to be sold off will be Credito, whose sale was announced in September. IRI is also expected to press ahead with the flotation of its principal industrial portfolio held through Finmeccanica, capitalised at L675bn. Finmeccanica has been chosen to become IRI's high-tech group with mixed public and private capital. Although the state will continue to exercise control of high technology through Finmeccanica and some transport and defence-related companies, other industrial holdings could be fully divested. This could be the case with parts of Ilva. A piece of Alitalia, the national carrier, is also scheduled to come on the market. The most appetising industrial asset in IRI's portfolio is probably the telephone business grouped round STET. The latter is already partially quoted; but with a re-organisation of the entire sector and the proposed creation of a telecom authority on similar lines to BT both the size and nature of STET will be transformed. The re-organisation of telecoms is unlikely to be completed by 1993 but the opening up of the STET with an expanded capital and international partners (BT is interested in acquiring a stake) could make this company one of the largest within the FT500. STET is capitalised at L4,600bn, and is by far the largest of any company within IRI (which holds 38 per cent of ordinary stock) and is 138th in the FT500. Another IRI divestment in an advanced state of preparation is that of SME, its foodstuffs, frozen foods and retail business. Capitalised at L434bn, IRI wants to sell off its entire 62 per cent holding. The ENI empire is also set for a radical shake-up. ENI was built up in the post-war period to become a principal rival to the 'Seven Sisters' oil companies by the late entrepreneur Enrico Mattei. The state is set to remain a controlling shareholder but with a capitalisation of L7,999bn, ENI envisages floating some of its stock and reducing stakes in its subsidiaries. The principal quoted companies in the group are likely to be Agip, the exploration arm, and SNAM its gas production/supply company. The first ENI subsidiary to be sold off will be Savio, one of the four world leaders in textile machinery, and this will be followed by Nuovo Pignone, its gas turbine manufacturer. ENI's main problem in privatisation is going to be how to tackle its loss-making chemicals and fertiliser divisions, part of which will have to be maintained because of their location in depressed areas with limited employment. Another company expected to enter the next FT500 will be INA, the insurance institute. INA is capitalised at L3,635bn and the treasury is due to sell off a substantial stake. According to analysts, INA is one of the few companies which may even be over-capitalised. Further down the line in 1994-95, ENEL, the electricity authority, is due to be privatised. ENEL is capitalised at L12,126bn and 1992 profits were expected to be L673bn. Its flotation will be conditioned in large measure by the speed with which the government restructures electricity tariffs.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bruntcliffe buys Tarmac quarries BRUNTCLIFFE Aggregates is to buy Northern Scottish Quarries from Tarmac for Pounds 12.5m in its first deal since a trio of industry executives brought it to the market in the spring. The company will fund the purchase with bank debt and a placing of 28.6m shares at 35p apiece, raising Pounds 9.1m net of expenses. About 69 per cent of the shares will be subject to a shareholder claw-back on the basis of 23 shares for every 20 held. Bruntcliffe's shares were suspended yesterday at 36p pending completion of the deal. Mr Mike Wallis, chief executive, who used to work for both Tarmac and Evered, said that Northern Scottish was the sort of company he was looking for when Bruntcliffe was launched. Tarmac said it was selling the business as part of its divestment programme launched in early-1992 to refocus on its core construction and building material activities. It has now sold 15 companies and raised Pounds 223m towards its target of Pounds 300m by the end of the year. Northern Scottish Quarries, which employs 180 people, had a 1992 turnover of Pounds 11.9m and operating profits of Pounds 1.5m. Subject to shareholders' approval of the deal, Bruntcliffe will pay Pounds 3m to Tarmac on completion on September 20, and Pounds 7m by the end of the year. The final Pounds 2.5m will be paid by December 31 1996. Bruntcliffe owns sand and gravel quarries in Warwickshire and Pennsylvania, where it also has a coal reprocessing operation. Mr Wallis said turnover of the present company was between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Tense week for Pounds THIS WILL be a tense week for sterling if last week's wobbles were an indication of what is in store. Rumours of a sterling crisis began to circulate wildly towards the end of last week on newspaper stories that Middle East countries were dumping sterling. Earlier in the week a string of opinion polls giving Labour a decisive lead had failed to upset the UK currency. Dealers said much of sterling's early strength could be attributed to the commitment of the three main parties to maintaining the pound's current value within the ERM and the widening of inter-bank interest rate differentials between the pound and the D-Mark. As for nervous Middle East investors alleged to be selling sterling, many analysts poured scorn on the story. Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays, said Middle East dealers were unlikely to act alone, but would wait for the reaction of domestic investors after the election before taking a decision on sterling. The rumours, along with worries over the next set of opinion polls and a strengthening of the D-Mark within the ERM, meant that sterling ended the week considerably lower. It closed on Friday night at DM2.8350. However, this weakened rate still leaves it some 6 pfennigs above its effective floor within the ERM. Indeed, many analysts are beginning to question the widely accepted belief that sterling will fall sharply if the Labour party wins power either outright or in a hung parliament. One US bank analyst said he thought the market had a great deal of respect for the strength of the EMS system, with huge scope for sterling profits on the upside and little but danger on the downside.</p>

Representatives of the 17 commissioners approved proposals  for establishing works councils in large multinational companies  operating in more than one EU country. The aim is to ensure  employees are consulted about key corporate decisions which  could affect their livelihoods.    The plan, which is now certain to be agreed by the  Commission  next week, will be this year's main item of social legislation  in Brussels and it is likely to become the centre of a battle  between the EU employers and trade unions.    Its significance for Britain and the Euro-sceptics on the  Conservative backbenches is that the Commission's lawyers  believe UK-based multinationals cannot escape obligations to  comply with a directive agreed by the other 11 member states  without the participation of UK ministers.    A big company with a headquarters in London and substantial  subsidiaries in other member states would have to set up  consultation machinery for its employees in mainland Europe.  Although the management of the UK operation could legally refuse  to take part, Commission officials think it would be divisive  and impractical if British workers were denied access being  offered to employees elsewhere in the EU.    Multinationals based in one of the other 11 member states  would be "obliged to invite the management and employees of  their UK branches or subsidiaries to participate."    The proposal is the first test of how the Maastricht social  protocol will work. It is being brought forward initially as an  attempt to achieve a consensus between the EU employers and  unions which might avoid the need for binding legislation.    In practice, however, such agreement is unlikely and the  plan  is likely to be turned into a binding directive. The German  government, which takes over the EU presidency in July, wants it  passed into law by October when its general election will be  held.    Chancellor Kohl thinks this item of progressive EU  legislation would be popular with the voters and potential  future coalition partners.    Emilio Cabaglio, secretary general of the European TUC  [Trade  Union Council], said yesterday that the Commission plan was a  "complete U-turn" on the previous works council proposal which  was approved by 11 member states last year under the  pre-Maastricht procedure, but fell because of British  opposition. It was "suprising and totally unacceptable," he  said.    Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the  European  employers' confederation, said his members would refuse to take  part in negotiations which the Commission was stacking  dangerously in favour of the unions.    Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, appeared to  be relaxed last night about being under fire from both  directions. He believes the new version of the proposal will  help employees of multinationals to negotiate consultation  machinery with their managements which best suits the  circumstances of their companies.    The union side would be strengthened because the employers  would know the Commission's plan could be imposed if no  agreement was reached. But the unions would still have an  incentive to compromise because these default powers would only  apply from 1999.    "The paradox of this directive is that it will succeed best  if it is never applied, but if it did not exist nothing would  happen," Mr Flynn said.    The proposals apply to firms with more than 1,000 employees  anywhere in the EU. British workers will count towards the  total. But the machinery for establishing consultation rights  cannot be triggered without the support of 500 workers from the  other 11 member states.    Mr Flynn has dropped the description "European works  councils" from his text in an effort to placate Unice.    Under the Maastricht social protocol, British ministers can  attend debates among the other 11 member states, but have no  vote.</p>

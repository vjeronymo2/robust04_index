			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Stanbic to acquire African operations of ANZ Grindlays STANDARD Bank Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's largest bank by market capitalisation, will pay R166m (Dollars 37.8m) to acquire the African operations of ANZ Grindlays Bank. The deal, which follows protracted negotiations, represents an important step towards re-establishing Stanbic as an important regional player. Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said yesterday that it was part of the group's policy of controlled international expansion which has recently seen the bank open a fully-fledged London office, purchase offshore interests in Jersey and the Isle of Man, and set up in Botswana. Stanbic will assume equity control of ANZ Grindlays banks in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya, Botswana, Uganda and Zaire, as well as significant minority stakes in Nigeria and Ghana. It is acquiring a network of 25 branches and a staff of about 1,400, all of whom will be kept on. Stanbic will compete directly in all of these countries, except Zaire, with Standard Chartered, its former parent company until it disinvested from South Africa in the late 1980s. Mr Theron said that, with the acquisition, the wheel had come full circle - a reference to the fact that in 1910 Standard Bank was the largest bank in sub-equatorial Africa before political developments forced it to shrink, by 1987, to a purely domestic operation. The deal has been settled by the issue of 2.47m Stanbic shares to ANZ Grindlays which has renounced them in favour of an unnamed local institution. There will not be any impact on the financial rand, the volatile investment currency for foreigners, as the necessary currency transactions have already been concluded. Mr Theron said the purchase price included a goodwill figure of about R3m. The price represents only about 5 per cent of Stanbic's capital and the deal will have a modest impact on profits in the short term.</p>

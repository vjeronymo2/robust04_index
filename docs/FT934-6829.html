			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Bock opens the books Lonrho lifted the veil a little further yesterday, though one suspects its restated accounts were motivated more by the obligation to comply with new accounting standards than crusading zeal on the part of its audit committee. At one level the changes are welcome. It is surely right to take into account the high inflation and depreciating currencies of developing countries where Lonrho trades. The pre-tax hit of Pounds 18m, though, also raises the question of how far profits have been flattered in previous years. Somewhat more unsettling is the restatement of profits under FRS3. Net extraordinary items of Pounds 78m from disposals under the old system shrink to only Pounds 41m when they are moved above the line as exceptionals under FRS3. The difference is accounted for by the change whereby profits on disposals are no longer taken against cost but against the value at which the assets are carried in the books. There is an indication here of the extent to which assets have been revalued in the past to shore up the company's balance sheet. This does not matter insofar as disposals have always been at a profit to book, though Lonrho conveniently wrote down the intangible value of its Scottish newspaper titles around the time they were sold. The precise gearing figure also matters less than ability to raise cash to service debt. The restated net loss from continuing operations of Pounds 18m after minorities is hardly encouraging in this respect. Mr Dieter Bock will have to look hard for the resources to take his revolution forward.</p>

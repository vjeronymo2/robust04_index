			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Changeover at the Bundesbank: Secretive society of Germany's listening bank - Mr Tietmeyer will require diplomacy rather than an autocratic hand to lead the Bundesbank council ANALYSING the mood and inclinations of the 16-member Bundesbank council that meets bi-weekly to discuss interest rate policies has become increasingly complex. Among the line-up are four professors, three former finance ministers in state governments, and two one-time journalists. Most members have had previous careers as public functionaries (Beamte) - but only three have risen from Bundesbank ranks. Made up of the seven-man directorate, headed by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, and nine chairmen of the regional central banks from the German Lander (states), the council has an average age of 59. Only one woman has ever sat on the Bundesbank council, and she left five years ago. Each member has one vote and the independent-minded regional bank chairmen have shown a growing tendency to counter the views of the directorate. The council's deliberations are normally kept secret. Formal minutes are released after 30 years. However, for the past decade the council has only kept approximate minutes. The present council is relatively inexperienced - half have sat on the board for two years or less - which could aid Mr Tietmeyer's efforts to wield control. On the other hand, the new president, said by critics to be a poor communicator, will need to launch a diplomatic offensive to win council members over to his side. One view circulating in Frankfurt is that the sometimes autocratic Mr Tietmeyer will try to force his views on the board, which could turn some of the more rebellious members against him. On the other hand, Bundesbank officials warn against over-estimating the significance of the change of presidency. One member of the council says: 'To speak of controlling the board is not correct. No president can force discipline on us. . . Everyone has his own ego.' Of the 16-man board, one seat - in Hamburg - is vacant, but is being filled for the time being by the regional bank's vice-president, Mr Hans-Jurgen Siegmund. Only one board member, the new Bundesbank vice-president, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, 63, has had mainstream private-sector business experience. He once headed his family oil trading business. However, two other directorate members, Mr Gunter Storch and Mr Edgar Meister, are former public-sector commercial bankers. Mr Horst Schulmann, 60, the head of the Hesse regional central bank, had a spell working for the steel group Hoesch. While directorate members are chosen by the Bonn government, regional central bank chiefs are selected by state governments. Nominations are made on the basis of politics as much as competence. The somewhat colourless Mr Gaddum is a former Christian Democrat (CDU) politician and long-standing friend of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Gaddum's appointment as No 2 to Mr Tietmeyer - also from the CDU - countered the long-standing tradition of drawing president and vice-president from the ranks of both the government and opposition. Mr Schulmann, a former personal adviser to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry until the change of government in 1982, is believed to have been offered the job, but turned it down. This may have been partly for personal reasons, since Mr Tietmeyer took his state secretary job in Bonn when Mr Kohl became chancellor in 1982. Other strong figures on the board are Professor Reimut Jochimsen, 60, the Social Democrat regional bank president from North Rhine-Westphalia, and Mr Lothar Muller, 66, the hawkish head of Bavaria's regional bank, who after 14 years on the council is now its longest-serving member. Mr Jochimsen's independent views have occasionally alienated Mr Schlesinger, the former president. Mr Jochimsen was mooted as a candidate to become deputy under Mr Tietmeyer, but Chancellor Kohl is believed to have turned down the idea because of Mr Jochimsen's sceptical statements about the Maastricht treaty.</p>

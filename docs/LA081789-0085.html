			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW SENTENCING RULES MEAN LIFE FOR 1ST OFFENDER  </P> <P> Ernest (Polo) Staley was small potatoes as drug dealers go. The feds caught him  with a measly 686 grams of crack. A street value of maybe $68,000. No prior  convictions.  </P> <P> But Polo Staley, small-time hood, this week got something that even the big  timers rarely get: life in prison.  </P> <P> In one of the starkest examples of tough new federal sentencing guidelines,  U.S. District Judge William Stafford in Tallahassee, Fla., sent Staley to  prison for good. No chance of parole.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutor Mike Moore was jubilant. "We caught him selling crack just  once, but he'll never sell it again, and that's the kind of justice I want."  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Court Rules  </P> <P> It is justice that Congress legislated into existence with the Sentencing  Reform Act of 1987. Many judges were hesitant to use the new standards until  the Supreme Court upheld them last January. Now the federal courts are  beginning to experience the full effects.  </P> <P> The new guidelines were meant to end disparities prevalent in the federal  system, where two criminals might have received vastly different sentences for  very similar offenses.  </P> <P> A judge now has a strict range of sentencing for a crime, with specified  aggravating and mitigating factors that may nudge the prison term up or down.  </P> <P> On Monday, Judge Stafford studied a pre-sentence report from the U. S.  Probation Office that matter-of-factly totaled up enough points to seal away  the 30-year-old Staley for all his days.  </P> <P> Those 686 grams of crack translated into 36 points on a sentencing table, which  converts into a term of 188 to 235 months for a first-time offender.  </P> <P> But there were these aggravating factors:  </P> <P>  -- Staley was the "kingpin" of a drug organization, a small one, yes, with  maybe only five workers, but an organization nonetheless.  </P> <P>  -- A firearm was involved. Staley bought a handgun and gave it to one of his  street-level dealers for protection.  </P> <P>  -- The defendant tried to obstruct justice, offering to pay off a key witness  to skip town.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Points Added Up  </P> <P> Under the new law, these facts rang up yet more points on the sentencing score  card. Forty-three is enough for life. Staley had 44.  </P> <P> Public defender Robin Rosen knew the sum only too well. She pleaded with the  judge. "I've represented people who took lives and received less of a  sentence," she said. "It's a tragedy. I'm not saying this as an attorney; I'm  saying this as a human being. Everybody has worth and dignity. Everybody should  have a chance at rehabilitation."  </P> <P> Staley's father, a minister, urged the judge to show mercy. So did Staley's  mother, a missionary. Finally, the defendant himself spoke up:  </P> <P> "I can remember J. F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King saying every man and woman  makes a difference. In order to make a difference, you have to be given a  chance."  </P> <P> Staley said that his months in prison awaiting trial already had beckoned him  toward redemption. "I know drugs are a terrible problem, destroying our  nation," he said.  </P> <P> Judge Stafford agreed up to a point. Indeed, crack was a scourge.  </P> <P> But he reminded Staley that he had been convicted of three drug counts:  possession, distribution and conspiracy -- that he had ferried cocaine from  city to city and cooked the powder himself into pellets of crack.  </P> <P> There were no extenuating circumstances to take this case outside the  guidelines, the judge concluded: "It seems to me your activity was the type you  could stop at any time."  </P> <P> Rosen, the defense lawyer, plans an appeal, finding fault with the  pre-sentencing report. "I'm still stunned by the tragedy of this," she said.  </P> <P> In fact, Staley's punishment is unusual, federal officials said --  extraordinarily rare for a first offender, especially in a case involving 686  grams, or less than two pounds, of drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tough Sentences Common  </P> <P> But there is no doubt that tougher federal sentences are becoming the rule.  "Guys are getting 15, 20, 25 years without parole, and a lot of times we're  just talking about two-three ounces of cocaine," said Assistant U.S. Atty. John  Gordon, chief of the Los Angeles gang drug task force.  </P> <P> "Prisons are going to be so jammed it's unbelievable. Everything is changing .  . . . We intend to put up flyers with the faces of guys, with their sentence  underneath, to show their friends what's happened to them."  </P> <P> Yet if the new federal law has been consistently tougher, it also has created a  greater disparity with the state system, where penalties are usually not as  severe. "That's the new crap shoot for the defendant: state or federal,"  Gordon, the prosecutor, said.  </P> <P> Many defense attorneys oppose the new guidelines, arguing that they restrict  the discretion of judges too much. "Sentencing by numbers has a real risk of  treating some people too harshly and others not harshly enough," said Neal  Sonnett, president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who were minor offenders in the general scheme of things are  now being sentenced to the kind of terms we used to preserve for major dealers.  I'm not sure that's a productive way to go.  </P> <P> "Think about it. A lot of people get caught up in other people's business. A  lot get caught up in drugs because of peer group pressure."  </P></p>

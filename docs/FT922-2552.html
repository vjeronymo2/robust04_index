			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Danger of building on false premises - Planning applications can be costly and time consuming. Charles Batchelor looks at how to avoid the pitfalls Robinsons Plastics, a southern company,* had been quite happily working from its premises for more than a decade. Part of the building which it used for office space was officially designated as being for residential use but this had never bothered the local planning authority. It was only when a spate of accidents, not involving the company's vehicles, made parking an issue with local residents that questions were raised about where the company parked its vans. In the course of the controversy, it became publicly known that the company did not have planning permission for its offices and the balloon went up. The company applied for a change from residential to office use. Planning officials agreed but the local council's planning committee turned the application down because, it said, there was not enough parking space. The company, which has turnover of about Pounds 2m, is now appealing against the decision. 'Unless it is overturned, we will have no choice but to relocate,' says the general manager. But the cost of moving and the possible disruption would have a serious impact on the business. Robinsons Plastics is not alone in finding Britain's planning system costly and confusing. 'Small businesses feel they don't have the opportunity to put their case across properly,' says David Harrop for the Forum of Private Business. 'The planners do not always understand the needs of small business.' Not only do smaller firms lack the resources of large companies, they rarely have the chance to build up any experience of dealing with planners. 'The small company only considers planning issues in times of crisis, when they need to expand or to move,' says Rory Joyce for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'Often, the first time they know they have done something which needs planning permission is when they are faced with an enforcement action, compelling them to put something right,' he says. Small businesses also feel themselves to be victims of a planning system which is tilted in favour of larger, wealthier companies. 'Large supermarkets can afford to come back with revised applications which the local authority cannot afford to oppose,' says Bill Franklin, chairman of the Sheffield chamber of trade. 'This is cheque book planning which is changing the character of our city centres.' If a large supermarket opens near a parade of smaller shops, there is little the small retailer can do apart business rates, says Stephen Alambritis, lobbyist for the Federation of Small Businesses. If a landlord owns a large swathe of the shopping area, the retailer may be able to argue for a clause in his lease excluding other shops in the same sector from setting up nearby. This clash of interests between small retailers and the large out-of-town superstores has been the focus of much small firms' discontent about the planning system in recent years. Signs that there is now a large oversupply of out-of-town retailing space is, however, now leading to a swing back in favour of the smaller outlets. Another source of conflict has been the position of people running a business from home. 'The rules are not particularly clear and different local authorities take differing views,' says Martin Anscombe, chairman of the legislation and local government committee of the National Chamber of Trade. Hairdressing, dress-making and music teaching normally present no problems, provided they do not lead to a large increase in traffic or the number of people calling, but other businesses may cause problems. So what can small businesses do to improve their influence in the planning process? Planning specialists suggest they: Join a local business organisation such as chamber of trade or commerce which can lobby for small traders' interests and spread the financial burden of opposing planning applications and fighting appeals, suggests Anscombe. Study the workings of the planning process. The Department of the Environment publishes a Step by Step Guide to Planning Permission for Small Businesses** and a revised version to take account of the latest developments is planned shortly. Call in a professional: a surveyor or an architect with experience of planning procedures. A surveyor will be less well equipped to design a building than an architect if that is what is required but both sets of professionals should be well versed in the intricacies of the planning process. Fees will normally be charged on a time-basis and will rise with the seniority of the person handling the case. There will also be a fee to pay to the local authority to make a planning submission, rising from Pounds 55 for domestic extensions to Pounds 5,520 for a large building development. If a planning application goes to appeal, then costs can rise sharply because legal advice will probably be needed. Despite the widespread belief among small businesses that the planning system is both archaic and hostile to their interests, it is undergoing considerable change. An important thrust of these efforts is to make the system more responsive to small firms. A revised set of guidelines for planning officers on how to deal with industry, commerce and small businesses is being prepared by the Department of Environment. In a draft of its revised Policy Guidance Note Number Four, the department urges special consideration for small businesses because uncertainty may 'threaten their growth or existence'. Instead of refusing an application outright, councils should impose conditions if appropriate. Speculative builders who frequently build premises used by small firms should not be discriminated against simply because they do not know who the future occupants of the premises will be, it urges. The deregulation unit of the Department of Trade and Industry has been studying the mass of regulations affecting business which are policed by local authorities. It will later this month announce details of a partnership programme aimed at streamlining procedures in the areas of planning, trading standards and health and safety. A Confederation of British Industry (CBI) task force has been set up to investigate how to improve the planning system. It will present its report to the CBI annual conference in November. Finally, local authorities across the country are drawing up development plans which will set down guidelines for the way their areas will evolve over the next decade. The aim of these plans is to give councils greater strategic control over developments. A potential weakness of these plans is that they will rapidly become out of date and they may be used by local authorities to refuse developments which are not specifically mentioned in the plan, says Marco Torquati, senior policy executive at the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. But provided that business takes a part in the shaping of the plan and knows what policies the local authority is pursuing, the plans should provide more certainty for businesses. Planning issues can be complex and, because they frequently involve the reconciliation of conflicting demands, highly charged. But with careful preparation and, where necessary, the use of professional advice, much of the mystery can be removed. *The name of the company has been changed. **From DOE, PO Box 135, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD9 4HU. 32 pages.

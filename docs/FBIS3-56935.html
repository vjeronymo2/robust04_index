Yeltsin  forwarded to Ukraine President L. Kravchuk a message of a  personal nature. It says that the assassination of Black Sea  Fleet press center chief Lazebnikov has been received negatively  by the Russian leadership. This has been reported by a  confidential source from President Kravchuk's entourage, who  stressed that the letter proposes in a rather harsh form to  impose order in Sevastopol by joint efforts, and to decide  finally the fate of the Black Sea Fleet in light of the  Massandra understandings. The letter was sent bypassing the  diplomatic channels of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.</p>

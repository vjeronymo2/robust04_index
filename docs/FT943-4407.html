			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UN chief in Kashmir offer Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, yesterday offered to play the role of 'honest broker' in an effort to resolve the 46-year Kashmir dispute, which continues to undermine relations between India and Pakistan, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The countries have fought three wars, and thousands of soldiers still face each other in the region. 'I have promised to be an honest broker to encourage a dialogue between the two protagonists of this problem,' said Mr Boutros Ghali at the end of a three-day visit to Pakistan, before leaving for New Delhi. However, he conceded that his role would be limited without the agreement of the two sides. In recent months western diplomats have been worried by increased tensions along the disputed border.</p>

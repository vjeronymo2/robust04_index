			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: WHEN YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE TURKEY  </P> <P> Just when you thought it was over. . . .  </P> <P> No, not leftovers, it's the Turkey Basket, a new downtown restaurant devoted to  the great wattled bird: all turkey, all the time.  </P> <P> "Gosh," said the man in the Brooks Brothers suit, "I hope you like turkey."  </P> <P> "Well," said his Anne Klein II girlfriend, scanning the menu -- turkey dogs,  turkey burgers, turkey tacos (both hard-shell and soft), teriyaki turkey bowl,  etc. -- "we could go to Carl's Jr." Maybe she didn't notice the turkey pasta  primavera or the turkey Parmesan or the Gobb salad (like a Cobb, but with . . .  turkey).  </P> <P> At the Turkey Basket, every day is Thanksgiving day and there's always enough  turkey to go around. Ever eat a salad with grilled turkey, goat cheese and  sun-dried tomatoes?  </P> <P> Cheery floral tablecloths, a fireplace (fake) topped with  forever-autumn-colored dried flowers, and one of the most spectacular views of  the downtown skyline might be the Turkey Basket's way of making you forget that  you've ordered your bird at a fast-food counter.  </P> <P> Set a number on your table, Sizzler-style, and in a few minutes a waiter  appears with, say, a carved turkey platter (it comes with stuffing, cranberry  compote, corn bread, baked yams, coleslaw), Cajun turkey rice, a turkey piccata  plate. . . . "And here's your cholesterol-free garlic bread," he says. The  waiters at the Turkey Basket care about your health.  </P> <P>  The Turkey Basket, third level, 444 S. Flower St., Los Angeles; (213)  892-9500. Entrees $1.99-$6.99.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

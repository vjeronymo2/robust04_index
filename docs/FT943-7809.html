			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Causes for complaint - Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at the pension ombudsman's report Pension transfers headed the list of complaints made to pensions ombudsman Michael Platt last year, according to his annual report* this week - the third since the office was set up in 1991. Platt said transfer values and the time taken to make transfers had been continuing problems over the years. Another recurring complaint related to the size of pensions. Some people found the amount was less than they had been led to believe, or that it was paid late. In some cases, they did not get a pension at all. In one case, two men accepted redundancy and early retirement on the basis of estimates provided by their employer. But their lump sum payments were 20 per cent less than expected because the basis on which they had been calculated was wrong. The men said they would have continued to work had they known the correct figures - and their complaint was upheld by Platt, who directed the employer to make good the difference. He said most disputes were the result of 'inadvertence, inefficiency, oversight or failure of communication' rather than intentional malpractice or fraud. And he pointed out that the number of complaints received last year - 2,179 - had to be seen in the context of the 20m people with rights to an occupational scheme. He was, however, concerned at the conflict of interest that could arise for some pension trustees, especially those administering small schemes. Indeed, the largest award he had made - of Pounds 190,000 - went to the victim of such a conflict. In this case, a man complained that his pension had not been paid since he retired. But the company of which he had been a director, and which was sole trustee, said he owed it money. Although the scheme rules allowed the company to recover debts from benefits, it needed a court order or arbitrator's award. Since it had not attempted to obtain either, the ombudsman decided that, by refusing to pay the man his benefits, 'it had placed its corporate interests first'. Platt said: 'Trustees are often appointed from the management of the sponsoring company, or the company itself may act as trustee . . . (the) possibility of conflict of interest is greater in small companies where management may have a proprietorial interest.' He also noted an increase in complaints about delays in winding up schemes and stressed that, when schemes were wound up with too few assets to pay benefits, 'I cannot conjure funds out of nowhere'. Although Platt welcomed the government's proposed compensation plan, he believed that limiting it to losses caused by fraud, theft or misappropriation of assets, meant that 'members of some schemes may still be at risk of losing some or all of their entitlement, with no means of effective redress'. In all, the ombudsman ordered Pounds 907,000 to be paid to wronged pension scheme members. This amount went to the 44 people whose cases he upheld wholly or in part. What is striking about the ombudsman scheme is the high percentage (90 per cent) of complaints investigated which are upheld. On the other hand, only a tiny proportion of cases are taken up - last year, only 49 out of 2,179 complaints received. Almost a third of all complaints was referred to the Occupational Advisory Pension Service, since they had not gone there first as procedure dictates. In another third, the ombudsman decided an investigation was inappropriate, mainly because there was no evidence of maladministration or injustice. A further quarter of complaints were outside the pension ombudsman's jurisdiction. Half of these belonged to a different complaints body and were forwarded to it. Some of the rest fell outside the time limit. This is three years from the date of the events which led to the complaint, or three years from the date the complainant first became aware of those events. *Annual Report of the Pensions Ombudsman 1993-94.

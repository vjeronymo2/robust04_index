			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / BT plans 50% reduction in personnel staff British Telecommunications is cutting nearly 50 per cent of its 4,000 personnel staff as part of its shake-up. A large part of the cut will come in the areas of training and general administration. Some less specialist training functions will be contracted out and line managers will take on more personnel functions. Under the reorganisation, known as Break-out, different parts of BT test their contribution to the company and assess whether it would be more effective for their function to be contracted out. Mr Peter Archer, head of personnel at BT, said: 'We thought for a long time that we should be able to run at about half of our current size. We then had extensive discussions with our internal customers about what they wanted from us and what they were prepared to pay for, and we have decided that a cut of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent is about appropriate.' He said that specialist training would remain in-house but 'generic' training, such as welding or computer skills, could be done more effectively by external trainers. The personnel function has played a leading role in the reduction in BT's employee numbers to 148,000 from 230,000 in 1990. The company has said it will seek to avoid compulsory redundancies for both managerial and non-managerial staff and so far it has succeeded in doing so. It said that exactly the same rules would apply to employees in the personnel area. The Society of Telecom Executives, the main union representing managers, is not happy about the way in which personnel numbers are being slimmed. Union officials fear that if more personnel functions are devolved to line managers national uniformity in terms and conditions will be eroded. BT has said that it is keen to retain national rules on issues such as pay and redundancy procedures but union officials said that there is a growing tension between the centre and the divisions. Mr Archer said: 'There will be some tension but I think it is generally a healthy one. The personnel function may have been too dominant in some areas.' Union officials said that the recent dispute between the company and the NCU communications union over the customer service improvement programme - designed to introduce more flexible shift patterns - showed the sort of tensions arising in the company. The NCU said it reached a compromise with the company's industrial relations specialists but found the agreement undermined by operational directors. BT Marine sold, Page 24</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US company wins order to process Chinese waste Dresser Industries, the Dallas engineering company, has won a pioneering agreement to treat wastewater in China, an area with huge market potential. DI will collaborate with Beijing Wastewater Treatment Engineering Corporation (BWTE) to build wastewater treatment plants and provide technical know-how. 'Dresser Industries has played a significant role in China for many years and is committed to doing business in China,' said Mr Robert Brimberry, president of Dresser's Trading Division, at a signing ceremony last week. China produces 100m tons of waste water a day. Only 5m tons, or 2 per cent, is treated, because of a lack of treatment facilities. Beijing now treats 20 per cent of the city's daily 2.4m tons of sewage. Officials plan to raise that figure to 80 per cent by the year 2000. DI won its first Chinese order in 1974. It now has an office in Beijing and one in South China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.</p>

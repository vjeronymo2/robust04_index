Jeszenszky  said the agreement was "witness to the reconciliation and  alliance of two nations." It lets them rebuild a centuries-old  cultural tie, helping ethnic Croats in Hungary and Hungarians in  Croatia, he added. Granic stressed how Croatian Hungarians had  helped Croatian freedom struggles.    Jeszenszky also met President Franjo Tudjman and Prime  Minister Nikica Valentic. Jeszenszky welcomed the Muslim-Croat  agreement.    He said Serb promises during his January Belgrade visit  still  remained promises, with no major gains for Hungarians in  Vojvodina. "But, it may be because measures justly expected by  the Hungarian minority depend on a new Serb government forming,"  he added.    Jeszenszky later visited the aid-consignment store in  Jankomir, and presented HUF [Hungarian forints] 6 million relief  from the Hungarian Government. Much of the medicine and food  will go to Bosnian Muslims.    Jeszenszky went to a March 15 celebration of Croatia's  Hungarian Democratic Community. He goes to Sarajevo on Thursday  morning.</p>

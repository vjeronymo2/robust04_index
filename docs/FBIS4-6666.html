			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Seiichi Takagi: "The Calculations of </F> the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in Choosing a  Pro-Ozawa/Pro-U.S. Course"]    [Text] The stir caused by a comment made by Koremasa Egawa,  director of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau of the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT], regarding a  "reconsideration of the course of high-definition television  [HDTV]," has been settled by Egawa himself, who corrected the  remark. It cannot be denied that Egawa's comment was rather  inconsiderate in giving the impression that the testing of  high-vision broadcasting will stop immediately--even tomorrow.  However, a closer study of the background of this comment allows  us to find a significant meaning hidden in it, and this makes us  realize that this comment should not be overlooked as a slip of  the tongue. Egawa abruptly mentioned, "We should seek the  digitalization of high vision, the analog-type HDTV," at the  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Social Capital Group meeting  held on 18 February. The point is that this took place during  the Shinseito group meeting.    In fact, the heated confrontation between Shinseito and the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] over the issue of running the  MOPT has been accelerating since last summer, when the new  government was born. The future course to be pursued by the  respective parties on the issue of HDTV, which will be a  generator of enormous demand in the 21st century, has often been  rumored. Although NHK and the MOPT have been taking the  initiative in developing HDTV, MOPT-related members of the LDP  have served as the actual decisionmakers. Rushing to embrace  the digitalization of HDTV by making high vision out-of-date  will permit Shinseito to obtain new political power.    Amid such circumstances, we can regard Egawa's comment as a  reflection of the intention of the MOPT to get out from under  the LDP and move toward Shinseito.    If such a comment as "Executive officials of the MOPT  frequently visited (Shinseito Secretary General) Ichiro Ozawa  before Shinseito group meetings," is true, it is possible to  assume that extensive groundwork had already been laid prior to  Egawa's comment.    In the MOPT, there is a group of people who have developed  close relations with Ozawa since he was a member of the LDP.  They first met at "Ichinokai," a study group in the ministry  once formed around Ozawa. Participants in this study group  include Mr. Misuo Igarashi, director of the Telecommunications  Policy Bureau; Akiyoshi Takada, deputy director of the same;  Kanichiro Aritomi, director of the Policy Division of the same;  Hideo Shimizu, director of the Broadcasting Administration  Bureau; and other opinion leaders on the issues of the  telecommunications and broadcasting administration of the MOPT.  This illustrates that the Shinseito-oriented course had already  been established.    The important point here is that a change in the direction  of  the MOPT does not merely mean a shift in the domestic power  structure; it is also a matter of international concern. Ozawa,  who made positive commitments to solving U.S.-Japanese  construction-related frictions, as well as electronics- and  telecommunications-related frictions, has been relied on heavily  by the U.S. Government and has been considered "pro-U.S."  Although I do not intend to discuss the real meaning of Ozawa's  approaches here, it is clear that "taking a pro-Ozawa course  means choosing a pro-U.S. course" (as was stated by a person  with the MOPT).    As far as HDTV is concerned, the United States has already  decided to adopt the digital method. Because European countries  are also inclined to take the same course, the isolation of  Japan, a country that is proceeding with the analog method, is  becoming increasingly decisive. The United States is displeased  by Japan's continued intention to stick with the high-vision  choice because this will possibly prevent the entry of  U.S.-method hardware and software into the Japanese market.    At the Shinseito group meeting, Egawa stressed, "Japan's  high-vision-oriented commitment will create another trade  friction," and he added the importance of taking a concerted  step with the U.S. method by giving up Japan's own standard.    It can be said that the MOPT's pro-U.S. attitude was  reflected well in the February resolution of trade frictions  over the issue of Motorola's mobile telephones. The MOPT  resolved the issue by making a substantial concession, which was  a big surprise to other government agencies. Ichiro Ozawa is  said to have taken various steps to settle the negotiations.    Because of the heated criticism of the Japanese bureaucracy  by the U.S. Government, Kasumigaseki is becoming increasingly  fed up with the United States. Amid these circumstances, the  attitude of the MOPT appears to be odd. It is particularly  interesting to observe the response of the Ministry of Trade and  Industry [MITI], which is a rival of the MOPT. Such an abusive  comment as "The decision made by the MOPT is traitorous in  promoting Japan's becoming technologically subordinate to the  United States" is heard from it. It is well-known that MITI is  strongly opposed to the U.S. demand to introduce numerical  targets at the U.S.-Japanese economic framework talks. This  clearly illustrates a discrepancy between two high-tech  ministries, MITI and the MOPT, in dealing with the United States.    Which ministry will take the leading role in Japan's  information technology policies for the 21st century? It seems  that the answer to this questions will significantly influence  the U.S.-Japanese relationship in the future.</p>

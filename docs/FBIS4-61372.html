			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Bill Clinton's Message to Armenia"--ARAGIL headline] </F>   [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" daily), 04/26/94  -- "I join to Armenians over the world in this solemn date, to  respect the memory of victims of the genocide of Armenians in  Osman [Ottoman] Turkey in 1915. This tragedy worries all of us,  and we mourn together the terrible loss of the victims. Even  after this destructive event, the Armenian culture is rich and  prospering, it shows excellent flexibility and courage.  American Armenians have a great input in our progress and  development as a country. Now, with creation of independent  Armenia, headed by the President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenian  people are building democracy and contemporary economy in their  own land with similar determination. Remembering the courageous  soul of the victims of the tragedy of 1915, these important  efforts are a sign of respect to their inheritance. As long as  we dedicate ourselves to construction of a flourishing Armenia  and lasting peace, I send my best wishes and insure my deep  respect to everyone".</p>

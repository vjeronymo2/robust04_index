			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry launches utility trust JOHNSON FRY, the financial services company best known for its business expansion schemes, is launching its first investment trust. The Johnson Fry Utilities Trust will buy shares in privatised water, electricity, telecommunications and gas companies. The trust will have a split capital structure with ordinary income and zero dividend preference shares. The zeros will have first claim on the assets of the trust and will grow at a rate equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 9 per cent per year over the trust's 10 year life. The income shares will receive all the dividends and the remaining assets after the zeros have been repaid. The initial gross yield on the income shares is expected to be 9 per cent. Assets will have to grow at 3.7 per cent per year for the income shares to be repaid at their issue price of 100p. Some 75 per cent of the portfolio will be in utilities. The remaining 25 per cent will be invested in irredeemable preference shares, to help boost the overall yield. Further income will be earned by writing call options against part of the trust's utility holdings. The trust aims to raise Pounds 40m, including Pounds 10m worth of zero dividend preference shares. The issue expenses have been capped at 4.2 per cent and the the manager's annual fee will be 0.5 per cent of assets. Applications must be for a minimum of Pounds 3,000. Those who opt for the income shares can place them in a personal equity plan for an additional charge of Pounds 30 per year. There is also the facility for a share exchange for those who own shares from previous privatisations. The trust will buy shares at the bid price at no dealing charge. Any exchanges, however, must be made on top of an additional cash investment of Pounds 3,000. The issue is sponsored by Smith New Court and will close on July 6 (for income shares) and July 8 (for zeros). COMMENT A portfolio of utility shares is such a natural choice for private investors that it is surprising no-one has launched an investment trust in this area before. The question is whether utilities have had such a good run that the trust is being launched at the top of the cycle. Certainly, with 25 per cent of the portfolio in preference shares, prospects for capital growth may be limited, given that income holders already need 3.7 per cent annual growth in assets just to get their money back. That said, the recent falls in interest rates have created demand for high-yielding equity investments and this ought to be safer than most. The zeros, which yield 9 per cent and are well covered, may be especially appealing to higher rate taxpayers.</p>

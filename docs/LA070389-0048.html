			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA FESTIVAL SHOWS RESTORED FILM CLASSICS  </P> <P> The UCLA Film and Television Archive's second annual Festival of Preservation  at once calls attention to the archive's invaluable, ongoing contributions  toward retrieving and protecting our endangered film heritage and provides  delightful summer entertainment as well.  </P> <P> The festival gets off to a roaring start at 8 p.m. Friday in Melnitz Theater  with one of Hollywood's truly legendary movies, Howard Hughes' "Hell's Angels"  (1930), which restores the film to its full running time of 127 minutes,  re-creates its tinted portions and incorporates a long-missing, eight-minute,  two-color Technicolor sequence that represents the only color footage of Jean  Harlow.  </P> <P> On the ground, "Hell's Angels" is pretty corny, following two brothers -- one  weak and cynical (Ben Lyon), the other strong and virtuous (James Hall) -- as  they are swept away by a shallow society girl (Harlow) and swept up by the  outbreak of World War I, which prompts their enlistment in the Royal Flying  Corps. (The film's three stars make no real stab at British accents, merely  sprinkling their conversation with rathers and rightos.)  </P> <P> In the sky, however, the film remains one of the most exciting examples of  aerial warfare, thrilling and unnervingly personal. Almost as suspenseful is  whether Harlow will fall out of her gown. (In the late '40s, as executive  talent director for Fox, Lyon would be instrumental in launching the career of  another dynamite blonde, Marilyn Monroe.)  </P> <P> The archive's preservation expert, Robert Gitt, and his team had an easier job  with John Ford's "The Quiet Man" (1952), which screens after "Hell's Angels."  However, a fresh print reveals how subtle three-strip Technicolor could be in  this glorious romantic comedy set in Ireland and starring John Wayne and  Maureen O'Hara, whose red-haired beauty was perfect for color.  </P> <P> Wayne plays a retired boxing champ who returns to the birthplace he left as a  small child. He has his reasons for avoiding a donnybrook with O'Hara's  comically stubborn brother (Victor McLaglen), who won't allow O'Hara to have  her rightful dowry. Ford's pace is appropriately leisurely, matching the tempo  of rural Irish life, and the film is resonant with the director's wise and  compassionate humor. Wayne is splendid and understated, as he always was under  Ford's direction, and it's gratifying to be reminded that O'Hara was not merely  "fiery" but delightfully varied as she alternates between pride and dismay.  This is an adult film in the best sense.  </P> <P> Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross" (1932), which has had its suggestive  (rather than explicit) pre-code sex and violence restored, isn't as much fun as  you would expect. In this ponderous extravaganza of Christian martyrdom in  Nero's Rome, there's something queasy in DeMille's patented prurience-and-piety  formula: The Christians, led by a pallid and insufferably noble Elissa Landi,  are hard to take and so are the Romans, an unappetizing, sadistic crew, led by  Charles Laughton's campy Nero. Fredric March seems too cerebral for Marcus,  prefect of Rome, who falls for Landi. The film's bright spot is Claudette  Colbert, as Poppaea, who takes what was a highly publicized milk bath and who  has the wit to make wickedness seem chic. Lots of Deco-influenced Mitchell  Leisen costumes.  </P> <P> "The Sign of the Cross" is screening Sunday at 8 p.m. Also screening Sunday at  2 p.m.: "The Line-Up at Police Headquarters" (1914) and the long-lost Jackie  Coogan picture, "Daddy" (1923).  </P> <P> The preservation festival, which runs weekends through July and includes many  rarities, continues July 13 at 8 p.m. with the recently rediscovered Roland  West silent "The Bat" (1926), which West remade (in 65 millimeter) only four  years later as a talkie, "The Bat Whispers." With William Cameron Menzies'  stark, vast sets and cinematographer Arthur Edeson's dramatic play of light and  shadow, "The Bat" is almost as striking a triumph of the visual as its remake.  </P> <P> It is one of the pioneer "old dark house" mysteries and adapted from the Mary  Roberts Rhinehart-Avery Hopwood play, based in turn on Rhinehart's novel. The  big deal is to guess the identity of The Bat as he -- or she -- terrorizes a  mansion in the country that has been rented for the summer by a formidable New  York aristocrat. The film is of special current interest as a clear inspiration  for "Batman" creator Bob Kane, even though the Bat was a villain. Information:  (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Time to take a sun cheque - The Plowshares / They're off for a cheap holiday in the Bahamas, but first there's the usual currency problem John and Alison Plowshare, in their late forties, live in a smarter part of North London. He is a partner in an architectural practice, and earned Pounds 60,000 last year; she is a part-time receptionist at the local GP's surgery. Their children are: Lucy, aged 21, at university; and Toby, 18, still at school. Through the deaths of John's parents and his subsequent inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 in unit trusts, Pounds 6,000 each in a personal equity plan and just over Pounds 36,000 in the building society as rainy-day money. IT'S BEEN a hard and stressful year for the Plowshares. John's architectural practice has been experiencing financial difficulties for some time, and there has even been some doubt about the security of Alison's job at the GP's surgery. As a result of the tougher financial climate, the usual family summer holiday to a friend's house in Tuscany was cancelled last year, and the Plowshares are generally feeling rather worn out. Opportunity arrives one breakfast time, with a letter from an old school friend of John's, inviting them to take advantage of the current cheap air fares to Miami and to use his house in the Bahamas, which will shortly be empty for two weeks. It doesn't take more than a day's thought for Alison and John to decide that this is just what the doctor ordered: exotic, international and above all fairly cheap. The opportunity seems too good to miss. Tickets are bought and travel arrangements made. The only thing left to do is the one thing that Alison dreads most: the Plowshares must decide how much money to take on holiday with them, and, more contentiously, in what form to take it. For years, the portability of holiday money has been the subject of a recurrent argument. John, faced with foreign travel, firmly believes that a credit card will get him everywhere, while Alison has greater faith in traveller's cheques. The argument has become more complicated with the attentions of Toby who, over the last few years, has professed himself to be fond of 'dosh - and lots of it' for foreign travel. The dosh option is firmly dismissed by Alison, on the grounds that, the last time any of the family had lots of it, it got blown away over the city ramparts in Perugia. Similarly, she recalls scouring the Dordogne for a restaurant that would accept the one type of credit card the Plowshares had taken with them, finding such a restaurant in the local chateau, and the subsequent sickening disbelief with which she had faced the credit card bill after their return. Had they really spent that much money? Alison decides that, in order to end the great foreign money debate once and for all, she will undertake a little research campaign. She spends the best part of a day looking at the various options, and returns home amazed at the variety of ways one can take holiday money abroad, and appalled at the variety of prices one can pay for the facility. Over dinner that evening, she lays out her findings: 'We should certainly take enough cash to last us for three to four days, for incidental expenses. It should be in US dollars, not Bahamian dollars, because they are both acceptable in the Bahamas, but US dollars are cheaper when obtained over here. 'They will cost us between 0.5 and 2 per cent in commission, depending on where we get them from - although one bureau de change explained that what you really need to look at is the minimum charge, not the commission cost. Can you believe that the minimum costs vary between Pounds 2 and Pounds 5, depending on where you go to get your cash?' John works out that Pounds 5 is 3 per cent commission on the Pounds 150 cash they are planning to take, and resolves to choose the source of cash carefully. 'I have also finally got to the bottom of those confusing signs next to the foreign money desk at the bank,' says Alison triumphantly. 'The 'we sell at' figure is the price that you pay when you buy foreign cash. The higher that figure, the better the rate: 1.73 means that you get USDollars 1.73 per pound sterling. The 'we buy at' figure is the one you get when you take your cash back to the bank.' The rest of the family digest this information, and John begins to reflect on the comparative simplicity of just taking a credit card. 'The rest of the money we should take in dollar traveller's cheques,' says Alison. 'With US dollar traveller's cheques, we will know exactly what exchange rate we are getting. We will know exactly how much money we have and how much we have spent, and the commission rate is roughly the same as cash. 'There is also,' she points out, 'a replacement-within-24-hours service available, if the cheques are stolen or lost. And we can cash them in restaurants, bars and shops - not just at the bank.' 'We can also use my credit card,' says John, plaintively. 'Well, I suppose so. It'Il certainly be useful for identification purposes,' Alison admits. 'But you do realise that credit cards charge their own exchange rates, and that interest charges, depending on your card, run from between 23.7 per cent and 29.8 per cent for purchases and even higher for cash withdrawals? 'Also, it's very difficult to budget, and, as we know, the card may not be accepted everywhere.' John and Toby, and secretly Alison, are relieved that at least The Plowshares Holiday Money Research Project has been completed and the debate closed. They set off on holiday with a small amount of cash, a large quantity of traveller's cheques and John's credit card.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TRAVEL MONEY PRICING: TRAVELLER'S CHEQUE COMMISSIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Buy          Sell         Buy            Sell           Sterling                Other Currencies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THOMAS COOK        2%           1%           3%             2% Pounds 3     Pounds 3     Pounds 3       Pounds 3      Min          Min          Min            Min Does not charge a commission when buying Thomas Cook traveller's cheques  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BARCLAYS BANK       No            1%          1%              1%     charge   Pounds 2    Pounds 2        Pounds 2                   Min         Min             Min Sterling and USDollars traveller's cheques are stocked only.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Just as reports began to circulate about  a possible Middle East tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher near the end of this month with the aim of advancing  the peace process, the Israeli foreign minister said in a  statement that major progress will be realized on the  Syrian-Israeli track during the forthcoming negotiations.  However, the Israeli minister did not say whether a change has  taken place in the Israeli position that has obstructed such  progress.    It is known that the Syrian-Israeli talks in particular, and  the Arab-Israeli talks in general, have always faced the Tel  Aviv rulers' intransigence and their refusal to discuss the most  important aspect of the conflict -- withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories and the implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [break in transmission]    The Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre dealt a strong blow to these  talks and entrenched the conviction that Israel is not serious  about realizing peace. This is not the first time that Israeli  officials have spoken about progress in the negotiations with  Syria. Such talk has never gone beyond media deception and  negotiations tactics aimed at playing games on each track.    Hence, a demonstration of real seriousness about making  progress should come through a serious declaration of commitment  to reaching a just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East  based on Security Council resolutions. Syria has unequivocally  committed itself to this position. Any talk about partial and  phased settlements, or peace by installments, is only an Israeli  maneuver to entrench the occupation and legitimize settlement  activities.    Syria has repeatedly urged the Arab parties to stick to the  principles of the Madrid conference, the resolutions of  international legitimacy, and the principles agreed on at the  Damascus, Amman, and Beirut meetings. Syria has also urged the  Arab parties to coordinate positions in a manner that will  circumvent the malicious Israeli attempts to isolate Arab  parties and dictate conditions on each party.    The Arab parties are expected to hold a meeting to discuss  the resumption of the Washington talks in light of their  contacts with the United States, the developments in the region,  and the higher pan-Arab interest. It should be recalled that  Israel is the one that has obstructed the Washington talks so  far, and prevented the realization of the slightest progress by  refusing to commit itself to withdraw from the occupied  territories.    The area is now in need of real, just, and comprehensive  peace. It is impossible to attain this peace without Israel's  full withdrawal and the return of all occupied territories to  their owners.    The only viable agreements are ones that realize calm,  security, satisfaction, and peace. What we see in the occupied  territories is the total opposite of this. Confrontations  between the Palestinian people and the occupation forces are on  the rise, and scores of people are being victimized daily.  Furthermore, the occupied territories have turned into a real  battlefield. Therefore, where is peace in all of this?    In response to [Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on] Peres'  optimism, we say that progress in the talks with Syria and the  other parties depends on Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan  and the occupied Arab territories, and the full implementation  of Security Council resolutions without ambiguity, and in a  manner that gives the final say to international law and the  principles of right and justice.</p>

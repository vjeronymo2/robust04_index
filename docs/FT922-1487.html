			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Germany delays European fighter decision for week THE increasingly confused debate in Germany over the future of the European Fighter Aircraft was thrown into fresh turbulence yesterday when the parliamentary leaders of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) agreed to postpone a decision by one week. The move was reported to have been made at the request of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under pressure from his fellow leaders in Britain, Italy and Spain to keep a German foothold in the multinational project. The debate over the EFA, known in Germany as the Jager-90, has split the ruling coalition, and Mr Kohl is clearly struggling to find a solution which will satisfy both his own CDU and the Bavaria-based CSU. Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, is now publicly in favour of pulling out of the Pounds 21bn (Dollars 39bn) project, while Mr Theo Waigel, the CSU leader and finance minister, is ironically campaigning to preserve it - not least to protect the military aerospace industry in Bavaria. A report in the conservative newspaper Die Welt yesterday said that Mr Kohl and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the floor leader of the CDU in the Bundestag, had decided to withdraw their support for Mr Ruhe in the stormy debate. Mr Schauble had been convinced by the defence establishment's arguments in favour of the aircraft, while Mr Kohl was anxious not to offend Britain, Italy and Spain, the newspaper said. Public opinion in Germany remains overwhelmingly hostile to the Jager-90, seen as a symbol of extravagant defence spending in the post-Cold War era. Defence experts argue that it is the only aircraft capable of meeting the requirements of the Luftwaffe past the year 2000, and that any less well-adapted alternative would anyway be quite as expensive in the long run. A decision on the aircraft needs to be made for the draft 1993 budget, in order to allocate DM100m (Pounds 34.2m) for tooling up for production. One compromise proposal is to leave a line in the budget which must be presented on July 1, without allocating any funds to the project. This would effectively postpone any decision until next year.</p>

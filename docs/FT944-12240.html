			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scotia has high expectations of OTC calcium supplement Scotia Holdings yesterday became the latest biotechnology company to hail the potential of a new treatment developed using funds from its recent flotation. The company, which raised Pounds 37m when it came to the market last October, said Efacal - its over-the-counter calcium supplement - would prove an effective remedy for osteoporosis in a global market worth an estimated Pounds 50m a year. It also has high hopes for EF40, its single-compound prescription treatment for the illness, which could exploit a market put at Pounds 300m if clinical trials prove successful. Mr David Horrobin, chief executive, warned the drug could cost another Pounds 5m before it reached launch stage - at least five years from now. Scotia's announcement followed claims on Monday from British Biotechnology, one of the sector's leading companies, that its new cancer treatment had shown promise in first clinical trials. Celltech, another rival, said last week it had made a breakthrough in Phase Two trials for its latest anti-arthritis drug. Such statements have helped lift the share price of all three companies, with Scotia closing up 3p at 263p. The industry, however, has been unsettled in recent weeks by US biotechnology companies reporting the failure of drugs in the latest stages of clinical development, which is supposed to involve the least risk.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Stores' low-price strategy fails to satisfy analysts - Kingfisher An increase in first-half pre-tax profits tomorrow at Kingfisher, the retailing group, from Pounds 82m to about Pounds 93m, is not expected to lift the gloom surrounding the stock in the City. The shares have fallen from a high of 778p last December to 504p on Friday. The results will include a full contribution for the first time from Darty, the French electrical retailer whose acquisition was completed two months before the end of the first half last year. Stripping out the increase from Darty, the underlying result is forecast to be down on last year. Uncertainty among analysts over the size of Darty's trading profit - forecasts average about Pounds 36m - is one reason for the wide range of group profits forecasts, from Pounds 89m to Pounds 98m. There is further uncertainty over how successful Kingfisher, which includes B&amp;Q, Comet, Superdrug and Woolworths, has been in making its Everyday Low Pricing Strategy work. Analysts do not quarrel with the overall strategy - trimming margins to increase sales volumes and market share, allowing further cuts in prices, to get into a 'productivity loop' - but they are concerned about its implementation. They say Kingfisher should have cut costs, and introduced technology such as electronic point of sale systems in all chains first. Kingfisher also operates in difficult markets. In the low-growth DIY market, B&amp;Q is expected to increase trading profits slightly from Pounds 41.6m to about Pounds 43m. In the similarly depressed electrical market, Comet is expected to make a small loss after Pounds 700,000 profit last year. Woolworths has suffered from the downturn in the computer games market, and is not expected to match last year's Pounds 2.1m profit. Little change is expected from Superdrug's Pounds 12.8m profit reported last year.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FOYT CRASHES IN SPEEDWAY SESSION  </P> <P> Four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt was injured today when he crashed  at Charlotte Motor Speedway during a practice session for the All-Pro Auto  Parts 500.  </P> <P> "He hit the wall in turn three, slid about 300 yards and came to a stop at the  entrance of pit road," said speedway spokesman Eddie Gossage. "The track  emergency staff worked about 10 minutes to get him out of the car. They were  mostly trying to be easy because they didn't want to hurt him worse than he  was."  </P> <P> Gossage said Foyt was "conscious and alert" when taken to the speedway  hospital. He was later airlifted to Charlotte Memorial Hospital, and hospital  officials would give no details of his injuries or condition.  </P> <P> "We don't know why he hit the wall," Gossage said. "It was just practice. He  wasn't racing the car. But he hit the wall very hard."  </P></p>

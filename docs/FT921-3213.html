			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Stark options: The referendum which will steer South Africa Tomorrow, white South Africans will choose between danger and disaster, in a referendum which will determine the fate of one of the world's most troubled societies. The choice - between a fragile peace and civil war, between apartheid fantasies and the reality of a multi-racial future - has polarised the white nation and drawn blacks into new conflict. It is the biggest political choice white South Africa has faced, and many potential voters may avoid it altogether. As for the rest, it is not yet certain that they will make the choice urged on them by the international community, and by their brave reformist president, Mr FW de Klerk. Both sides - the ruling National party, which is asking for a 'yes' vote to endorse negotiations with blacks, and the ultra-right Conservative party, which wants 'no' voters to back its plans for modernising apartheid - predict a close poll. The landslide triumph seen as crucial by Mr de Klerk may not materialise. Much could change before polls open in 24 hours' time. The anxiety of the Nationalists could galvanise reluctant 'yes' voters into action; or, conversely, the outside chance of victory for the Conservatives could give the 'no' campaign new life. With the publication of opinion polls banned during campaigning, neither side knows its true strength. The Conservative party, with its allies the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB) and the Herstigte Nasionale party (Reconstituted National party, HNP), has undoubtedly run a more powerful campaign. That is scarcely surprising: the Conservatives have found it easy to tap emotion and prejudice, fear and anger. Mr de Klerk has sought the more difficult goal: to capture the soul of the white voter through reason. It is not clear he has succeeded. The Conservatives kept their message simple: vote 'no', and stop the advance of communism in the form of the African National Congress (ANC), with its close ally the South African Communist party (SACP). The Nationalists ran a wordy and unimaginative campaign. Repeatedly, Mr de Klerk called on voters to resign themselves to the inevitable: that a huge majority of blacks cannot forever be governed by a small white elite. He experimented with visionary rhetoric, promising a grand and beautiful multi-racial future; but his efforts fell flat with audiences far more worried than inspired by change. After all, Mr de Klerk's ideal is not the integration of South Africa's peoples into one colour-blind nation; it is to create a balance of power between racial groups which will eliminate conflict while preserving cultural differences. The ANC wants a melting pot; Mr de Klerk prefers a rainbow. Most South Africans, barring a small minority of liberal whites, have a similar vision. They know white domination must end, and will vote for the party which strikes the best bargain for white interests. Mr de Klerk has promised to prevent black domination, by insisting on traditional liberal protections and enforced coalition government. The Conservatives preach a neo-apartheid vision of racial separation which they defend as Afrikaner nationalism, and which Mr de Klerk condemns as neo-fascist. Tomorrow's vote will tell whether whites believe Mr de Klerk's vow to share power without abandoning it, or Mr Treurnicht's promise of security in separation. Unless the result is clearly a landslide, disputes will inevitably arise over the strength of Mr de Klerk's mandate: if turnout is low, a 55 per cent majority will do little to support his claim to negotiate for white South Africa. But if a large majority (say, 60 per cent) votes 'yes' to a 'continuation of the reform process . . . aimed at a new constitution through negotiation' (the essence of the wordy referendum question), blacks will come to power in an interim government within months. Parties to the multi-racial negotiating forum, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), will have had a serious fright at the prospect of right-wing victory; they will rush in a multi-racial interim government which would be less vulnerable than the Nationalists on their own. The outlines of such a deal have been sketched in during bilateral talks between the ANC and the government - the only two parties whose agreement is truly essential. An interim executive could be appointed by Codesa as early as June, with multi-party committees to oversee the security forces, local government, the budget and foreign affairs, as well as independent commissions to control the media and multi-party elections. Within a year from then, elections would be held to a unicameral legislature which would both replace the current parliament and draw up a new constitution. This represents a major concession from the Nationalists, who have always insisted on a second chamber, a sort of 'house of minorities', to protect whites. Such a legislature would meet the ANC's main demand: that an elected constituent assembly draw up a post-apartheid constitution, with decisions taken by two-thirds majority. This body would sit for about a year - not the 10 years originally demanded by the government - until elections were held under a new constitution which would enforce power-sharing for a further five years. The new parliament would be bicameral, with disproportionately large representation for minority political parties by region. And crucially, many powers would be devolved from central government to the regions. For this is the key to the National Party's plan for preventing black domination; government officials believe they have ANC agreement to maximum devolution. Details of this plan could change - especially if a big 'yes' vote inspires Mr de Klerk to take a tougher line - but an interim government should be put swiftly in place. At least as importantly, a clear 'yes' majority could provoke the Conservative party to split, with a large chunk entering talks on a more moderate platform. The risk is that the radical rump of the party  -along with the paramilitary AWB - would turn increasingly violent once legal forms of opposition had failed. The result could be a smaller but more radicalised right, creating havoc as a spoiling force. The consequences of a slim 'yes' majority, perhaps with a low turnout, are more difficult to predict. Mr de Klerk will have been denied the clear moral and political victory he sought, and negotiations could lose momentum. Here, the role of the security forces could become crucial: for while the largely conscript army has no tradition of taking power, the generals might find their tenuous commitment to political reform weakened, and drag their feet over Codesa. Negotiations would continue, but with less speed. The prospect of a 'no' vote provokes apocalyptic visions from most commentators. Mr de Klerk, the great hope of South African democrats, would resign; his government would lose a general election fought within electoral boundaries which give heavy weight to conservative rural areas; inevitable black protest would provoke security force repression; and the west would impose further sanctions. None of this would happen overnight, and the behaviour of the Conservatives  -who claim to be willing to enter negotiations with blacks to create a confederation of racially-based states - would also be important. But Conservative policy is irredeemably racist, and it is hard to see room for accommodation with the ANC, which would be forced to resume a campaign to overthrow the government. Civil war would ensue; and though South Africa probably does not have the potential for conflict of Lebanon or Yugoslavia, many would die - far more blacks than whites, as always in South Africa. Whatever the referendum outcome, 1m or more whites will have voted to reject a multi-racial South Africa; they will not disappear with the polling booths. It is hard to imagine a lasting solution without them; and they are unlikely to compromise unless heavily beaten in the referendum. For it could prove dangerous to force artificial political unity on a country which has for so long clung to diversity. 'It is not possible to subject a nation forever,' argues Prof Carel Boshoff, an Afrikaner theologian who is the respectable face of the right. 'There will always be a struggle for self-expression, even if it takes 50 years.' And unless this struggle can be brought to the negotiating table, it will destabilise South Africa for years to come.</p>

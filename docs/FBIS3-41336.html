			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Panamanian Government strongly rejects  statements made by U.S. State Department official Robert Gelbard  on drug money laundering.    A Foreign Ministry communique sent to the U.S. ambassador in  Panama states that charges by the previously mentioned official  are false, as Panama has undertaken serious and decisive actions  to fight drug trafficking and money laundering since 1990.    The document, which lists in 12 points everything Panama has  done to stamp out these crimes, says it is unacceptable for the  United States to express criticism which does not seriously  reflect the real position and will of the Panamanian Government.    Furthermore, the communique questions the U.S. Senate's  delay  in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT] for  criminal affairs, which has already been approved by the  Republic of Panama.    The Panamanian Foreign Ministry communique responds to  statements made by Gelbard, who harshly attacked the Panamanian  Government for what he called a lack of effort in fighting money  laundering.    The State Department official's statements could stop Panama  from achieving MLAT certification and from obtaining loans from  Congress for the eradication of drug trafficking.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Too late to avoid problems Sir, I hope you will allow me, as a believer in the accuracy of historical records, to clarify my discussion with Sir Terence Burns, reported by Peter Marsh (Monday Profile, February 24). The conversation occurred in June 1987 when my argument was this: first, I believed that the rate of growth of economic activity in the UK was unsustainably high; second, that this would lead to serious inflation which could be corrected only by monetary policy. Sir Terence took the view that since house prices were not rising significantly all was reasonably well. To this I replied that unless policy were changed house prices would begin to rise rapidly but that by then it would be too late to avoid serious problems. Your readers will be able to judge which of us was nearer the truth. Douglas Hague, chairman, Doctus Consulting Europe, Windsor House, 2 Pepper Street, Chester</p>

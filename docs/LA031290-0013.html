			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS RECONSIDER CLOSING BARS EARLIER  </P> <P> Moorpark officials were considering redrafting a proposed ordinance that would  force restaurants and bars serving alcohol to close at 1 a.m. after questions  were raised about its legality.  </P> <P> City officials said any new proposal would be reviewed by attorneys before it  is presented to the City Council.  </P> <P> By imposing a blanket ordinance to close the businesses at 1 a.m., the city  would violate a 56-year-old state law that allows alcohol to be served until 2  a.m., said John Pierce, an attorney with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage  Control, the state agency that regulates alcohol sales and consumption.  </P> <P> Moorpark City Atty. Cheryl Kane said the law gives cities the option of  imposing conditions such as early closing times on businesses that serve  alcohol.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance would standardize the closing times for new and old  restaurants and bars, which presently close between midnight and 2 a.m.,  according to Community Development Director Patrick Richards. It would also  help police handle enforcement around closing time, he added. PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 8 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Nikola Sainovic said on Sunday the success of the  country's economic recovery programme was a heavy blow to  international sanctions against it. The sanctions were  originally introduced to cause an economic collapse in  Yugoslavia, but the programme has prevented this and in this way  made senseless the very purpose of the sanctions, Sainovic told  the local radio in Kragujevac.    In late May of 1992, the U.N. Security Council introduced  tough sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) for its  alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those who imposed the blockade now see that  the Yugoslav economy is recovering and that the sanctions are  also affecting the countries neighbouring on Yugoslavia which  are allegedly supported by the big powers, said Sainovic.    "The positive results of the programme have become evident  in  the first 100 days of its implementation, primarily as concerns  the curbing of hyperinflation and revival of production." The  basic goal now is to sustain production growth and ensure  revival of the overall economic activity, explained Sainovic.    The economic recovery programme, which was launched on  January 24, slashed inflation to zero. Before the programme was  introduced, the monthly inflation in Yugoslavia soared to the  unbelievable 310 million percent. One of the effects of the  sanctions was a sharp drop in industrial production which was  reversed after the programme was introduced. In February,  industrial output rose by 12.4 percent on the January figure and  in March by 21.3 percent.    The architect of the Yugoslav economic recovery programme is  Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, 77, who for decades worked with the  World Bank and other U.N. specialized agencies. Dr. Avramovic is  currently governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.</p>

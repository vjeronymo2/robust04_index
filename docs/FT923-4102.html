			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Trade News: BMW Rolls-Royce in Dollars 500m deal - Farnborough Air Show THE NEW Anglo-German aero-engine consortium between Rolls-Royce and BMW has clinched its first big order worth over Dollars 500m (Pounds 251.2m) for 200 engines to power the new Gulfstream GV business jet aircraft. The order announced by the BMW Rolls-Royce joint venture at Farnborough, launches the group's new BR700 series of medium-thrust jet engines to power business and regional jet liners of 60-140 seats. The venture, formed two years ago, marks the return of the German carmaker to the aero-engine business. It reflects Rolls-Royce's efforts to extend its collaborating ventures into new niche markets. The venture is building a plant near Berlin. BMW owns 50.5 per cent, with Rolls-Royce holding 49.5. It is capitalised at DM200m (Pounds 71.6m). Turnover last year was DM231m and the group employs over 1,100. The private venture aims to produce a new family of engines ranging between 10,000 and 22,000 lbs of thrust for civil aircraft. Gulfstream announced the development of its new twin-engine top-of-the-line GV business jet at Farnborough to meet the need for an aircraft capable of flying non-stop from New York to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. The first flight of the new business jet is due in late 1995. The selection by the US company of the Anglo-German engine was described yesterday as 'the first and most significant breakthrough' for the new organisation by Mr Albert Schneider, chairman of BMW Rolls-Royce.</p>

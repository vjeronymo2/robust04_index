			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (3): Recanting is not an option - Profile: Charles Picque AS the first chief minister of the Brussels region, Charles Picque is the man who runs the capital of Europe. For exactly three years - since direct elections in June 1989 - the 43-year-old socialist has had the difficult task of squaring the demands of a growing international centre with the need to preserve the 'soul' of Brussels. Mr Picque and his government face some formidable obstacles, including an institutional framework of mind-boggling complexity, even by the standards of Belgian's complicated federal system of government. The chief minister admits that simply managing the web of councils, executives, assemblies and Flemish and francophone commissions takes up more of his government's time than he would like, but he calls it 'le miracle bruxellois' that the system works at all. Much of the rest of the government's time is spent working to correct or soothe the planning and financial scars inflicted in preceding years of centralised state control when Brussels was, in Mr Picque's words, 'the unloved child of Belgium'. 'Brussels was made poorer by the central state,' he explains. 'For 15 years, the 19 communes (boroughs) of the Brussels region were receiving two or three times less money than the other large towns in Flanders and Wallonia (the Flemish and French-speaking regions of Belgium).' Belgium's capital has also inherited the legacy of several decades of haphazard urban planning, including a system of tunnels and inner ring-roads dating from the 1950s and early 1960s which has blighted some of the most attractive parts of the city. But in trying to set right the errors of the past, Belgium has imposed new burdens on its capital's government. Everybody seems to agree that the boundaries of the city were drawn too tightly in 1989. Politically that was prudent because it avoided treading on the toes of the regional authorities. But economically it made little sense. Mr Picque talks hopefully of sharing the government - and the fiscal revenues - of the Brussels hinterland, but for the time being he literally cannot afford to alienate Brussels' 1m or so inhabitants. The wealthy commuters who work in the capital and live beyond the city limits pay their taxes to Flanders and Wallonia but spend their weekdays using services bought by Mr Picque's government. At the same time, there are fears that the inner city will be abandoned to offices or to the European institutions, and to poorer inhabitants, including a large number of immigrants often resentful of what they see as harassment by the authorities. For practical as well as idealistic reasons, then, Mr Picque - who is still mayor of one of the 19 communes - does not want Brussels to go the way of other international centres. In an attempt to prevent the village atmosphere of some parts of Brussels being replaced with administrative sterility, the government has tried to encourage joint developments with the private sector. More controversially, it has frozen or cut the number of city-centre parking spaces and imposed strict rules on granting planning permission for new offices. Partly because of this draconian policy and partly thanks to the European Community institutions' voracious appetite for space, Brussels already has one of the lowest office vacancy rates in Europe. Developers - many itching to acquire and convert older buildings - believe, or hope, that Mr Picque's ideas are doomed to failure. In five or 10 years he or his successors will have to relax their restrictions, they say, because Brussels will be starved of investment. Recanting is not an option contemplated by the current chief minister, who believes it could take 10 or 20 years to set the city to rights. During that time, Mr Picque is aware that Brussels must avoid alienating the business world and the European Community institutions, but he is determined to stick to his principles: 'I don't think you can always dream about the ideal city,' he says, 'but you ought not to give in either.'</p>

This organization, which controls  narcotics and psychotropic drugs worldwide, is linked to the  United Nations. Carlini was chosen on 19 April during the third  round of elections and was appointed World Health Organization  representative at the INCB. He disputed the position with  representatives of the PRC and the Philippines. He will be  installed in Vienna during the second half of the year.    Carlini has a well-defined line of action and wants to urge  Brazil to comply with the international treaty terms that force  countries to report on their production, import, and consumption  of drugs that affect the brain and create addiction, such as  morphine byproducts and psychotropic substances. Carlini  criticized: "For three years Brazil has been sending incomplete  reports to the INCB or not sending reports at all." Brazil has  never before been represented on the INCB (which comprises 13  members with 5-year mandates), but has signed the 1961 and 1971  conventions that establish rules to control drug circulation  worldwide.    Carlini said: "I will press the Board to adopt a firmer  position regarding Brazil." Carlini is a psycho-pharmacist and  a professor at the Sao Paulo Medical School. He founded the  Brazilian Center for Information on Psychotropic Drugs [Centro  Brasileiro de Informacoes Sobre Drogas Psicotropicas--Cebrid]  and has published nearly 200 papers on controlled drugs.</p>

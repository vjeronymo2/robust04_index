			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Industrial unrest hits transport Striking transport workers disrupted German cities yesterday as industrial unrest spread from the engineering industry to the public sector, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Bus and train drivers in the industrial heartland of North-Rhine Westphalia prevented thousands from getting to work on time. Protest stoppages lasted for several hours. The action against calls by the employers for a wage freeze and benefit cuts was the latest in a series of disputes over pay and job security which are hitting the German economy as it struggles to emerge from recession.</p>

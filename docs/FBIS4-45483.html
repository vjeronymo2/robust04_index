			<p>for   `Radical Change'   <F P=102> 94WD0393 London THE SUNDAY TIMES in English 29 May 94 pp 1,  2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0393 </F> <F P=104>  London THE SUNDAY TIMES </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Leppard: "Police Defeated in War Against </F> Drug Epidemic"]    [Text] Police chiefs are demanding a radical change in  government strategy as they finally admit they have lost the war  against drug abuse. They want ministers to consider a  controversial scheme to allow all 25,000 registered drug addicts  to receive heroin and other drugs free on the national service.    They are also demanding a royal commission on drug control  and an American-style national drugs task force to spearhead a  new anti-drugs campaign.    "We've won several battles but we've lost the war," Keith  Hellawell, chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs,  said yesterday. "The current policy has not stopped young people  turning to drugs.    "It has not stopped the violence and other crime related to  drugs. We need to win the hearts and minds of a generation and  turn them around."    Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and the favourite to  become  Labour party leader, last night supported the police initiative.  "It is desperately important that the government recognises the  scale and urgency of the drugs problem," he said. "It must put  together a comprehensive programme which cuts demand as well as  supply."    Police alarm at the rising drugs menace follows new evidence  that Britain is caught up in a drugs explosion. Chief constables  say existing policy has failed to stop the emergence of a "drugs  generation" made up of tens of thousands of youngsters who have  turned to crime to meet their drugs bills.    Hellawell will unveil fresh evidence of the crisis when he  chairs the chief constables' drugs conference at Wakefield next  week. "It's extremely serious. It's not just confined to the big  cities. This affects every city and town in the country. It's  right across society, it's right across our youth. I will  guarantee your children have been offered drugs or at least know  about drugs in their school.    "Headmasters are keeping it under wraps. This is a cancer in  our society that has to be excised. Otherwise I don't know where  it will lead."    Richard Browne, Britain's chief customs drugs investigator,  told THE SUNDAY TIMES: "I can stem the flow. I can make it more  difficult for them and restrict the amount that comes in. But we  can't link arms around the coastline and stop it. It's a  bottomless pit."    Chief Superintendent Paul Cook, head of community affairs  and  drugs in Greater Manchester, admitted that police and Customs  had failed to halt the drugs explosion. "The entire police  effort over the last 25 years has had no discernible effect on  the availability of drugs on the streets," he said. "I've talked  to ministers until I'm blue in the bloody face. We have got to  address this problem."    A cabinet sub-committee set up last year under Tony Newton,  leader of the Commons, is considering switching resources from  policing to reducing drugs demand among the young. The review,  due to report to John Major this summer, is likely to propose  giving the police a greater role in educating the public about  drugs.    Police chiefs warn, however, that Britain is facing a drugs  crisis matching the worst affected cities in the United States.  Philip Thomas, West Midlands assistant chief constable and head  of crime operations, said: "Drug dealers are protecting a trade  which is causing more social disruption than anything else in  our society."    "There have been drug-related shootings in Liverpool,  Manchester and eight in Birmingham in the last 12 months," says  Thomas. Last year there were 31 drug-related murders and  attempted murders in London alone.    New research shows the black market in heroin, cocaine,  cannabis and other illegal drugs is now worth &pound;5 billion a  year. Police, fearful of the "knock-on" effect on burglaries,  car thefts, credit card fraud and street robberies, point to new  figures showing that Britain has overtaken the United States in  car crime, previously the record holder.    Customs chiefs revealed last week that Britain is now the  most lucrative market in the world for heroin and cocaine  traffickers, giving international drugs syndicates a profits  "premium" of more than 30 percent.    Crack, the highly addictive cocaine derivative, is a growing  source of concern. "We're seeing huge amounts being targeted at  Britain and Europe," said Browne.    Large quantities of pure cocaine are being shipped to "crack  factories" in the inner cities including Tottenham, Stoke  Newington and Brixton in London, Moss Side in Manchester and  parts of Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh.    Manchester police estimates that the average heroin addict  consumes nearly &pound;30,000 worth of the drug each year, paying  for their habit by street dealing, prostitution and theft.

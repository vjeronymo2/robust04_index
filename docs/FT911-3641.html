			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: UK's new pollution inspector puts industry under scrutiny - John Hunt meets David Slater, who takes up the position next week The job of policing new environmental controls over a large section of British industry will be taken over next week by David Slater, a consultant from the private sector. He succeeds Frank Feates, who is retiring as chief inspector of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution. HMIP is implementing a new system of integrated pollution control (IPC), which some companies fear will require them to shoulder a heavy financial burden in order to meet the new standards. This programme commenced on April 1 and will be introduced in stages. The engineering and chemical industries have been particularly concerned about the introduction of Batneec (which stands for the 'best available techniques not entailing excessive cost'). It is the central part of the new system of pollution control. Big plants such as engineering and chemical works and refineries will be obliged to conform with Batneec by introducing tougher measures over the next four years. Industry has complained that it has little information on what this will mean in practice for specific processes and has been alarmed that it could entail heavy capital investment. But Slater believes Batneec should be seen as a positive way of improving standards so that environmental damage can be avoided. He sees Batneec and the Environmental Protection Act as 'very good conceptually, a great advance pointing the way that legislation will be going in the rest of the world'. He is also confident that the 'green' message is getting through to business and industry. 'In some of these big companies you are starting to see the effect,' he says. 'There is a big emphasis on management improving the safety of their processes. It is in the company's interests to be viewed as environmentally friendly. It is a big commercial advantage.' From experience, Slater has seen what can happen when things go wrong at large industrial plants. He is a founding director of Technica, consultant scientists and engineers, where he has worked on environmental studies and risk assessment. Previously he was with Cremer and Warner, consulting engineers. He has been involved in studying the huge chemical explosion at Flixborough, Humberside, which killed 29 people in 1974, the chemical plant accident at Seveso, Italy, the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal, India, and a study on the Exxon Valdez disaster. He believes that industry has learnt the lessons of these events and has developed a range of management tools such as risk analysis, environmental impact assessments and environmental audits. 'There is no such thing as a completely pollution free or completely safe process. But you can minimise the risk through good design. There has been a big push towards quality in industrial processes. If you improve quality it is a safer company, a cleaner company and it makes a profit.' The UK Government has been under attack for failing to provide enough staff and resources for the inspectorate to carry out its enhanced role. Integrated pollution control means that the branches of the old inspectorates covering pollution of air, water and land have been merged into one organisation embracing all these areas. There has been some in-fighting between the different disciplines as the new There have also been complaints that salaries have been inadequate to attract staff of sufficient quality. But the Government has now increased staffing and salaries and Feates will hand over the inspectorate to Slater in better shape than when he took over. Slater believes that salaries, up to Pounds 32,900 for a new inspector are now competitive with outside industry. When jobs were advertised recently more than 600 applications poured in. 'These are very encouraging signs,' he says. He is confident that morale has improved at the inspectorate. 'It has to be professional, credible, competent and independent and I am sure it is going to be that way. 'There are a lot of very good inspectors out there at the sharp end. They have the industrial expertise and they know what the problems and practicalities are.' The inspectorate is to be given agency status so that it can operate more flexibly and at arm's length from government. Slater welcomes this: 'It makes a lot of sense, it is a natural evolution.' He is cautious, however, over suggestions that Britain might eventually need a powerful independent agency to act as a 'green' policeman along the lines of the US Environmental Protection Agency. In recent years Slater has been in charge of Technica's US operation and his experience has made him sceptical of importing the US model. He found the American system to be adversarial and believes the mechanisms now being introduced by the Government may fit better into the British scene. He emphasises that the inspectorate is prepared to listen to the problems of industry but cannot take on the role of a commercial consultancy advising companies. 'That is not good for industry,' he says. 'They have to develop their own expertise.' On the one hand the new pollution control regime has been criticised by some sections of industry for being too tough. On the other it has been attacked by the environmental movement as too weak. Slater is philosophical about this. 'If you do your job properly you may end up being somewhat unpopular with both sides,' he says. 'But at the end of the day the public needs to rely on the credibility and competence of the organisation.'</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ciba-Geigy stages strong advance to SFr1.28bn CIBA-GEIGY, the largest Swiss chemical group, yesterday reported 1991 post-tax profits up 24 per cent to SFr1.28bn (Dollars 847.6m) from SFr1.033bn the previous year. The performance was described as outstanding by Dr Alex Krauer, president and managing director. The outlook remained bright, said Dr Krauer. Both the agriculture and pharmaceuticals operations had made very healthy progress during the first two months of 1992. Currency had been highly favourable for the first quarter of 1992, although this was unlikely to continue throughout the year. During the last two months there had been no sign of improvement in the demand for industrial products, except in the US, where there were some signs of recovery. Last year, the healthcare divisions increased sales 10 per cent in local currencies, while agricultural sales increased 18 per cent. Operating profits in the divisions were respectively up 20 per cent to SFr1.25bn and 15 per cent to SFr507m. Sales at the industrial divisions were 4 per cent down in local currencies, while operating results improved 44 per cent in Swiss francs to SFr349m. Group turnover increased 7 per cent to SFr21bn, from SFr19.7bn, although sales were helped by a strong dollar. On a currency adjusted basis, sales growth was 5 per cent. Dr Krauer also announced proposals to split shares and bearer participation certificates on a five-for-one basis. The company is to issue one new registered share for every 25 old shares of any capital unit category. The company said it expected the price to be equivalent to about two-thirds of the share price at time of issue. Net earnings of Sandoz, another Basle-based pharmaceutical and chemical group, jumped 15 per cent in 1991 to SFr1.1bn on sales up 9 per cent to SFr13.4bn. The dividend is increasing 17 per cent to SFr35 per share and participation certificate. The group said dynamic growth and strict cost control had contributed to the improved profit performance. Excluding currency gains, the sales increase was 7 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] In today's "Conversation from Lany" to be  broadcast on the Czech radio at 1315 GMT, President Vaclav Havel  returns to the vote of no confidence in [Slovak] Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar's government.    [Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has  lasted on the Slovak political scene for some time now. It is  difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is probable  that early elections will take place, and, until then, it is  hoped that some kind of less conspicuous but efficient  government will be formed rather soon, which I imagine will be a  semicaretaker government, one that would bridge the period and  contribute to calming down the situation. It is in the interest  of both the Slovak citizens and all of us who are not  indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (3): New eyes on the City  -Fund management has the potential to be big business MANAGING funds for charities suddenly showed the potential to be a big business this year. City fund managers, anxious to find a new source of funds, are offering radically improved packages for charities, while the charities themselves, in some cases jolted into action by divestment from the Official Custodian for Charities, are looking at the City with new eyes. But fund managers are keeping a sense of proportion. Estimates of the total charities market vary, but it is unquestionably tiny compared with the money invested in segregated pension funds. The annual survey of the top 400 grant-making trusts by the Charities Aid Foundation shows that these bodies control assets of about Pounds 7bn. Total investment in charity fund managers stands at about Pounds 12bn, and total long-term investments controlled by the charity sector account, according to Mr John Harrison, charities director of Lazard Investors, for about Pounds 15bn. By contrast, pension fund money accounts for about Pounds 300bn. Hymans Robertson, the consulting actuaries, calculates that Mercury Asset Management, the biggest manager of segregated pension funds, has Pounds 39.617bn total funds under management. Of this, charities account for only Pounds 978m. Part of the problem in expanding the funds under management is that charities' needs vary much more than those of pension funds. Some are endowed foundations which make grants. These will normally try to make grants out of investment income, leaving the capital to grow. This presents a fund management task wholly different from a fund-raising charity, which has an irregular stream of income, used to finance on-going commitments. Furthermore, certain charities will want their investments constrained by ethical or political criteria, requiring careful monitoring. The fund management needed also varies according to the size of a charity. A large endowed fund, with Pounds 1m or more to invest, probably needs a segregated fund of directly held securities. The small charities which will soon divest from the official custodian typically have large holdings of war loan, or other low-yielding investments, and might be best served by choosing a pooled investment vehicle, or 'common investment fund.' These work in the same way as unit trusts, but with the significant advantage that dividends can be reinvested gross. Divestment has opened up considerable opportunities for these products as the official custodian currently arranges for charities to receive their income gross, but in future charities will need to go through the expensive administrative hassle of paying tax and then reclaiming it. Common investment funds would solve this problem. The market is dominated by the Charities Official Investment Fund, COIF, which is managed by Church, Charity and Local Authority Fund Managers (CCLA). Other players include the Charities Aid Foundation, whose funds are managed by Cazenove, and M&amp;G, a dominant force in the unit trust market. Recent entrants include large fund managers such as Mercury, Schroders and Fleming. The potential influx of money from smaller charities should help to expand the sector. But at the other end, the Wellcome Trust this year made the biggest single injection of charitable funds, following the flotation of part of its holding in Wellcome plc. Wellcome placed Pounds 2.75bn of new funds with eight City managers following an extensive 'beauty parade' of 237 applicants. Companies which did not win a slice of Wellcome's money included Mercury - and James Capel and Morgan Grenfell, which were both existing managers for the charity. The winners included Baillie Gifford and Newton, both relatively small fund managers. Hambros Bank will manage Wellcome's gilt portfolio, while some of the UK's biggest money managers made up the rest of the list: Fleming, Gartmore, Henderson, Phillips &amp; Drew, and Schroder. The sector has also had to adjust to a possible change in the rules governing the assets in which charities can invest. The Charities Act gave the home secretary the power to relax the constraints placed on managers by the Trustee Investment Act 1961. At present this requires a large proportion of investments to be held in gilts and other fixed-interest securities. No changes have yet been announced, and it is ironic that this extra freedom could be introduced just as bonds have come back into favour. For example, Mr John Thornton, of Glasgow-based fund managers Murray Johnstone, believes that few charities will take advantage of the extra opportunities, both because the need for income is important, and because it would be imprudent to have a fund skewed too far towards equities. Mr Martyn Bensley, charity fund director at Robert Fleming, agrees that charity portfolios will typically have a higher element in bonds than other funds, and will also reduce overseas exposure because of exchange rate risks. But the business of charities management is subtle. While many fund managers have set up specialist teams for charity management, some companies with pension fund expertise ask their managers to work on both pensions and charities. This has some attractions as both investments are essentially long-term, risk-averse, and in a tax-free environment. Schroders deliberately asks its charity managers also to work on segregated pension funds, and retains a heavy emphasis on equities, which it says is necessary to protect capital and increase revenue over the long term. Others adopt a different approach. According to Kleinwort Benson, linking pension fund and charity investment is a mistake because charity trustees think in terms of total returns, while charities tend to have a much more precise requirement for income. Mr Mark Summers, senior consultant with James Capel, points out that charitable trustees are usually in position because they have a specific interest or skill in the area concerned; by and large they are financially naive. 'They are very often of a crusading turn of mind, which drives the desire for maximum distributable revenue. Charity trustees as a body are therefore much more akin to private clients than they are to institutional clients.' Also, charitable trustees now seem to have a much wider choice than the average private client.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                       CHARITY FUNDS UNDER MANAGEMENT  -------------------------------------------------------------------                          End-December 1991     End-September 1992                          poundsm               poundsm  ------------------------------------------------------------------- CCLA                     1,328                 n/a Cazenove                 1,141                 1,250 Fleming                  1,047                 1,086 Baring                   931                   978 Mercury                  778                   903 Schroder                 671                   760 Hill Samuel              660                   n/a Morgan Grenfell          634                   969 Foreign and Colonial     480                   539 James Capel              383                   368  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hymans Robertson  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

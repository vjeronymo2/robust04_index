			<p>BFN     [Text] Mmabatho May 21 SAPA -- North West Executive  Commitee member Rocky Malebana Metsing said on Saturday his  administration would not hesitate to confiscate land, without  compensation, from farmers who allowed AWB [Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] activities on  their farms, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  news reports.    Addressing a meeting at Bapong near Brits on Saturday Mr  Metsing, whose portfolio is agriculture, said the government  would not allow farm land to be used for storing weapons or for  training members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging's military  wing.    Referring to people who were forceably removed from their  land under apartheid laws, he said the state would do all in its  power to ensure they got their land back.</p>

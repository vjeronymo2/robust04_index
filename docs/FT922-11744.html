			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Dump Truck shouts foul KONISHIKI, the American sumo wrestler, has swung a heavy punch at the Japan Sumo Association in his efforts to win elevation to yokozuna, the sport's highest rank never yet achieved by a foreigner. In newspaper interviews this week, he has accused the association of 'racism' for denying him promotion, even though he has won three tournaments. The charge, denied by the Sumo Association, could generate friction between the US and Japan, if American politicians choose to take up Konishiki's case. The 262kg Hawaiian, also known as the Dump Truck, said the only reason he had not been made a yokozuna was 'because I'm not Japanese'. The sumo association declined to comment on Konishi's claims. But it said a wrestler's rank was decided by his performance in the ring and race was not a consideration. The latest row over Konishiki's status erupted after he won his third tournament in March. After some deliberation the wrestler was told he would have to wait 'until the next tournament or the tournament after that'. There are no specific standards for promotion, but the sumo promotion committee has considerable discretion. As well as results, it takes into account health and spirit. Konishiki's style irritates some fans because he relies on using his vast bulk to push out rivals. Purists argue this demeans the sport and a true yokozuna should have a better range of throws and thrusts. There have also been suggestions that foreigners cannot be yokozuna because they cannot appreciate the significance of sumo in Japanese culture.</p>

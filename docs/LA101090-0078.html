			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW OFF 78; PROGRAM TRADING, OIL-RELATED SELLOFF WREAK HAVOC  </P> <P> Wall Street, in a renewed selloff Tuesday, sent scores of stocks to their  lowest prices in more than a year as pessimism soared.  </P> <P> The 30-share Dow Jones industrial average index closed down 78.22 at 2,445.54,  a drop of 3.1%. It was the worst fall since a 93-point drop on Aug. 6.  </P> <P> In the broader market, losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in New  York Stock Exchange trading, with 1,313 down, 288 up and 388 unchanged. Big  Board volume totaled 145.61 million shares, up from 99.47 million shares  Monday.  </P> <P> The market was lower for most of the day, and then fell sharply on a frantic  bout of selling in the last hour as computer-trading programs kicked in.  </P> <P> "Programs were going absolutely whacko," one trader said.  </P> <P> Underlying the day's decline was a sharp rise in oil on Mideast turmoil,  raising fears of inflation and widespread skepticism about federal budget  talks. Those worries helped send interest rates soaring. (Main story, A1.)  </P> <P>  Action in the Senate and House -- both of which passed a general budget  resolution Monday and left their committees to work out the details -- did  nothing to calm fears about the economy.  </P> <P> Worries that upcoming third-quarter profit reports will be dismal also added to  the slide, particularly after a poor report from Motorola. That stock skidded 7  to 52 3/4 after reporting earnings per share of 78 cents in the third quarter,  versus the expected 90 cents to $1 a share.  </P> <P> Also suffering major hits on earnings disappointments were Dow Jones, down 2  5/8 to 20 1/8; Whirlpool, off 2 to 18 5/8; and Consolidated Papers, off 7/8 to  32 1/8. Whirlpool and Consolidated were just two of many stocks hitting new  52-week lows. On the NYSE, 191 stocks hit new 52-week lows, versus 96 on  Monday.  </P> <P> Among other market highlights:  </P> <P> * Many recent market leaders fell sharply, raising worries about a new surge in  bearishness. (Market Beat column, D3.)  </P> <P> * Big losers among industrial stocks included Alcoa, down 2 1/8 to 59 3/4;  Ford, off 1 3/4 to 31; Caterpillar, off 2 1/4 to 39 3/4, and Grace, down 1 3/4  to 18 7/8.  </P> <P> * Consumer stocks also were dashed, including Gap, down 1 3/8 to 44 1/8; light  fixture maker Dynasty Classics, off 2 1/4 to 5 1/4, and General Mills, down 2  3/4 to 80 1/2.  </P> <P> * Sears closed down 1 1/4 at 25 1/4 after a Kidder, Peabody analyst reduced his  third-quarter earnings estimate for the retailer.  </P> <P> * After falling 11 1/2 Monday, UAL Corp. dropped 3 1/4 to 88. The company's  board rejected a buyout offer by an employee-led group.  </P> <P> * Travelers, which has been sliding since Friday, when it announced that it  would cut its dividend by a third and increase its reserves against real estate  losses, dropped another 1 3/8 to 13.  </P> <P> * Countering the general trend, shares of drug maker Upjohn rose 1 to 37 3/4 on  vague takeover speculation.  </P> <P> * General Cinema gained 3/4 to 18 1/8 on news that it sold its 17% stake in  Cadbury. Neiman Marcus gained 3/4 to 11 7/8 on speculation that General Cinema  might now bid for the 40% of Neiman it doesn't own.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks fell as investors took profits after two sessions of gains.  The key Nikkei 225-share index closed down 134.89 at 23,495.11.  </P> <P> In London, share prices fell sharply on concerns that had dogged the London  market before sterling's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. The  Financial Times 100-share index closed down 67.5 at 2,134.1.  </P> <P> Share prices fell sharply in West Germany, with the the 30-share DAX index  dropping 32.12, or 2.2%, to 1,433.41.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Bond Traders Buried in Worry; Prices Fall  </P> <P> Bond prices also plunged on the soaring price of oil and increasing investor  pessimism about interest rates and the ability of Congress to pass a meaningful  budget agreement. There was also concern about an oversupply of government  bonds, with two auctions planned this week and the Treasury's quarterly  refunding sale next month.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 1-25/32, or about $17.81 per  $1,000 in face amount. Its yield soared to 8.96% from 8.81% late Monday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.063%, up from 7.938% late Friday. The fed funds rate  from Monday wasn't available because of the Columbus Day holiday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Foreign Money Sales Ease Dollar's Drop  </P> <P> The dollar finished mostly lower on world markets, but selloffs in other  currencies prevented its decline from deepening.  </P> <P> The dollar fell sharply in Asian dealings, hitting new lows against the German  mark and 18-month lows against the Japanese yen before consolidating and  recovering slightly when trading shifted to Europe and the United States, said  Marc Chandler, an analyst with the consulting firm IDEA.  </P> <P> Traders cashed in on the weekend run-up in the British pound and the yen, and  their profit taking prevented the dollar from relinquishing further ground.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 129.95 yen. Later in London, it  was quoted higher at 130.30 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 130.25 yen,  down from 130.48 yen on Monday.  </P> <P> The British pound, which soared Monday after its official entry into the  European exchange rate mechanism, closed at $1.973, down slightly from Monday's  $1.976.  </P> <P> Against the German mark, the dollar closed at 1.523, down from Monday's 1.531.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Rumors of Soviet Sale Undercuts Gold  </P> <P> Gold prices declined sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange amid fears of a  massive Soviet gold selloff, analysts said.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, grains and soybeans were mixed, and meat and  livestock futures were slightly higher.  </P> <P> Gold settled $4.80 to $5.30 lower, with the contract for delivery in October at  $389.70 an ounce. Silver settled 7.7 to 8.5 cents lower, with October at $4.59  an ounce.  </P> <P> Prices of precious metals futures, which usually follow the energy futures  market, plummeted after traders began selling off on rumors that the  cash-strapped Soviet Union is expected to sell off a good quantity of its gold  supply to finance recent purchases of grains and other goods.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DMV OPENS ITS FIRST DRIVE-THROUGH WINDOW  </P> <P> The Department of Motor Vehicles opened its first drive-through window this  week at its Van Nuys office.  </P> <P> The window is designed for people with simple needs, such as picking up forms  and pamphlets and vehicle registration, and offers a way to cut down on lines  inside the office, said DMV Director Del Pierce.  </P> <P> But DMV officials conceded the drive-through idea has some drawbacks, not the  least of which is that few things at the DMV are simple. The office faces the  ugly possibility that a string of cars will be backed up at the window as their  drivers try to work out their DMV problems. Pierce acknowledged that the South  Coast Air Quality Management District's ambitious clean-air plan could spell  the end of all drive-through windows, including the one at the DMV.  </P></p>

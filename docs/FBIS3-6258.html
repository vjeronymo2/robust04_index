			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] It has been revealed that concerning construction  projects at the U.S. Forces Japan [USFJ] Atsugi base, the U.S.  Government has notified the Japanese Government of its intention  to demand that 73 Japanese construction companies pay a total of  1.1 billion yen in compensation for its having been forced to  pay unreasonably high construction costs as a result of bid  rigging among major Japanese construction companies.    According to the message, the U.S. Government has been  unjustly forced to pay unusually high costs for the construction  of facilities at the USFJ Atsugi base in Kanagawa Prefecture  between 1984 and 1990 because major Japanese construction  companies engaged in bid rigging. It is reported that the U.S.  Government therefore intends to demand about 1.1 billion yen in  compensation from 73 construction companies which were involved  in the construction projects.    In this regard, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said at  a  news conference following a cabinet meeting this morning that  although it is the job of the Fair Trade Commission to determine  whether there was bid rigging, the Construction Ministry, for  its part, will immediately investigate the matter. Igarashi,  however, brushed aside concerns that this situation might refuel  bilateral construction frictions, saying that it would not  affect future bilateral ties because Japan presented the United  States with measures last January to improve foreign access to  Japanese construction markets, including the revision of bidding  procedures, and that the two nations managed to reach an accord.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry feels the United States is  not linking the bid rigging issue to the ongoing bilateral  economic disputes because this matter is strictly a civil issue.</p>

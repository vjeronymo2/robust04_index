			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) on Monday [25 April] appealed to the  new government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to review the rate  of consumption tax.    The federation also urged the government to take positive  economic measures, including an increase of investment on public  works projects by more than 100 trillion yen over the next  decade.    It said the appeal was contained in a proposal timed to Hata  becoming prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosokawa who  stepped down over questions about financial impropriety.    The proposal also called for early enactment of the fiscal  1994 budget which is up for parliamentary approval and  readjusting the yen's exchange rates against other currencies at  optimum levels.    The proposal also expressed hope that the government will  take action to remove economic frictions with the United States  and other countries to overcome the recession.    The federation also urged the government to reduce income  and  corporate taxes by reforming the tax system and carrying out  thorough deregulation in real estate transactions, housing,  communication and information, and distribution sectors.</p>

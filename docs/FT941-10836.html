			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Costa Rican victor attacks free market The narrow victor in Costa Rica's presidential election said free market policies had impoverished the country. He vowed to tackle poverty and improve health and education services, writes David Scanlan in San Jose. In one of the closest presidential elections in the country's history, Mr Jose Mara Figueres, 39, of the left-of-centre National Liberation party, defeated Mr Miguel Angel Rodrguez, 54, of the ruling Social Christian Unity party on Sunday. The winner polled 49.7 per cent, just 2.2 percentage points ahead of his rival, according to preliminary official results. 'We've had enough of the neo-liberal policies that have impoverished Costa Rica,' Mr Figueres told thousands of jubilant supporters at party headquarters in San Jose. 'We will govern for those who have had less and need more,' said Mr Figueres, a former agriculture minister and graduate of Harvard University and West Point military academy in the US. The president-elect will take office on May 8. Mr Figueres said during the campaign he wanted to renegotiate agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But political analysts see little room for manoeuvre. A new round of economic reforms must be approved by the legislative assembly and the government needs financial support from the institutions. 'I think you'll see some cosmetic changes,' said Mr Carlos Sojo, a political analyst with Flacso, a Costa Rican think-tank. 'But a part of (the adjustment policies) is inevitable.' For example, Mr Figueres might halt plans to sell the state-owned insurance and telecommunications services, but still open the industries to private competition, Mr Sojo said. Mr Figueres told a news conference yesterday that sale of the state insurance institute would only go ahead if 'it was good for Costa Ricans'. 'I think you'll see Figueres continue with the structural adjustment policies, but with a greater emphasis on social programmes to soften the blow,' said Mr Victor Borge, a Costa Rican pollster.</p>

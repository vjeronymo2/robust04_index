			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The murders of seven Russian servicemen committed in  Tajikistan last week are a result of "a cold-blooded campaign  planned in advance," said the commander of Russian frontier  troops stationed in Tajikistan, Lt.-General Anatoliy Chechulin.  IF Note: Sevem servicemen have been killed in Dushanbe in the  past few days. The latest victim was Lt.-Colonel Sergey  Leontikov, who was murdered Saturday [4 June] morning in a  residential area of the Tajik capital.    "These brutal, well-organized and purposeful crimes pose the  start of methodical terror against Russian servicemen,"  Chechulin told a news conference in Dushanbe. He accused a  leading member of the Tajik opposition and Islamic Revival  Movement, Akbar Turajonzoda, and the head of the so-called  "government in exile", Said Abdullo Nuri, of having provoked  these actions.    Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-General Georgiy  Kondratyev, also explained the series of terrorist acts with the  unwillingness of the hard-line opposition to "give up its  intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including  military measures." According to the general, at the moment the  opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border  with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan.    Russia's 201st motorized infantry division stationed in  Tajikistan, in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and  Tajik armed forces, is capable of stopping any military actions  launched by the opposition within Tajikistan and from  neighboring Afghanistan, Kondratyev said.    Chechulin demanded that Tajikistan's law-enforcement  agencies  investigate the murders without delay.    Earlier First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik parliament,  Abdulmajid Dostiev, tried to assure Interfax's correspondent  that there are no political grounds for the murders of Russian  servicemen. According to him, these are purely criminal  offences, and the authorities are doing their best to find those  who committed them.    Some observers link Dushanbe's unwillingness to accept the  version of political terror with its reluctance to aggravate  relations with the opposition on the eve of another round of  inter-Tajik talks which is to take place in Tehran on 14 June.    In the meantime spokesmen for the opposition Movement for  Islamic Revival (MIR) qualified the Russian officials'  assertions as to the involvement of the Tajik opposition in the  terrorist acts as conflicting with reality.    In its statement released on Monday the movement said:  "Certain circles are used to blame everything on the opposition.  The acts of terror and violence committed in Dushanbe and other  areas of Tajikistan reflect the intrigues of those forces which  are not interested in a peaceful solution to the conflict, and  which seek to hinder the process of talks. It's they who  unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for the purpose of seizing  power, not for the purpose of restoring peace, law and order."    The statement points out that the Tajik opposition would  like  Russia to be "more impartial and neutral toward the conflicting  sides."    The MIR welcomed Russia's suggestion that the opposition  should join political reforms, such as debates on a new  constitution, underway in Tajikistan. "However it's practically  impossible to implement this initiative in the present  circumstances. If a new constitution is adopted at submachine  gun point, without the participation of about one million  refugees, we will not recognize it," the statement points out.  According to the MIR, "at first we must settle the conflict  politically, ensure return for all the refugees, guarantee  freedom of the press, speech, political parties and movements,  and begin to discuss a new constitution nationwide in order to  adopt it only after that."</p>

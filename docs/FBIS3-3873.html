Mayor Li told a press conference that the bonded capital  goods market will become a national market where prices are  about five to ten percent lower than those on the world market.    Foreign investors in China can buy whatever imported  products  they need in Shenzhen instead of going abroad so as to lower  production costs, he added.    The Shenzhen bonded capital goods market has 12 affiliates  specializing in various kinds of capital goods, with a total  transaction reaching 400 million U.S. dollars in 1993.    The opening of the market, he said, will help bring the role  of the city as a coastal special economic zone and an economic  information center into fuller play.</p>

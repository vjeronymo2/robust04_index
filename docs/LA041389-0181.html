			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> 13-DAY TRIP FIELDS YAHOO AND DORADO, BUT BIG TUNA ESCAPE  </P> <P> There was excitement at 22nd Street Landing in San Pedro last week when the  Deluxe returned from a 13-day trip to Clarion Island 200 miles north of Cabo  San Lucas.  </P> <P> Trolling for wahoo and dorado resulted in big catches.  </P> <P> On one stop there was suddenly a huge swirl of water as bluefin tuna broke the  water.  </P> <P> Anglers dashed for heavier tackle, but the tuna refused the bait and fish  weighing only 15 to 25 pounds were decked. Capt. Chuck Ellis said anchovy bait  would have raised the catch.  </P> <P> Mike Odnell of Torrance, trolling with a mackerel, had a marlin strike. After a  45-minute fight the fish, estimated at 400 pounds, broke off.  </P> <P> Robert Gerber of Hawthorne hooked and released a 140-pound marlin.  </P> <P> Bob Milleson of Palos Verdes had a good catch of wahoo, dorado and tuna, as did  Norman Woodruff of Redondo Beach and Delbert Marcus of Long Beach.  </P> <P> The total count of the long trip was 217 wahoo, 54 dorado and 14 tuna.  </P> <P> Joe Martinez of Wilmington, fishing from his boat the Antelope, brought to gaff  a big halibut. Not possessing a scale, he headed to 22nd Street Landing and the  flattie weighed in at 35 pounds.  </P> <P> Catches of spotfin croaker set the pace for surf anglers over the weekend.  </P> <P> Ray Hawks of Torrance fished the surf at Dockweiler Beach and caught a limit of  four- to five-pound fish.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Bret Janus of Long Beach, fishing Catalina Island on the Aztec, pulled a  yellowtail out of the kelp and won the whopper of the week -- 28 pounds.  </P> <P> Frank Ivanho of Gardena won the jackpot aboard the Grande at Cherry Bank with a  27 1/4-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Bob Taft of San Pedro, aboard the Topgun, brought a 20-pound yellowtail out of  the rocks at Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Bill Merrill of San Pedro, fishing at Cherry Bank aboard the Explorer, won the  jackpot with an 18-pound salmon grouper.  </P> <P> Gum Baiz of Hermosa Beach, on the Redondo Special at Twin Roads, caught a  15-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> During the recent heat wave the higher water temperature was reflected in  catches of barracuda and bonito from Horseshoe Kelp to Rocky Point.  </P> <P> Catalina anglers saw plenty of yellowtail but few bait-takers. Limits of bonito  made up most of the island's catches.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the rock reefs and anglers  caught 57 sand bass, four halibut and two bonito.  </P> <P> The Del Mar worked the Venice Beach area and anglers sacked 210 sculpin and 36  barracuda.  </P> <P> The Happyman tried the bay and returned from a half-day trip with 125 mackerel  and five halibut.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Southern Cal worked Twin Roads and claimed 244  sand bass, eight rockfish, four halibut and three mackerel.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special took a half-day trip to Hermosa Flats and anglers landed 23  halibut and 14 sculpin.  </P> <P> The barge Isle of Redondo was invaded by mackerel and fishermen caught 510,  plus 120 rockfish.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo, on two half-day trips, chalked up 241  sand bass and 188 sculpin.  </P> <P> The First String on the last rock cod trip of the spring to Cherry Bank  returned with 600 rockfish and 10 lingcod.  </P> <P> At L.A.

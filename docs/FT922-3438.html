			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Algeria frees Moslem activists ALGERIA has freed 2,000 suspected Moslem activists from detention centres in the Sahara desert to mark the feast of Eid al-Adha, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Algiers. About 1,200 people have been freed from the centres since March 21, out of the 7,448 detained under a state of emergency declared on February 9, official figures show. The official news agency APS said there would be further releases. Human rights groups have demanded the closure of the desert detention centres. Suspected Moslem activists were rounded up after riots blamed on the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was poised to take power in a general election cancelled in January and has since been banned by court order. Meanwhile, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, head of state, appealed to Algerians to join his Patriotic Rally - a new movement which excludes Moslem radical groups and which the authorities hope will undermine their support. Mr Boudiaf dismissed calls from two leading political parties, the Socialist Forces Front and National Liberation Front, to replace the government with one of national unity.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRIENDS TAKE A PIECE OF ZEKE'S DUNG HEAP  </P> <P> A light drizzle Monday disrupted plans by Mountain View Cemetery to begin  hauling away Zeke the Sheik's Gargantuan dung heap.  </P> <P> But it didn't discourage dozens of Zeke's friends and amateur gardeners from  coming by for their own piece of the pile.  </P> <P> All morning, well-wishers were lined up in front of the 30-foot-high mound next  to Zeke's Altadena farmhouse, hoping to salvage some of the steamy soil.  </P> <P> Some paused to sign a petition describing the one-acre jungle of fruits and  cacti fueled by the fertilizer as "an educational experience." Others shelled  out a few bucks for T-shirts featuring a photograph of Zeke, the alter ego of  47-year-old Timothy Dundon.  </P> <P> Cemetery officials, who years ago gave Dundon permission to spread the fecund  mass atop one of their vacant lots, said they will send out a work crew to haul  away what is left of the compost pile as soon as the weather breaks.  </P></p>

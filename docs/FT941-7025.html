			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam braced forvolatile trading ahead - Outlook still optimistic Jitters about interest rates have put a temporary halt to recent rises on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Analysts are confident that the upward trend will resume in spite of this month's upheavals. But they also expect a volatile few weeks ahead as the market examines annual results for 1993 and corporate predictions for 1994 against a background of nervous worldwide equity trading. Amsterdam's prospects are underpinned by the cost-cutting carried out by major companies since the early 1990s, putting them in a good position to benefit from global economic recovery. At the same time, the economy, which never slipped into recession like Germany, seems on course for growth of 1 per cent in 1994 and 2.5 per cent in 1995. Inflation is expected to remain at just 2 per cent. As always with the stock exchange, however, the strong international orientation of its biggest companies makes it especially vulnerable to external risks, such as a tightening in US monetary policy and fears of Russian instability. Amsterdam has been thrown off balance since the US Federal Reserve's increase in interest rates on February 4. Concern about interest rates is understandable because the bourse's sharp gains of 1993 and early 1994 were driven mainly by the resolute decline in worldwide interest rates. The AEX index, which surged by 45 per cent to a record 414.27 in 1993, added a further 6 per cent to finish January at 438.71. February's bout of nerves have erased most of last month's gains, and the index closed yesterday at 415.64. Nervousness about interest rates has not prompted Dutch banks to make any changes to their forecasts for the stock market, which call for further gains in 1994 after the spectacular surge of 1993. Unlike 1993, however, the upward trend this year is expected to be punctuated by periodic and more volatile corrections. In its latest stock market survey, ABN Amro stands by its previous prediction that the AEX index will stand above 450 by the end of June. It notes that this will come despite the ex-dividend period that traditionally takes place in May. Other banks and stockbrokers are also sticking by their predictions of rises ahead. The consensus is that the wider CBS All-Share Index will rise to 310 by year-end, compared with around 288 yesterday. Some caution that the rises may not come until the second half. With short-term interest rates already very low, the influence of interest rates will wane later in 1994 as room for cuts disappears. Expected improvements in corporate profits, which are forecast for 1994 and especially for 1995, are then expected to take over as the main motor behind further gains. Mr Heinie Hakker of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam says: 'The Dutch business community has been working hard on rationalising in order to adjust to more competitive conditions. The market is looking to see this translated into profits.' This week, the 1993 corporate reporting season got under way in earnest, with annual results from Unilever, Royal Dutch/Shell, Hagemeyer and Akzo, among others. The picture so far is coloured by the negative reaction to Unilever, which yesterday had fallen to Fl 213.70 after unveiling results on Tuesday, a week's decline of 5 per cent. Royal Dutch fell by Fl 6.00 to Fl 202.70 on Thursday after announcing only a slight rise in 1993 profits, closing yesterday at Fl 201.70. Both companies' results were affected by restructuring charges. Together, the two account for well over 60 per cent of market cap, and they exert a preponderant influence both over sentiment and the market's indices. But they are hardly representative of the bourse as a whole, and interest is focused particularly on the more cyclical companies and what they say about the profit outlook for 1994. Akzo was rewarded yesterday for its better-than-expected fourth quarter results with a strong rise in its share price to just below Fl 214, recouping practically all of the previous day's sharp losses. The company said it now expected 'positive' developments in 1994, thanks in part to the fact that it believed the recession in Europe had bottomed out. Brokers' recommendations and Hoogovens' successful rights issue in late 1993 helped push up the company's shares to a 12-month high of Fl 64.70 on February 10. They have since fallen back to Fl 59.40, but analysts say there is room for further gains, particularly if aluminium prices stabilise. Mr Fokko Tuin, an analyst at Kempen &amp; Co in Amsterdam, said the importance of corporate earnings as a market factor may not emerge until September, when first-half figures are published and anticipation about 1995 develops. 'In 1995 some of the cyclical companies could show big jumps in profits,' he said. He too believes Amsterdam will rise during 1994. Subscriptions for the partial privatisation of KPN, the state-owned telecommunications and postal company, open in early June. The company, with an estimated total market capitalisation of up to Fl 22bn, would rank third in size behind Royal Dutch and Unilever.</p>

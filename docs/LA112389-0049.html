			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANTELOPE VALLEY DELIVERS 'REPORT CARD' ON HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT'S PARENTS ARE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTY TO BENEFIT FROM A  NEW STATE LAW REQUIRING EVALUATIONS.  </P> <P> Parents of high school students in the Antelope Valley this week will become  the first in Los Angeles County to get annual report cards assessing the  performance of their children's schools, the result of a new statewide  requirement.  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley Union High School District on Wednesday began mailing out  nearly 8,600 "school accountability report cards" it prepared in compliance  with a provision of Proposition 98, which was narrowly approved by state voters  in November, 1988.  </P> <P> The proposition, sponsored by the California Teachers Assn. and other education  groups, was intended to channel more state money into schools and carried the  "report card" provision as an added inducement for voters.  </P> <P> It required every public school, from elementary to high school, to prepare an  annual report covering 13 areas of school performance, including student test  scores, dropout rates, class sizes, spending per student, textbook quality,  counseling services, teacher data, and school safety and cleanliness.  </P> <P> State and local school officials said they believe the Antelope Valley district  is the first in Los Angeles County and one of only several districts statewide  to distribute the reports. Other districts must follow suit before the end of  the school year next spring.  </P> <P> The Antelope Valley reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the district's  six campuses. "I think we're very happy with them for a first go-around," said  Robert Sanchez, the district's assistant superintendent for educational  services.  </P> <P> The four-page reports vary somewhat from school to school. But all generally  give a positive, although not always telling, picture of the campuses.  </P> <P> For instance, among the six school reports, only one mentioned gangs. However,  concern about school security and mounting gang problems have dominated the  debate among district board members for months and one campus had a gang melee  recently. The district is considering adopting a tough anti-gang student dress  code and a host of security measures.  </P> <P> The last paragraph of the report on Antelope Valley High School noted,  "Although the school is thought to be safe in general, there is a growing  insecurity among the staff and students about the number of gang members and  outbreaks of fights."  </P> <P> Sanchez, who oversaw the preparation of the reports, acknowledged the lack of  discussion about gang problems but insisted the district was not trying to  gloss over the issue.  </P> <P> He characterized this year's version "as basically a numbers report card" and  promised that next year's would have "a more comprehensive approach to school  climate and safety. It was not an intent to escape the issue entirely."  </P> <P> On other topics, the reports addressed the district's problems with  overcrowding, high dropout rates and a shortage of substitute teachers. They  detailed district efforts to deal with those issues. They also referred to  increases in students test scores, which generally improved throughout the  district.  </P> <P> Under state guidelines, school districts must produce the reports and make them  available to parents or others upon request. Districts are not required to send  them out. But Sanchez said his district chose to mail them so they would be  seen by as many parents as possible.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the country with  more than 600 schools, will not release its reports until early April, said  Joan Evans, an administrative consultant for the district. And Los Angeles,  like many larger districts, does not plan to mail out the reports because of  the cost and work involved, Evans said.  </P> <P> Originally, many school officials were unhappy about the added burden of  producing the annual reports, which all schools must release in November in  future years. But many have come to see the reports as a way to bolster needed  public support for school issues, education officials said.  </P></p>

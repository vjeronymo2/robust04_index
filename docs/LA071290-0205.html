			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RIPPLE EFFECT OF COCHELL'S RESIGNATION REACHES CAPE COD;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: SOME OKLAHOMA PLAYERS ON SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM NO LONGER WISH TO  BE SOONERS.  </P> <P> The days of thunder have passed for the Cal State Fullerton baseball team,  which was rocked last week by the resignation of Coach Larry Cochell, who went  to the University of Oklahoma and took coveted pitching coach Vern Ruhle with  him.  </P> <P> But Jason Hutchins, a former Golden West College and Woodbridge High School  pitcher who signed with the Titans last spring, has found himself amid another  storm -- far away from Fullerton or Norman, Okla. -- that was spawned by  Cochell's move.  </P> <P> Hutchins is playing in the Cape Cod Summer League for the Wareham (Mass.)  Gatemen, a team that is coached by outgoing Sooner assistant Jim Fleming and  includes five players with Oklahoma ties -- three Sooners, one would-be Sooner  and one was-going-to-be-a Sooner.  </P> <P> But now make that two don't-want-to-be Sooners and one who isn't sure.  </P> <P> "I'm right in the thick of it," Hutchins said.  </P> <P> Hutchins, who went 6-3 with a 3.31 earned-run average for the Rustlers last  season, isn't sure if he will be in the thick of Fullerton's pitching rotation  next season.  </P> <P> He said there's a "40%" chance he will honor his commitment to Fullerton,  though the right-hander added he will wait to see who replaces Cochell and  Ruhle before he makes his decision.  </P> <P> "It depends on if I can get released from my letter of intent and if there's  scholarship money at Oklahoma," Hutchins said. "And it also depends on who the  new coach is. But Vern Ruhle was the reason I went to Fullerton."  </P> <P> If Hutchins winds up at Oklahoma, he would be the second Titan signee to  transfer. Villa Park High pitcher Todd Blyleven, son of Angel Bert Blyleven,  said last week he will follow Ruhle.  </P> <P> And USC sophomore Mike Smedes, a former Laguna Hills High pitcher who was  released from his scholarship so he could go to Fullerton, may be a Sooner real  soon.  </P> <P> "If the scholarship money is there, I'll definitely go to Oklahoma," Smedes  said. "If it's not, I'll have to talk it over with my parents."  </P> <P> Tony Darden, a UCLA sophomore who was released from his scholarship so he could  pitch for the Titans next year, also is awaiting word from Cochell on  scholarship funds.  </P> <P> Reports of these players heading East have stirred things up at Cape Cod. Of  Hutchins' five Oklahoma-related teammates, two are veering away from the  program and one is in limbo.  </P> <P> Mike Hickey, who started at shortstop as a Sooner freshman, asked Cochell for  his release Wednesday. Scott Watkins, a pitcher from Seminole (Okla.) Junior  College who was leaning toward Oklahoma, signed with Oklahoma State Sunday.  </P> <P> Doug Walker, a pitcher from Conners (Okla.) State Junior College who signed  with the Sooners, said he hasn't made up his mind whether he will go to  Oklahoma. Two more of Hutchins' teammates, pitchers Steve Dean and Bert Inman,  will remain at Oklahoma.  </P> <P> "They're worried that Cochell is going to bring in California guys and that  they're going to lose their scholarships," Hutchins said.  </P> <P> Cochell maintains he will not pull scholarships from present Oklahoma players  and that if funds aren't available, transfers such as Blyleven may have to pay  out-of-state tuition until they can secure scholarships.  </P> <P> All the movement has put Hutchins in an awkward situation on his summer team.  He is friends with the Oklahoma players, but for him to gain a scholarship,  some Sooners will have to leave.  </P> <P> "It has been an interesting summer here," Hutchins said. "I've told the  pitchers to stay because of Vern Ruhle, but some of them are too worried to  even give them (new coaches) a chance."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the search for Cochell's successor has begun. Fullerton has  advertised the position, and associate athletic director Steve DiTolla said a  selection committee should be formed within the next two weeks. He hopes to  have a coach by early August.  </P> <P> Former Titan Coach Augie Garrido, who is now at Illinois, has expressed  interest in returning but has not made contact with Fullerton officials.  Riverside City College Coach Dennis Rogers, a former Titan assistant under  Cochell, has applied, and USC assistant Bill Hughes will also apply, according  to Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie.  </P> <P> Other coaches who have shown interest in the position are Chris Smith of Loyola  Marymount, George Horton of Cerritos, Don Sneddon of Rancho Santiago and Titan  assistant Fred Hoover. Bill Kernan of Cal State Northridge is expected to be a  candidate but is on vacation and couldn't be reached.  </P> <P> Cochell said most of the players returning from last season's College World  Series team, including pitchers James Popoff and Bill Fitzgerald, infielders  Phil Nevin and Steve Sisco, catchers Matt Hattabaugh and Frank Charles and  outfielder David Ayala will remain at Fullerton.  </P> <P> However, three recruits -- Golden West outfielder Frank Herman, Mater Dei  outfielder Jim Betzold and Estancia pitcher Greg Brannis -- say they won't  finalize plans until a new coach is named.  </P></p>

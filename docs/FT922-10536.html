			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Social Europe: Brussels may force clock watchers into a re-think - The implications for British companies and their workers of the EC directive on working time ABOUT 2m British workers who work more than 48 hours each week, and the thousands of companies they work for, may have to re-think radically if European Community employment ministers today reach outline agreement on the EC working time directive. If agreement is not reached today it will come at the ministers' meeting in June and, although the government is likely to oppose it, the directive may become part of UK law within months. The 'opt-out' from the next stage of EC employment legislation won by the government at the Maastricht summit was too late to fend off the directive. Because it has been introduced under health and safety legislation, it requires only a qualified majority - at least one other big EC country plus a small one, or three smaller countries, must side with the UK to block it. British officials believe there is a new willingness to do a deal with the UK, especially with Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary in the chair, and that a high degree of flexibility in implementing the directive might be allowed at national level. The UK's preferred option is to allow work over 48 hours provided people have passed a health risk assessment. If the UK government is not satisfied with the outcome, it will probably launch a legal challenge to the health and safety basis of the directive. Alternatively, it may simply refuse to implement the directive and wait for the EC Commission to take it to the European Court of Justice. Either way, there is no certainty that the UK would win. The directive includes: A ceiling on the working week of 48 hours including overtime, averaged within a reference period, likely to be set at four months. A minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, with Sunday 'in principle' treated as a day of rest. That principle can be broken with impunity but is still unpopular with the UK government because of the support it gives to the anti-Sunday trading lobby. Minimum annual paid holiday of four weeks - three weeks for the first three years of the directive. Some groups of workers, including managers, the self-employed and transport workers, are exempt from the directive and there are 'derogations' for other groups that allow particular measures such as the 48-hour week to be breached but insist on 'compensatory rest'. The proposals - particularly the 48-hour limit - would seem a classic case of the EC's legislative norms being imposed upon the UK's more flexible system of industrial relations. Almost all other EC countries, apart from the Irish Republic and Denmark, have had detailed legislation in those areas for decades. Partly as a result, there is a much stronger convergence of working time in other EC countries and far fewer people working more than 48 hours. The EC's average working week is close to 40 hours, but 36 per cent of workers in the UK work between 35 and 40 hours a week, compared with 72 per cent in the rest of the community. The UK has a much higher incidence of part-time work and of long hours - for full-time workers, the UK has the longest average working week in the EC at 45.5 hours. British workers also do more overtime and more shift-work than those elsewhere in the EC. A total of 2.7m British employees - 11.7 per cent of the workforce - regularly work more than 48 hours per week, far more than elsewhere else in the EC. There is a high concentration among particular groups of workers - rail workers, farm workers, crane drivers, food industry workers - mainly as a result of high overtime. But Department of Employment economists say there is a sprinkling of over-48-hour working in almost all industries. The cost to British industry of maintaining output while complying with the directive is impossible to calculate. The government's estimate of Pounds 5bn - of which Pounds 3.5bn comes from the 48-hour limit - is very rough. Some managers say it is good management to cut chronic overtime. Some companies, such as ICI, are not enthusiastic, but say they live with such restrictions on the Continent. With a little reorganisation they could do so here. Nevertheless, the bulk of UK companies strongly oppose the directive and fear higher costs unless productivity can be correspondingly raised. Much will depend on how quickly it has to be introduced and how adaptable employees can be.</p>

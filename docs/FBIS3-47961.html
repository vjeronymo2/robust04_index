			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan's regional banks  painted a bleak outlook for the economy on Wednesday [19  January] with a top official brushing aside recent market  optimism resulting from buoyant personal consumption over the  year-end.    "I didn't particularly get the feeling that the economy has  turned brighter... from recent conversations" with various  company heads, said Takashi Tanaka, chairman of the Regional  Banks Association of Japan.    Companies have pushed forward with "restructuring" but the  prolonged business slump is now forcing them to start "labor  adjustments," he told a regular press meeting.    In a monthly survey of Japan's 60 regional banks released at  the same time, the association said business activities in most  regions are expected to remain weak over the next three months  under "sluggish personal consumption and stagnant production  despite expected steady home building and public works."    "The degree of stagnancy particularly in production is  deepening," said the survey conducted in late November.    Considering the government's plan to use public funds in  stimulating liquidity of the real estate market, Tanaka praised  it as a "very good" option in economic measures.    But he expressed caution over linking the land program to  measures on nonperforming loans at banks, saying, "we see no  direct relation."    Tanaka reiterated his opposition to using public funds to  help banks liquidate bad loans, and banks should take the  "responsibility themselves."    He also expressed opposition to wider disclosure of problem  loans and to active liquidation in the current fiscal year even  at the cost of reporting net losses or sharp profit declines.    Regional banks are required to disclose only bad loans  extended to insolvent customers, while Japan's 11 major  commercial banks, known as city banks, are obligated to also  announce loans that have produced no interests for six months or  longer.    On liberalization of demand deposit rates, Tanaka called for  "careful" and "thorough" discussions even if an adoption this  year is delayed to realize a system of government-backed postal  rates following private-sector rates.    The Finance Ministry, insisting on a system led by  private-sector rates, is now negotiating with the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harbin, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Heilongjiang Province recorded a remarkable growth in its export  of farm and sideline products last year, which amounted to over  500 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 27.4 percent of its  total export volume.    Among the 21 major kinds of export commodities that earned  at  least 10 million U.S. dollars each in 1993, 14 were farm and  sideline products.    And, over 90 percent of the soybean exports of the whole  country came from Heilongjiang.    Experts here attributed the fast growth in farm exports of  the province to growing border trade with Russia in recent years.    Along the 3,000-km borderline, 70 percent of the townships  and 30 percent of the villages have built their processing  industries, while inland cities have set up many export farm  bases in the province.    To boost the development of an export-oriented economy, the  province has invested about 120 million yuan to build more than  170 farm production bases itself over the past few years.    It has also set up economic ties with over 30 countries and  regions throughout the world, using foreign funds to build  modern farms and processing industries.</p>

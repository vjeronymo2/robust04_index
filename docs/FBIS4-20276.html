			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement by Ozker Ozgur, Turkish Cypriot </F> minister of state and deputy prime minister and leader of the  Republican Turkish Party, in Nicosia on 28 April -- recorded]    [Text] The indirect talks on the package of  confidence-building measures seem to have broken off. However,  I do not wish to draw the conclusion that the talks have  completely broken off. It is common knowledge that the  confidence-building measures package is a whole package. The  indirect talks focused on three or four main points, which were  related to the question of access from south Cyprus to Maras  [Varosha], the map of the area, the use of Nicosia International  Airport by the airline companies, and the customs procedures.    The question of access from south Cyprus to the closed area  of Maras was brought up in the meeting that was held today.  However, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative, did not wish to inform the Turkish Cypriot side  of the Greek Cypriot side's approach and the UN officials' views  on the other matters.    I have already said that the package is a whole package. It  has been described as the confidence-building measures package.  In view of that, a middle way cannot be found if the views of  the sides on the whole of the package are not brought to light.  Selecting only one issue from the package and concentrating on  it without focusing attention on the others will not move the  sides anywhere. In other words, a mistake has been made in  connection with the method that has been applied in the process.  That mistake has to be quickly rectified.    Therefore, Mr. Joe Clark must make an appropriate assessment  on the situation at this point. He must seriously consider what  he should do to resuscitate the negotiations process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Richard Falbr, one of the  candidates for the chairmanship of the Bohemian and Moravian  Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), described as unacceptable the  recommendations concerning the role of the unions, made by Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the 1st CMKOS congress earlier  today.    According to Falbr, Klaus wants the unions to work in basic  organizations, and the union associations not to be too active  and not to play the role of political parties.    Addressing the congress this morning, Klaus said that "the  essential meaning of trade unions lies in the relationship of  individual union members and their basic trade union  organizations on the company level towards employers and towards  the management of the company -- that is in the relationship on  a micro level."    Falbr noted that the situation in basic organizations had  been worsening just due to measures pushed through by the  government and Parliament. However, Falbr did not specify the  measures.    Falbr told CTK that the methods of work were exclusively the  unions' own matter. He said that Klaus's speech was "smartly  composed," but could not conceal the premier's ideas which are,  according to Falbr, identical with Margaret Thatcher's negative  view of union work.</p>

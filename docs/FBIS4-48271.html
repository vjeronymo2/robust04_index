			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Electricity rates will increase by an average of  19 percent within the next few days while water rates will  increase by an average of 15 percent. These increases were  announced by the government on 14 May. For electricity, 45  percent of regular consumers, notably 194,000 households, will  be spared the rate increases. For water, 100,000 consumers will  be exempted.    The increases in electricity and water rates are due to the  excess operational costs resulting from the devaluation.  However, the necessary rate increase was calculated as strictly  as possible in order not to penalize the people and to preserve  the competitiveness of the country's businesses and  professionals.    In both cases, the state will bear the greater share of the  cost. For water, the real increase in the average rate is about  40 percent, and for electricity, the rate is 30 percent.

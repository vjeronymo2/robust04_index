			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil searches for coffee policy UNCERTAINTY IS deepening over the Brazilian position at the next International Coffee Organisation meeting in London on 5 February. A meeting between exporters and the Brazilian government to define a new price listing proposal was postponed to today because of what the government referred to as 'scheduling problems'. The Brazilian coffee sector has been floundering for the lack of some kind of coherent policy since its proposal (made jointly with Colombia) for the retention of 10 per cent of production in an effort to boost prices was rejected a few months ago by other major coffee producing nations, who felt a better option was the revival of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system, suspended since July 1989. Brazilian exporters say they are firmly against a return to any kind of quota system.</p>

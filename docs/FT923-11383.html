			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Analysts despair as Milan falls further  -Recent events have dented the Italian market's fragile credibility The Italian equity analyst, one of the more exotic species prowling in the world's financial jungle, is threatened with extinction following the recent collapse in share prices on the Milan stock exchange. Observers had already spotted the danger signs late last year as trading volumes dwindled in spite of the implementation of long-awaited market reforms. However, the predicament of the well-groomed, Bocconi-educated analysts has become acute following the killing of a leading anti-Mafia judge last weekend and the government's inept handling of the liquidation of Efim, one of the country's three state holding companies. Both events severely dented Italy's fragile international credibility and prompted long-suffering domestic and foreign investors to dump what was left of their Italian equity holdings. The reasoning behind their decision is compelling, and not even the most bullish broker can find something positive to say about the Milan stock market. Indeed, most analysts believe that the outlook will get worse before it improves. Political uncertainty hangs over the bourse in spite of the determination of the new government, led by Mr Giuliano Amato, to tackle structural ills, such as the public sector deficit, and its decision to speed up the privatisation of state companies. But, with around 500 parliamentary amendments to its mini-budget plan alone ahead of this week's parliamentary debates, the coalition, based on a slim majority, has yet to prove that it can deliver. While many of Mr Amato's ideas are laudable, dealers fear that putting them into practice could expose his government's Achilles heel. That would be particularly damaging in the case of privatisation. Mr Amato's concept of forming two 'super-holdings' under the Treasury to take charge of many public sector assets had been criticised as woolly and bureaucratic, which explains the revision yesterday in favour of a simpler structure. Uncertainty about the fate of the Iri and Eni holding companies could cast a shadow over existing privatisation plans. The flotation of Iri's Finmeccanica subsidiary and Eni's Agip and Snam operations are still on course but their success could well be soured by investors' hostility towards Italian equities. The impact of the Bank of Italy's decision to raise the discount rate twice this month, to 13.75 per cent, was imm-ediately felt on equities. Meanwhile, rates for secur-ities repurchase agreements reached a record 17.56 per cent on Wednesday, against 16.02 per cent at Friday's previous tender. With the Bundesbank showing no sign of relaxing its monetary rigour, Italian rates look set to rise further. Intervention by the central bank and rate rises have relaxed the pressure on the lira and rumours of an imminent lira devaluation have eased. However, the chances remain of a depreciation from a position of greater stability, perhaps once the 1993 budget has been passed by end-September, limiting the appeal of equities to non-lira investors. The prospects for corporate profits are poor. The recent collapse of share prices could be seen as an opportunity to pick up bargains, but the general outlook for earnings in 1992 and 1993 is bleak. Mr Roberto Condulmari of Gemina-Credit Lyonnais Sim predicts an average 8 per cent fall in quoted companies' net profits this year. That could be a conservative estimate if the government stamps on consumer demand in its attempt to cut the deficit. So the flickering signs of economic recovery may die out. Virtually the only good piece of economic news came yesterday with the report that inflation remained steady last month at 5.5 per cent. Corporate profits will also be eroded by rising interest rates. The higher cost of credit has weighed on the corporate sector, and penalised highly geared groups, Ferruzzi-Montedison in particular. Banking and construction shares have also been savaged. Concerns about credit quality have been heightened by the likely economic slowdown, while problems in the bond market could lead to write-downs and lower securities trading profits for the banks. The construction and cement sectors are in the doldrums in view of the likely slump in orders from a public sector chastened by recent corruption scandals. Meanwhile, Italian equity analysts in Milan and London are desperately trying to justify their existence. 'We are developing a series of worst-case scenarios to examine the possible effects of a variety of government decisions, like tariff freezes, on company profits,' says one. 'Are you free for lunch?'</p>

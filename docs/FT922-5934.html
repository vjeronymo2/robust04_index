			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: German solution to lack of UK apprenticeship opportunities Sir, Mr Richard Trim (Letters, May 26) is correct to express concern over the lack of graduate apprenticeship opportunities in British industry. Before I graduated two years ago, I, like many other students, spent a considerable amount of time trying to find a satisfactory apprenticeship (management trainee) programme within the British manufacturing industry - unfortunately without success. I had studied business and wanted to move into the manufacturing sector, but due to such a marked lack of interest in business students, I eventually decided to move outside of the UK. My endeavours led me to Germany, where I am now in the process of finishing my apprenticeship with a well-known Bavarian automobile manufacturer. My trainee programme has been very carefully planned, I have enjoyed many opportunities, and have learnt a great deal. When I consider the lack of response and enthusiasm shown by the manufacturing sector at 'career days' and through our 'careers advisory service' at university, I realise that I had no other choice but to leave the UK in order to receive a proper training, and I am not atypical. This is a shame, and perhaps should be a cause for concern in the British manufacturing industry. Richard Jarrett, (Nachwuchs-Trainee, Audi AG), Oberer Graben 14, Ingolstadt, 8070 Germany</p>

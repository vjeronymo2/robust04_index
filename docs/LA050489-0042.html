			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The man who was skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it struck a reef and  caused the nation's largest oil spill pleaded not guilty to criminal charges,  including operating the vessel while drunk. Joseph Hazelwood, 42, entered the  plea through his attorney in a 15-minute proceeding in Anchorage before Alaska  Judge David Stewart. Hazelwood, who was silent and declined to answer  reporters' questions, was ushered out a back door of the courtroom immediately  after the hearing. Hazelwood, who was fired by Exxon after the March 24  accident, is charged with operating a vessel while drunk, reckless endangerment  and negligent discharge of oil.  </P></p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Bank warns rate cut would threaten inflation targets THE Bank of England yesterday gave the government a thinly veiled warning that a further cut in interest rates at present would jeopardise its struggle to defeat inflation. In its first quarterly report on inflation, the Bank said that expectations of inflation are still too high in Britain and the government's target has yet to win credibility. It warned that 'further progress is required' to meet the government's objective of keeping the annual increase in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments, in a 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in the life of this parliament. The Bank also said that it expected unemployment to continue rising for some months and urged wage restraint to prevent further heavy job losses. It had seen few signs so far of recovery in demand and output. This gloomy view of the UK economy was borne out yesterday by the latest government figures for industrial production. These showed that manufacturing output fell in each of the last two quarters of 1992. Output of all production industries, including manufacturing, energy and water, dropped in 1992 for the third year running - the first time this has happened since the early 1930s. Although the Bank believes that underlying inflation can stay in a 3 per cent to 4 per cent range during the next two years, there are risks that the top level of the target will be breached. In particular, the Bank warned that 'a sustained further depreciation of sterling' could cause inflation to exceed the target range. Another problem was the government's large fiscal deficit and fears that it might be monetised in the future. Official figures yesterday put the public sector borrowing requirement at Pounds 21.6bn in the first 10 months of the 1992-93 financial year in spite of an unexpectedly high Pounds 3.8bn surplus in January. Although the Bank is not independent, it was recently given a mandate by the government to combat inflation. Yesterday's detailed report is a sign that it takes its duties seriously. The Bank considers the report an important check on government actions. It has ensured it gets wide circulation by making it available in leading bookshops. The report details how cost pressures have built up in the economy since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. It marks out the government's limited room for manoeuvre by setting its monetary policy in the context of likely continuing inflation pressures. While the UK economy is still bumping along the bottom of the recession, the Bank finds that underlying inflation is too high for comfort. But Mr John Major last night offered a more optimistic gloss on the economic outlook. Speaking to an audience of Tory party supporters, the prime minister hinted that official figures for retail sales due later today would confirm a sustained upturn in consumer confidence.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Smokers, drinkers and drivers hit by mini-Budget Thursday's mini-Budget, resulting from the government's defeat over extending VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent, was bad news for smokers, drinkers and drivers. Duty on alcohol and tobacco is raised by about 4 per cent from midnight, December 31. This means an extra 6p on 20 cigarettes, 1p on a pint of beer, 5p on a bottle of wine, and 26p on a bottle of whisky. Duty on petrol and diesel will go up by 1p a litre (4.5p a gallon) at the same time. Planned extra payments to compensate pensioners and social security claimants for the higher VAT rate will be scaled back. The earnings threshold for NI contributions will be Pounds 58 rather than Pounds 59 a week from April 1995.</p>

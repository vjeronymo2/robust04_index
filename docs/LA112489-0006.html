			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> We knew and loved Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, the academic vice rector of the  University of Central America, murdered Nov. 16 by a government death squad.  </P> <P> We watch in horror as our leaders call for a full and proper investigation of  this murder by the Cristiani government -- a government of the Arena party, the  party of the death squads who have tortured, raped, murdered and "disappeared"  countless numbers of Salvadorans and have never yet been brought to justice.  </P> <P> With over 70,000 Salvadorans dead and a million refugees in our country because  they fear for their lives at home, for President Bush, the State Department and  members of Congress not to know at this point the true nature of justice in El  Salvador is a moral crime.  </P> <P> BARBARA BEAUSOLEIL ZELWER  </P> <P> ADRIANNE ARON  </P> <P> Berkeley  </P></p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US seeks less chip reliance on Japanese THE US Commerce Department has put forward plans to increase government-sponsored efforts to reduce US semiconductor manufacturers' heavy dependency on Japanese suppliers of ceramic semiconductor packages. Mr Ronald Brown, commerce secretary, stopped short of recommending that President Bill Clinton invoke powers to limit imports or order that a quota of US government purchases be made from domestic suppliers. The ceramic packages are used to house some types of semiconductor chips, including most microprocessors and many of the chips used in military equipment. Japanese suppliers, led by Kyocera, dominate the world market, supplying over 90 per cent of ceramic packages for chips used in some US weapon systems and an estimated 60 per cent of those used in commercial semiconductor products. The decision follows an incident that showed the vulnerability of the semiconductor industry to interruptions in supplies of critical materials. An explosion at a Sumitomo Chemicals plant in Japan is raising serious concerns about a possible shortage of epoxy resins used to make semiconductor packages for standard devices such as memory chips. The Commerce Department plan, announced on Wednesday, follows a nine-month study of the semiconductor ceramic packaging industry, prompted by a petition filed last November by two US ceramic package makers - Coors Electronic Package and Ceramic Process Systems. The US companies claimed that dependency on Japanese suppliers of ceramic packages was a threat to US economic competitiveness as well as to military security. The department concluded that imports do not now represent a national security threat. Mr Brown also directed the US Bureau of Export Administration to review criteria for determining what constitutes a 'national security threat' after the ending of the cold war. Industrial competitiveness might be included. The case has been closely watched as a bellwether of the Clinton administration's stance on government intervention to protect strategic US industries. However, the department's apparent reluctance to impose limits on imports is believed to have been influenced by the opposition of US semiconductor manufacturers.</p>

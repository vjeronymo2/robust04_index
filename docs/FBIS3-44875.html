			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Taiwan authorities  are urged to stop placing any political barriers in the way of  repatriating hijackers in a XINHUA commentary here today.    On December 18 to 22 last year, the Association for  Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the Chinese Mainland and  the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) held working  talks in Taibei [Taipei].    The working talks attained positive results, including the  consensus that in principle hijackers must be repatriated, the  commentary says.    However, the SEF issued a statement on December 22 saying,  that although the ARATS eagerly wants to have the hijackers  repatriated, it is not willing to face up to the "equal judicial  jurisdiction entitled to our side."    Originally, the discussions between the ARATS and the SEF  were aimed at seeking practical and realistic measures  acceptable to the two sides to solve concrete problems in the  people-to-people contacts across the straits, considering that  political differences exist between the two sides across the  straits.    The ARATS has reaffirmed that the political differences  between the two sides should not become an obstacle to  consultations between the two organizations.    Many times the ARATS has put forward practical and realistic  and rational suggestions for seeking ways to reach an agreement.    However, the Taiwan authorities called the suggestions  "defying the equal judicial jurisdiction entitled to Taiwan" and  refused to accept them.    It should be pointed out that, under the present situation  in  which political differences between the two sides can not be  resolved at once, the practical way to solve the repatriation of  hijackers and other issues is to avoid sensitive political  problems and take a positive and realistic attitude to seek  measures for resolving the issues, which can be accepted by both  sides, within the scope of discussions of the two organizations.    The issue of judicial jurisdiction is essentially a  political  one, the commentary says. The Taiwan authorities' sticking to  the so-called "equal judicial jurisdiction" or "reciprocal right  to the judicial administration" during the routine business  talks of mass organizations is a covert attempt to create "two  Chinas" and will never work.    The "Wang-Ku" meeting concluded agreements and the two  organizations have made progress in routine talks, thus paving  the way for solving concrete problems in contacts among  compatriots on both sides of the straits.    To better prevent the criminal offense of hijacking, the  civil aviation departments on the mainland have strengthened  safety examinations.    Naturally, the Taiwan authorities should adopt necessary  measures to cooperate in settling the issue of a handful of  evil-doers hijacking passenger planes to Taiwan, the commentary  says.</p>

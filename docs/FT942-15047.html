			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Moscow delays taxes The increased tariffs on a wide range of imported goods originally imposed by the Russian government from March 15 have been delayed until July 1, according to a government statement. The decision followed what the Kommersant Daily newspaper called at the weekend 'a wave of protests from the cities' over the prospective price rises on imported goods, which in some large centres make up 25 per cent of the shopping basket. It also follows strong protests from foreign states, led by the US. Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, raised the issue last month with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin and received a pledge that the tariffs would be re-examined.</p>

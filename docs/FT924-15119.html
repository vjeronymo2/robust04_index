			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (4): Intervention rocks the airwaves - Traditional broadcasters are facing changes THE UK's traditional broadcasters are in turmoil as government intervention and an increasingly competitive market begin to challenge what they do, how they do it and above all how much it costs. The ITV network will over the next year be coming to terms with the provisions of the 1990 Broadcasting Act and the competitive tenders for new franchises which begin on January 1, 1993. The date will mark the beginning of a new era in British commercial television, with new companies, unparalleled pressure to reduce costs and a much greater emphasis on ratings. ITV could be about to face one of the most difficult years in its history. The unexpected length and depth of the advertising recession will put all budgets under pressure. The advertising revenue growth forecasts of bidders for new franchises averaged around 4 per cent a year in real terms over the next 10 years. Some forecasters such as consultants Booz Allen now believe the more likely figure will be between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. National Economic Research Associates, which has been more bullish in the past, warned in a recent survey that confidence was lower than normal at this time of the year and that little real growth was expected for 1992 compared with last year. ITV is not, however, about to go into a serious decline - advertising agencies predict net revenues of Pounds 1.8bn for this year. Yet potential instability could arise because of the particular problems faced by a number of companies which bid high to defeat serious opponents. In addition to having to pay large amounts of money to the Treasury companies such as HTV, the licence holders for Wales and the West and Yorkshire Television, which merged with Tyne Tees earlier this year have tended to lose market share as advertising revenue flowed towards the Midlands, London and the south. An additional area of uncertainty arises from the fact that from the beginning of 1993 Channel 4 will sell its advertising competitively with ITV instead of, as at present, being funded by a set percentage of ITV advertising revenue. The BBC has also come into the firing line as the long debate begins on the re-negotiation of its Royal Charter in 1996. To improve efficiency the corporation has set up a system of Producer Choice under which producers will have the freedom to go to the outside market for services if they want to, a measure that is clearly likely to reduce staff employment. The corporation is also moving towards a competitive strategy of providing 'distinctive' programmes and not competing against every aspect of commercial and satellite television. 'The BBC will need to withdraw from areas in which it is no longer able or needed to make an original contribution,' is how the organisation puts it although it is not yet clear what its 'higher ground' programme philosophy will mean in practice. Making the BBC the 'National Theatre of the airwaves' was another objective set out in recently leaked documents. Yet the BBC is determined to remain in all the main genres of programme-making including comedy and light entertainment. A clearer idea of what lies in store for the BBC will come later this month when the government publishes a green paper or discussion document on the future of the corporation. All the signs are that the government believes there is a role for a public service broadcaster like the BBC well into the next century and that a universal licence fee is still the best method of funding. Considerable pressure is likely to be applied to ensure that the BBC is as efficient as possible. In spite of the uncertainty and sometimes near hysteria surrounding the BBC's future the corporation is busy carving out a role for itself in the new media. BBC World Service Television runs 24-hours-a-day satellite channels in Asia and Africa and plans to span the globe. Quite separately the BBC is in talks with Sky Television looking into the possibility of a joint 24-hour news service for the UK. On November 1 the BBC and Thames Television, which has lost its ITV franchise, will launch UK Gold, an advertising-financed general entertainment. The channel will be scheduled mainly from the libraries of Thames and the BBC and will include drama, soap opera, comedy and films. There will be no news, sport or current affairs. The channel in which Thames will have 15 per cent plus a 5 per cent option and the BBC 20 per cent is a further sign of a growing secondary market in programmes which have already been shown on the main broadcast channels. In September, BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the corporation, signed a 10-year deal with UK Gold for around 1,500 hours of programmes a year. 'This agreement represents further progress in turning UK Gold into a reality. Exclusive access to BBC and Thames programming is the heart of the channel, enabling it to offer classic British-made entertainment to the satellite television audience,' BBC Enterprises said. The BBC would eventually like to be involved in as many as five satellite channels offering everything from documentaries and wildlife to children's programmes as long as suitable partners can be found. ITV is also starting to think about the possibility of launching its own UK Gold channel on satellite, a channel with the working title of ITV2. Research is under way and ITV is due to take a decision on whether or not to become directly involved in satellite television within the next few weeks.</p>

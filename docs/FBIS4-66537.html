			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Avinash Singh] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 14 April. Having failed to achieve the  desired results with the Sikh boys in forging an alliance with  the Kashmiri militants under its K2 (Kashmir Khalistan) plan, so  that their respective "freedom movements" could be guided to its  logical conclusions Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of  Pakistan with the assistance of Jehad Council is now trying its  hands at Ahmadiya youth. [sentence as published]    While one of the Ahmadiya boys Zubair Ahmed, reported to be  an activist of Babbar Khalsa, was shot dead at Qadian in  Gurdaspur district, the international headquarters of the  community some time back a couple of others have been nabbed by  security agencies in Srinagar and Delhi in recent weeks.    The "arrests" have revealed that members of the Ahmadiya  community were being recruited for dual purpose--reviving  terrorism in Punjab and fomenting more trouble in Kashmir.  Besides furthering the K2 ambition that got a battering in  Punjab, the new recruitment is also aimed at bringing a bad name  to the Ahmadiyas, a hated lot in Pakistan.    Ahmadiyas are the followers of London-based religious chief  Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth generation of Khalifatul-Masih.  Ahmadiyas have over the years been complaining of persecution  in Pakistan where they are not treated as Muslims. As per the  diktats of Islam there cannot be any Prophet after Prophet  Mohammad, Muslims in Pakistan contend. Ahmadiyas, however,  claim that they are true Muslims. They say that Mirza Tahir  Ahmad is a "man of God", who "was born to bring comfort to  fellow human beings."    It is understood that olive branch being held out to  Ahmadiya  youth while exhorting them to take to the gun is that once they  proved their loyalty to Islam by joining the "Jehad" they could  claim parity to other Muslim sects.    The brain behind this move is none other than Maj Gen-[Major  General] designate Imtiaz, who is heading the Jehad Council.  Interestingly, Brigadier Imtiaz was earlier heading the Kashmir  cell of the ISI and was also the key functionary of the Joint  Command Coordination Cell (JCC), later rechristened as the Jehad  Council. The Major General-designate is currently being assisted  by Col. Sadiq in Sialkot and Major Javed in Muzaffarabad.    Recent interrogation reports have disclosed that one Ayaz  Ahmad was the first boy from the Ahmadiya community to be  trained in Pakistan occupied Kashmir by the ISI sleuths sometime  last year. He was sent to the Valley later to establish contact  with youngsters from his clan and motivate them into joining the  struggle for liberation of Kashmiris from the "shackles of  India".    Ayaz escaped security dragnet twice in Kashmir and moved to  the national capital where he took up the assignment of  preparing fake passports and travel documents for ISI contacts  and make their lodging arrangements in old Delhi area. These  contacts started arriving in India by Samjhota Express after  large number of them got killed while crossing the Line of  Control (LOC) around November last year.    Another Ahmadiya boy active in Punjab has been identified as  Habib Ahmad. Habib is operating for Babbar Khasla, an  organisation for which his late younger brother Zubair was  working. He has been making frequent trips to Kashmir with a  view to establish fresh contact with the militants in the Valley  in a bid to provide a fresh lease of life to the K2 plan.    Questioning of the arrested extremists have confirmed that  Khalistani protagonists like Daljit Singh Bittoo of the Sikh  Students Federation and Lakhbir Singh Rode (Khalistan Commando  Force) are currently in Sialkot and were closely in touch with  the Kashmiri militants. They are in the care of Col. Sadiq, who  was earlier based in Multan.    Another votary of Khalistan Wassan Singh Zaffarwal, as per  latest reports, was spotted in Muzaffrabad recently. He is  believed to be closely associated with Major Javed, one of the  very few to have direct access to Jehad Council chief Imtiaz.</p>

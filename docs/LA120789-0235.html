			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'FULL HOUSE' EPISODE TO DEAL WITH EARTHQUAKE TRAUMA  </P> <P> The San Francisco earthquake shook up a lot of kids all over the country, and  Jeff Franklin, creator and executive producer of ABC's "Full House," has  written an episode to reassure them and their parents.  </P> <P> The "Aftershocks" episode airs at 8 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> For those who are not familiar with the show -- the most popular series on  Friday night and the most popular of all among the 2-to-11 year-old set -- it  deals with a young widower with three children who has brought in two male  friends to help him raise the motherless brood.  </P> <P> It is set in San Francisco, and in this episode, the middle child, Stephanie,  7, suffers aftershocks of fear about the earthquake and also, because of the  earthquake, fears of separation from her remaining parent to whom she clings.  </P> <P> " 'Full House' is set in San Francisco and, of course, we were all deeply  affected by the tragedy there and we didn't want to ignore the fact on our  show," Franklin said in an interview.  </P> <P> "We wanted to see if we could be of some help to both the people in San  Francisco who were chiefly affected and also everyone around the country who  watched the footage on the earthquake, day in and day out."  </P> <P> In writing the show, Franklin consulted Dr. Robert Pynoos, director of the  prevention/intervention program in trauma, violence and sudden bereavement of  the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the UCLA School of  Medicine.  </P> <P> "Children are not always able to articulate their feelings and problems, and  that's very frustrating for parents who want to help them," Franklin said. "We  wanted to say to parents, who may not feel like good parents because they are  not able to solve children's problems, that they shouldn't be afraid to seek  professional help."  </P> <P> The show includes a scene in which Stephanie sees a therapist who offers  positive steps parents can take to deal with some of these fears.  </P> <P> "We try to put some element of the child-parent relationship into every show,"  Franklin said.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology: Rewards of friendship - Why AT&amp;T and NEC are joining forces to produce the next generation of semiconductors When AT&amp;T Microelectronics and NEC, the Japanese electronics company, were calculating the potential savings to be made in jointly developing technology to make future generations of semiconductors, they had to allow for one extra cost - translation services. The two companies have just agreed to develop a process for further semiconductor miniaturisation, thus increasing the memory capacity and functions of an individual chip, though the success of the project will depend as much on human relations as on the sophistication of their respective technologies. Apart from saving money in the expensive race to develop ever more sophisticated chips, the agreement reflects the emphasis placed by Japanese electronics companies on cultivating strategic relationships with foreign companies. Close ties with AT&amp;T could bring NEC benefits not only in semiconductors, a constant source of trade friction with the US, but also in the telecommunications market, where trade disputes are also a problem. The companies' announcement last week flowed from an agreement last year on the development of application-specific integrated circuits (Asics) and came a few days after the finalisation of a pact between Toshiba and the General Electric Company of the US. Those two companies have agreed on the marketing of humble home appliances and, more importantly, to launch research projects in refrigeration technology, electronic controls and environment-related technologies. Chip partnerships have become commonplace between US and Japanese companies, despite the ongoing disputes over access to the Japanese market. There are tie-ups between NMB Semiconductor and Intel, Toshiba and Motorola, Sony and Advanced Micro Devices, Matsushita and Intel, and Hitachi and Texas Instruments (TI). In February, Hitachi and TI announced that their 1988 pact had produced a protective package for a 16Mbit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chip. Their relationship is for the most part an exchange of information, which a TI official in Japan said is 'working well', while the AT&amp;T and NEC agreement is far more ambitious, involving exchanges of researchers and joint funding of a project with broad applications. Electronics companies are competing to cram increasing amounts of memory and functions on to chips, meaning that they have to find ways to shrink the circuits. Companies are now swinging into mass production of 4Mbit D-Ram chips, and have begun to deliver samples of 16Mbit chips, but will need to improve significantly manufacturing processes to market 64Mbit chips successfully. The development of 16Mbit chips is proceeding with 0.5-micron technology, enabling circuits to be produced with a width of 0.5-microns (a micron is a millionth of a metre). AT&amp;T and NEC have agreed to develop a 0.35-micron process, which is regarded as essential for the mass production of future chip generations. Officials at AT&amp;T say the company presently has a 0.9-micron capability and the tie-up with NEC will allow a matching of the company's strengths in basic research with the chip technology skills of NEC, which has been the leading Japanese producer. Japanese companies complain that the costs of keeping ahead in the memory race are multiplying faster than chip capacities, and the pressure of competition is forcing the introduction of chips such as the 16Mbit D-Ram even before the 4Mbit market has matured. William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, said that developing the 0.35-micron process is likely to cost between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m: 'I don't think that the agreement will save us half of those costs, but it will be more than a quarter.' The benefits of the partnership, he said, would be to 'share resources, lower individual company risks, and gain timely access to technology'. Tomihiro Matsumura, NEC's executive vice-president, said that the agreement 'represents true co-operation between two multinational semiconductor companies'. Precise details of that co-operation are yet to be finalised, but the companies have agreed to divide the development process into 'modules', with scientists at NEC and AT&amp;T working on agreed technology problems in their respective laboratories in Japan and the US. It is expected that there will be from 25 to 29 modules, and each company will send a researcher to the other to monitor each module and ensure that appropriate information is exchanged during the two-year programme. AT&amp;T and NEC have agreed to report regularly on progress, and say that they are clear in their own minds about the status of ownership rights - if a patent follows joint work it will be jointly owned. Research work will be conducted by the development division of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the chip development department of NEC, and will focus on areas such as memory cell technology, ultra-fine circuiting technology and ultra-fine etching technology. If the project is successful, the two companies will have a common 0.35-micron technology and will be able to develop related products and, perhaps, to share production lines to increase their manufacturing flexibility. 'Our combined efforts will assure our customers timely access to a leading-edge process technology that will be used to design sophisticated components that will enhance the value and performance of our customers' end systems,' Warwick suggested. The sensitivity of the US-Japan relationship in electronics prompted AT&amp;T to emphasise that the NEC partnership will not comprise the US company's commitment to Sematech - the Texas-based US government-industry project which had planned to develop 0.35-micron technology by 1993, but has fallen behind schedule. 'AT&amp;T has supported Sematech since its inception and remains committed to the efforts taking place at Sematech to assist the US semiconductor industry,' Warwick said. Steve Myers, senior industrial electronics analyst at Jardine Fleming, said that the success of the joint research project will depend on middle-management's interpretation of the aims of the executives who signed the agreement. 'It requires very sophisticated management direction. The middle-level has to understand exactly what they are supposed to be doing,' Myers said. He said the agreement was useful for NEC, which has found the financial commitments of advanced research a difficult burden, and would assist AT&amp;T, which he said has not fulfilled its potential in chip marketing.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Dollar to lead way THE dollar is again expected to dominate the foreign exchanges this week, with crucial figures on consumer confidence out on Tuesday. 'Information coming out until now has been perceived to be historic and not of much interest,' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser of Chemical Bank. The consumer confidence numbers, along with the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Report on Friday, will be the first significant forward looking statistics. UK clearing bank base lending rate 10.5 per cent from September 4, 1991 The dollar is expected to test lower levels if the consumer confidence is worse than January's 50.4 per cent. However, any decline is not expected to last long as underlying demand is still strong. Lower levels against the D-Mark would only encourage the bulls. Economists suggested that dollar/yen could be subject to further intervention this week. The Bank of Japan sold dollars for yen twice last week. Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economist with DKB International, dismissed rumours that the Bank of Japan might seek to introduce alternatives to intervention  -such as a limit on speculative dollar buying. 'The Bank of Japan is more likely to focus on its reserves as a primary source of defence,' he said. Sterling is likely to ignore economic data this week, in favour of opinion polls. 'The pound will be a political animal from now on,' said Mr Cocker. Speculation over an imminent base rate cut in the UK had virtually been eliminated by the end of the week, with most players counting on a reduction just after the March 10 budget. The Australian dollar faces some uncertainty as the market awaits a statement on the economy from Prime Minister Paul Keating. 'If they signal an easing of policy the dollar could have a perverse reaction,' said Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays.</p>

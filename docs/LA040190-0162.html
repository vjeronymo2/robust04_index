			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> WINFIELD ANSWERS SOFTLY WHEN QUESTION IS ABOUT TRADE  </P> <P> Dave Winfield has spent too many years working for New York Yankee owner George  Steinbrenner to discuss the possibility of a trade to the Angels.  </P> <P> He knows that saying the wrong thing at the wrong time can produce more turmoil  for him, and he already believes that no player -- aside from Jackie Robinson  -- has ever been through more.  </P> <P> At 38 and having missed the entire 1989 season because of back surgery,  Winfield is confident that he will regain his All-Star form in 1990 and carry  it beyond.  </P> <P> Maybe even as far as Anaheim? Would he like that? Would he approve a trade  involving the Angels?  </P> <P> He smiled and said:  </P> <P> "The only thing I can tell you is that I'm going to play five more years and  believe I can still play 155 games a year at my previous level.  </P> <P> "I want to win. I want to have fun. I don't want to be abused."  </P> <P> His attorney, Jeff Klein, provided some additional insight.  </P> <P> "The Angels are obviously a good team in a strong division, and they've  evidenced a commitment to winning," he said.  </P> <P> "Dave enjoys the environment. He and his wife (Tonya) live there (in Beverly  Hills). He thinks it's a nice place to play and that the ball carries well at  the Big A. Other than that, it's hard to respond to rumors.  </P> <P> "I mean, Dave is not looking to leave New York. He's been great for the city,  and the city has been great to him."  </P> <P> As a player with 10 or more seasons in the major leagues and five or more with  the same team, Winfield's consent is necessary for any trade. He said he has  not been approached regarding the Angels, though the respective general  managers acknowledge they have talked.  </P> <P> The Angels, with a surplus of starting pitchers, are pursuing a run-producing  outfielder or a bona fide leadoff hitter.  </P> <P> The list is believed to include Von Hayes, Rob Deer, Lenny Dykstra, Tim Raines,  Cory Snyder and Winfield.  </P> <P> The Yankees, in turn, need pitching. Their rotation, so to speak, includes  Pascual Perez, Tim Leary, Andy Hawkins and some mystery guests.  </P> <P> The Angels are believed to have offered Mike Witt, but Steinbrenner, despite  his well-documented dislike for Winfield, said publicly the other day that he  has no interest in Witt, whom he once pursued as a free agent but who was 22-31  over the last two years and may lack the temperament to pitch in the Bronx.  </P> <P> The question then becomes:  </P> <P> Would the Angels deal Kirk McCaskill, knowing it would also cost them a buyout  of Winfield's veto rights and renegotiation of a contract that expires at the  end of the 1990 season, when Winfield can become a free agent?  </P> <P> There are reasons to believe they will seriously consider it. Among them:  </P> <P>  -- There is mutual respect between Winfield and General Manager Mike Port,  both of whom were with the San Diego Padres in the 1970s.  </P> <P>  -- Because of his athleticism, age may not be the deterrent it is with some  other players. In 1988, at 36, Winfield had one of his best seasons, batting  .322 with 25 homers and 107 runs batted in.  </P> <P>  -- Amid nine years of almost constant turmoil with the Yankees, Winfield has  displayed leadership, stability and fortitude, qualities that a team would seem  to want.  </P> <P> First, of course, Winfield must prove to Angel scouts -- former manager Cookie  Rojas, among them -- that he is physically sound.  </P> <P> The process is accelerating.  </P> <P> Winfield served as a designated hitter Thursday, his first competitive  appearance since September of '88. He is expected to play the outfield today.  </P> <P> "I'll be ready opening day, I guarantee it," he said. "Physically, I'm there,  but it takes awhile to get the synchronization and coordination (at the plate).  The hits will come, the confidence will come. I'm glad to be part of it again."  </P> <P> Winfield had fragments of a herniated disk removed by Dr. Robert Watkins at  Centinela Hospital Medical Center after the stiffness he began experiencing  during a four-hour bus ride in the spring of 1988 turned to pain last spring.  </P> <P> He rehabilitated with weights and exercise, and believes that the summer out of  uniform might have been mentally therapeutic as well.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be there, but I didn't allow myself to ride an emotional roller  coaster," he said. "I tried to avoid feelings of frustration. I tried to stay  on an even keel.  </P> <P> "I mean, the way I look at it, I added a year to my career."  </P> <P> Winfield won't make an issue of it, but he is obviously displeased that the  Yankees are moving him from right field to left, leaving Jesse Barfield in  right and Roberto Kelly in center.  </P> <P> Barfield and Winfield each believes he is baseball's best right fielder.  </P> <P> "It's like if they wanted Kareem to play guard when he was the best center in  basketball," Winfield said, forcing a smile. "What could he do? He'd play  guard."  </P> <P> No one was more surprised by the Yankees' $5.7-million signing of the eccentric  Pascual Perez than Buck Rodgers, his former manager with the Montreal Expos.  </P> <P> "He's a sick man, a time bomb," Rodgers said. "He wants to do well and stay  clean, but he needs help."  </P> <P> The Expos, Rodgers said, provided that help during Perez's drug rehabilitation,  then were snubbed when he left as a free agent.  </P> <P> "After you take a guy out of the gutter, you would think he would want to come  back, but his agent didn't even give us a second chance after he got the offer  from New York," Rodgers said, adding that Perez figures to be immune to the  pressures of Steinbrenner and Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> "Nothing's going to bother Pascual because he's in his own world," Rodgers  said. "It doesn't matter if he's pitching in Des Moines, Iowa, or New York  City."  </P> <P> One of the pivotal questions of the abbreviated spring for the New York Mets  concerned the ability of former infielder Keith Miller to play center field,  allowing Kevin McReynolds to remain in left and Mike Marshall to move from the  outfield to first base.  </P> <P> Alluding to another former infielder who played center field for the Mets last  year, Manager Davey Johnson said of Miller:  </P> <P> "I know he's going to be better than Juan Samuel was. I look for him to be a  spark for us. I look for him to hit .250 and do the little things. He's going  to help get us going. What he hits is not as important as his enthusiasm."  </P> <P> Cal Ripken, the Baltimore Oriole shortstop, remains frustrated over the  September slump that might have cost his surprising team the American League  East championship and enabled Robin Yount to win the most-valuable-player  award.  </P> <P> Ripken hit .198 in September. He also slumped in September of 1988, batting  .216, but he does not believe that the late collapses are a result of fatigue  from his streak of consecutive games, now at 1,250.  </P> <P> "I wanted to contribute. I wanted to drive in runs. I wanted to help us win so  badly that I fell back into the same bad habits," Ripken said of last September  as it related to the previous September.  </P> <P> "I felt I could hit balls out of the strike zone. The word travels pretty  quickly when they're getting you out that way. If you're stubborn enough and  dumb enough to keep doing it, they'll keep doing it, too."  </P> <P> The Atlanta Braves have converted their succession of early draft choices into  what Don Sutton, now doing color commentary on Atlanta telecasts, calls the  most talented collection of young pitchers he has ever seen.  </P> <P> Sutton is particularly high on 19-year-old Steve Avery, 19-8 in two minor  league seasons after being selected third in the 1988 draft.  </P> <P> "Avery is an absolute franchise pitcher," Sutton said. "He has the best  mechanics of any young pitcher I've seen in 25 years. The Braves ought to hire  a sniper so that they can pick off anybody that tries to change him. Just leave  him alone."  </P> <P> Cecil Fielder, who played for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan last year, was  immediately named cleanup hitter by Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson  Wednesday when he hit home runs on three consecutive pitches by three St. Louis  Cardinal pitchers.  </P> <P> Fielder has never been to bat more than 176 times in a major league season, but  as Cardinal catcher Tom Pagnozzi said of the hefty DH:  </P> <P> "He looked like King Kong today. He was King Kong. You think Sparky will have  him in the Hall of Fame tomorrow?"  </P> <P> The possibility of a 27 player roster over the first 21 days of the season has  been reborn. Despite Wednesday's contrary directive from the owners' Player  Relations Committee, negotiations have resumed in New York concerning the  roster issue.  </P> <P> No one knows yet whether clubs will open with 27, 25 or 24 players, but the  fact that a simple issue has become so complicated illustrates that the  relationship between management and players will never be free of greed and  selfishness.  </P> <P> St. Louis Manager Whitey Herzog said rescinding the 27-man roster represented  the silliest decision ever.  </P> <P> "For the good of the game they ought to let the people on the field start  making decisions again," he said. "We play 20 straight days starting with the  fourth day of the season, and I may use 90 to 100 pitchers in those 20 games.  You may see teams get buried, key pitchers hurt.  </P> <P> "I hope none of mine do. But if some of the Mets do, well . . ."  </P></p>

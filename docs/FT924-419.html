			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Observer: No expense Choosing between this year's best-selling Christmas toys is proving to be exceptionally difficult. Two years ago, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, modestly priced by current standards at Pounds 4.99 upwards, won hands down. But this year Sega and Nintendo video games systems, both at a rather more substantial Pounds 129.99, are battling it out for prime position on the parental cheque book stub. Hamleys of Regent Street reports that Sega's Sonic, the high-speed hedgehog, was just beating Nintendo's Mario the Brooklyn plumber, but 'it's virtually neck and neck'. However, Thunderbirds, boosted by recent reruns of the classic puppet series, are still popular, partly because parents buy them for nostalgic reasons and partly because they only cost Pounds 3.99. . . .</p>

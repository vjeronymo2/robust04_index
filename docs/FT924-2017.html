			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Austria reveals new-found zeal for privatisation - The state seems ready to sell controll of most of its holdings and it has given up any dreams, of building up Austrian-controlled world competitive giants in finance and industry IT IS a bit late in the day, but Austria seems finally about to undertake a serious privatisation programme. This news may come as a surprise to those who know that the Austrian government has in the past few years sold off significant stakes in its vast holdings of the country's leading banks and industrial companies. But in almost all of these cases, the government has retained majority or voting control. Given the strong socialist - some would say collectivist - strain in Austrian management-labour-government relations, it probably would have continued to do so if the recession had not rudely disrupted its plans. The event that provoked the policy shift was the revelation earlier this year that Austrian Industries, a conglomerate of metal and oil companies that was being readied for Austrian-style privatisation, had plunged into heavy losses. That meant the government, which was counting on the proceeds of a partial sale of AI equity to help cover its deficit, had to resort to more radical measures. Now, with a couple of exceptions, it seems ready to sell control of most of its holdings. And it has given up any dreams it may still have held of building up Austrian-controlled world competitive giants in finance and industry. 'The state has to look to what it can release,' said Mr Viktor Klima, the minister responsible for nationalised industries. While this statement would seem a truism in most western countries, it is nearly revolutionary in Austria where state ownership is still widely seen as a defence against foreign ownership and as a necessary pre-condition for the cosy and usually effective social partnership among government, industrial management and labour that has prevailed in the post-war period. Indeed, the partnership worked so well that Austrian leaders totally rejected the privatisation trend when it caught on elsewhere in the early 1980s. It was only in 1985 when the sprawling steel and engineering group Voest Alpine suffered large losses on unauthorised speculation in the London oil market that serious questions began to be raised about who was actually in charge. The result was a significant shift towards more commercial disciplines - the creation of AI, massive rationalisation at Voest Alpine and flotations of a minority of shares in leading banks, such as Creditanstalt and the former Lander Bank, and utilities, such as the Verbund and EVN. But the government always maintained control and the social partnership continued more or less intact. The only real addition in many cases was an ill-fated international ambition. This was particularly true at the leading banks, most of which came to grief with expansions in London and New York in the late 1980s. As late as last year, Mr Rudolf Streicher, the former nationalised industries minister, could say of AI: 'Our aim is an Austrian dominated industrial concern whose managers have to report to Vienna and Linz and not to Amsterdam and Tokyo.' Today, Mr Streicher's successor, Mr Klima, points out that AI's problems stem largely from over-investment abroad. 'In the past five years, it invested more than Sch20bn (Dollars 1.8bn) more than its cash flow. That is why it got into trouble.' The first application of the new policy is on AI itself. Instead of being readied for flotation as a single large group, it is now being stripped down to its core metal and engineering businesses, most of them inherited from the old Voest Alpine. Other activities are being privatised separately. In particular, OMV, the large oil and chemicals group which is one of the two main sources of AI losses this year, is being detached and restructured. Under a new chief executive, it is withdrawing from some of its international ventures and concentrating on becoming a leading player in central European oil products markets. Large minority blocks of its shares are to be offered to potential strategic partners, such as international oil or chemical companies, next year. Austria Metall (AMAG), the aluminium group which was the other source of AI's losses, is being drastically cut. Its Austrian smelter has been shut and participations in at least two of three overseas smelters are to be sold. Its successful packaging business is up for sale and it is looking for partners for its extrusion and forging divisions. Other smaller AI subsidiaries are to be sold, floated or put into joint ventures with foreign partners. Last month, shares of Voest Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme (VAE), a small subsidiary of AI that makes high technology railway points (switches), were offered to the public. AMS, a specialised semiconductor maker, is on the ramp to follow early next year. Mr Klima still seems determined to sell off some of AI within the next year and it could be possible. AI executives are making optimistic noises about their steel and steel-related technology businesses. But he says that unless equity markets improve, the first step will probably have to be a private placement of 10 to 20 per cent of the equity. In all of these cases, except OMV, the government is prepared, at least in principle, to sell a majority of its holdings. Mr Klima, OMV's finance director before he joined the government last spring, says the oil company is vital to Austria's energy security. The government also seems willing to give up its control of the big banks. Speculation has been rife in Vienna for weeks of the government selling a part of its 49 per cent stake in Creditanstalt to a foreign company. And it confirmed that Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, had discussions in September with General Electric of the US, among others. But as always in Austria, the implementation of this new enthusiasm for real privatisation may not come quickly. It is notable, for example, that the flotation of VAE involves only 49 per cent of the shares. Sources close to the issue say the anxieties of the trade unions prevented it from being higher. Which goes to show it is still not easy for commercial values to make headway against the social partnership.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (6): Powerful trio dominate banking - 'Bancassurance' has intensified competition between financial institutions Despite the continuing influx of foreign banks into the Netherlands, the country's financial system is still dominated by a powerful trio of domestic institutions. The three big banking institutions - ABN Amro, ING Bank and Rabobank - control a combined 80 to 90 per cent of crucial market segments, such as mortgages and savings accounts. This makes it difficult for foreign banks to achieve anything other than niche banking status in retail banking, in spite of the Netherlands's reputation as one of the most open banking markets in Europe. The concentration of banking power has been strengthened by the spate of mergers since 1989 that has whittled down the number of important domestic participants from five to three. But the oligopolistic nature of banking in the Netherlands does not mean that Dutch banks have been freed from worrying about encroachments on their territory. On the contrary the three are increasingly treading on each other's turf. This, plus the advent of 'bancassurance' - the blurring of strict divisions between banking and insurance - means that competition between the three remains spirited. In the fight to win over customers to pension plans and other types of insurance products, the banks face competition from Dutch insurers such as Aegon and also from Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial group, which like ING and Rabobank, has consciously set out to cross-sell products through its insurance and banking distribution channels. All in all, the battle lines have changed dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s when the banks each had a preserve of their own. Rabobank, a co-operative, was the farmers' bank; the forerunners of ABN Amro were seen as catering to big companies; and ING's predecessor NMB Bank, was associated with the medium-sized business community. To an extent the three big banks do retain specialities in the domestic market. Rabobank is the leader in home mortgages, ING (through its Postbank subsidiary) is a leader in money transfers, and ABN Amro is dominant in equity trading and corporate lending. Nevertheless the old days of seemingly exclusive preserves are gone, creating heightened competition at home but also partly abroad. Until the mid to late 1970s, the only bank with a large international presence was ABN Bank, which later merged with Amro to create ABN Amro. Since then, however, Rabobank and ING Bank have pursued international expansion, with ING in particular establishing a reputation in emerging markets banking, starting with its pioneering role in the trading of less developed country (LDC) debt in Latin America after the international debt crisis. All three are now expanding overseas, with ABN Amro and ING targeting many of the same emerging markets in eastern Europe and south-east Asia. In the summer, for example, both applied to open offices in Mexico to take advantage of new business opportunities expected to be opened up by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Rabobank, traditionally the bank that caters to the Netherlands's extensive and rich agricultural sector, is increasingly focusing its international aspirations on the area of trade and commodity finance, a field which ING Bank selected long ago as one of the five components of its international expansion. At home, Rabobank's dominance of the agricultural and horticultural market is being challenged by ABN Amro, which recognises the export-driven potential of the country's farmers and greenhouse owners. Competition is rife not only in traditional lending activities but also in areas such as capital markets, where all three are trying to find new sources of commission income. Half-year results published by the three banks at the end of August show the importance they attach to this growing pool of income. In each case, growth of commission income outstrips interest income, due in part to the fact that ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank were all involved in the underwriting syndicate for the flotation of KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal group, in June.</p>

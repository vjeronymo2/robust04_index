			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Investors take stake in Burmese airline A GROUP of Asian businessmen have taken control of Myanmar International Airways (MIA), the Burmese airline, in the first large privatisation project by south-east Asia's most politically-isolated country. The Prince of Brunei, Mr Oei Hong Leong (son of the founder of Indonesia's Sinar Mas group) and Mr Wong Fong Fui are the largest shareholders in a consortium which has purchased 70 per cent of MIA for USDollars 10m. Burma's military government retains 30 per cent, and has an option to move back up to 50.4 per cent. MIA has international landing rights for 37 countries, but little demand for the routes and few assets. Its ageing fleet has been passed on to the domestic airline, and a new aircraft has been leased from Royal Brunei Airlines to fly routes between Rangoon and Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. Another aircraft will be taken on next year. Mr Oei said: 'Burma is like China was 20 years ago.' His Hong Kong-listed company, China Strategic, operates more than 200 factories in China, injecting outside management into state-run businesses. Mr Oei is confident that MIA will be profitable soon, once the government's push to attract tourism and foreign investment starts to make an impact. In 1992, only 20,000 tourists visited Burma, but the government claims that this figure will have risen to 500,000 by 1996. The deal illustrates a changing attitude towards Burma by south-east Asia's businessmen. A Hong Kong-led consortium is renovating the colonial Strand Hotel in Rangoon (once one of the great hotels of Asia), and other Asian hotel groups such as Shangri-La and New World are understood to be considering projects. The economy remains tightly controlled, with an artificial exchange rate - 7 kyats to the dollar, versus the black market rate of around 110 - but Mr Oei claims that the military is committed to economic change. Since the military takeover in 1988, Burma has been shunned by the international community, although Korean and Thai companies are already active investors. Mr Oei argues: 'If you isolate them, they can still survive. But if you change the economic environment, it will change the government.'</p>

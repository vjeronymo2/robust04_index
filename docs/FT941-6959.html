			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Profile (12): If the economy is really on the mend, small may once again be beautiful - Many smaller-companies funds offer Peps, allowing investors high exposure to domestic cyclical stocks. Bethan Hutton appraises a sector that is due for recovery Smaller-company funds have been in the doldrums for several years, because smaller companies were hit badly by the recession. But last year the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index rose by about 40 per cent, doing better than the FT-SE-A All-Share, which had a very good year itself. However, that performance has not necessarily translated into equally good returns for investors in collective funds. '1993 was one of the better years on record for smaller companies, but not for most small-company unit trusts, which underperformed both the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index and the FT-SE-A All-Share Index,' says Michael Lenhoff, a strategist with Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, in a study of smaller company funds published this month. Previous research suggested that smaller companies offered higher returns for lower risk, the opposite of what is normally expected of investments. But the Capel study says this anomaly was never easy to exploit, and has now been eliminated; so, while smaller companies still offer higher potential returns, this is at the expense of higher risk. The best performance is concentrated in a small percentage of the very smallest companies, making it difficult for fund managers to get exposure to enough of the right companies. However, the study concludes that stock-picking skills may become less relevant to smaller companies, as market risk rather than specific risk becomes the main source of variability of returns. The good news for small investors is that this may make it easier for fund managers to outperform. Investment trusts have a better record on smaller companies than unit trusts. The average UK smaller companies unit trust grew by 33.69 per cent over the year to February 1 (source: Micropal), while the average investment trust in the same sector grew by 59.15 per cent. The same pattern of investment trust outperformance is repeated over three, five and 10 years. Lenhoff suggests that investment trusts may tend to perform better than unit trusts in the smaller-company sector, because investment trust managers have greater freedom to invest in smaller, illiquid or unquoted companies, and it is precisely the smallest companies which have the greatest potential for outperformance (though their risk is correspondingly high). Unit trust managers are restricted both by regulations, and by the constant awareness that the fund's holdings have to be liquid enough to sell in a hurry if investors decide to cash in their units. This may mean that they have to concentrate on the larger end of the smaller companies scale. Investment trusts, meanwhile, can go as small as they like: the Pilot investment trust, launched last year, picks companies from the very smallest end of the market - those valued at less than Pounds 30m. The fund has grown by almost 40 per cent over the past six months, and is currently trading at a slight premium. The discounts on most investment trusts in this sector are fairly narrow, at around 5 per cent, and though there are one or two trusts at a premium, none of them is high enough to make a unit trust's initial charge look like an attractive alternative. However, as always with investment trusts, investors run the risk that a wider discount will open up, and eat into the trust's performance. If smaller companies already put on such a spurt of growth last year, have investors missed the boat? Lenhoff thinks not. 'We would look on last year as the first instalment on a sustained period of outperformance for small companies. The higher exposure of small companies to the more cyclical areas of economic activity in the UK, combined with the fact that a greater proportion of their earnings arise in the domestic economy, justify this thinking.' There are 56 UK smaller companies unit trusts to choose from, and 35 investment trusts. A large number of the unit trust groups include a smaller companies fund in their own Pep schemes; as do some of the investment trusts, including Pilot, TR Smaller Companies, Ivory &amp; Sime, Kleinwort Benson, River &amp; Mercantile and Scottish Amicable. If the fund you like does not have its own Pep scheme, you could also take the self-select route, though this is less cost-effective for unit trusts. As many European countries are at an earlier stage in the economic cycle than the UK, investors looking further ahead should remember that European shares are also eligible for full Pep investment. Morgan Grenfell's Europa fund, Framlington's Continental Smaller Companies and Save &amp; Prosper's European Smaller Companies are among the qualifying unit trusts with their own Pep schemes. Fleming's European Fledgling is one investment trust in this area with its own Pep. US, Asian or international smaller company funds are subject to the Pounds 1,500 non-qualifying Pep limit. Pure venture capital funds are currently excluded from Pep investment, because they do not have at least half their investments in the form of ordinary shares. However, in the last Budget, the chancellor proposed a new type of venture capital fund, income and capital gains from which would be tax-free, putting them on a par with Peps. Proposals are still being studied, and the first funds are unlikely to appear before 1995. Smaller-company shares tend not to be high yielding, so this is not a sector for investors concentrating on income. As it is a relatively high-risk area, it might also be unwise for first-time Pep investors to put all their money into a smaller company fund. However, the sector can be seen as a useful element in a balanced portfolio and, at this stage of the recovery, investors who are not averse to a little spice might like to increase their holdings.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Victory for Taipei as air links with Japan are boosted Taiwan and Japan have agreed to expand air links between the two countries for the first time since a civil aviation pact was agreed in 1975. The accord allows each side to appoint two carriers to provide air services between Taiwan and Japan, Taiwan's transport ministry said yesterday. It adds a new route, Taipei to Fukuoka and increases flights on the existing routes between Taipei and Nagoya and between Tokyo and Okinawa. The outcome of the talks marks an important victory for Taipei, which for two years has been thwarted by Beijing in its efforts to expand services to Japan to meet increased demand. It also represents a coup for EVA Airways, Taiwan's first privately owned international carrier. Taiwan's flag carrier, China Airlines, and Japan Asia Airways currently provide regular flights between Taiwan and Japan. EVA, founded in 1991 by the Evergreen group, the shipping concern, will share the expanded routes with Japan's Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways. The accord was not an unqualified success, however, as the two sides were unable to establish direct air links between Taipei and Osaka's new Kansai Airport, an important route for business travel. Negotiations over this route were stymied by objections from Beijing. Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972. Trade and investment ties between Taiwan and Japan have grown rapidly in recent years. Two-way trade climbed to USDollars 32.1bn last year from Dollars 8.06bn in 1983, with Taiwan posting a record bilateral trade deficit of Dollars 14.2bn in 1993.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: WTO, a new name heralds new powers - US gets its own back on the European Union / Disputes The US knows how to play a mean game of poker. It formally agreed only yesterday to the establishment of a new, more powerful, world trade body which will take trade in goods, services and ideas under its wing. Then, just as everyone was breathing a sigh of relief, it said it would do so only on condition the name was changed, from the Multilateral Trade Organisation to the World Trade Organisation. It is hard not to see this as the US getting its own back on the European Union, and particularly the French, which proposed the original MTO name. But World Trade Organisation it is. Washington's reluctance to sign up to a WTO reflected anxiety by US negotiators that it might pose an unnecessary difficulty in pushing the Uruguay Round package through Congress, always suspicious of a threat to its sovereign powers in trade policy. This has been a sensitive issue ever since Congress vetoed the International Trade Organisation, which was to have been the third Bretton Woods pillar alongside the IMF and World Bank. Withholding US consent to the WTO also proved a useful bargaining chip in negotiations with the EU which, along with Canada, put forward the WTO proposal in 1990. European negotiators, chivvied by France, had made establishment of a WTO a key Uruguay Round objective, in order to place multilateral curbs on US unilateral trade action. The fact that the US has now agreed to endorse the WTO is thus significant in two ways: it signals that, in the administration's view at least, it has a good and sellable Uruguay Round accord in the bag; and it reflects an acceptance of new curbs on its unilateral powers in return for a much stronger multilateral disputes mechanism. Under the agreement on disputes procedures, to be administered by the WTO, countries agree to use multilateral remedies wherever are available. This is already the case in Gatt but, since the WTO will now cover not only trade in goods but also in services and intellectual property, the scope for unilateral action will be considerably narrowed. Washington has acknowledged that its controversial Section 301 trade law authorising reprisals against unfair traders will not get as much use in future, but say the new disputes settlement procedure will be a good substitute. It is particularly pleased to have secured the principle of cross-retaliation - that countries can take reprisals against goods trade, say, if a trading partner breaches fair trade rules on services. The WTO will operate the same mechanism for settling disputes across the trade spectrum, replacing the separate systems operated by Gatt and its various voluntary codes. In addition, 'dispute resolution will become more timely, automatic and binding,' says a US factsheet issued on Tuesday. 'When we take a case to a Gatt dispute settlement panel and win, we know that the report will be adopted and that we can retaliate if the other country does not respond.' The factsheet, perhaps deliberately, does not make clear that this retaliation would be with WTO authorisation, if offending countries failed to implement panel reports or pay adequate compensation. Administratively, the WTO will be an umbrella organisation encompassing the Gatt and sister bodies on services and intellectual property, and headed by a ministerial conference meeting at least once every two years. A WTO council at official level will run the organisation's affairs and turn itself as needed into a body to arbitrate disputes and review members' trade policies. Membership of the WTO will mean accepting all the results of the Uruguay Round without exception. The expectation is that most if not all Gatt's 114 members will join. The WTO will operate, as Gatt now does, on the basis of consensus. The main exception is dispute settlement where offending countries will no longer be able to block adoption of panel reports. Countries will have a new right of appeal against panel verdicts but, if this fails, they will be required to put things to rights, pay compensation to trading partners, or face authorised trade reprisals.</p>

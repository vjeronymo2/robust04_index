			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Stepping back from the brink - Thomas Wyatt argues the case for Company Voluntary Arrangements which save businesses from bankruptcy With more than 25,000 British companies going to the wall last year, one wonders how many even knew about a rescue option which could have kept some of them alive. The Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) is a procedure which is awkward to invoke, by no means foolproof but certainly far less traumatic than liquidation. It is also a solution with the added attraction of keeping more people in employment and allowing managers and directors to retain their powers. Yet last year it was a management tool used by only 137 financially sick companies - slightly over 0.5 per cent of the dying. The CVA is designed to shield an insolvent company from creditors so that it can recover sufficiently to trade its way out of its difficulties. There is a time limit, usually two or three years, to effect the approved rescue plan. Only companies with a solid core business qualify for such treatment, because any CVA proposal needs 75 per cent by value of its creditors to approve it. These creditors will often include the VAT collector and the taxman. The creditors are betting on recovering far more money than they would from a liquidation or receivership. And the company's directors are hoping to regain their dignity (and profits) after emerging from the strictures of a successful CVA. Every CVA needs an insolvency practitioner - acting as an independent professional adviser - to piece together, present and supervise the proposed rescue plan. One such is Mark Goldstein of Morley &amp; Scott in Marlow, who is currently nurturing 25 such rescue attempts under the little-known CVA umbrella. He says: 'There is a considerable public and even professional information gap about the solid reliability of the CVA rescue option. CVAs are not a panacea for insolvent companies, but under the right conditions they can be a most powerful and helpful management tool.' There are three reasons why CVAs have had such a low profile. First they do not figure in the standardised fees which the leading insolvency practitioners habitually charge their lending bank customers when administering the more established mortuary routines of company liquidation or receivership. Part of the public outrage about the fees charged by the larger insolvency practices stems from the cosy contracts which the lending banks' recovery units allow their 'approved' insolvency practitioners. Such chosen insolvency practitioners tend to be rather more concerned with speedily recouping the banks' lending exposure than any intensive care efforts to rescue ailing companies. The liquidation of even a 'small' business, for example, might entail only five to six days' work from 'approved' insolvency practitioners, yet earn a firm Pounds 10,000-plus even if it fails to recover a penny of the bank's money. Furthermore the bank will need to indemnify the practitioner from any legal risks from other creditors caught up in the insolvency. Second a CVA takes years, rather than days, to complete, can be tricky to start and will pay the insolvency practitioner relatively modestly. The emphasis in such rescue attempts is on quality of time rather than quantity. There is no risk indemnity from the bank. By definition, therefore, it is the smaller practitioner, one not 'approved' by the leading banks but hired by the financially distressed company itself, who has accepted and even specialised in CVA work. In addition to Morley &amp; Scott there are two other smaller insolvency practitioners, Bartfield &amp; Co and Levy Gee &amp; Partners, that are also supervising around 25 CVAs each. And the third reason why we are so extraordinarily poorly informed about CVAs? The crux of their workability is finding a further injection of cash. More money must be found from somewhere to prime the stalled trading engine. Often, however, the historic lending bank is against providing any further cash to its insolvent customer. Negotiating this CVA cash supply is thus the insolvency practitioner's trickiest task, and yet it is precisely the one which both the banks and their 'approved' larger insolvency practitioners most studiously ignore. Their attitude is understandable: more immediate benefit comes from gutting the secured assets or directors' guarantees from a troubled company than creatively risking or seeking yet more funding to attempt its possible salvation. Because neither the leading high street banks nor the insolvency practitioners find it worthwhile to mount such uncharacteristic rescue efforts, we seldom hear about CVAs. Out of sight is out of mind, despite the fact that CVAs were introduced six years ago in part one of the 1986 Insolvency Act. The difficult part in designing any CVA revolves around the awkwardness of the word voluntary - awkward because there is no familiar route or set format to offer the gradually co-operating participants. Each solution is quite flexible within certain rules. What particularly offends many financial fundamentalists is that uniquely under a CVA (as in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US) the remaining sinning directors and managers retain their executive powers. Some feel this is equivalent to letting the fox loose again in the hen house. Yet this misses the point. Insolvency often occurs innocently - the result of circumstance or commercial naivety. Given a viable core business and the genuine will to improve performance, many companies can pull through, although there are no guarantees. An important technical objection to the CVA is the fact that a dissident creditor can block an arrangement by calling in his debts. There is no interim protection to give the majority of creditors any time to agree a CVA. But such protection is not necessary in every case. Much depends on the existing quality of communication with the company's creditors. The company which has built up goodwill and an honourable reputation over years of fair trading practices will seldom find itself abandoned if it can propose a viable recovery plan. The ultimate protection for any CVA lies in the diagnostic skill of the insolvency practitioner, who at the first sign of any consistent awkwardness on the part of directors or managers, will simply abort the co-operative effort and move on to liquidation or receivership. Certainly no insolvency practitioner wishes to be involved with a rescue attempt that he judges will fail. If the lending banks made sustained efforts to inform both their recovery units and their high street managers about the practical, emergency validity of CVAs, several hundred more British companies would undoubtedly be saved from unnecessary death every year. To do so would entail painfully questioning long-standing routines with the banks' existing insolvency practitioners and possibly forging fresh alliances with some of the smaller practices that have specialised in CVA rescues. The financial community's ability to recognise and bite this bullet may prove crucial for any national recovery. To cure our economy we need to learn honestly to cure sick companies rather than simply to pity and eviscerate them.

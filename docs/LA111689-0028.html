			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: CHEESECLOTH LINING SOLVES PROBLEM OF LEFT-BEHIND DRESSING  IN TURKEY  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: As the holiday season draws near, I am reminded of the terrific  hint I received several years ago.  </P> <P> To avoid any of the dangers of left-behind dressing in the turkey, first line  the cavity with cheesecloth, being careful to leave a generous amount outside  to be tucked in after the dressing has been added. Then add the dressing as  always -- loosely, as it swells during cooking.  </P> <P> Follow the same procedure if you stuff both ends of the turkey. It can be  removed like a sack and no stuffing is left behind. Of course, the taste isn't  changed one bit.  </P> <P>  -- C. J., Minneapolis  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Cured hams, smoked turkeys and pheasants have become popular  holiday gift items, but sometimes the cooking and/or storage instructions for  these goodies aren't clear or, in some cases, there are no instructions at all.  </P> <P> If you have any questions about conditions or storage of meats or poultry  received in the mail, call the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA)  Meat and Poultry Hotline, (800) 535-4555, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Pacific  Standard Time.  </P> <P> The Hotline staff has the answers to your questions about the safety of meat  and poultry.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I heat a lot of vegetables and soups in small bowls in my  microwave. I used to use waxed paper or plastic wrap to cover the dishes until  recently when I discovered a better way.  </P> <P> I realized my coffee filters were shaped almost perfectly to fit the tops of  the small bowls. Now I use a coffee filter and the best part is that it can be  used a couple of times if it doesn't become soiled. It also does not shrivel up  from the heat like the wrap does.  </P> <P>  -- VERDA, Bradford, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When my younger sister was moving into her first apartment, we  all wanted to help her set up her new home. We decided to throw her a  housewarming party. However, many of our family members are on limited budgets  and unable to buy expensive gifts.  </P> <P> Then I got the following idea. I asked all the invited guests to bring items  they no longer needed. The items had to be usable and in good condition, just  "old hat" or not wanted for one reason or another.  </P> <P> She got all types of pots and pans, dishware, silverware and cloth items. She  also got larger items like a television stand, a bookshelf and even an old  desk. She got a lot of things for setting up her own little home.  </P> <P> The party was quite a success and she really appreciated the time and effort  spent in organizing the event.  </P> <P>  -- BARBARA, New York, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR BARBARA: You sure put on your thinking hat. This is an easy way for  families and friends to help make an easy transition to a new home.  </P> <P> If there are things that can't be used, please don't forget to donate to your  local battered women's shelter. They can use all types of household items.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I solved the problem of leftover food storage in my refrigerator.  There was never enough room with all the different size containers.  </P> <P> Now I've started using the plastic, zipper-top storage bags. They are so handy.  You can take them right from the fridge to the microwave, and you will be  surprised at the amount of space this saves.  </P> <P>  -- BARBARA, Kingsland, Ga.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: For anyone who has arthritis or rheumatism, here's a very helpful  way to get tops off of bottles. Use your hand-held nutcracker. It opens wide so  you don't have to close your hand tight, and the grooves on it make it grip the  bottle top so the top comes off easily without a lot of effort on your part.  </P> <P>  -- MARJORIE, Bradford, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Before storing your barbecue grill away for the winter months, be  sure and wash the grate well. An unwashed grate sitting all winter can build up  bacteria that will cause food poisoning.  </P> <P> This happened to my family this past summer. The barbecue grate was not cleaned  well before storing, and when we brought it out for the first summer barbecue,  my husband did not wash the grate nor did we use aluminum foil over it. We both  ended up with food poisoning.  </P> <P> Even though we now wash the grate after each use, a good rule of thumb is to  also wash it before using, especially after storage.  </P> <P>  -- EVELYN, Canfield, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I found an excellent way to reduce my weight. Although I may have  2,000 calories each day, I try to limit them to 1,700.  </P> <P> I bought a small book that lists every kind of food and the calorie content of  each. On a pad, I keep track of everything I eat at each meal, every day.  </P> <P> You'd be surprised how easy it is to stop eating and snacking when I reach my  daily limit. Sometimes I stop at 1,700, even 1,200. The pounds come off slowly,  but they stay off -- it works.  </P> <P>  -- HELEN, Yardville Heights, N.J.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We had some really bad weather lately and the electricity was off  from time to time. The other night it was off for a couple of hours.  </P> <P> I am wondering if I should have thrown away the dairy items that were in my  refrigerator. Do you have any information on how long they can stay in a  refrigerator with the electricity off and still not spoil?  </P> <P>  -- JODIE, Houston  </P> <P> DEAR JODIE: When electricity goes out, the first thing we do is open the  refrigerator to check on the items. Well, this is the worst thing to do. You  should leave the refrigerator door shut to allow the cool air to stay in it.  </P> <P> Generally dairy items will not spoil for four to six hours in an unopened  refrigerator. You may also want to check the "use by" date. If it's an item  that is almost out of date, it may not last as long as an item that has a newer  date.  </P> <P> Some dairy foods are more perishable than others, so if you have any doubts  about the freshness of an item, toss it.  </P> <P> And next time, don't open that door.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I found a wonderful baking tip. When baking goods for my family,  I was always concerned with all the sugar that I was adding.  </P> <P> Now I add half sugar and half heat-stable diet sweetener. For most recipes this  will work. Now I bake more often and feel better knowing that the sugar content  is not quite so high.  </P> <P>  -- DELORES, Miami  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I received a beautiful bottle of wine for my birthday. I wanted  to do something with it as a decoration in my kitchen.  </P> <P> There was one thing I had to do first and that was to remove the cork that had  been pushed into the bottle. I mentioned it to my friend and she said she had  success with pouring ammonia in the bottle and keeping it in a place with good  circulation. I tried it and in less then a week the cork had completely  disintegrated. I cleaned the inside well with soap and water.  </P> <P> I have it hanging on a wall along with other kitchen gadgets and get many  compliments on the arrangement.  </P> <P>  -- DORIS, San Francisco  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My son plays baseball almost every night with his friends at a  nearby park. Last night when he played, he had a slight accident and sprained  his ankle.  </P> <P> When I heard he was hurt I ran to the park, but thank goodness it wasn't bad. A  neighbor had a zipper-type bag with crushed ice cubes and a towel over it on  his ankle to reduce the swelling.  </P> <P> I thought that was a clever idea for anyone who doesn't own an ice pack. It  certainly did the trick until I got my son to a doctor.  </P> <P>  -- M. B., Huntington, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I've always known white vinegar can be useful for many things,  but never realized there are hundreds of uses. I'd like to pass on a few.  </P> <P> Did you know that most decals and stickers on windows can be removed by putting  vinegar on them? Paint a few coats on, let soak for a few minutes and the  stickers will wash off easily.  </P> <P> My husband's lunch box started getting a terrible odor, so I dampened a piece  of bread with vinegar and put it in the lunch box overnight. I washed it the  next morning and was surprised to see how fresh-smelling it was.  </P> <P> One more thing I did with vinegar was remove new deodorant stains from my  husband's shirts. All I did was rub the area before washing them. I'm so happy  with it I always keep a gallon handy.  </P> <P>  -- M. B., Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My brand-new wooden bread box taints our bread with a terrible  flavor and odor. Airing hasn't helped any. What else can I do?  </P> <P>  -- JONI, Columbus, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR JONI: Most of the bread boxes that have an odor problem are made of pine,  which has a resin in the wood that gives off the strong smell. If this is the  case, it may be impossible to get rid of the odor.  </P> <P> You can try putting charcoal in the box for a few days and see if it will  absorb the odor. You might also want to try an air-tight plastic container that  would fit inside your bread box to actually hold the bread, with the wooden box  just being decorative.  </P> <P> If you can't get rid of the odor, try to find another use for the bread box.  They're really attractive in the kitchen and can be used to store things that  the odor wouldn't be a problem for, such as coupons, stationery or even small  appliances like your hand mixer.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Please settle a question for me. How are potatoes supposed to be  stored and which type is the best? I'm getting a lot of conflicting ideas from  my mother and my new mother-in-law.  </P> <P>  -- CONFUSED, Boston  </P> <P> DEAR CONFUSED: Potatoes are easy to store. Just keep them in a dark, dry place  that's relatively cool, about 40 to 50 degrees. Don't put them in the fridge;  the cold makes the starch change to sugar and that changes their taste and  texture. Also, don't store them with onions; the moisture from the potatoes can  cause the onions to start sprouting.  </P> <P> Potatoes will keep for several weeks if you purchase good ones. That means pick  those that aren't soft, bruised, cracked, wrinkled, sprouting "eyes" or look  greenish.  </P> <P> As to which one is best, it depends on what it will be used for. There are  several varieties and each has different characteristics.  </P> <P> Russet Burbank potatoes are the large, oblong ones with dark, rough skin. They  cook up fluffy and make great mashed potatoes and French fries. Idaho russets  are favorites for baking. California and White Rose all-purpose long potatoes  are oblong with thin, smooth skin. They're best for roasting, boiling, steaming  and pan frying.  </P> <P> Round white potatoes, such as all-purpose round, Eastern and Maine varieties,  also have thin, smooth, beige skins and are used much the same way as the long  ones as well as in soups and stews. Round red potatoes are perfect for steaming  or boiling and so are excellent for salads. Always cook them with the skins on.  </P> <P> It's best to cook all potatoes whole with the skins on. They retain more  vitamins that way. Potatoes are high in Vitamin C and potassium, as well as  being a great source of fiber and complex carbohydrates.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPOe Chairman Federal Chancellor Franz </F> Vranitzky by Hubertus Czernin and Herbert Lackner; place and  date not given: "`Not All of Us Were Kreiskys'"]    [Excerpts] [PROFIL] How did you sleep on the night of 13  March [after the SPOe suffered major losses in the provincial  elections in Tirol, Salzburg, and Carinthia]?    [Vranitzky] Very badly, and not long enough, because I was  on the telephone until after midnight.    [PROFIL] And the fact that, at the time, you had already  decided that Peter Ambrozy would have to resign as chairman of  the Carinthian Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPoe], did  not improve your sleep?    [Vranitzky] It did not make the bad results any better.    [PROFIL] According to pollsters, four out of five Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe] voters said that they had voted for  Haider's party because the FPOe was exposing the mess produced  by the big parties. Is this not also a vote that goes beyond  the context of a provincial election but also has something to  do with politics at the federal level?    [Vranitzky] It is absolutely clear that we cannot say at the  federal level that we are not affected by the election result.  Still, I do think that Sunday's elections were first and  foremost affected by regional affairs. [passage omitted]    [PROFIL] Somebody, whom you do not appreciate a lot -- the  chairman of the FPOe -- undoubtedly managed to win votes from  groups of people who used to be traditional SPOe supporters.  One in four FPOe voters is a worker, while this percentage is  only insignificantly higher for the SPOe.    [Vranitzky] This has not least to do with the fact that the  significance of party work at the grassroots level has  diminished. It is true that Haider has raised issues that are  related to workers. Yet, it is equally true that, in reality,  he is making major pronouncements and promises that can easily  be weakened or disclosed as half-truths or lies. Yet this  disclosing is not taking place to a sufficient degree.    [PROFIL] This brings up the question whether disclosing such  things is enough to prevent the voters from supporting Haider in  the polls.    [Vranitzky] It is not the argument alone, it is also the way  in which such an argument is presented. It is also a question  of rhetorics and clarity.    [PROFIL] People have been voting for Haider for almost eight  years now. Neither the SPOe nor the Austrian People's Party  [OeVP] have been able to think up a convincing strategy.    [Vranitzky] This is not a purely Austrian phenomenon. The  progress of civilization does not only produce winners. Those  who lose or, at least think that they are not among the winners,  are particularly responsive to those who criticize our  highly-developed, highly liberal system.    [PROFIL] Has the FPOe not meanwhile become too big for the  others still to maintain that it is nothing but a protest party  that represents the losers?    [Vranitzky] This is not what I said. This group of voters  has been added to the traditional FPOe voters.    [PROFIL] [President of Parliament] Heinz Fischer once said  that Haider would ultimately win himself to death. Do you see a  dying man somewhere on the horizon?    [Vranitzky] It has become clear that the SPOe's good results  in surveys at a national level are not a warranty. There is no  election victory without fighting. Therefore, I do not want to  deal with the question whether he has won himself to death or  whether he has reached a ceiling.</p>

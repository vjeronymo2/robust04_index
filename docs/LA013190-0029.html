			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ACLU TAKES CASE OF LATINOS ARRESTED AT CHURCH  </P> <P> The local ACLU announced Tuesday that it is pressing three new cases involving  religious freedoms, including an incident last fall in which two ministers of a  Latino church in North County were handcuffed and removed from their Sunday  services by sheriff's deputies responding to a noise complaint.  </P> <P> The other two cases concern the cross atop Mt. Helix and the cross emblazoned  on the shoulder patches of the La Mesa police uniform. But it was the intrusion  by San Diego County deputies into the Apostolic Church of the Faith of Jesus  Christ that drew the most ire from the ACLU officials.  </P> <P> Along with the church leaders being arrested during the service in Fallbrook,  the officials said, one deputy flung a Bible in the air and the church flag was  knocked over.  </P> <P> "The image of them being arrested and handcuffed is truly one of the most  repugnant images we can think of in a country that protects religious  freedoms," said Betty Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil Liberties  Union Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties.  </P> <P> D. Dwight Worden, the ministers' attorney who is working with the rights group  to defend the preachers against the disturbing-the-peace complaint, added:  </P> <P> "The maximum penalty for this infraction is only a $250 fine, but I can tell  you that I'm taking it as one of the most serious cases I've ever handled."  </P> <P> But sheriff's reports describing the Oct. 15 arrest said that about 20  complaints were filed in a four-month period because of noise from the tiny  church, whose services are animated. The church on Kalmia Street is in a  residential area, and neighbors were upset because the congregation's public  address system disturbed the neighborhood quiet. The neighbors said they were  unable to take naps or hear television.  </P> <P> The deputies' reports said the church leaders had been warned repeatedly about  noise complaints, but, on Sunday afternoon Oct. 15, there was loud "yelling,  pounding, clapping, and chanting."  </P> <P> Deputies Dan Megna and Linda Powell received a signed complaint from Norene  Brock, who lives in an apartment complex just south of the church. The officers  went inside the church, crowded with about 70 worshipers, including children.  </P> <P> "The congregation was standing with their hands over their head, eyes closed,  chanting," the officers' reports said. "A minister was standing behind a  (lectern) yelling into a P.A. system to the crowd."  </P> <P> The pastor, Daniel Perez, stood in the deputies' way and refused to move or  cooperate, according to the reports. "He kept saying basically God was in  control, not him. At no time did he attempt to quiet the group or offer to turn  off the P.A. system," the reports said.  </P> <P> The pastor was arrested and handcuffed by Megna when "he put his hands out in  front of him and said, 'Go ahead,' " the report said. While Perez was taken to  the patrol car outside, an assistant pastor, Reynaldo Flores Pizano, was  clinging to the lectern as he was being arrested by Powell.  </P> <P> "She said he began to incite the congregation when I arrested Perez," Megna  said in his report. "The crowd was much louder at this point, chanting and  yelling. At one point, the congregation became so loud and unruly that I  requested additional deputies from Vista."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department investigators impounded the church's public address  system, which they are using as evidence for the March 12 trial in Municipal  Court in Vista.  </P> <P> The two ministers, who speak only Spanish, could not be contacted Tuesday. But,  in the deputies' reports, it is clear that Perez and Pizano did not believe  they were bothering their neighbors.  </P> <P> "We are just praising the Lord," Perez was quoted as telling the deputies when  they asked him to turn down the P.A. system.  </P> <P> The ACLU's Wheeler and defense attorney Worden suggested Tuesday that there may  be racial overtones in the case because the church has a Latino congregation  and the arresting deputies are white.  </P> <P> "My initial reaction is that I'm suspicious of that issue," Worden said.  </P> <P> However, except for defending the two arrested church leaders, Worden said he  has not lodged a formal complaint with the sheriff's internal affairs unit, nor  has he filed a civil claim or lawsuit against the department.  </P> <P> Sgt. Jim Cooke, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department, said he was unaware  of allegations that a Bible was tossed from the lectern into the lap of one of  the worshipers or of the flag being knocked over. He also denied any racial  motivation in the situation.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that would be the case," he said. "This has been an ongoing  situation. But I can't imagine there would be any kind of racial overtones to  this."  </P> <P> In the other cases, the ACLU filed federal lawsuits Tuesday against San Diego  County, alleging that county officials violate the doctrine of separation of  church and state by maintaining the Christian cross affixed atop Mt. Helix.  </P> <P> The cross, county amphitheater and park atop Mt. Helix were deeded to the  county in 1929, and county officials routinely spend taxpayers' money by  keeping them clean of graffiti and other problems, Wheeler said.  </P> <P> "The Latin cross is a religious symbol of Christianity," she said in the  lawsuit. "The permanent display of the cross on Mt. Helix conveys an  unmistakable message of government endorsement of the Christian faith."  </P> <P> However Robert Lerner, a county spokesman, said no government money is used to  maintain the cross.  </P> <P> "There's nothing improper and there's nothing illegal about having the cross  there," he said. "There isn't anything to maintain. We maintain the trees and  the grounds in the park, but the cross is just there."  </P> <P> The ACLU filed a second federal lawsuit against the city of La Mesa, saying  that it is a constitutional violation for La Mesa police officers to wear  shoulder patches depicting a cross.  </P> <P> However, La Mesa police and city officials contend that the emblems are simply  symbolic of the Mt. Helix-La Mesa area and carry no religious significance.  </P></p>

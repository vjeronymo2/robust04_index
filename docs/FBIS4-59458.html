			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 12 May (MENA)--Ambassador 'Uthman Ahmad  'Uthman, head of the Egyptian delegation to the meetings of the  Refugee Affairs Committee stemming from the multilateral talks,  has stated that several countries have decided to give financial  assistance to the tune of $50 million to the Palestinian  refugees. He said that this assistance is designed to improve  the refugees' standard of living.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, Ambassador Ahmad 'Uthman  said that the Refugee Affairs Committee has prepared a report on  the condition of the Palestinian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon,  who thought they were excluded from the peace process. He noted  that a special committee had inspected their living, economic,  and social conditions and submitted a report to the Refugee  Committee. Accordingly, several countries decided to give  financial assistance to improve the conditions of the  Palestinian refugees who live outside the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    In his statement, Ambassador 'Uthman said that other  countries had also decided to give technical assistance and to  finance economic projects to improve the conditions of the  refugees inside and outside the occupied territories without  harming their political rights, including their right to return.  He affirmed that the philosophy of the Refugee Affairs  Committee is to promote the refugees' living conditions until a  final solution to their problem is reached. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Ilyas [name indistinct], head of the Palestinian  delegation to the Refugee Affairs Committee, said that the  Palestinian delegation has demanded that all the UN resolutions  pertaining to the Palestinian issue be implemented and be a  basis form the authority of the Committee. The Palestinian  delegation noted that there should be no contradiction between  the Refugee Affairs Committee's work and the refugees' political  rights and future status, he said.    The head of the Palestinian delegation said that working out  a final solution to the refugee's problem will be dealt with  within the context of Palestinian-Israeli political  negotiations, slated to be held at the start of the third year  of Palestinian autonomy. He said there are six million  Palestinians, and those include three million refugees who are  seeking to return to the homeland.</p>

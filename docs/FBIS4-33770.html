			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 12 Jun (EFE) -- About  to conclude his four-year term, and in advance of his assuming  office as OAS secretary general, Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria is preparing to receive the leaders of the 23  member-countries of the Ibero-American community in Cartagena de  Indias. Beginning Tuesday, and for 48 hours, the presidents  will hold the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and  Government.    In an exclusive interview with EFE, Gaviria, who will cease  to be president on 7 August and will likely assume office as OAS  secretary general in September, explored some issues related to  Latin American integration and to the future of the OAS.    [EFE] What is Colombia's outlook as it prepares to host the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit?    [Gaviria] We expect this summit, as the others that have  preceded it, to result in an exchange of ideas and experiences  and to be productive. We will debate economic issues, trade,  investment, how to unite the trade processes we are involved in,  how to improve opportunities for investment and savings in  America, and how to preserve our special links with Spain and  Portugal, which are our bridge to the European Union [EU].    [EFE] Is this bridge truly operational?    [Gaviria] It has been working. It is our link with the EU,  particularly via Spain. I think it is very useful. There have  been disagreements, such as on the Andean countries'  preferences. In the specific case of the preferential treatment  that Colombia receives from the EU, the battle that Spain waged  and the support we received from this country were decisive.    [EFE] Does Colombia regard these annual summits as useful?  Does Colombia think it is necessary to hold these summits  annually, or would it prefer them to be held every two years?    [Gaviria] We are maintaining a neutral position on this  issue. We believe that the agendas of some countries tend to be  a little overloaded for annual summits. This is not true in our  case, however, and we support any decision made. We would vote  neither for nor against holding these meetings on an annual  basis.    [EFE] How do you think the Cartagena de Indias summit will  influence the hemispheric summit President Bill Clinton has  called to be held in Miami in December? Do you think the two  meetings are compatible?    [Gaviria] I do not think either meeting will conflict with  the other. First, the two agendas are very different. The  subjects we will discuss with Spain and Portugal are very  different from those we will discuss with the United States, a  country with which we hold a much more complex, intensive, and,  in some aspects, a much more conflicting relationship, but a  relationship that offers us many opportunities. I do not see  the two meetings competing with one another.    Some references to the Miami summit will probably be made in  the Ibero-American summit. At least from Colombia's viewpoint,  I do not see any kind of incompatibility regarding time or  agendas. These summits apparently have demonstrated their  usefulness and potential. Regarding the future, we should hold  more, not less, of these kinds of meetings on the continent. I  do not believe the presidents will have trouble attending  several summits.    [EFE] What will the Ibero-American leaders tell Fidel Castro  in Cartagena de Indias that they have not told him already?  What do you think of the fact that he was not invited to the  Miami meeting?    [Gaviria] I do not know what other heads of state will tell  Castro. That is one subject that has been overlooked a bit. At  the beginning, the subject of Cuba appeared to come up  frequently in the summits, but now it has fallen away. More  importance is attached these days to exchanging experiences and  ideas than to an intensive debate with Cuba. The possibility of  this subject springing up in a summit should not be ruled out,  however. Regarding the Miami summit, it is a U.S. initiative,  and, because of this, the United States has specified which  countries it wants to attend and has left out Cuba, probably  because there are no diplomatic relations between the two  countries.    [EFE] In the Group of Three, Colombia has been one of the  leading countries in the debate about relations with Cuba. Do  you not feel a little frustrated to see that the rapprochement  with Castro has not resulted in a political opening?    [Gaviria] Well, it is true that the economic opening has  been  considerably greater than the political opening. Nevertheless,  I appreciate the changes that have been taking place in Cuba.  The international community and myself regard these changes as  insufficient, but I think they are moving in the right  direction. Everyone expects to see more political changes that  will make it possible for Cuba to be reinstated in the  inter-American system.    [EFE] You will assume office as OAS secretary general in a  few months. What do you think of your role as secretary  general? What changes does the organization require? Which of  these changes are most pressing?    [Gaviria] I do not think immediate changes will be  introduced, because decisions in an international organization  such as OAS are by nature made by consensus and made gradually.  The secretary general can make suggestions, but it could take  months, even years, for these suggestions to become changes. I  think, however, that all across the continent there is a desire  for the organization to adapt itself to the new agenda on the  continent: trade and strengthening democracy and the mechanisms  for the protection of human rights and the environment. This  task could take many years but, if it is completed, it can make  the OAS stronger and make it serve to meet the countries' most  urgent needs.    [EFE] Do you agree with the frequently voiced charge that  the  OAS is an over-bureaucratized and slow organization?    [Gaviria] Although there was important progress in the way  of  modernization during Joao Baena Soares' term, the OAS has  undergone an experience common to any truly international  organization: The world changes much faster than these  organizations, and, for this reason, the OAS lagged behind a  little. The idea now is to put it in step with these changes.</p>

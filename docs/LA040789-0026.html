			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LPGA NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> FEW COMPLAINTS ARE HEARD AS TEMPERATURE TOPS 100  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the golfers didn't seem to be bothered Thursday by the 102-degree  heat during the first round of the Red Robin Kyocera Inamori tournament at  StoneRidge.  </P> <P> For example, Pamela Wright, a native of Scotland who shot a 70, said, "It was  very nice out there. I like it. It beats the cold and dreary weather back  home."  </P> <P> There were more complaints about bumpy greens than anything else, those coming  from the women who had late tee times. The wind that started about 11 a.m. also  was a factor. Most of the low scores were posted in the morning.  </P> <P> Sherri Turner, a diabetic, had been concerned about the heat but said, "I had  no problems at all. I took less insulin this morning than usual, brought along  a banana and some crackers and drank a lot of water. I like the heat. It helps  me stay loose."  </P> <P> Co-leader Deedee Lasker (68) was the only San Diego area entrant who broke par.  </P> <P> Other scores: Meg Mallon, Ramona, 73; Heather Drew, Solana Beach, and Yuka  Irie, Carlsbad, 74; Kathryn Young, Coronado, 75; Debbie Skinner, Chula Vista,  78; Sharon Barrett, Spring Valley, 84. Amateur Allison Shapcott, a U.S.  International student from England, shot an 82. BOB WOLF  </P></p>

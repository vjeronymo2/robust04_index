			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report concerning a 12-14 May 1994 roundtable </F> meeting of scholars of the Russian Federation and Ukraine  regarding the relations of the two countries: "Appeal"]    [Text] We, scholars of the Foreign Policy Research Center  of the IMEPI [International Economic and Political Research  Institute] of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the  International Research Center of Odessa University, after  assembling in Odessa on 12-14 May 1994 for a regular conference  of the "Roundtable of Ukrainian and Russian Scholars," discussed  the current state and outlook for Russian-Ukrainian relations  and came to the following conclusions:    The struggle of two tendencies in the relations of our two  countries--the moderate and the compromising, which is directed  at the search for mutually acceptable resolutions--and the  confrontational, which incites a further worsening of relations,  is obviously turning out in favor of the latter. Relations are  forming between Russia and Ukraine that are reminiscent of the  "cold war," and a "war of nerves" is going on that is fraught  with border disputes and interethnic clashes.    And this is at a time when an overwhelming part of the  population of one and the other country is not experiencing  hostility toward each other.    Moreover, the traditional friendly relations of the two  peoples urgently require amicable interstate relations.    Political elites are competing between themselves who, as it  seems to us, cannot find a common language by virtue of the  obsession with imperial great power ambitions on the one hand,  and the so-called "Pereyaslavl complex," with excessive fears  regarding a threat to Ukrainian independence--on the other hand.    Under conditions of a lack of clear state rule from both  sides, too great a force in the adoption of political decisions  is acquired by the generals and admirals and their small but  very active ultrapatriotic, chauvinist circles in both Russia  and in Ukraine.    This threatens that the ruling state structures will lose  control of the situation. It looks especially explosive in  connection with the recent presidential elections in the Crimea,  the provocative statements of Crimean President Meshkov and the  position of the command of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Similar  actions could cause a chain reaction of the further  regionalization of Ukraine and Russia at best, and at worst--it  could unleash a civil war.    We are categorically against the policy of the two countries  being determined by generals and admirals among whose functions  this does not fall. We are against the emergence of a "Crimean  Zhirinovskiy" in Ukraine, and more specifically in the Crimea.    After considering numerous problems in Ukrainian-Russian  relations, many of which have an undoubtedly objective  character, in particular economic, international-legal, and  culturological, we came to the conclusion that these problems  are completely resolvable, given the competence, persistence,  and tolerance of the sides. And the main thing: Given a clear  realization of the desire to come to a mutually acceptable  compromise by means of bilateral concessions that do not affect  state sovereignty and the independence that was recently  acquired by both sides.    During the course of our discussions, we coordinated the  measure and volume of such concessions and are prepared to  report them to the authoritative structures.    Being loyal citizens of both countries and at the same time  professionals in the field of international relations, we  caution the governments and the authoritative structures of both  sides against playing with fire. The recent events in the area  of Odessa were a striking example of the possible uncontrollable  development of events. These kinds of incidents, given the  current nature of authority in both countries, are entirely  probable in the future as well. It is difficult to predict how  local military authorities will behave in this case, just as it  is difficult to predict the chain reaction of similar events.    At the same time, careful analysis of the foreign policy of  both countries shows a real possibility not only of resolving  bilateral problems, but also of effectively achieving an  "international division of labor" in current international  relations, in the resolution of problems of European security  and relations with developing countries, in the resolution of  problems of domestic and world economies and participation in  joint international projects, and in the development of common  positions in relations with the leading countries of the  West--without unnecessary competition and ambitious political  games of the ruling circles of Ukraine and Russia.    We view this appeal as a serious warning to the governments  and public organizations of both countries, and we urgently  request that it be taken into account in the preparation of  decisions that affect the fundamental interests of Ukraine and  Russia.</p>

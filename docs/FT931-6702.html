			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Fashion: Navy and white: a classic combination cruises on - Avril Groom welcomes fashion's equivalent of the first cuckoo of spring IN THE shifting world of fashion it is comforting to find a rare constant. As surely as spring follows winter, once the doors have closed on the greyed and fingered remnants of the January sales the store-rails turn blue, intermixed with white and cream. There are fashion followers who await the first delivery of navy and white as a sign of spring, much as keen birdwatchers record the first cuckoo. Once the clothes arrive, they are inevitably labelled 'the nautical look' so it is interesting that, in a year when the mood of fashion is totally removed from the crisp uniformity of that epithet, this colour combination is as strong as ever. It is an easy look to market in the uncertain weather of early spring, translating as well into the classic shapes and lightweight wools that sell at that time as into the flimsy fabrics of high summer. But the appeal of it goes much deeper than a brass-buttoned blazer. Navy and white is fresh and optimistic after the heavy, dark shades of winter, and embodies the idea of travel in its widest form. The nautical connotation suggests journeying for pleasure to, or on, the sea, which even for the affluent used to be a summer activity rather than an all-year option. It also appeals to the human penchant for nostalgia for it goes back a long way, to the original bloomered bathing-dress and the sailor-suits and dresses which children wore early this century and which design leader Gianni Versace has now exploited in the striped, sailor-collared shapes of his couture collection for this summer. By the 1920s travel had become a fashionable end in itself for the monied and leisured, leading to a new genre of clothing, labelled first in America and later in Europe as cruisewear. It is to the heyday of staterooms and dinner at the captain's table that this year's navy and white harks back, to the time when the rich shuttled across the Atlantic with complete suites of Louis Vuitton flat-topped trunks in the hold of a liner. Cruises now have a different image, requiring rather briefer and more colourful clothing. But as the novelist Robert Louis Stevenson wrote more than 100 years ago: 'Young and old, we are all on our last cruise,' and recreating some of that lost elegance in the contemporary wardrobe is seductively aspirational - even if we are only cruising to the office, a dinner date or, at best, a villa in Tuscany by charter flight with one holdall. In the retro mish-mash of this spring's styles, inspired by the 1930s and 1940s as filtered by the 1970s, softness and lightness are the keywords. The graceful, fluted lines created by the lightest fabrics, whether bias- or generously-cut, are the gentlest and most flattering way to wear what may seem, after years of power tailoring, an alien way of dressing. Certainly it means giving up to some extent the comfort of more solid fabrics - so this could well be the spring of the thermal vest. Keep in the mind the elegance of old-style cruisewear and the look will fall into place, from sporty casuals to dinner dress. There is no need to abandon a tailored navy jacket, especially if it has pretensions to the curvy, swashbuckling style favoured by designers Rifat Ozbek and Christian Lacroix, but swap metal buttons for plain covered ones and make sure anything you wear with it is meltingly fluid. A softly ruffled chiffon shirt and layered chiffon skirt is the combination seen most often on the catwalks. In the same vein, well-cut classic cream or white trousers still look right but are no longer worn with a blazer - try a softly-wrapped jacket or loose silk shirt instead. If you are buying new trousers, choose a loose, soft shape, widening towards the ankle if you dare, in a fluid fabric - crepe is the season's big hit. The same fluidity applies to dresses, which need a swing in their long skirts, or at least a split to give a similar but sexier effect. Accessories are important - go for large, soft-brimmed, face-framing hats rather than nautical caps, the new, rounded-looking, platform-soled shoes, and use jewellery sparingly in the form of long, simple bead ropes, plain but chunky bangles or Art Deco-inspired earrings. But the final strength of this colour scheme is its universality. Some find it works better with white, others with cream, but there is hardly anyone it does not suit at all. If you go for colour analysis you will learn that there are many shades of navy - picked out for you will be 'your' navy, the one that suits you best. Finding that exact shade in the shops will be another matter - but rest assured that some store, somewhere, has the navy wherewithal to give you the elegance of cruising times past.</p>

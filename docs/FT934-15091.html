			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (10): Flexible and resilient - Machine tools industry ITALY is the world's third-largest producer of machine tools, behind Japan and Germany, but significantly it has only four companies among the 40 leading European manufacturers. The flexibility provided by the relatively small size of Italian producers has made them resilient, but by no means impervious, to the industry's downturn. World consumption of machine tools and manufacturing systems fell 21.1 per cent to Dollars 31bn last year. Against that picture, Italian consumption dropped 14.1 per cent at current prices in 1992 to L3,161bn. A further, although more moderate, decline is being repeated this year, says UCIMU, the association which represents 237 Italian machine tool makers accounting for 70 per cent of sales. Orders in the second quarter were 5.9 per cent down on the same period in 1992. The problems afflicting this sector, which is the thermometer of industrial health, have been highlighted by a debt crisis at Mandelli, the Piacenza-based factory automation group which occupies seventeenth place among Europe's top 40, a list dominated by German manufacturers but led by Comau, the Fiat subsidiary. The indebtedness of Mandelli - whose present aversion to publicity contrasts sharply with its attitude during the booming 1980s - springs from the acquisition by the publicly-quoted group of five companies which were quick to suffer from the downturn. Now, Bankers Trust, heading 30 bank creditors, is considering a restructuring plan for debts of L537.6bn which are more than twice the group's turnover. There would also be an injection of capital and the Mandelli family's majority share stake would fall to 9 per cent. The company believed it needed to reach a critical mass to compete on the international stage but observers are sceptical that synergy is necessarily achieved by Mandelli-style takeovers. Italy has a very different ownership structure from that of Germany, its main European competitor. While German groups on average had 265 employees in 1991, Italian companies had 71. The number of machine tool employees in Italy fell from 31,500 in 1991 to 29,230 last year (against Britain's 13,000). Nearly a third of Italian companies had recourse last year to the 'cassa integrazione' system of state-assisted short-term lay-offs but UCIMU says that only a tiny proportion faces protection from creditors. Mr Flavio Radice, UCIMU'S chairman, says: 'It's true the small size of companies has helped them face the crisis. But we must be prepared for the recovery, and to be small is not so good then.' UCIMU is therefore pressing companies to collaborate in exports and, where appropriate within Italy, to make a joint bid for a single order. The organisation cites, as an example, a recent exhibition in Bologna where forming machines of 14 companies combined to make a single saucepan production line. This line was later sold. The emphasis is on collaboration in Europe, too. This prompted UCIMU to host a European-wide convention of manufacturers and customers at Cernobbio earlier this month called 'Preparing Recovery'. Italy maintained its place as the world's third-largest machine tool exporter last year despite a 5.4 per cent fall in foreign sales to L2,012bn, accounting for 48 per cent of production. Two-thirds went to Europe but the star performance so far this year has undoubtedly been exports to China, following a 1992 exhibition by Italian companies in Beijing. Sales to China in the first quarter were not far short of total sales there in the whole of 1992, a result which has pushed China up from eighth place as an overseas market to second, behind Germany. The Italian export philosophy is to tailor high-quality products to a client's need. 'We solve a client's problems, we don't sell a machine tool,' says Mr Radice. UCIMU is convinced that, bad as times are, manufacturers are continuing to innovate. The Italian presence at last month's EMO machine tool fair in Hanover was bigger than that of any other country, bearing witness to the sector's innovation and flair.</p>

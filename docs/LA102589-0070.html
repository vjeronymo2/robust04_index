			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPORARY BAN UPHELD ON SCHOOLBOOKS  </P> <P> The Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Board of Education early Tuesday  upheld a temporary ban on reading books that sparked a debate about morbid  imagery but agreed to reprint and keep teaching some less controversial stories  and poems while it evaluates the entire series.  </P> <P> The compromise, reached after more than five hours of heated discussion, failed  to appease many of the 500 people who squeezed into the Cedarlane Junior High  School auditorium in Hacienda Heights.  </P> <P> "They have to terminate the whole series," said Denise Hill, who took her  8-year-old daughter Daphne out of class this week and will enroll her in  private school. "We won't be satisfied with them removing just a portion of the  books. There are still stories about magic."  </P> <P> On the other side were parents like Mark A. Peterson, who warned that the  hysteria could lead to book-burning. "What is involved is a basic attack on the  liberties of all of us in this country," he said. "If we object to these  stories, the next step is to attack and remove other stories which have been  told in Western society for generations."  </P> <P> The debate focuses around "Impressions," a series of literature-based reading  books published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd. and used in  first through sixth grades. Protests have already been mounted in several  Oregon and Washington communities where religious activists have claimed that  the series promotes witchcraft and magic.  </P> <P> The books have also raised issues about conflicts between First Amendment  rights and parents' rights to censor what their children read. Not all the  selections in the "Impressions" series are considered objectionable; some are  classics like William Farley's "The Black Stallion."  </P> <P> School administrators defend the series as a whole, however, and blame the  protests on a group of parents with strong religious beliefs who have inflamed  others in the district, which has 22,295 students from La Puente, Hacienda  Heights, Industry and Valinda.  </P> <P> School officials also say that some of the controversial stories had been  removed from a revised edition they reviewed and approved earlier this year.  </P> <P> For instance, officials approved books that contained the standard "Twelve Days  of Christmas" but got instead in one of the books a version with "a wart snake  in a fig tree."  </P> <P> "An honest mistake was made," said Irv Rem, the assistant superintendent for  instructional services who said the textbook series cost $378,000. "The books  my board received to review were not the edition of books that were shipped."  </P> <P> Parents responded with cries of "Send them back! Let's get our money back!"  They also threatened to picket the district, take their children out of school  for a day and vote out school board members.  </P></p>

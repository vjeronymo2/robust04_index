The investigation is focusing on how their real estate  holdings have changed since the last property registration early  last year, committee officials said.    To carry out its work, the committee obtained real estate  registers from the Home and Construction Ministries and the  National Tax Administration.    The committee has also asked banks and other financial  institutions to provide financial data related to 120 to 130  civil servants who registered no change in their financial  assets, though they are considered to have made asset changes.    Examination of the financial data will start early next  month  when the committee obtains the data, an official said.    The investigation will be completed toward the end of May,  and those civil servants found to have falsely registered  propertychanges will face punishment including dismissal and  fines of up to 20 million won.</p>

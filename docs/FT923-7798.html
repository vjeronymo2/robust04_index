			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Semi-Tech to invest in joint venture in Shanghai SEMI-TECH, the Hong Kong owner of the Singer Company, yesterday announced a major thrust into the mainland Chinese market. It unveiled plans to invest USDollars 14m with Singer in a sewing machine joint venture in Shanghai and up to USDollars 100m over coming years in related ventures in China. Semi-Tech and Singer will join with Shanghai Yah Chong Sewing Machine Company to form Singer (Shanghai) Sewing Machine Company. Singer will own 70 per cent of the venture and its Chinese partner, which will contribute USDollars 6m, the balance. Singer will provide manu-facturing technology and management for the joint venture which is expected to occupy a 40,000 square metre site in the Shanghai Minhang economic and development zone of the city. The factory there will produce multi-function zig-zag machines which can be operated either manually or electrically. The company will be permitted to sell up to 70 per cent of its production on the Chinese market - the highest percentage yet offered to a foreign joint-venture - and export the remainder, principally to Africa and the Middle East. Singer will be allowed to repatriate profits in equal proportion to its foreign sales, company executives said. Production is expected to take place in three stages. From October this year, the company will import 20,000 knocked-down machines for assembly. By 1994, production is expected to reach 200,000 units as imports are phased out in favour of domestically produced machines. Phase three, to be completed by 1995, will result in full production of 400,000 units a year. Singer plans to open a chain of up to 100 stores throughout China to market not only its sewing machines but other consumer durables. Three sites have already been chosen in Shanghai and two in Guangzhou (Canton). Mr James Ting, chairman of both Semi-Tech and Singer, said that, with Singer's retail distribution expertise and Semi-Tech's intimate knowledge of the China market, 'we are confident that Singer Shanghai will succeed and grow with the rapidly developing China market." Mr Ting said that over the next three years Semi-Tech would invest up to USDollars 100m in other joint ventures currently nearing agreement.</p>

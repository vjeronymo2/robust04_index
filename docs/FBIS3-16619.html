Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for International  Affairs Vladimir Lukin, who attended the meeting, told Interfax  that the meeting focused on some aspects of "pragmatic  partnership" in the defense sphere between the two countries.    "It is not a tragedy that our interests in this sphere do  not  always coincide. These are normal relations between two great  powers," Lukin said.</p>

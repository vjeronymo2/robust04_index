			<p>BFN     [Text] Within reactions to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the  Islamic [Resistance] Movement, Hamas, said that the agreement  and the resulting sell-out and dissipation of Palestinian rights  has exceeded all limits. In a statement today, the Movement  voiced its strong rejection of the agreement's provisions and  all its repercussions on the Palestinians. It said the  agreement is expected to have serious connotations and  repercussions which might result in confrontations among the  Palestinian people themselves, something which the Israelis had  been endeavoring to realize for a long time.    The Movement said: We are apprehensive that when the  Palestinian police arrive in the Gaza and Jericho areas, they  will be transformed into forces whose aim would be to continue  arrests among our people instead of providing security,  reassurance, and stability which were denied the Palestinian  people for a long time.    The Movement hoped that the Palestinian police force will  back their Palestinian brothers and will not be a burden to  them. It warned that the Movement will not sit idly by if these  forces adopt the role of an honest guard to the Zionist settler  presence.    The Movement said that if the 'Arafat leadership followed  the  policy of gagging people, confiscating their liberties, and  imposing emergency regulations on the citizens, it will enter  into a big labyrinth and the situation will become like a powder  keg, liable to explode at any moment.</p>

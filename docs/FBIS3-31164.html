Romania considers that a political solution is the only one  capable of settling the conflict in former Yugoslavia, said the  spokeswoman and underlined: "One of the assumptions Romania has  taken into account when stating its position with regard to the  situation in former Yugoslavia was the important role that could  be played in a peaceful settlement of the conflict by the  countries neighboring former Yugoslavia."    The Geneva meeting could be considered a direct and concrete  result of the two international mediators' talks in Bucharest,  the spokeswoman said.    Secretary of State of the Romanian Foreign Ministry Adrian  Dohotaru, currently visiting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,  met with the federal minister of minorities and human rights and  federal culture minister, with the deputy minister of foreign  affairs of Yugoslavia and with the minister of culture and  relations with diaspora of Serbia. The visit is an expression  of the Romanian Foreign Ministry's preoccupation of maintaining  a continuous dialogue with the Romanian nationals living in  Yugoslavia and of finding, together with the Yugoslav  authorities, the means of full expression of their ethnic,  language, cultural and spiritual identity, said Romanian Foreign  Ministry's Assistant Spokesperson Simona Miculescu.    A Romanian delegation will attend a meeting on February 11,  in Athens, of representatives of the European Union, the six  states associated to the European Union and the Baltic states,  to discuss a draft pact of stability in Europe. Romania will  reiterate its support for a pact ensuring stability in Europe  through the promotion of good-neighborly relations among states,  will underscore the precedence of the European Union's support  to the reform and democratization processes in Central and  Eastern European states, will promote the principle of frontier  inviolability, will reassert Romania's readiness to entrench the  European standards in the field of the rights of the persons  belonging to ethnic minorities, the spokeswoman said.    Referring to the consultations that are taking place on  February 9 and 10 between experts of the Foreign Ministries of  Romania and the Czech Republic, the spokeswoman said they were  working on the updating of the bilateral relations through an  intergovernmental protocol to discern which of the conventions  agreed by Romania and former Czechoslovakia until 1992 are still  effective and which are not.    Talks are scheduled to take place today, February 9, in  Bern,  between secretaries of state of the Foreign Ministries of  Romania and Switzerland, approaching issues of the  Romanian-Swiss relations and seeking to find out joint actions  aiming to develop these relations.    The Romanian Foreign Ministry Secretary of State Gheorghe  Tinca will have consultations by mid-February at the Foreign  Affairs Ministries of Pakistan, Japan and the People's Republic  of China. The state secretary's visit in Pakistan is going to be  the first at such level after 1989. State Secretary Tinca will  convey a message from Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu to  Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The talks the  secretary will have in Japan represent a continuation of the  ones in Bucharest, in 1992. The consultations in the People's  Republic of China follow the protocol signed earlier this year  referring to the collaboration between the two ministries.  During his three-state tour, Gheorghe Tinca will approach also  international issues of mutual interest and will promote some  actions meant to evince the economic potential of Romania.</p>

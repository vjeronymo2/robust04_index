			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tanzanian farming embarks on a quiet revolution - Paula Hawkins on a privately-backed programme emphasising science-based agricultural technology In the village of Imbaseny, Tanzania, a slow and quiet agricultural revolution has been taking place over the past few years. John Elisamia, an Imbaseny farmer, points to his healthy maize crop, the cobs twice the size of those grown by farmers just two miles along the road. He is expecting yields of 18 to 20 bags (90kg each) a hectare this year. Six years ago, he was getting only two or three bags. His secret is simple: correct spacing, timely weeding and, most important, the use of chemical fertilisers. Environmentalists need not cry 'foul' as the volume of fertiliser used - about 25kg a hectare - is still well below the average used even in low-income economies. According to Norman Borlaug, winner of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his part in India's 'Green Revolution', Mr Elisamia's methods are those which must be adopted by Africa's peasant farmers on a wide scale if the continent's agricultural decline is to be reversed. 'The single most economically viable and environmentally friendly action to be taken is to promote moderate and proper use of chemical fertilisers in an aggressive manner,' he says. Mr Borlaug is president of the Sasakawa Africa Association, part of Sasakawa Global 2000, an international agricultural programme financed by Japanese businessman and philanthropist, Ryoichi Sasakawa, and supported by former US president Jimmy Carter. The programme emphasises science-based agricultural technology as the key to increasing food production worldwide - an increasingly urgent task. Over the past 80 years, the world's population has grown from 1.6bn to 5.6bn. In 1990 the world's food production could have provided an adequate diet for 6.2bn, yet that same year more than 100m people in Africa faced food insecurity. It is in rural Africa, home to more than 70 per cent of the continent's population, that the problem is most pressing. Population is growing at an annual rate of 3 to 4 per cent while agricultural output continues to decline. If these trends continue, Africa will be able to supply only 75 per cent of its own food by the year 2000. SG 2000 came to Tanzania in 1989 and now has projects in seven regions, involving more than 35,000 small-scale farmers. The scheme operates through demonstration and training. Management test plots are established on land owned by farmers involved in a three-year training programme. In the first year inputs are provided on 100 per cent credit; in the second on 50 per cent credit; and thereafter farmers must pay for inputs themselves. Sasakawa provides vehicles, tools and comprehensive training. The project is time-consuming and costly. Given SG 2000's annual budget (only USDollars 7m worldwide), the scheme could not possibly be extended to every village in Tanzania. Michael Foster, SG 2000's country director in Tanzania, says that 'Sasakawa's primary objective is to form an education base' that will give the revolution its own momentum, so that Imbaseny's experience might be replicated countrywide. More than half of the village's farmers have adopted some or all of Sasakawa's methods. According to Mr Foster, it is not essential that farmers use the precise technology package advocated by SG 2000, nor even that all the correct fertilisers and hybrids are readily available and affordable. What is essential is that farmers understand the concept underlying the package, and can thus adapt the methods to their particular circumstances. The problems facing Tanzania's peasant farmers are immense - simply increasing yields is not enough. Agricultural budget cuts have led to lower agricultural imports, with the result that fertiliser imports meet only 39 per cent of demand. Storage also presents problems. John Elisamia estimates that he will lose about a third of his harvest because he has inadequate storage facilities. SG 2000's post-harvest technology programme involves building storage facilities, but materials are neither cheap nor readily available. The other main problem concerns marketing. There is no guaranteed market for maize, and simply getting crops an outlet is a daunting task. Tanzania's weak infrastructure and transport difficulties raise overheads considerably: even in the relatively wealthy region of Arusha, roads are riddled with potholes. The World Bank is funding the renovation of trunk roads, but feeder roads to the rural areas receive little attention. Any agricultural sector operates within the wider context of the economy as a whole: in Tanzania, that economy happens to be enormously aid-dependent and the second poorest in the world. Imbaseny's agricultural revolution stands little chance of spreading unless this general economic climate improves; if it does not, SG 2000's project may be relegated, like so many before it, to Africa's aid programme junkyard.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Soros dealing nets big profit THE New York-based financial group headed by Hungarian financier George Soros turned in a profit of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds 1.9bn) last year, one of his top aides said in London yesterday. Mr Stan Druckenmiller, a managing director of Soros Fund Management, said 'substantially less than half' the profits came from speculation on sterling. The rest came from dealing in other currencies and financial instruments. He denied that the fund management group - in which Mr Soros has a one-third stake - had contributed to recent tensions over the French franc by selling the currency. Last week the franc brushed its floor against the D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism, although this week it has strengthened. Last summer the fund management group made about Dollars 1bn from selling sterling before Britain's ERM exit. Mr Druckenmiller said it was wrong to think his organisation had specifically targeted the pound for selling. 'Sterling was one piece in the matrix (of our overall operations).' While in London, he met Treasury and Bank of England officials for talks about currency operations, which one official described as 'helpful'. Soros Fund Management currently owns a portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn. The total is due to fall over the next few months after profits on last year's operations are paid to shareholders. Mr Druckenmiller said the franc was 'not fundamentally overvalued' in the ERM and that Soros Fund Management 'had no plans' to sell it. 'If the ERM did not exist and the franc no longer had a peg to the D-Mark then in our view the franc would not depreciate,' he said.</p>

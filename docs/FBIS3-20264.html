One Danish representative in the European Parliament is now  threatening to vote against Swedish membership of the EU.    During the last, hectic night of talks on the EU agreement,  Sweden succeeded in negotiating a higher cod quota in the Baltic  Sea. The increased share of Baltic cod can only be taken from  EU member states Denmark and Germany. Neither Denmark nor  Germany has approved the Swedish fisheries agreement, and Danish  politicians in the European Parliament are so indignant about it  that they are thinking of voting against Swedish EU membership  unless the fisheries agreement is altered.    In the past, Sweden has had 24 percent of the total cod  quota  in the Baltic Sea, which amounts to 60,000 tonnes. The EU  member states, i.e., Denmark and Germany, share 36 percent  between them. The remaining 40 percent is split between Russia,  Poland, and the Baltic states. "Next year the total cod quota  in the Baltic Sea will increase to at least 80,000 tonnes.  Under the terms of the EU agreement, the Swedish quota will  increase by 5 percent," Stefan de Mare, chief negotiator for the  Swedish fisheries sector at the talks with the EU on accession,  said.    Danish Fisheries Minister Bjorn Westh said that the Swedish  agreement was a technical error and that Denmark, together with  Germany, will try to change it. Danish MEP [European Parliament  Member] Niels Anker Kofoed, who represents Bornholm, described  the agreement as scandalous. He is considering voting against  Swedish membership in the European Parliament unless the  agreement is changed back. Fishermen from Bornholm, who are  highly dependent on cod fishing, were recently promised higher  quotas next year. A higher Swedish quota could wreck their  chances of this, too. The Bornholm fishermen have lodged a  protest with Fisheries Minister Bjorn Westh.</p>

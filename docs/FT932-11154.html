			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Campari upset Sports clothing company Campari plunged after the group astonished analysts by announcing its second profits warning in less than two months. Specialists had already scaled back estimates following the first warning in mid-March, which preceded figures just over a fortnight ago. Broker BZW was said to be predicting Pounds 1.6m but Campari said yesterday that it would be lucky to break even in the coming year. The shares tumbled to 120p before ending 45 down on balance at 133p. An easier trend in sterling against the dollar helped the oil sector gain ground. Shell, still stimulated by last week's excellent figures from its US arm, Shell Oil, edged up 2 to 556p on good turnover of 4.6m shares, with at least two of the big London-based investment houses, Smith New Court and SGST, pushing the shares. However, BP was not left behind and rose 1 1/2 to 294p; turnover was an unspectacular 3.3m shares. Oppenheimer and Co, one of the most influential US brokers, upgraded BP to its buy list. Enterprise Oil improved 7 to 488p after relatively high turnover of 1.1m shares. Lasmo failed to make headway, however, holding steady at 152p. Aran Energy, on the other hand, appreciated 3 to 30 1/2 p, the highest level since May 1991, after what was described as a very positive presentation in London to UK oil analysts. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, is believed to have included the stock in its Capital International Index as part of its Irish Portfolio. Banks remained under pressure after a couple of recent bearish circulars from brokers. These focused on the weakness of the UK banking sector's Tier One capital ratios compared with those of the US banks, with the notable exceptions of TSB and Abbey National. The latter moved up 6 to 391p. Royal Bank of Scotland, due to announce interims today, edged up 3 to 267p. The market is looking for the bank to top most analysts' forecasts, which range from around Pounds 50m to Pounds 80m, compared with last time's Pounds 48m. Drug issues were stronger following US buying on Monday. However, Glaxo suffered from worries, emanating from a research presentation by Wellcome, of a rival to its anti-migraine treatment. Analysts said the possibility of a competing product from Wellcome would be countered by new developments from Glaxo, but the latter lost 4 1/2 to 590p and the former rose 4 to 739p. Pearson advanced 10 to 447p on reports that it is interested in taking a stake in Hong Kong satellite television station STAR TV. Reuters Holdings was 14 lower at 1245p as one securities house published a bearish piece of research. Negative comment was again undermining food retail issues. Weekend press reports suggested that prices had been reduced because of competition from discount supermarket chains, confirming the bearish view on the sector held by several brokers. Tesco slipped 4 1/2 to 217 1/2 p, J. Sainsbury 6 to 461p and Kwik Save 5 to 778p. United Biscuits ebbed on profit-taking as the heralded bid failed to materialise. The shares dipped 5 to 421p. A positive annual statement from Unilever helped the shares climb 4 1/2 to 1087p. Tate &amp; Lyle added 4 at 405p ahead of today's results. A disposal of some of its poultry interests lifted Hillsdown Holdings by 7 to 164p. Interest in Kingfisher on optimism that its DIY business had experienced a good Bank Holiday was dampened on the back of a dull stores sector. The shares closed a penny adrift at 599p. Storehouse, which announced the buy-back of some property interests, rose a penny to 209p. Negative press comment and rumours of less than praiseworthy views from one of the company's brokers weakened Ladbroke Group. The shares slipped a penny to 162p. The Premier League championship lifted Manchester United. The shares leapt 23 at one stage before settling 11 ahead at 463p. Euro Disney advanced 15 to 880p on hopes of a funding deal with Walt Disney. Holiday group Owners Abroad declined 7 to 100p as criticism continued over recent broker downgrades. Some analysts were said to be unhappy at the new figures following Owners' previously bullish tone during its successful defence against the Airtours bid. A big seller of Bass undermined the shares, which retreated 9 to 534p. However, Grand Metropolitan attracted support after its recent poor run and improved 5 to 415p. Volex fell sharply to close 23 off at 389p after the chief executive left the company and joined Farnell Electronics. Aerospace Engineering raced up 4 1/2 to 19p after selling Forward Industries to OMI International. Confirmation that British Aerospace is setting up a joint venture in guided weapons with Matra helped BAe shares move forward 6 to 328p.</p>

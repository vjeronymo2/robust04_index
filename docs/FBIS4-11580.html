			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramon Hernandez S.] </F>   [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrates on  24 April filed an appeal on the Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ)  resolution temporarily suspending the legislative elections  slated for 14 August. It has been reported that the appeal was  filed at the CSJ Secretariat at 1845 local and that the file  will be sent to the Constitutionality Court (CC) today.    Thus, the decision to continue the electoral process is in  the hands of the CC magistrates, who should either confirm the  provisional amparo ordered by the CSJ or amend it. The latter  looks more likely, according to legal and political analysts.    On 22 April, the CSJ magistrates, acting as an amparo  chamber, accepted the provisional amparo which Social Action  Movement (MAS) Deputy Carlos Arroyave Cerna had requested saying  he had been harmed by the TSE's call for the elections to be  held on 14 August. This action interrupted the election  process. The CC magistrates are expected to overrule the CSJ  and rescind the resolution in a few hours, however.  Consequently, the election process would continue while the  provisional amparo filed by Deputy Arroyave follows its normal  course.    The fact that the TSE magistrates have filed an appeal on  the  CSJ resolution means that they acted according to the  Constitution and the law by calling the Guatemalan people to  hold legislative elections to elect a congress of 80 deputies.    Democratic Union (UD) Party Deputy Luis Chea last night said  he hopes the CC magistrates "will abide by the law and confirm  the TSE's call for elections, which is according to the law."    Roberto Arana Espana of the Central Authentic Nationalist  Party said: "The CC must rule favorably on the appeal filed by  the TSE magistrates because the CC is the only institution  backed by the people. It is the only body whose decisions are  accepted by the people because the CC has always abided by the  Constitution." Arana Espana added that the people are ready to  participate in the elections on 14 August, "a historic date  which will change the country's politics."</p>

On behalf of Shao Qihui, governor of the  Heilongjiang Provincial government, Vice Governor Wang Zongzhang  met with Minister Kozyrev and also held a 50-minute talk with  him.    Vice Governor Wang Zongzhang first explained the ways in  which Heilongjiang Province and the Russian Federation are  making ceaseless efforts to develop border economic and trade  cooperation. He then set forth some existing problems cropping  up during mutual contacts. Vice Governor Wang suggested:  First, i addition to giving visas to those with official or  ordinary passports, the Russian Federation should give entry  visas to our side's tallymen, drivers, persons from large  economic and trade enterprises, interpreters, and laborers who  have to traverse the Russian Federation border often. Second,  nongovernmental economic and trade committees should be set up  to solve the problems cropping up during mutual economic and  trade activities. Third, a formal agreement on building the  Heilongjiang highway bridge linking Heihe with Blagoveshchensk  city should be reached as soon as possible. Fourth, we hope the  Russian Government will support the cooperative construction of  the "Heihe- Blagoveshchensk free economic and trade zone."  Fifth, it is necessary to pioneer the construction of the  Suifenhe and Pogranichnyy border area of Maritime Kray. Sixth,  in addition Suifenhe, which has been opened as an international  passenger-cargo port, we suggest the establishment of other  international passenger-cargo ports and their opening to other  countries. Seventh, we hope that the Russian Federation will  provide conveniences for the other CIS countries that have to  deliver their goods to our country through the Russian  Federation. Eighth, we hope that the Russian Government will  provide preferential policies on developing border trade to  promote friendly contacts and border trade cooperation.</p>

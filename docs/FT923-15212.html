			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK market The UK equity market's response to Wall Street these days seems to be a kind of reverse ratchet effect, whereby it falls along with Wall Street and does nothing when it rises. The differential between the two markets is somewhat stretched as a result. In particular, as Warburg points out, comparison of the two market multiples leaves London looking more depressed than at any time since the dark days of the mid-1970s. There are obvious distortions, such as the fact that most UK companies do not yet charge closure and rationalisation costs against earnings. If only for that reason, UK companies do not have the same scope for a rebound in stated earnings in the event of economic recovery. But there is more to it than accounting conventions. On the one hand, Wall Street's continued strength takes a lot of justifying. On the other, the weakness of the dollar is unsettling. This may be irrational: the US currency may recover, while some UK companies with dollar earnings have better cash cover on their dividends than others which depend solely on the UK economy. But the memory of what a Dollars 2.40 pound did to manufacturers in the last recession is not calculated to steady nerves.</p>

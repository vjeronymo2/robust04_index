			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEADLINE PUTS FUNDS FOR CAMPUS IN LIMBO  </P> <P> California State University officials acknowledged this week that they may miss  a deadline for spending $7 million earmarked for a Ventura County campus, but  said there was little chance that funds for the project would dry up.  </P> <P> Although Cal State loses the money if it does not acquire a site before July,  1990, lawmakers agreed that renewing the allocation would not be a major  problem.  </P> <P> State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who sponsored the 1985 legislation  that provided the $7 million, said he would gladly introduce such a bill again.  And Hart predicted that, barring a severe budget crisis, the money would again  be available.  </P> <P> "If we can show that some real progress is being made, I think we'll be able to  persuade the Legislature to keep the ball rolling," he said. "It's not a slam  dunk or a guarantee . . . but I'm reasonably optimistic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Legislation  </P> <P> Hart last week introduced legislation for a $900-million educational bond act  that, if approved by the Legislature and California voters, could give the  university $400,000 to help develop a West Ventura site. His last bond measure,  Proposition 78, was approved by voters in November. It earmarked $100,000 for  the campus.  </P> <P> Cal State officials had hoped to take steps toward acquiring a portion of  scenic Taylor Ranch during their quarterly board meeting in Long Beach this  week. But several studies that they had ordered for the ranch last summer --  and that were expected to be completed this month -- still have not been done,  they said.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will be too difficult to get the deadline extended," said  Jack Smart, Cal State's vice chancellor for university affairs. "Everything  seems to take longer than it should."  </P> <P> Last June, the owners of Taylor Ranch threw the search for a campus site into  turmoil when they announced that they were no longer interested in selling the  oceanside property.  </P> <P> Undaunted, the Cal State Board of Trustees in July ordered an appraisal and an  environmental impact report for the ranch -- steps consistent with condemning a  portion of the hillside land.  </P> <P> Under the California Civil Code, public agencies can acquire properties through  eminent domain if a project is in the public interest and serves the greatest  public good while causing the least public injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eminent Domain  </P> <P> Although Cal State officials will not confirm whether they intend to use  eminent domain, they acknowledge that it is an option. Smart declined to  predict when those studies will be completed.  </P> <P> "I've been wrong so many times in the past," he said. "I don't want to be wrong  in the future."  </P> <P> In comparison, the northern San Diego County campus proposed by Cal State about  the same time as the Ventura County campus is already in the works.  </P> <P> The San Marcos site, which was purchased last year, is being graded and readied  for construction. If work goes according to schedule, classes should begin in  the fall of 1992, Smart said.  </P> <P> Since 1974, Cal State Northridge and UC Santa Barbara have offered classes  jointly to as many as 1,000 third- and fourth-year students in a cramped office  building in mid-town Ventura. The Cal State wing of the university center moved  to a larger facility near Seaward Avenue last fall.  </P> <P> The proposed campus is initially expected to serve 2,500 upper level students  and, within the next 20 years, could be expanded into a four-year university  serving 5,000 students, officials said.  </P> <P> Once a site is acquired, officials said, they will need at least four years for  planning and development before the first student enters a classroom.  </P></p>

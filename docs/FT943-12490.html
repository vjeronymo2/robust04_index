			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Tee-off Golf, the great uniter. At least that's how it might appear to Wang Jun, deputy director of the China Golf Association. He's visited Taipei to meet leading Taiwanese golfers and hold talks on the joint development of golf courses in China. His host was Chen Chung-Kuang, head of Taiwan's golf association. Coincidentally, Wang is a son of the late Chinese vice-president Wang Zhen, as well as president of China International Trust and Investment Corp, one of China's leading state conglomerates. Could have been an interesting chat at the 19th hole.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- 21.4 percent of  Bulgarians are unemployed, specialists of the National  Statistical Institute (NSI) said today, announcing the results  of a survey of the population's economic activity and the labour  force conducted for the first time in Bulgaria in September this  year. It covered 30,000 households chosen at random using  techniques of the International Labour Organization, thus making  the survey comparable with similar studies in other European  countries. The survey cost two million leva, one million of  them being provided by the state. If three million are raised  next year, statisticians will be able to conduct several surveys  of this kind to reveal the dynamics of unemployment in the  country, Mr. Milcho Mladenov, an NSI department director, said.    814,000 people out of a 3.8 million population in active age  are unemployed, the NSI statistics show. This figure is higher  than those reported so far because it includes all people over  15 years of age who are looking for jobs. Practically, the  group includes 51,000 pensioners and 13,000 learners who would  like to work.    Most unemployed have low educational qualifications: 385,000  have primary or lower education, 137,000 have finished secondary  vocational schools, and 44,000 are university graduates. Women  are more badly hit by unemployment than men.    Almost 400,000, or 38 percent, of the unemployed are between  25 and 44 years of age. Unemployment in the rural areas runs at  19.5 percent, which is 6 percent higher than the urban centres.    55 percent of the unemployed have become redundant as a  result of staff cuts, 11 percent failed to find themselves jobs  after finishing their education and 7.8 percent -- after their  dismissal as conscripts from the Army.    63 percent of the unemployed have had no jobs for more than  a  year and a half, 14 percent have been looking for job  opportunities for half a year or a year, only 6 percent have  been jobless for less than a month.</p>

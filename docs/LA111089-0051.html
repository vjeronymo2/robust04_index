			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRALESTE TANKERS BREEZE IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Ocean League champion Miraleste breezed through the first round of CIF 2-A  water polo playoffs Thursday, but Mira Costa and El Segundo didn't, falling in  close games that had one coach crying foul.  </P> <P> Miraleste, playing at home, defeated Western of Anaheim, 19-10, while Mira  Costa lost at La Palma to Kennedy, 4-2. El Segundo lost at Agoura, 11-10.  </P> <P> Mira Costa led, 1-0, on a goal by Matt Lutton, but Kennedy came back to take a  2-1 lead at halftime and stretched it to 3-1 in the third quarter. Noah Willard  scored to cut the deficit to 3-2. Kennedy got the final goal with three minutes  left and ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Mira Costa had two goals called back when an official ruled the Mustang players  were standing on the bottom of the pool. However, Mira Costa Coach Mike Nollan  claims the same official allowed Kennedy to play under similar circumstances.  Though officials' judgment calls can't be protested, the incensed Nollan said  he will send a complaint to the CIF, saying, "We lost because of the official."  </P> <P> Nollan said: "Two (Mira Costa) goals were called back while (Kennedy) got three  shot attempts standing on the bottom and no calls were made. One official made  or refused to make all five of those calls. It was blatantly biased."  </P> <P> Mira Costa finished at 13-14.  </P> <P> Miraleste, the third seed, easily held off Western, building an 11-4 halftime  lead. Ocean League most valuable player Kyle Hildebrand led the attack with  seven goals and got support from Andy Foster with five and Zoltan Gyurko with  four. The Marauders' David Reed was outstanding in goal as Miraleste improved  to 20-5.  </P> <P> Miraleste led after one quarter, 5-2, and ballooned the lead to 17-10 after  three periods, allowing the reserves to finish the game. The Marauders will  face Alhambra in the second round Saturday.  </P> <P> El Segundo, the underdog against Frontier League champion Agoura, played evenly  throughout. The game was tied, 2-2, after a quarter, 8-8 after three periods  and was 10-10 going into the last minute. El Segundo sophomore goalie Chris  Lubba, trying to avoid a steal, held the ball under water and Agoura was  awarded a penalty shot. It was converted, giving Agoura the winning goal with  31 seconds left.  </P> <P> For the Eagles, who finish 7-12, Darrel Schumann scored four goals, Robert  Ingersoll three, Tim McGoldrick two and Mike Whitney one.  </P></p>

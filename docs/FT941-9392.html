			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UAP to seek cash as part of sale: Alice Rawsthorn talks to the head of the French insurance group ahead of privatisation Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, is in negotiations with the government to raise cash for its international expansion plans as part of its forthcoming privatisation. Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of UAP, yesterday said that he was discussing with government officials the possibility of including a capital increase within the privatisation package. 'We do want to stage a capital increase,' he said. 'But it hasn't been decided yet whether we will do it at the same time as the privatisation or in a separate issue afterwards. The final decision will depend on the condition of the stock market.' UAP is scheduled as the next company for sale in the French government's privatisation drive. The economy ministry is expected to launch the disposal, which will involve selling the state's 50 per cent stake in UAP at an estimated value of up to FFr28bn (Pounds 3.2bn), as soon as it is convinced that the stock market has digested the Elf Aquitaine issue. Mr Friedmann declined to comment on how much money UAP hoped to raise. However, he said that the group needed cash to finance its investment plans and to complete existing deals such as its recent purchase of the international interests of Victoire, the French insurer. UAP late last year took control of Victoire's international business by buying the 78.8 per cent stake owned by Suez, the French holding company. It also has an option to buy the remaining 21.2 per cent from the Oppenheim group, which will be exercisable in September at a fixed price of DM1.2bn (Pounds 460m). It needs to raise capital to fund the deal by the autumn. 'In the past we've been able to finance acquisitions by issuing new shares because the state has agreed to reduce its stake,' said Mr Friedmann. 'After privatisation that course of action will no longer be open to us.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, and the United States in  June and July will be doing the first military exercise under  NATO's Partnership for Peace scheme, Ukrainian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy said.    He told a news conference in Kiev on Monday [16 May] that  each country would detail a motorized infantry company for the  exercise, to take place in Poland.    Radetskyy said Ukraine's Odessa and Cis-Carpathian Military  Districts had already prepared training grounds for future  Partnership for Peace exercises.    He said none of the participant states should be allowed to  "enjoy priority" in the scheme, which "some of the states seek."    Earlier the same day Radetskyy said "the content of the  neutral status of Ukraine needs a more precise definition."  "Our noninterference in efforts to ensure the security of the  common European home would be difficult to understand," he said  at a news conference held for him and his visiting Austrian  counterpart, Werner Fasslabend. "It is not only the security of  Ukraine that is our concern. What's happening to our neighbors  also concerns us. If there's trouble in a neighboring state, it  may speread to our country too," he said.</p>

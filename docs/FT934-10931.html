			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Management: Rewards for the top performers - The curious appeal of UK performance-related pay schemes Performance-related pay in the UK is a puzzle. There is overwhelming scepticism about its effects on performance, yet its progress seems unstoppable. Over the past few years this may owe something to government patronage as PRP has been, or is being, imposed on the civil service, the NHS, the education system and now the police force. Yet government patronage is only part of the story. A 1991 study by the National Economic Development Office found that about half of all private-sector organisations in Britain were using PRP for some staff and more than one third had been doing so for more than 10 years. Despite its long pedigree there is considerable muddle about what it is and how widely it has spread. PRP - not to be confused with profit-related pay, which attracts various tax advantages - could cover anything from piece work for manual workers, one-off merit pay schemes, or simply the promotion of good performers to higher-paid jobs. But in practice it has come to describe the linking of all, or part, of an individual's pay rise to a formal performance appraisal system. The most recent research from the Institute of Manpower Studies finds that more than two-thirds of all UK organisations now have individual-based PRP for at least some of their staff. The majority of schemes apply to managers or valued 'core' staff, but the trend of the past few years has been for the system to trickle down to white-collar staff. It is still relatively unusual for manual workers, although Nissan's British assembly plant is an exception, and the real extent of PRP can be easily exaggerated. A glance at the government's latest New Earnings Survey shows that productivity/incentive pay for all non-manual employees increased from 2.6 per cent of gross earnings to 3 per cent between 1992 and 1993. It is difficult to tell how much of that 3 per cent is PRP as the NES does not break down incentive pay into different categories. But even if PRP accounted for a good part of it, it would still be far less than the productivity pay arrangements that in 1993 accounted for 5.3 per cent of manual workers' pay. Also, although two-thirds of all organisations may have some form of PRP, when settlement groups within organisations are examined, as they are by the Industrial Relations Services pay databank of more than 1,000 such groups, PRP coverage falls to only 20 per cent. Nevertheless, PRP is on the march in the private and public sectors, and most companies in sectors such as building societies, banks and insurers have PRP for all their staff and usually for the whole pay rise. Little work has been done on evaluating the effectiveness of schemes but, according to the last IMS case studies, PRP does more to demotivate than to motivate staff and neither helps to retain high performers nor dispatch poor performers. Other studies find that the motivational effects of PRP are, at best, neutral. What explains its continuing popularity? First, for government ministers and private-sector managers the introduction of PRP is a powerful signal for a broader change of business culture. And it is often accompanied by other moves towards individualising employer-employee relations - such as team-briefings, profit-sharing and health schemes. Second, as organisations become 'flatter', stripping out layers of management, the ability to reward people through promotion becomes more complex. PRP, and a widening of pay scales, is one answer. Third, as Louis Wustemann of IRS points out, although PRP companies often seem to make higher pay awards than non-PRP companies, many of them are actually making substantial savings in salaries. That is because a surprising number of companies in sectors such as finance and chemicals still have service increments which can pay people about 2 per cent a year, as they move up seniority scales, on top of an annual pay rise. With the introduction of PRP these service increments are usually abolished. There are more traditional arguments in favour of PRP which few people disagree with in principle. Why pay the same rise to someone just avoiding the sack, as to someone who is making a substantial contribution? Also, it is inefficient to promote someone from something they are good at to something they might not be good at because it is the only way of paying them more. The principle is fine but, as Wustemann says, PRP is something that is easy to do badly. The fair and accurate measuring of individual differences in performance is an art still in its infancy. Most personnel managers say it is easier to measure performance for senior staff with some autonomy or for clerical staff with clearly defined functions. But for the growing number of middle-ranking, white-collar staff, things are more complex and many such employees believe themselves to be victims of bias in line-manager appraisals. There is also some doubt that individuals will increase their effort to gain more reward, especially as the sums involved are usually quite small. Alan Wild, head of employee relations at Guinness, says 'PRP must be only one piece of the motivational matrix.' Most practitioners believe PRP is not a reincarnation of the bogus productivity deals of the 1960s. There are, however, limits to its progress as teamwork for both blue- and white-collar workers switches attention to group reward systems. For senior staff it will, according to Wild, continue to play a useful role in 'focusing' efforts. Further articles on PRP will appear in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Commodities Prices: Tea TEA Demand was fair but selective, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Bright liquoring teas and many of the better mediums were 3-5p easier. Central Africans met good competition at firm to dearer rates. Plain descriptions were generally neglected and 1-3p lower where sold. Ceylons were well supported with brighter teas dearer and the balance tending easier. Offshore teas sold readily but prices for the brightest kinds were lower. Quotations: quality 210p (240p) medium 110p (114p), low medium 72p (74p).</p>

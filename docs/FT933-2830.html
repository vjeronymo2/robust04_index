			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EBRD to advance Dollars 90m loan for Russia's Polar Lights oil project THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday signed a Dollars 90m loan for Polar Lights, a joint venture between the US oil company Conoco and Arkhanskgeologiya, a Russian state-owned company. The loan is part of a Dollars 350m project involving another Dollars 60m loan from the International Finance Corporation and Dollars 50m from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation for the development of the Ardalin oil field. Conoco's investment will amount to at least Dollars 50m. Mr Billy Branch, Conoco's representative in Moscow, said the partners had 'some confidence' that an exemption granted to them from some oil export taxation would still be respected by the time production began. Peak production is expected to be around 26,000 barrels a day during the 20 year life of the project. The EBRD loan carries a maturity of nine years and a grace period of three years during which nothing will have to be paid. Western loans will be repaid via Russia's state-owned Moscow Narodny Bank in London out of the proceeds from oil exports. The EBRD, anxious to demonstrate effective lending to eastern Europe following the furore over the spending on its headquarters in London, says it hopes to grant around Dollars 400m in loans to the Russian oil sector this year. This would include a Dollars 60m loan its board approved recently for Nizhnevartovskneftegas, Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, for a project not involving a foreign oil company.</p>

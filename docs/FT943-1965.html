			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (6): Warehouse revolution - A look at the power of the supermarket chains The demands of the retail sector have done much to force the distribution industry to become more sophisticated, and those demands are continuing to dictate the pace of change in the industry in the 1990s. Retailers, and especially UK food retailers, have realised that highly efficient distribution systems are crucial to gaining a competitive edge, and that they were paying too much for distribution in the past. Distribution costs in the UK have come down from more than 10 per cent of sales to about 4 per cent over the last 10 years. Two important trends have dominated retail distribution, and facilitated that improvement in cost ratios: centralisation, and contracting out of distribution to third parties. Retailers have largely abandoned deliveries by suppliers directly to stores, in favour of deliveries to retailers' own regional warehouses, where goods are sorted and loaded on to trucks for distribution to stores. The shift has been dramatic. The Institute of Grocery Distribution found that by 1992, on average, 83 per cent of goods were distributed centrally by retail multiples. The tendency towards centralisation continues, and within it other trends can be discerned. One is a move away from different warehouses for different categories of goods, towards composite centres handling all categories - including ambient, chilled and frozen goods in food retailing. Another is a move away from large networks of small warehouses to smaller networks of ever larger depots. Hillier Parker, the commercial property agent, predicts that demand for new, larger warehouse facilities will increase. It says the average size of retailers' warehouses is 304,000 square feet - twice that of manufacturers'. The possibility of reducing costs through economies of scale is also prompting smaller companies to look at sharing distribution facilities, staff and transport fleets. This is linked to the second important tendency, contracting out distribution. Sainsbury and Tesco, the UK's largest food retailers, now contract over half their distribution, and Asda, the fourth-largest, more than 70 per cent. Contracting out offers a number of advantages. It means contractors, rather than retailers themselves, shoulder much of the considerable investment burden. It also gives retailers access to specialist knowledge and expertise, in a field where technological advances continue apace, permitting - indeed necessitating - constant changes in operating methods. The conventional wisdom has been that few companies would want to contract out all their distribution. Few have so far done so, a notable exception being Laura Ashley, the UK-based fashion and fabrics group which has brought in Federal Express Business Logistics on a 10-year contract. Most retailers were thought likely to want to retain control of at least some of their distribution, and to be able to compare costs between in-house and contractors' operations. But Mr Robert Blyth, senior consultant with Kurt Salmon Associates, the management consultants specialising in the soft goods industries, says retailers are growing more comfortable with the idea of contracting out. He suggests three key elements to success in third-party distribution partnerships: Retailers must retain internal, highly-competent personnel to direct their supply chain strategy, even if operations are largely contracted out. The third party must have highly professional people and adequate systems. The correct balance between keeping costs down and achieving high standards of service must be kept. Retailers are realising that the costs of daily deliveries from regional warehouses may be high, but may be more than outweighed by the benefits of achieving lower levels of goods out of stock, and hence lower markdowns. Mr Blyth suggests that to derive the maximum benefits from such relationships requires a change in attitudes: 'The third party contractor must be seen as an important service supplier, and treated that way. Close relationships between all three parties are the key.' Only through developing closer relationships can ways be found to lessen stockholding, and so reduce costs, at all points of the supply chain. This is the essence of efficient customer response, and quick response, the buzzwords of retail logistics in the 1990s. Quick response means retailers ordering precise quantities of product from suppliers, based on the sales that have occurred within a specific time - frequently, a single day. This allows stocks to be maintained at a considerably lower level. Spectrum Planning, the supply chain consultants, says retailers who have embraced a quick response strategy have halved stock levels in the product groups concerned. It says that extrapolating this to the whole fast-moving consumer goods sector suggests the industry could achieve savings of about Pounds 1bn a year. However, quick response places great demands on distribution services and product suppliers. To ensure product is always available, orders must be fulfilled with 100 per cent accuracy in terms of quantity and timing. In practical terms, this means retailers must share sales information with their suppliers and logistics contractors, through electronic data interchange (EDI). This is being hampered by at least two factors: the lack of common international standards for EDI, making it difficult to link together all elements of the supply chain, and the traditionally 'adversarial' relationship between retailers and suppliers. However, some encouraging evidence was found in a recent survey of food manufacturers by Food Industry News, sponsored by BRS and Exel Logistics, and analysed by the University of Westminster's transport studies group. Among food manufacturers, 80 per cent believed the quality of information flows with their customers had improved over the past two years. Some 40 per cent of respondents felt their operations were already highly integrated with customers', and 67 per cent believed they would be by 1995; more than half already had EDI links with customers, the figure rising to 90 per cent among larger companies. A final trend for distribution specialists is likely to be towards a single distribution company handling the entire supply chain from the raw materials stage through to the retail outlet. This might entail, for example, one logistics company transporting fabric from, say, China, to a factory, and then transporting finished garments to the retailer's distribution centre, and on to the stores. Increasingly, logistics specialists will be expected to have international, even global, reach - likely to lead to more international partnerships, joint ventures and takeovers among logistics companies. Distributors that are international, and offer most flexibility, are those that will win the contracts as retailers themselves become more international.</p>

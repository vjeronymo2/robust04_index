			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Regions regard Moscow moves with wary eye  -Two regional governors lose their jobs in battle of wills WHEN BUSINESSMEN in Russia's Novosibirsk region wrote to President Boris Yeltsin complaining about the threatened sacking of the local governor, the reply came from an official in the president's office. The fact that the letter was not answered by Mr Yeltsin himself was seen as an example of arbitrary rule from the president in Moscow. 'It's like when the politburo in Communist times controlled everything, including the government,' Mr Vyacheslav Tyabotin, a spokesman for the Novosibirsk regional administration, told the Financial Times yesterday. Having overcome his opponents in Moscow with a show of force, President Yeltsin has a fine line to tread between dictatorial high-handedness and reformist determination. It will be difficult enough to find a balance between vital political reforms devolving power to the regions while retaining for Moscow enough power to maintain a single financial policy and a universal tax system. The sackings yesterday of two powerful regional governors opposed to Mr Yeltsin was the first salvo in the president's battle to impose his will on the regions, even though most of the other 88 regional governors support him. The two governors sacked - Mr Vitaly Mukha, Novosibirsk regional head, and Mr A Surat, Amur governor - lost their jobs because they had opposed the president's dissolution of parliament, a Kremlin statement said. Mr Yeltsin's previous attempt to fire Mr Mukha failed after the regional council refused to let him go. On Monday the regional administration condemned violence by both sides in Moscow, calling for early elections of president and parliament and urging the inhabitants of this Siberian province to stay away from rallies and strikes. Calm has been observed so far, but it is unclear whether some regions will take protest action against the president's attempts to impose his will on them directly. Mr Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of Russia's republic of Kalmykia, last week hosted a meeting at which regional leaders, most of them from councils, discussed the possibility of economic sanctions - such as closing railways and pipelines - to forestall such action. Having tried to broker peace talks between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, Mr Ilyumzhinov has also been given a heavy hint to fall into line in future: Mr Yeltsin's anti-corruption committee leaked a report on Monday that he may have been involved in corrupt deals related to the vice-president. In a second salvo, a presidential aide said that Mr Yeltsin was considering whether to dissolve all regional councils, or only those which had opposed his orders for new elections. Only half of the councils have come out in support of Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament last week and calling new elections. They have all been concerned to prevent bloodshed from spilling into the regions, but a meeting of the Federation Council - to represent regional leaders - was postponed yesterday while the president decides whether the local councils should be represented on it and, if so, which councils. Many have toed a cautious line, refraining from voting outright against Mr Yeltsin's instructions. The regional council in the Urals region of Perm for instance failed to obtain a quorum to condemn the dissolution of parliament. But a spokesman for the Perm administration said yesterday that their 'ambiguous statement' after events in Moscow suggested they were not completely loyal. In the mining Kuzbass region, a local administration spokesman said that the council and administration were working together to prevent Moscow's violence from spreading locally. If Mr Yeltsin calls for re-election of the soviets, or councils - without a reform of their role - he could find himself with the same people in charge of unreformed legislatures. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow who helped put down the uprising against Mr Yeltsin, set the example yesterday by dissolving Moscow's city and district councils and saying they would be replaced by a single new-look city council which would not meddle in his day-to-day running of the city.</p>

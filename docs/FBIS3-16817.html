			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Twenty-two Saeima deputies have sent an open letter  to State President Guntis Ulmanis appealing to him not to sign  the interstate agreements initialled at the talks between  Latvian and Russian delegations, providing for the functioning  in Latvia for another five-and-a-half years of the Russian  Federation's military site, the Skrunda radar station. The  letter says that the signing and ratification of such agreements  would unequivocally signify Latvia's renunciation of the  justified demands it has made so far for the speedy and complete  withdrawal of Russia's armed forces, also incorporated in the  resolutions of the United Nations Organization and the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The letter  emphasizes that both the assembly of Latvian local authorities  and many political and public organizations have testified to  their unwillingness to legalize the activity of the Skrunda  radar station on the territory of the Republic of Latvia, and  demand the maintenance in force of Latvia's demand hitherto for  the withdrawal of the occupying troops without additional  conditions.    The deputies who signed the letter propose holding a  referendum of Latvian citizens, simultaneously with the local  government elections due on 29 May on their attitude to the  operation of the Skrunda radar station in Latvia after 31 August  this year, and call for the issue of concluding the treaty with  Russia not to be debated before the collection of the referendum  results. The letter is signed by 22 deputies of various  factions in the Saeima, among them Maris Grinblats, the leader  of For the Fatherland and Freedom; Aida Predele, the leader of  the Christian Democrats; deputy Oskars Griks of the Peasants'  Union; deputy Karlis Leiskalns of the Democratic Party; deputies  Odisejs Kostanda, Eduards Berklavs, Aristids Lambergs, Andrejs  Krastins of the Latvian National Independence Movement; and  other deputies.</p>

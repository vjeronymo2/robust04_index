			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pepkor improves 18% PEPKOR, the South African retail group, lifted attributable profits by 18 per cent in the year to February in which it took over Checkers, one of three largest supermarket chains in South Africa. Turnover rose by 118 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.5bn) following the takeover of Tradehold and its subsidiary Tradegro which controls Checkers. Operating profit rose 30 per cent, to R218.3m, reflecting the larger contribution from food sales relative to clothes on which margins were better. Attributable income was 18 per cent up at R93.8m and there were extraordinary profits of R75.3m. Pepkor's results included losses and large write-offs at Tradegro which made an operating loss of R30m on turnover of R2.2bn. It wrote off R46m in rationalisation and other costs related to its incorporation into Pepkor.</p>

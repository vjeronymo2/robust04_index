			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Baccalaureate urged instead of Scots exam THE SCOTTISH education system will have its biggest shake-up for decades if the Scottish Office implements recommendations to scrap the Higher exam and introduce a system that included a baccalaureate. A report by a committee chaired by Professor John Howie of St Andrew's University said yesterday a baccalaureate would provide greater depth and breadth of study than the Higher. There would be a vocationally-oriented 'Scottish certificate' for the majority. Unlike English pupils, who may study three A-levels in the sixth and seventh years of secondary school, Scottish pupils take up to five or six Highers at the end of their fifth year, often in a combination of arts and science subjects. Highers, as well as being an important aspect of Scottish differentiation from England, have been praised because up to 70 per cent of Scottish youngsters stay on at school after the age of 16, compared with about 35 per cent in England. Prof Howie said the breadth of Highers was illusory because many pupils obtained only one or two. 'Even the more able students display less breadth of attainment than their European counterparts,' he added. Highers presented little chance of studying in depth and pupils often rushed through them in little more than two terms. Vocational education suffered from a lack of esteem, with academic education and excessive flexibility leading to arbitrary subject choices. The Scottish upper secondary system was 'seriously wanting in many respects', he said. The baccalaureate, for which pupils would study for three years up to the sixth year, would have arts and science 'lines' but the common core would include English, modern languages, mathematics, science, social subjects, arts and information technology.

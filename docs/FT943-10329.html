			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort European raises Pounds 234m Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust has raised more than Pounds 234m in the second call on its shares despite widespread fears that private investors, who have incurred losses since the launch, might not subscribe. The figure is about 94 per cent of the amount payable through the final instalment on the trust's ordinary shares. The second 50p instalment was due on August 1 but Kleinwort will continue to accept late payment for 'a limited period,' the length of which it has not yet stipulated. Reminders will be sent out on Tuesday to those of its the 85,000 investors who have not responded. The trust, which raised Pounds 500m when it was launched in February, was oversubscribed by a record Pounds 380m. The shares closed at 81 1/2 p yesterday, up 1 3/4 p, compared with a net asset value of 94.1p. The warrants closed at 30.5p. Taken together, those who hold the package of shares and warrants have seen a fall of about 12.4 per cent from the original price. The trust has underperformed the FT-A Europe Index by 15 per cent. The trust, which had traded at a premium, is now trading at a small discount. Mr Simon White, director, attributed this to weak markets since launch and to the trust's 'less stable' shareholder base, in a reference to those who bought shares in the hope of making a quick gain. 'You only need a small number of sellers wanting to stag profits for the discount to widen,' he said.</p>

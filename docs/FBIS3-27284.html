Speaking at a public occasion tonight, NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY  [XINHUA] Hong Kong branch Director Zhou Nan said that the future  of Hong Kong is after all in the hands of the great Chinese  people including Hong Kong compatriots.    He reiterated that with the backing of the powerful  motherland and the support of all the people in the country, we  will surely overcome all the man-made obstacles on the course of  progress to secure a smooth transition and guarantee long-term  stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.    Zhou made the above remarks while reviewing the recent  Sino-British relations in his speech. He said that we sincerely  hoped that China and Britain could reach an agreement on the  1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong on the basis of the  "three conformities".    He said that the Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in  order to reach an agreement with the British side.    However, the good will of the Chinese side and Hong Kong  compatriots did not come true, he said, adding that the  responsibility totally lies on the British side.    In his speech delivered at tonight's reception party held by  the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch to celebrate the  Lunar New Year, Zhou Nan also reviewed the recent development of  the relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.    He said that the relationship between the two areas in the  past year had become ever closer, adding that the booming  economy of the Chinese mainland had enabled Hong Kong to retain  its continued economic growth at a fairly high rate.    This, he said, had fully revealed that the stability and  development in the Chinese mainland is the most solid foundation  for prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.    He expressed his firm belief that the economic and trade  relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland,  together with exchanges and cooperation in the other fields,  will enter a new stage in the coming new year.    Over a thousand people including local public figures from  all walks of life in the territory such as leading businessmen  Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok Ying-tung, both of whom are also  vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, attended tonight's grand meeting.</p>

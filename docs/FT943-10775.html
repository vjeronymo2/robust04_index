			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Observer: Media games Talking of maverick yachtsmen, Ted Turner's Goodwill Games in St Petersburg still seem to be having teething troubles. Last week the swimmers were delayed because the water in the swimming pool had turned the wrong colour and yesterday the short-track speed-skating competition ran into problems because the ice was not ready. Worse still, Turner Broadcasting, which has spent upwards of Dollars 100m on the event, looks like being out of pocket because the US TV ratings have been below expectations. However, it takes much more than this to upset Turner who is already starting to concentrate on the 1996 Olympics which are coming to his home town of Atlanta. Indeed, there is even talk that Turner may be in the running to be one of the two US members of the International Olympic Committee. It is over two and a half years since Robert Helmick, the former president of the US Olympic Committee was forced to stand down and a decision on a replacement is expected by early September. While some members of the US sporting establishment would run a mile before allowing Turner on board, sporting cognoscenti have noted that Harvey Schiller, the executive director of the US Olympic committee has announced that he will be joining Turner's sports broadcasting arm in the autumn.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Warning over 'underclass' PERSISTENT long-term unemployment presents the risk of a permanent 'underclass' developing in Britain and imposing serious strains on social, political and civil order, a Policy Studies Institute report warns today. The future of the underclass, says the report, depends mainly on the future of employment. To prevent a permanent underclass forming there must be effective policies for reducing and changing the distribution of unemployment, or a change in the social structure so that employment was no longer the source of money and everything else that society regarded as valuable.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. paper  PEOPLE'S WEEKLY WORLD January 22 reported that U.S. figures  challenged the allegations of the Central Intelligence Agency  (CIA) of the United States about North Korea at an action forum  held in Chicago under the sponsorship of the U.S. academic and  religious circles.    The paper conveys their remarks as follows:    Professor of East Asian and International History, Bruce  Cummings, pointed to the different estimates of the U.S. State  Department, which says, "North Korea may have nuclear weapons"  and the CIA, which says the North Koreans have them.    Cummings said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  relies heavily on the CIA for its "information about North  Korean nuclear capability," although IAEA has conducted a series  of full inspections of North Korean nuclear sites.    These inspections have been allowed even though the first  section of the IAEA's statutes say that any nation can refuse to  allow such inspections if it feels another country threatens its  security.    Referring to the question of why the CIA persists in its  claim that North Korea has nuclear weapons, Professor Henry Em,  candidate in history, University of Chicago and instructor at  Lake Forest College, charged that the CIA is fighting to  maintain its 300 billion dollars annual budget and strives to  maintain a "threat of dangerous enemies" as a means to gain  public and congressional support.    Em said: "The attitudes ascribed to North Korea can be  better  applied to the CIA--that it is dangerous, unstable and  self-serving."</p>

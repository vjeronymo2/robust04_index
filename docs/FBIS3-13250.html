			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 9 Mar (INA)--BABIL accused U.S. President  Bill Clinton of lying in his message to Congress on his decision  to renew the economic embargo on Iraq under the pretext that  Iraq did not implement Security Council resolutions.    In an article today, the newspaper said that the U.S.  President and the Congress are fully aware that all the reports  of the UN Special Commission have emphasized that Iraq has met  all of the requirements in the Security Council resolutions.    The paper added: This Iraqi commitment should urge the  Security Council to adhere to its own commitments regarding the  lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. It said: Ignoring  this fact exposes the evil intentions aimed at infringing on  Iraq's legitimate right and the determination to perpetuate the  unjust siege against Iraq without regard to the suffering of the  Iraqi people.    The newspaper said that further criminal behavior in the  service of Zionism and backwardness clearly shows the extent of  the hatred towards Iraq, which is due only to Iraq's defense of  its freedom and independent decisionmaking.    The newspaper emphasized that the successive pretexts the  evil ones present with the aim of maintaining the siege will  soon be refuted and exposed to the world, and even to many  permanent Security Council members. The newspaper said faithful  and patient Iraq will never accept this evil U.S. behavior, and  will not bow to the continuation of injustice it faces.    BABIL concluded by recalling that Iraq has fulfilled the  commitments imposed on it according to the Security Council  resolutions, and the council should, in turn, fulfill its  commitments in accordance with the same resolutions. The  Security Council should not bow to the U.S. terrorism that has  gone beyond all reasonable limits and become a sword threatening  free peoples everywhere and even the big powers.</p>

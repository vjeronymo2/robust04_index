			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CHANNEL ANNIVERSARY FLIGHT DITCHED  </P> <P> A pilot trying to re-enact the first flight across the English Channel on its  80th anniversary was forced to ditch her plane just two miles short of the  British coast today.  </P> <P> Gloria Pullan was commemorating French aviator Louis Bleriot's July 25, 1909,  flight from Calais, France, to Dover in an authentic Bleriot XI monoplane, the  same type used for his crossing.  </P> <P> "I took off from Calais, and it was a beautiful flight until I started losing  power," she said. "Gradually the aircraft went down, and I had to ditch in the  sea about two miles off Dover."  </P> <P> Pullan, 36, was rescued by a Royal Air Force helicopter after being in the  water for three minutes.  </P> <P> She was taken to a field atop the famous White Cliffs of Dover where a large  welcoming party was waiting on the spot where Bleriot landed.  </P> <P> "It was so sad," she said. "I think the aircraft has been lost. I was enjoying  it so much, and I would do it again any time. I am sorry I could not bring the  airplane in to land for the official reception."  </P></p>

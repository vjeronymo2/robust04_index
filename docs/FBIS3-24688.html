			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the secretariat of the Presidential </F> Group; place and date not given]    [Text] In his year-end address, the president of the  Republic announced that he would take the political initiative,  provided peace was restored in the country. The Presidential  Group, which salutes this step by the president of the Republic,  is surprised that Bernard Kolelas, his political family, and the  international press interpret this initiative by the head of  state as the expression of his wish to form a national union  government with which the opposition would be associated.    Indeed, in his many statements, the head of the Union for  Democratic Renewal-Congolese Labor Party [URD-PCT] coalition has  said that the Congolese political class is actively thinking  about such a government, thus giving the impression that he has  discussed the issue with the other political forces in the  country, notably with the presidential group. The Presidential  Group, which has the parliamentary majority, the statement  continues, takes this opportunity to say that it has never  discussed the formation of a national union government with  anyone whatsoever.    To this end, it is proper to reaffirm the following: The  Presidential Group is not opposed to the participation of all  the sons of the Congo in the management of public property  according to their competence, regardless of their political  convictions. It is, however, opposed to a party government as  was the case of [words indistinct] the formation of political  combinations that will look like a one-party system. On the  other hand, the Presidential Group is still open to all the sons  and daughters of the Congo, without exception, who want to  contribute at all levels, including the governmental one, in the  reconstruction of the country on the basis of the president's  program.    Furthermore, as the end of the proceedings of the  international arbitral college--charged by the terms of the  Libreville accords to examine the electoral dispute--draws near,  the Presidential Group would like to break the responsible  silence that it has so far observed so as not to impede the  delicate work of the college. Regarding this, the Presidential  Group denounces the feverishness of the opposition and its  external allies and the manipulation of the opposition, in which  they pass muster by spreading alarming rumors about the  imaginary results of the arbitral college. According to them,  these results allegedly gave them the majority at the National  Assembly. The statement continues that these habitual tactics  by the opposition are well known. They are aimed at  embarrassing the arbitral college and, above all, preparing  public opinion toward accrediting a thesis of fraud in case the  decisions of the arbitrators do not tally with their fantasies  and wishful musings -- in which the URD-PCT coalition excels.  Finally, the opposition's attitude is aimed at justifying a new  spate of violence, which they are currently preparing for.    The Presidential Group invites all its activists,  well-wishers, and all the Congolese people to await in calm,  serenity, and above all, in vigilance the decision of the seven  international judges who have accepted the delicate task of  helping our country to peacefully resolve the dispute that  cropped up in the wake of the by-elections.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Walker tells court he lied to police investigators Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent Walker property and leisure group, yesterday admitted in court that he had lied to police investigating the company's finances. Mr Walker, giving evidence at the Old Bailey in his defence, was being questioned over his police interviews concerning Mr John Love, a former business associate. Cross-examined by Mr Peter Rook QC, for the prosecution, Mr Walker admitted he had wrongly told police attached to the Serious Fraud Office that Mr Love was not connected with the Walker family trusts. Mr Rook responded: 'So you accept that was a lie?' Mr Walker replied: 'If you want to put it in those terms, yes.' Mr Rook: 'You are someone that lies to get himself out of difficult situations?' Mr Walker: 'No. By that time I was very angry. I had got round to the stage of not being very co-operative. I am sorry about that. 'I had done 30 hours plus with the Serious Fraud Office - very aggressive questioning like you are doing to me now, Mr Rook.' Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, are accused of fraudulently inflating the profits of Brent Walker by devising bogus film rights transactions. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify accounts. The prosecution claims that after Mr Love's death, Mr Walker used his name in the bogus transactions involving Universal Talent Management, a company that was run by Mr John Quested, a former director of the Brent Walker film division. However, Mr Walker dismissed these suggestions as 'fairy tales'. He also denied using KPMG Peat Marwick, Brent Walker's auditors, to mislead the SFO about who ran UTM. During an internal investigation into allegations of improper deals with UTM Mr Walker told the accountants that Mr Love ran UTM. This had been the case, he told Mr Rook. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] The strong winds of the Uruguay Round [UR] talks  concluded last December are bringing a great shock to our  farming villages, and movements are vigorously arising to  overcome this. These movements, being conducted in the direction  of producing value-added products based on scientific  agriculture, are here and there showing instances of success,  injecting new hope into the depressed farm economy.    Started out of an understanding that only competitive  products can survive, these new agricultural methods are  characterized by aspects that are completely different from the  past, for example, the adoption of advanced technology such as  computers. They are drawing agriculture to a higher level by  increasing productivity and competitiveness, and are aiming for  high technology and high added value in agricultural products,  just as is done with industrial products. Recently, in  particular, this is not stopping at domestic markets, but  instances are increasing of products making inroads into Japan  and other foreign markets. This shows that these methods are  readily capable of developing the present crisis into an  opportunity for making great strides.    The agricultural sector being dealt the greatest blow  following the conclusion of the UR talks is the rice market.  With 4 percent of domestic consumption supposed to be brought in  from foreign countries by 2004, it is predicted that the price  competitiveness of domestically produced rice will fall  dramatically, dealing a serious blow to farmers dependent on  rice cultivation.    It is predicted that when the rice market opens in earnest,  the price of domestic rice will fall, followed by reduced  production, self-sufficiency, and farm-household income. The  side effects will not be slight.    To stop the disintegration of the rice-farming household,  high-quality rice must be produced at a low cost and brought to  market. Considerable advances are being made in the first stage  of this process, such as in species improvement for producing  high-quality rice, and this brings hope.    The Rural Development Administration, the delivery room of  our nation's agriculture, boasts that at present, in the  quantity and quality of its rice, Korea is ahead of its  competitors, Japan and the United States. Developed in 1991,  Grade-I Rice, in particular, is assessed to be vastly superior  to Japan's "Koshirikari" and America's "Calrose," which have  been known to be of good quality, with a good taste as well as  clear, clean grains.    The Rural Development Administration was also successful in  developing other new kinds of rice, such as "Suwon--No. 387,"  "Suwon--No. 393," and "Miryang--No. 115." Presently going by  their test names, it appears that these types of rice, if  supplied to normal farming households, will further heighten  competitiveness, at least as far as quality goes.    In charge of rice-quality development is the research team  of  the Rural Development Administration's Crop Testing Center. With  a total of 31 members devoting themselves to research, this team  has for the last ten years applied genetic engineering, and so  on, toward developing two to five new species every year.    Of these, "Grade-I Rice," "Changan Rice," "Odae Rice,"  "Tongjin Rice," and "Mangum Rice," supplied since 1990, are  strategic species capable of dealing with the opening of markets  to imports. The research team will soon come out with "Hyangmi,"  whose grains give off a pleasant smell; "Taerimmi," whose grains  are more than twice as large as normal rice; and "Yusaengmi,"  whose grains contain various colors.    "We are developing various new species based on the over  21,500 species of rice now stored at the seed bank," says Mun  Hon-pal, director of the Crop Testing Center's Lowland Rice  Breeding Division. Expressing confidence, he said, "I believe  that in quality, Korean rice is already securing international  competitiveness."    Besides this, concerning the 13 items to be opened for  import, such as cereals, miscellaneous grains, and flowering  plants, the Crop Testing Center seed bank has secured over  11,000 kinds of seed and is increasing efforts to develop  high-quality species.    Competitiveness in the rice market is not obtained with  quality alone, however. The most important task faced at present  is lowering the price of rice, some three times higher than  American rice, to a competitive level. For this, it must be  backed by agricultural technology and government policy  targeting low production costs and high production power. There  will be considerable difficulty in accomplishing this, say Rural  Development Administration officials.    "More than anything else, an expansion of agricultural land  is needed to make possible large-scale mechanized agricultural,"  says researcher Yun Yong-tae, stressing, "The backing of  government policy is urgently needed for the reclamation of farm  land, which requires the investment of massive project costs."    Efforts to find a way of escape, and swimming out of the  rough seas of the UR are particularly lively at the private  level. Instances are appearing a few at a time of the  development of new products mobilizing all kinds of ideas, of  facilities conceived and operated to reduce production expenses,  and even of products making inroads into foreign markets.  [passage omitted]    More than anything else, the government and the public need  to have a new understanding of agriculture, and farmers too must  cultivate a self-renewing capability by developing agricultural  methods in keeping with the times.    In connection with this, Ho Sin-haeng, former agriculture,  forestry, and fisheries minister, says, "First of all, the  administration must present a mid- and long-term blueprint with  a good understanding of farming and farming communities." He  stresses, "Containing the administration's strong will to carry  out its policies, it must be capable of inculcating in farmers a  motivation to produce."    "There must be reform in agricultural education and other  areas for raising a specialized workforce. Market reform for  price stability must be realized along with it," he says,  adding, "Farmers too should conduct one-village-one-product  campaigns, campaigns to create local specialty production  complexes, and so on, enabling themselves to be independent in  the long run."</p>

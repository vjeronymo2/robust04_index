			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro by </F> Snjezana Mlinarevic; place and date not given: "We Began  Allocating Shares"]    [Text]A vacuum in the Assembly; the government being  incapable of regulating important regulations, like special  taxes for instance, and, in the worst case, resorting to  unpopular decrees; the resignation of Health Minister Andrija  Hebrang in connection with a decision made by the Constitutional  Court -- all this is making the government's life miserable as  it has enough problems trying to administer the country with the  unstable parliamentary processes. Deputy Prime Minister  Borislav Skegro, in his department of economy, has to deal with  most of those problems at present. Furthermore, his portfolio  covers the constantly red- hot field of the transformation and  privatization of social enterprises.    [Mlinarevic] Mr. Skegro, would you comment on the  Constitutional Court's decision that present salaries in the  field of medical services are unconstitutional? Did that create  a precedent or could similar decisions meet the same fate?    [Skegro] I would not comment on the decision passed by the  Constitutional Court. The court is an independent institution.  I can, therefore, not predict the outcome of other cases either.    [Mlinarevic] The health minister's warning that overruling  the decision would undermine the basis of the stabilization  program is an important phenomenon.    [Skegro] Minister Hebrang has warned of resistance regarding  the program, which we emphasize on a daily basis. His  resignation shows his moral attitude. The resignation he  submitted to Prime Minister Valentic does not necessarily have  to be accepted.    [Mlinarevic] While the government is waiting for deputies to  take their seats, many say it has got unnecessarily involved in  the Split case of "Banovina." Why has the government become so  involved over the purpose of one building?    [Skegro] I do not think it got involved at all, and that  this is an insignificant problem, especially for Dalmatia. The  Banovina building is the property of the state and the  government must intervene in this and all similar cases.    [Mlinarevic] You have successfully completed the last round  of negotiations with trade unions about the pay deal. The  latest rift in the biggest trade union head office may bring new  negotiators. Could you comment on that?    [Skegro] I would not comment on the events on the  trade-union scene. Do you want me to come into conflict with  trade unions, now that we managed to get used to being partners?  But, seriously, the trade union turmoil is their internal  problem. Government negotiators do not care who is the  authorized negotiator of the other side.    [Mlinarevic] Some say Mr. Lesar is a weaker negotiator than  say Boris Kunst, who announced a new and stronger trade union  gathering.    [Skegro] I do not want to characterize negotiators, but in  the present circumstances and considering our obligations toward  international financial institutions, the government cannot,  even if it wanted, be generous regarding trade union demands,  which are often justified.    [Mlinarevic] Trade union members say that, in the latest  talks, they managed to "draw in" a large number of firms from  the circle of those that do not submit to pay limitations. Have  you really plant bait for the trade-unions of "51 percent of  registered shares" in the agreement?    [Skegro] Can you imagine that something like that is  possible? Everybody has their own tactics in negotiations.  Anyway, we do not fear salaries will explode in firms with more  than 51 percent of registered shares. New privatization bills  -- and we have been discussing them for a while -- propose that  the dividend be paid on the entire package of shares, meaning  also on the registered, partly-paid shares. Small shareholders  will then have to consider which pays best. Before they give  themselves a raise, they will calculate which pays better. If  they opt for better salaries, they will reduce the dividend,  although they should wait. And it does not take much  calculation to figure out that income tax is much higher than  profit tax. I do not think we will have to persuade  shareholders that those figures are correct.    [Mlinarevic] The arrival of "fresh" money in Croatia is  imminent. Moreover, the minister of finances has set a definite  date for the first round of the foreign loan to come to Croatia  very soon. How will the money be "spent"?    [Skegro] It was announced that the first loan from the World  Bank of $128 million should be given the green light on 23 June,  in addition to other loans that make up the sum of about $500  million, and this will not be "consumed," even if we wanted  that. Those are strictly special-purpose funds that will be  used for rebuilding and building places that were destroyed in  the war, as well as for the construction of the infrastructure;  roads, the electric-power industry, water management, and  agriculture. There can be no improvisation regarding that, for  the world institution will have full control at all times, from  insight into the dynamics of work to payments for every rebuilt  house, for example.    [Mlinarevic] As deputy prime minister, you also function as  the president of the Board of Management of the Croatian  Privatization Fund. How do you account for contradictory views  on the efficiency of the transformation process in Croatia,  ranging from very positive to statements that the privatization  model is a failure?    [Skegro] Easily. As the deputy prime minister who is also  directly in charge of that area, I am expected to give a  favorable judgment. I would, therefore, not like to pass  judgment on the past privatization period or measures we  introduced from that position. I think that the judgment of an  independent institution is most objective and it was presented  to our public. There are weaknesses during the aftermath of the  transition process in all countries -- and Croatia is no  exception -- but IMF and World Bank experts say this process in  Croatia is very good. Anyhow, all further relations with  Croatia are tied to the results of privatization. They see  great progress and their objections refer to public state  enterprises that have not been privatized yet. I am personally  very pleased with the pace of introducing new ownership  relations in firms, and the job of privatization and  restructuring the economy is a painstaking and long process,  even without war.    [Mlinarevic] So, you say that to say that there is social  injustice in the transformation, which has also been compared  with the South-American syndrome -- the rapid impoverishment of  the masses and the rapid acquisition of wealth by a few -- is  unfounded    [Skegro] I do not want to list the arguments that prove that  those statements are false. Let me refer once again to the  evaluation by the international institutions, and they probably  know the circumstances in South America much better than some of  our economists.    [Mlinarevic] Recently, several foreign companies have  purchased shares in Croatian firms. Are foreign investors now  more interested in Croatian firms?    [Skegro] Of course. The climate for investment has improved  significantly, now we have several prominent international  companies in Croatia; "Ericsson" will soon sign a contract to  purchase the shares of "Nikola Tesla," Belgian "Interbrew" is  here, German "Messer" and some others. Furthermore, the success  with swap arrangements, selling shares for "old foreign-currency  savings" [that were lost as a result of the disintegration of  Yugoslavia] on the Zagreb Stock Exchange, is evidence enough of  the progress of privatization.    [Mlinarevic] Still, the state is reluctant to relinquish its  property.    [Skegro] I would not say it is reluctant or that it does not  want to do that. However, we cannot rush into selling off firms  just to get privatization off our backs. For example, can we do  that with hotels for which there is a lot of interest in a  situation like this? Are we to sell hotels cheaply just because  the roads leading to them are destroyed at present?  Furthermore, I do not think it is wise to sell firms that are  making a profit in these circumstances as well. The state needs  some of them. However, private property must prevail.    [Mlinarevic] Sessions of the Managing Board of the  Privatization Fund have recently been opened for the press to  see how decisions on selling firms are passed. On several  occasions, you emphasized that this makes your work much easier.    [Skegro] Decisions about purchases and sales, and which also  concern the destiny of firms and people employed there, are  neither simple nor easy to reach. We must often consider  elements that require sane judgment from different angles. It  would be easier if money was the only element to be considered.  Discussions, people advocating different things, the way of  voting, that is all available to the press, it is all  transparent, and that makes it easier for us to work, knowing  that there can be no additional interpretations, which is a  frequent phenomenon in everything that happens in the process of  transformation.    [Mlinarevic] Journalist had the opportunity to notice that  all members the Managing Board of the Privatization Fund meet  very rarely, and their meetings most often barely have a quorum  or are inquorate, as the last one was. How will you tackle this  extensive agenda?    [Skegro] It will be difficult. It is obvious that the  Managing Board is turning into a bottleneck of a kind. Composed  of deputies, ministers of some key departments, and trade-union  representatives who are burdened by other obligations, often  away on business, the board is essentially a hindrance. Firms  are waiting for decisions and this delay is impossible and  costly for several reasons.    [Mlinarevic] Meetings of the Board, which are few and far  between, have prompted you to consider professionalizing that  body.    [Skegro] That should also be considered. Whether to have a  fully professional, competent team that will be directly  responsible to the government and parliament for each decision  it makes or something similar to that effect. I think new  privatization laws will introduce some new details into the work  of the Managing Board.    [Mlinarevic] Will that also refer to the lower level, to  managing boards in firms?    [Skegro] Managing boards in firms are not that much of a  problem, although they will also be "checked." The more  efficient the managing boards and the privatization, the fewer  firms will have to be run by the state.    [Mlinarevic] New privatization laws were announced some time  ago. From what was available to the public, we can deduce that  the emphasis is on small shareholders.    [Skegro] That is correct. Very soon, the government will  put together a new bill to be put before parliament. We are  aware that the present pace of payment of share installments is  very difficult for small shareholders without great sacrifice,  although we did make some concessions at the beginning of the  second year of payment. We will, therefore, considerably  prolong the period of payment by installments and it will be  longer than the present period of five years. Furthermore, we  will also give a considerable discount for payment in full.  After disabled veterans and the families of dead soldiers, the  second category of citizens will follow -- refugees who will be  given shares.    [Mlinarevic] Will this enable the reaching of a social  consensus of all classes, because some say the state cares only  about the chosen "critical mass" of shareholders?    [Skegro] I think the state should care about the small  shareholders who trusted their firms, who, after all, accepted  the risk of shareholding. However, all other categories will  sooner or later be taken care of. But, everybody cannot be  given an equal number of shares, nor do they deserve that.    [Mlinarevic] According to the first version, it is planned  that the refugees are to get about 20,000 Croatian kuna worth of  shares. Is that a modest amount?    [Skegro] Even children, minors, will have the right to get  shares, so it will not be that insignificant in one family.  However, it is more important which shares to distribute, and  how to secure high-quality, profit-yielding shares that can be  sold at a price not lower than nominal, instead of just "paper."    [Mlinarevic] You attempted to solve the problem -- with  regard to disabled veterans -- by founding the HDF [Croatian  Patriotic Fund]. You got involved personally, but as we see,  the HDF is not functioning as it should.    [Skegro] Yes, I personally supported the HDF project as the  first investment fund, the forerunner of others to come,  however, we encountered problems on two levels. Firstly, the  lack of experts who would lead such a fund. We simply do not  have people educated for that and this will continue to be a  problem. On the other hand, disabled veterans demanded -- and  no one can or wants to deny them that right -- that they chose  the shares themselves and manage them independently, keeping  them or selling them on the market, instead of keeping them at  the HDF with a guaranteed dividend. Therefore, the Managing  Board of the Fund has recently decided to share out, from its  own portfolio, all shares of the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, which  are in great demand among disabled veterans.    [Mlinarevic] Investment funds, as a part of the further  privatization strategy, have been announced, but also forgotten,  it seems. Is the HDF one of the reasons?    [Skegro] They were not forgotten. We have been encountering  the same problems: Who will lead those funds? We are preparing  the establishment of the largest investment fund, the Fund for  Rebuilding, whose beneficiaries will be those who suffered most  in the war. This could be a possibility for the refugees, but,  having learnt from the experience with disabled veterans, we do  not know how the refugees will want to realize their right to  shares. Furthermore, there is the Pension Fund and a couple of  other funds.    [Mlinarevic] On the other hand, the distribution of shares  -- and the Zagreb Tobacco Factory is a case in point -- could  quietly lead to a take-over of factory by foreign companies, and  the state is protecting the tobacco shares precisely from that.    [Skegro] In the ownership structure that will, in time,  develop in the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, once the shares are  distributed -- and there will be a large number of small  shareholders -- take-overs will not occur unforeseen. But you  can rest assured that we created protection mechanisms in the  firm itself, and the state has its own way of influencing the  course of privatization of the firm. There will be no major  take-overs, especially after the experience of some eastern  countries, where tobacco factories were bought just because of  the market and then closed.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5> <H5>  The Right Time Is Yet to Come </H5>   [Mlinarevic] You also advocate the distribution of shares.  If they are being shared out as late as now, was the pace and  the time for the distribution not more important than the  principle of distribution itself?    [Skegro] That is correct. I think that the time for mass  privatization was determined well in Croatia. What would happen  if we had such a strategy at the beginning of transformation?  An abundance of vouchers in a country at war! I claim that  would be lethal; who, today, could know who owes shares? A  "hostile take- over" of our firms, as an economic term, would  probably also happen literally. Naturally, we are counting on  the distribution of shares in transition. Disabled veterans  were first in line, and we will also cover other categories of  the population.  <H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5> <H5>  Bankruptcy </H5>   [Mlinarevic] In spite of the good results of the  stabilization program, the latest data show many insolvencies  among firms. How do you explain that?    [Skegro] It is very simple. Insolvency, just that part  concentrated in two or three branches of economy, is the result  of the chronic nonsettlement of debts between firms that surface  powerfully at a time of zero-inflation.    [Mlinarevic] Still, regarding that, the question of  bankruptcy has again become topical. One gets the impression  that there are no bankruptcies, for they are a matter of  political decision.    [Skegro] There are no bankruptcies of large firms like there  were three years ago. Not that many and with such consequences.  However, it is not true that bankruptcy is a matter of political  decision, nor that politics controls it and artificially  inhibits it. Anyhow, bankruptcy is an everyday occurrence, our  data show that. Indeed, they are not very stormy, which is  good, they do not include a large number of employees at one  place. There are no big changes, but that does not mean there  are no bankruptcies as a normal phenomenon in the market  economy. However, there will be large-scale bankruptcies, but  we must take them as a process of healing the economy that will  be accompanied by a strengthened social program.</p>

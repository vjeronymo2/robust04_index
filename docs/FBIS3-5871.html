Senior Lieutenant General Le Kha Phieu,  member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Communist  Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee attended. Evaluating  the results of the two-year implementation of objectives and  tasks set forth by the 13th province party organization  congress, Comrade Nguyen Ba, member of the CPV Central Committee  and secretary of the province party committee, said:    Over the past two years, the socioeconomic situation in Nghe  An has developed fairly comprehensively. The province's overall  growth rate was relatively higher than in preceding years with  an average agricultural growth rate of 6.15 percent. The  province has basically been able to tackle its food grain issue.  Its gross industrial output value in 1993 increased by 9.4  percent over 1992. Trade, support services, and foreign  economic activities have undergone several changes for the  better. The province's cultural, educational, public health,  and sports activities as well as efforts to solve unemployment  and to implement various social policies have showed great  improvement. Livelihoods have become less difficult and are  becoming stable. The face of various cities, towns, and rural  areas has undergone rapid changes for the better.    However, as a poor province, Nghe An's economic growth rate  is still regarded as slow and much lower than the national  average. In the years ahead, Nghe An must strive to improve its  economic structure in the direction of gradually industrializing  and modernizing various local economic sectors to achieve a  rapid increase in the volume of marketable products. It must  vigorously develop its trade and support service activities to  considerably increase their share of the gross social product.  It must develop education and public health, carry out the  motto of eradicating hunger and reducing poverty, encourage the  people to enrich themselves legally, and stabilize and improve  the people's lives.    The conference directed that the following targets be  achieved by the province during the period ahead:    -- agricultural output value must achieve an average annual  increase of 6.2 percent in a bid to yield 820,000 to 850,000  tons of food grain.    -- gross industrial output value must achieve an average  annual increase of 14 percent.    -- gross social product value must achieve an average  annual increase of 7 percent.    -- national revenue must achieve an average annual  increase of 8 percent.    Addressing the conference, Comrade Le Kha Phieu urged Nghe  An  to ascertain the strengths and advantages of each economic area  in order to come up with effective investment measures to help  achieve national socioeconomic development and to avoid being  left behind compared with other localities nationwide.</p>

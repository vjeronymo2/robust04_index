			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (AFP)--Five persons working for the  U.S. television network NBC were detained by police and  questioned for two hours after the crew interviewed dissident  Wang Dan at his Beijing home, relatives of one of the crew said.    The crew comprised an American, an Australian, a Filipino  and  a Chinese, as well as a Tokyo-based Japanese who was the only  one of the five without Chinese accreditation, they said.    Relatives of Wang said about 10 police burst into his home  at  around 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and asked the crew if they had  official authorisation to carry out the interview.    "As they did not have any, the police took them away, along  with Wang Dan," one said.    The NBC crew was taken to the central Beijing offices of a  branch of the police that is in charge of foreigners in China,  and was released two hours later.    Wang, held for an hour at a police station in his  neighbourhood, said the police wanted to know how the  journalists had contacted him and what had been said at the  meeting.    He said the interview focussed on renewal of  most-favoured-nation (MFN) customs status by the United States,  the state of human rights in China and his private life.</p>

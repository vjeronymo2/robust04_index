			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Combined Bond-and-Equity PEPs (15): A tax cherry in a portfolio cocktail - The savings industry lobbied the chancellor for a Pep-like allowance for gilts or gilt funds, but he did not oblige. Bethan Hutton examines the possible compromises available to investors The ideal portfolio for the typical private investor is usually said to consist of a mixture of shares, fixed-interest securities and cash on deposit. The proportions should vary according to your stage of life, attitude to risk, view of the market, particular need for income or capital growth, and so on. So if a Pep is to be a central part of your portfolio, it would seem logical for it to furnish more than one of these elements. However, the government has other ideas. Personal equity plans, as their name suggests, are intended to encourage equity investment, not to act as tax shelters for lower-risk investments such as gilts or cash. The savings industry lobbied the chancellor before the last Budget for a Pep-like allowance for gilts or gilt funds, but the chancellor did not oblige, and is unlikely to in the foreseeable future. The government's priority now is to get people spending again, rather than encourage them to save more. Although a Pep cannot be used to invest solely in gilts or bonds, you can get some exposure to them in combination with ordinary shareholdings. However, two investment management groups (Foreign &amp; Colonial and Save &amp; Prosper) ran into trouble last year, when the Inland Revenue decided that funds they were marketing for inclusion in Peps were not eligible for Pep investment, as less than 50 per cent of their assets were in the form of shares. The Revenue deemed that such funds could not be held in a Pep, even up to the Pounds 1,500 limit for investment in 'non-qualifying' funds. Only funds which were less than 50 per cent invested in bonds or gilts were 'pepable'. The government's ruling has created the anomaly that a single fund can invest up to 49 per cent in bonds or gilts and still qualify for Pep investment; but an investor putting together a self-select Pep cannot include any gilts, bonds or funds which are more than half invested in bonds or gilts, even if the total holding of fixed interest securities within the Pep is less than the regulation 50 per cent. Curiously, although the Revenue has clamped down on using Peps to invest in fixed-interest securities, it has not done the same for holdings of cash. At the moment, there is no fixed limit on how much of your Pep can be held in cash, or for how long, before you use the money to buy shares or units in a trust. This is perhaps because cash is not an enticing prospect for investors at the moment, due to low interest rates. Shortly after the Revenue ruling on bonds, a number of other investment management groups came up with pepable unit trusts designed to exploit the 50 per cent limit. The idea of a Pep which can combine bond/gilt and equity investment is appealing to many investors, because it will tend to produce more income than most funds invested solely in equities. For most people, at least in the first few years, the main attraction of a Pep is the income tax exemption, not the capital gains tax one, as relatively few people pay capital gains tax. There are four funds designed for Pep investment which fall into this category: Cazenove Utility &amp; Bond fund, Fidelity High Income, Guinness Flight Equity &amp; Bond Income, and M&amp;G Managed Income Fund. The M&amp;G Managed Income fund, which puts together a selection of M&amp;G unit trusts, including gilt funds, gets around the rule because it is a fund-of-funds, structured as a unit trust in itself, rather than a Pep wrapper around a mix of individual funds. The other three trusts fall into the category of UK balanced funds - ie those which hold a mixture of shares and bonds or gilts. Their main emphasis is on income, but they do also offer the prospect of some capital growth. They tend to invest in higher-yielding shares, such as utilities. Not all balanced funds are suitable for Pep investment, as their holding of bonds may slip over to more than 50 per cent. Chris Burvill, manager of Guinness Flight's Equity and Bond trust, says: 'We designed it very much as a Pep product. It is meant to be a low-risk fund.' He sees the fund's advantage as offering a high yield, through investing in high-yielding stocks and corporate bonds, but also presenting a lower risk than a pure equity fund. At the moment, the fund has about 65 per cent equities, and 35 per cent corporate sterling Eurobonds. The equity portion was higher and is gradually being reduced. The lower risk level of balanced funds is partly due to their defensive capacity. Managers are able to increase the fund's weighting in equities when the stock market looks set for a good run, then lock in growth by switching back to more stable bonds when they feel shares are becoming over-valued. This tends to mean, however, that capital growth is slower than that of more equity-oriented funds. Performance of the Guinness Flight fund was above average for the UK balanced funds sector over the six months to February 1, ranking 16 out of 42 funds (source: Micropal). 'We are competing against funds which have up to 80 per cent in equities, so if we can be half-way up in a very strong bull run in the market, we should do quite well on the down side,' Burvill says. Cazenove's utility and bond fund did even better, ranking second overall in the same sector, while Fidelity was at number 31. M&amp;G's Managed Income trust was 17th out of 60 funds in the fund-of-funds sector. John Spiers, of Best Investment, warns that some of these Peps have high management charges, which he says are hard to justify. 'If you do want to be conservative and go for this sort of fund, management charges are more important than they would be for an equity fund,' he says. For example, M&amp;G has an annual management charge of 1.5 per cent; Guinness Flight's annual charge for the Pep is 1.25 per cent; Fidelity also charges 1.25 per cent; while Cazenove charges 0.5 per cent on the underlying unit trust, and Pounds 30 plus VAT for the Pep from the second year onwards.</p>

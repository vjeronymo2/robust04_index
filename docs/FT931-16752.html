			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Real cause of damage to US silver mining Sir, I enjoyed Arnold Wilson's article on Leadville and skiing ('Leadville, living on a legend', December 24). He writes that 'In 1893, when along with other old mining towns . . . Leadville had its heart torn out by a government decision to end the silver standard.' It was in fact only in 1900 that bimetallism officially ended in the US, when Congress passed the Gold Standard Act. But Mr Wilson is correct in indicating that the real damage to Colorado silver mining was done in 1893 - by the British authorities as well as by the American. In June 1893, India ceased coining silver, and the price of silver tumbled in four days from 83 to 62 cents an ounce. In October 1893, the US Congress repealed the Sherman Act which had required our Treasury to purchase several million ounces of silver annually. And any hope of a recovery in silver mining ended in the presidential election of 1896, with the defeat of William Jennings Bryan and 'Free Silver'.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Arms Buildup Targeted Against Fellow Countrymen" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group  is blaring that it will "additionally introduce" latest-type  weapons under the pretext of "establishing a stronger security  posture" and stage as scheduled all the war gambles including  the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, not reducing their  scale.    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    The reckless arms buildup of the Kim Yong-sam group and its  war preparations to invade the North are unpardonable  treacheries to plunge the fellow countrymen into the scourge of  a nuclear war, in confrontation with them as a war servant of  outside forces.    In stepping up arms buildup and war gambles under the  pretext  of "establishing a security posture" and carrying the situation  on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase of war, the Kim  Yong-sam group seeks to stay in power with the armed backing of  the master, leaving South Korea under U.S. domination. The Kim  Yong-sam group is a pack of bellicose elements who are racing  headlong along the road of confrontation and war against fellow  countrymen, in order to be "protected" by the U.S. military  industrial complexes in reward for the fabulous profits ensured  them which are trying to sell more weapons by increasing the  tensions at any cost.    Our fellow countrymen who hold dear the dignity of the  nation  and love peace will never pardon those who hold personal ease  and interests of outside forces dearer than the interests and  destiny of the nation and do not hesitate to impose the  holocaust of nuclear war upon the nation.    The Korean people and People's Army will sternly punish the  South Korean puppets, if they attempt to do harm to fellow  countrymen in league with foreign forces.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs cut Doeflex to Pounds 1.24m Doeflex, the maker of specialist plastic materials, overcame its difficult first quarter to produce an increase of 13 per cent in operating profit over 1991. However, pre-tax profit declined 3 per cent, from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 1.24m, reflecting additional interest costs associated with the purchase of the freehold of the Swindon factory. Turnover improved marginally to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 18.1m). The group was not immune to the depressed conditions in the construction and DIY markets, but significant growth was coming from products introduced over the past two years. Earnings per share worked through at 10.59p (10.21p) and the final dividend is 2.7p for an unchanged total of 4.02p. Gearing at the year-end was 118 per cent but a favourable cash flow was expected this year.</p>

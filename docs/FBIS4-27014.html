			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China today called on  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to speed up  the talks on the resumption of its membership of the world trade  body.    Gu Yongjiang, head of the Chinese delegation and  vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, made  the appeal at the 17th meeting of the GATT China team  responsible for the talks.    In his speech at the meeting, which began here today, he  said  that since China applied for reentry eight years ago it has made  great progress in its economic and foreign trade reforms.    "China has made a series of reforms on its own conditions to  meet GATT demands." he added. "In some fields the Chinese  markets are more open than some developed nations."    Gu said that after the 16th team meeting held in March this  year a positive and constructive momentum emerged in the  negotiations on the issue.    According to the Chinese foreign trade official progress has  been made in the bilateral talks China held with some individual  GATT member countries and those on cutting tariffs and  non-tariffs.    "China's economic and foreign trade systems have further  conformed to the international ones." Gu said adding that China  abolished tariffs on 208 kinds of import commodities from the  beginning of this month. [sentence as received]    He said China would further cut tariffs by negotiations with  the GATT members concerned but stressed that as a developing  nation it can only fulfill the obligations taking into account  current economic conditions.    Gu said GATT's conditions for China's reinstatement should  help perfect the Chinese market economy, promote China's social  stabilities and economic steady growth, thus making China's  markets more open to the world and beneficial to a large number  of the GATT member nations.    The four-day meeting is discussing the protocol articles on  China's reentry.    On Tuesday [28 June] Long Yongtu, secretary general of the  Chinese delegation and assistant to Chinese foreign trade and  economic cooperation minister, complained that the articles are  burdensome for China's current economic capabilities and  therefore unacceptable.    He pointed out that although China attaches importance to  the  resumption of its founding membership in the world trade body,  it has other important things to do.    Long expressed his hope that all the parties involved in the  talks act fairly and realistically in the discussions on the  protocol articles.    During the meeting the Chinese delegation will also hold  separate consultations with the United States, the European  Union and Japan.</p>

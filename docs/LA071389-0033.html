			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TOMAC 9TH IN INDIVIDUAL TIME TRIAL;  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH CYCLIST OFF TO SLOW START IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> John Tomac, a Chatsworth cyclist who was among the favorites in the men's  individual time trial at the U. S. National Cycling Championships, finished  ninth in Wednesday's race, 1 minute, 33 seconds behind winner Nathan Sheafor.  </P> <P> John Wordin of West Hills finished 14th, 2 minutes, 33 seconds behind Sheafor,  a Boulder, Colo., competitor who was not listed among the seeded riders.  </P> <P> Sheafor brushed aside rainy weather and slick streets to finish the 24.8-mile  course in 49:54.  </P> <P> Jim Copeland of Cary, N.C., placed second in 49:59, the only other rider in the  field of 143 to finish in less than 50 minutes. Kent Bostick, of Albuquerque,  N.M., was third in 50:20.  </P> <P> "I was pretty nervous. I didn't know what to expect," said Sheafor, who  finished second in the event in 1985. "I rode in the rain after the first three  miles. The course was very slick. I almost fell and crashed into a wall."  </P> <P> John Frey, the defending champion, was the final entrant to begin the course  and rode in the worst conditions.  </P> <P> Despite falling at the turnaround, he still placed 12th in 51:57.  </P> <P> Wordin said he was encouraged by his ride, despite the miserable conditions.  </P> <P> "It was absolutely the most brutal time-trial course I've ever raced on,"  Wordin said.  </P> <P> Jeanne Golay of Hollywood, Fla., third overall in the recent Tour of Texas, won  the early 47-rider women's division in 54:51.  </P> <P> Jane Marshall of Albuquerque, who holds the national time-trial record of  54:27, placed second in 54:56. Marion Clignet of Bethesda, Md., finished third  in 55:56.  </P> <P> Defending women's champion Phyllis Hines of Atlanta missed the event because  she is competing in the Tour de France.  </P> <P> Dara Rogers of Van Nuys was eighth, 4:13 behind Golay.  </P> <P> After a rest day today, the men's and women's divisions will resume racing  Friday with the team time trials, also in Coalville.  </P></p>

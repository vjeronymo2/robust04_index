			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / DTI rejects Labour plea on Archer Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected Labour claims that a report from his department on Lord Archer's Anglia Television share dealings could be published. Mr Heseltine said the Financial Services Act gave him 'no power' to publish the report, compiled by DTI inspectors after MAI paid Pounds 292m for Anglia earlier this year. Labour dismissed Mr Heseltine's interpretation of the act, accusing him of a blatant attempt to avoid 'matters of genuine public concern'. The report was compiled by DTI inspectors earlier this year after Lord Archer placed orders for Anglia shares on behalf of an associate shortly before the MAI bid was announced. After taking legal advice on the report, Mr Heseltine decided not to prosecute Lord Archer, the novelist and former Conservative party deputy chairman. The London Stock Exchange decided to take no action against Lady Archer, a director of Anglia, under its Yellow Book rules aimed at preventing the leakage of price-sensitive information. Labour claims that section 179 of the Financial Services Act allows the trade and industry secretary to publish an inspector's report if those named give their consent. But Mr Heseltine said the inquiry was carried out under section 177 of the act, which provides for investigations to determine whether a criminal offence of insider dealing has been committed. 'Thus, inspectors' reports, as well as detailing the facts as they find them, set out their judgments on these facts,' he said in a letter to Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who is on holiday. 'For example, they typically consider possible motives underlying the actions of those they have investigated and their state of knowledge, and they express their views about the prospect of securing a conviction in the criminal courts. 'Such reports are prepared on the basis that they are not for publication, but that they are instead confidential reports to the secretary of state to enable him to decide whether there is a basis for criminal proceedings.' Mr Heseltine said it was 'clear' that parliament did not intend such reports to be published. The DTI would not say whether Lord Archer had been asked for permission to publish the report. Lord Archer was not available for comment.</p>

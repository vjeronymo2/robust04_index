			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Alcatel sells postal units in record buy-out ALCATEL, the French telecommunications equipment group, has sold its postal franking and folding machine businesses to a group of financial investors and company staff for an estimated FFr2bn (Dollars 369m). This is France's largest management buy-out since the FFr7bn acquisition of Darty, the electrical retailer, four years ago. Alcatel's mailing machine businesses, known as Satmam in France and Hadewe in the Netherlands, take second place in the world market after Pitney Bowes of the US. The division recorded FFr2bn sales last year and employs 3,600 people. About half its sales are made abroad, mainly in the US, Britain and the Netherlands. The deal allows Alcatel to pull out of a non-strategic activity without selling to a competitor, said Mr Jean-Marie Messyer, a managing associate at Lazard Freres, the bank which organised the buy-out. The management holds 2 per cent of the equity and will have stock options - still under negotiation  -which could allow them to go up to more than 5 per cent. The remainder is held by the financial backers, with 35 per cent owned by a Lazard investment fund, plus 15 per cent with Baring Capital Investors.</p>

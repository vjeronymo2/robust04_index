			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T Introduces New PCs: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. unveiled  four personal computers made to AT&amp;T specifications by Intel Corp., which  is substantially replacing Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. as the company's  PC supplier. The computers are specially designed to be used in networks and  can be purchased with software that allows them to perform particular  networking or communications jobs. They range in price from $2,995 to $22,225.  The announcement was expected after AT&amp;T's announcement last week of a  personal computer development agreement with Intel, which is better known for  selling bare chips, not whole computers.  </P></p>

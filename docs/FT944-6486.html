			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mellon Bank takes Dollars 130m charge over stock lending Mellon Bank of the US said it would take a Dollars 130m after-tax charge to cover investment losses of customers of its stock lending business following the fall in bond prices this year. The move is the latest sign that some banks, ambitious to develop their global custody and stock lending businesses, have bought unsuitable securities with cash which was deposited by their customers as collateral. In June, Harris Trust, a subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, said it would absorb Dollars 51.3m of investment losses for stock-lending customers, leading to an after-tax charge of Dollars 33m. Mellon said the charge announced yesterday sprang from its intended purchase of interest rate swap contracts to change the characteristics of investments under its control. These swaps would be used to tie the investments to short-term floating rates, the bank said. Mr Frank Cahouet, Mellon's chairman and chief executive, said the bank had decided that 'the interest rate sensitivity of certain client portfolios is not appropriate under current conditions for the unique requirements of the securities lending business'. Mellon did not provide details of its investment strategy, except to say that it invested in longer-term bonds. Prices of these bonds have fallen steadly this year. The returns from investing collateral have become an important source of income in the global custody business. Custodians, which hold securities on behalf of institutional investors, lend the securities to brokers and others for short periods, receiving collateral in return. The broker is generally paid a return on the collateral equivalent to overnight interest rates. Any additional investment return is usually kept by the custodian.

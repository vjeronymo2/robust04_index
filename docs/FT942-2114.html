			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: 'The Rake' renewed - Opera David Hockney has done some repainting for Glyndebourne's celebrated production (from 1975) of The Rake's Progress, and in the new house his designs look more brilliant than ever: witty, imaginatively apt, visually sensational. John Cox has come back to direct it again, and with the odd bright new detail the whole conception rings true. This is an unforgettable staging. Musically - well, it is nearly as good. Andrew Davis takes the London Philharmonic through Stravinsky's score with his usual lively intelligence, and due care for his singers. The darkest, sternest passages are a touch lightweight; the soft-edged attack that Davis cultivates so appealingly in Richard Strauss alternates here with nervy brittleness. I found myself wishing that he could swop places with Elgar Howarth at the Garsington Opera: Davis to lavish more unashamed tenderness upon Strauss's Capriccio, Howarth to emphasise the tough muscle in the Rake. Tom Rakewell himself is sung by an interesting American tenor, Stephen O'Mara (his first time): a nice edge of hysteria, genuinely moving when ruined, but too much tight tone and too often unintelligible in the Auden/Kallman words. Promising, though; and so is Christiane Oelze's sweetly frail Anne Trulove, though she misses the brave resolve of her climactic Act 1 aria. It is left to Steven Page's potent, saturnine Nick Shadow - the Mephisto-figure - to wield the full weight of his character, and thus to dominate the evening. It was only two years ago that this latecoming star essayed the role for Glyndebourne's young touring company; but Page should expect an international demand for his Nick in many future seasons. Besides the advantage of imposing height, he is a sharp and subtle actor, in towering command of his words and his music. For Baba the Turk, the Rake's rash choice of a circus-wife, Jane Henschel's throaty comic delicacy matches her luxuriant beard, more plausible than any I've seen on a Baba. Cox has given her an affecting moment when she plucks out a hair of it - at some evidently painful cost - for one of her admirers. On a cameo scale Robert Tear's ripe, preening auctioneer is perfect too, lending a vital theatrical charge to the post-prandial third act (specially important at Glyndebourne, as the audience is liable to drift off). Frode Olsen makes a fine, upstanding Trulove pere, and Angela Hickey a cheery old trout as Mother Goose, the brothel-mistress. In the brothel scene and everywhere else, I missed more of the eager Glyndebourne chorus's words than expected. As with O'Mara's Tom, however, I was unsure whether the fault lay with them or with the tricks of the acoustic. For Figaro three weeks ago I sat in the rear stalls, a bit higher, and heard almost every word; nearer the stage this time, I lost many more of them. That may be one of the uncontrollable accidents of the theatre, and in any case the losses were marginal compared to the persuasive certainties of the production. Revival sponsored by British Airways; in repertory until August 14</p>

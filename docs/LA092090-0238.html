			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TOPICS: STUDENTS TELL HOW TEACHERS GET TO THEM  </P> <P> The sound of fingernails screeching across blackboards may be extremely  irritating, but it didn't even make the list when Hot Topics asked "What is the  one thing a teacher can do to make you angry?"  </P> <P> "When they think they are the only teachers giving us homework."  </P> <P> Lauren Fitxer, 16, senior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "If a teacher catches one student doing something wrong and she punishes the  whole class."  </P> <P> Hoa Vu, 14, sophomore, Saddleback  </P> <P> "When some teachers get carried away by being in charge. They're so demanding,  they make students feel inferior."  </P> <P> Angie Landrum, 16, junior, Rancho Alamitos  </P> <P> "When they use me as an example in front of the class."  </P> <P> Chris Thompson, 17, senior, Orange  </P> <P> "They could form opinions about me without knowing me and then not change them  throughout the year."  </P> <P> Amy Mosher, 13, freshman, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> "When it's more important for them to follow their syllabus than to make us  understand."  </P> <P> Brigette O'Donavan, 17, senior, Troy  </P> <P> "When they don't let you go to the bathroom."  </P> <P> Brian Stoddart, 16, junior, La Habra  </P> <P> "When teachers contradict themselves."  </P> <P> Brian Harden, 16, junior, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> "When teachers pry into my personal life. I think a teacher should teach and  not ask about my life unless it affects the rest of the class."  </P> <P> Briana Cole, 16, senior, Esperanza  </P> <P> "They assign homework and don't collect it."  </P> <P> Elisa Caillier, 16, junior, Connelly  </P> <P> "When a teacher says she will return a test or an assignment the next day but  returns it a week later."  </P> <P> Mark Abutin, 15, junior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "I don't get it when teachers take their frustrations out on you. Like when  they say 'Shut up,' that's a slap in the face."  </P> <P> Monee Hammond, 15, sophomore, Ocean View  </P> <P> "Blaming me for doing something I didn't do."  </P> <P> Cortney Roberts, 15, sophomore, Sonora  </P> <P> "If a teacher is close-minded and not open to new ideas."  </P> <P> Glenn Perez, 17, senior, University  </P> <P> "When teachers judge me on my appearance."  </P> <P> Jim McNeill, 16, junior, Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Next Week's Hot Topic:  </P> <P> "If you could have one hour to address the leaders of influential nations, what  would you tell them?"  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Orlov: "Yuriy Shafranik Is Haunted by </F> the Fuel and Energy Complex"]    [Text] We all know that Russia has a fuel and energy  complex (TEK) and the entire economy--which means our entire  life--is "locked" onto it. At the sound of the word "fuel,"  hearts begin to ache with dread in Russia and the near abroad,  because this word has long become a synonym for inflation. The  problems associated with the TEK look different, however, from  the angle of car owners and housewives, well drillers and  geologists-prospectors, exchange speculators and VPK  [military-industrial complex] brass. Following this line, it  would be interesting to find out what the leadership of the TEK  itself sees as a priority.    The minister of fuel and power engineering met with  journalists a few days ago and told them that on one hand he is  grateful, if not to all, then almost all, those who write about  the TEK; on the other hand, they mainly write about the wrong  things or place the wrong emphasis. As a sort of methodological  aid, Yuriy Shafranik described three main directions--the three  component parts of the TEK's problems.    First. We treat TEK output barbarically. The fuel  and energy complex is the most "social" of all the sectors. One  can somehow survive for two to three days without bread, but not  without various kinds of energy. Nevertheless, we expend energy  right and left, and expend it stupidly. Not a single product in  Russia is produced according to Western standards of  energy-intensiveness: For instance, we expend 400 kw-hours to  produce a tonne of ammonia, while in Europe this indicator does  not exceed 80. Another 25 percent is regularly lost in  transportation: For 400 hecacalories produced, about 100 are  "dissipated" in pipes. Next, losses during production: In the  world more than 12 percent is considered a disaster; here, less  than 30 percent is an occasion for celebration.    A counterquestion. Is it not the TEK itself that  accounts for two out of three aforementioned factors in energy  losses: production and transportation?    Second. Rate disparity hurts the fuel and energy  complex, while in turn influencing all of industry. During  the "stagnation" years physical persons paid 4 kopeks per kw-hr,  enterprises--2. Approximately the same rate structure is used in  the entire world. Today the average rate is 24 rubles [R] per  kw-hr, but individuals pay an average of R5. At the same time,  regional rate differentials today measure a factor of eight,  which should be no more than 2.5 (the regional lobby, naturally,  resists rate leveling). This rate disparity hurts industry,  which is simply unable to pay. Hence, the insolvency crisis and,  as a chain reaction, the TEK's dismal situation.    Counterquestion No. 1. Everybody feels sorry for  industry, of course, but does this mean that ordinary citizens  have to pay for everything--is it not enough that they pay their  taxes?    Counterquestion No. 2. Leveling rate differentials  between regions apparently assumes raising them for those who  pay too little, and lowering them for those who carry an  excessive burden. Does across-the-board resistance indicate that  in the process of "leveling," the regions with low rates are  simply being "pulled up" to the level of more costly  neighbors?    Third. The fuel and energy complex needs money, for  which there are no sources. The TEK includes mainly very  capital-intensive productions. Money is needed not only for  long-term programs and new technologies. Unless 12 planned  construction projects are completed in the near future, the  energy supply for eight krays and oblast will deteriorate  substantially. At the same time, money is needed not only for  the TEK's development, but also for the long-awaited  restructuring--liquidation--of money-losing enterprises (the  corresponding programs already have been drafted with respect to  the coal, oil, and gas sectors; in addition, five mines in the  Kuzbass [Kuznetsk Basin] need to be closed urgently). However,  so far investment is not an option.    The TEK has practically no internal investment reserves.  Consumers currently owe the entire complex more than R20  trillion. True, now the money will be recovered faster: The  recent government decree permits TEK creditors to withdraw money  from accounts of debtor enterprises on a nonacceptance basis  (immediately, without additional coordination and regardless of  whether the debtor acknowledges the debt). But even after money  is collected, because of the difficult tax situation only a  small part can be reinvested. Ninety percent of the TEK output's  price is comprised of items outside of the complex--that is, the  price largely consists of tax rates, excise taxes, and  reappraisal of fixed assets (the latter boosted prices by 20  percent). Out of the remaining 10 percent they have to pay  salaries, cover costs, and only after that invest in new  programs.    They see as a solution, on one hand, creating a sensible  structure of rates (read: individuals should pay more than  enterprises--V.O.), and on the other--large-scale conversion to  joint-stock holding. First, joint-stock companies, once they are  set up, will not allow speculators to feed off them. Second, the  mechanism of operation of joint-stock companies will make it  possible to shift to internal clearing prices due to working  with customer-supplied material. Third, value-added tax can be  removed from the company's internal clearing. All of this will  enable the TEK to reduce prices for their products, which as a  result will undermine inflation at its roots.    Counterquestion No. 1. Is it not the citizens--who, in  the minister's opinion, pay too little for energy--who in the  final analysis pay for all the taxes, excise taxes, and  reappraisal of fixed assets?    Counterquestion No. 2. Will the money for the  completion of the aforementioned 12 construction projects come  from the budget? If so, then on which expense line item and how  will the TEK compensate for this new hole in the budget?    Counterquestion No. 3. Does not one of the reasons the  TEK does not have any internal reserves have its roots in the  somewhat strange position of heads of TEK enterprises: Instead  of seeking a compromise with strike committees they immediately  transfer all monetary revenue into salaries and other  pay-outs?    A few counter- (and very arguable) contentions. The author  doubts that he will live long enough to see anyone anywhere in  Russia reduce prices for anything at their own initiative. The  author has no doubt that many journalists in their search for  culprits in some or other problems have formed a sort of  personal image of the enemy. For some it is the directors'  corps; for others--the defense sector; and for others it is  probably the TEK. This is not very good, since it is not the  defense sector or the TEK that are at fault--as Mikhail  Zhvanetskiy used to say, "the faults of the entire system have  started coming out..." Nevertheless, the author is doubly  certain that in addition to the group of problems enumerated by  Yuriy Shafranik, many other questions are no less important and  significant: quotas, licenses, and other bribe-exports; poor  justification of enterprises' and sectors' claims to budget  means and budget preferences; unclear regulations regarding  foreign investment (one day "put the squeeze on them," and the  next day, on the contrary, "let them in"), and so on, and so on.  It would be good, of course, to see these topics disappear from  newspaper pages--but only as a result of a fundamental  improvement in the situation.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The Times erroneously reported Saturday that John Cassavetes' publicist, Esme  Chandlee, quoted the late actor-director as saying he could no longer watch his  film "A Woman Under the Influence" because it was "too powerful an experience."  Cassavetes' comment actually came from an Associated Press report.  </P></p>

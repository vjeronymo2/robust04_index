			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Fashion: Baby dolls with a tough message - Comment Fashion, the source of much innocent pleasure, is capable of arousing an extraordinary amount of displeasure. It has always been so. Moralists throughout the ages have predicted the downfall of civilisation on the grounds of an excess of sequins, five-inch heels or stressed whalebone. But their homilies were never as disturbing as the current outpourings of gibberish to which fashion is falling victim. Possibly the worst example is the theory which is glibly advanced for fashion's current preoccupation with a waif-like body and clothes which, in their brevity and their winsomeness, remind some commentators of the children's department at Harrods. This style, says the new generation of style police, is paedophilic and utterly to be deplored. Their analysis does not go beyond this catchword but it is such a loaded word that it hardly needs to. Headlines and hints are quite enough to communicate the horror and revulsion readers are intended to share. Do those commentators understand the term they are using? Or is it just a smart word with lots of syllables that gets their story on to the front page. Some certainly do and one can only assume that they do not understand what they see on the catwalks of international fashion designers and, more importantly, on the streets of our cities. We have just emerged from one of the most stultified and stultifying periods of fashion history, a period in which the ideal woman was trussed up in tight, rigidly structured clothes which projected a self-conscious, mature sexuality. Paradoxically, women did not feel they could be taken seriously in the workplace, never mind the boudoir, if they were not displaying well-propped cleavage and lengths of sheer-stockinged leg atop sharp stilettoes. The most that could be said for this swaying, hourglass-shaped parody of what a transvestite thinks a girl should look like was that it took the most unambiguously obvious symbols of femininity and transformed them into aggressive weapons. Traditionally regarded as a way of dressing which pleased men and, therefore, placed the wearer in a dependent, eager-to-please role, it was transformed into a way of dressing which intimidated men and put women in control. The moth to the flame method of manipulation after Alexis Colby. Many women hated it and refused to play. Thoughtful analysts of fashion were torn between approving of it - because it obviously made women feel empowered - and disapproving of it - because it made them look like cartoon-character tarts. But there was another style of dress running in parallel with the executive tart and it was highly subversive. It consisted of leggings, a decency preserving top, and big, big boots; it looked extraordinarily like the costume for a particularly competent principal boy. The women, usually but not always younger women, who adopted this style swaggered rather than minced. While they sat with their legs comfortably hitched over the arm of the chair, their micro-skirted sisters wriggled uncomfortably, attempted to cross theirs seductively and prayed their knickers were not showing. As we all know, the principal boy is an innocent, virtuous, straightforward kind of character. The baby doll look which young women are enjoying at present is a simple development of both the look and the mood it represents. It is about innocence rather than experience, suggestion rather than insistence. It is tentative, approachable, youthful, instinctive and free-spirited. Unlike the principal boy look which is gamine, androgynous and deliberately jokey, it is incontestably feminine. But no modern young woman wants to look like a real baby doll. This is a baby doll with an edge. She may be an innocent, but she's nobody's fool. While the clean simplicity of her droopy little slip of a frock may tell some of the truth about her, the whole story is a lot more complicated. So she wears her hair sticking up in rats' tails that have taken hours to construct and she either parodies the executive tart's stilettoes by wearing them with ankle socks or climbs into the biggest, butchest pair of mountaineering boots she can afford. The details may be different but in its rejection of knowing ultra-femininity, the baby doll is very closely related to the 1960s mini in a way that the 1980s mini was not. As Mary Quant said at the time, the mini-skirted swinger was trying very hard indeed not to look like her mother. Consequently, she time-locked herself, metaphorically, into late adolescence. But she did not do it to titillate paedophiles; she did it to distance herself from preceding generations and to identify with her own. Similarly, today's skinny-shanked baby dolls do not imagine they are giving pleasure to anyone who is sexually attracted to children. But she does hope she will shock and alienate the complacently middle-aged who think they know what an attractive female should look like. And she hopes her message of innocence and toughness, wariness and openness, will speak to the young men of her own generation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Suha 'Arafat, wife of PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat, in Tunis by Nidal Qabalan in London on 2 June --  recorded]    [Text] [Mrs. 'Arafat] First of all, I would like to thank  MBC for its interest in Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] health. I  assure you that there is no call for concern. Abu-'Ammar is in  good health. He is only somewhat exhausted and has the flu;  that is all there is to it. He will resume activity tonight.  He is just a little tired. It is a very mild case of influenza.    Brother Nidal, you have noticed that for two weeks -- after  the issue of his statement about jihad in Johannesburg -- there  has been a series of rumors about Abu-'Ammar, his family, and  about his illness. Now there is another rumor that he has been,  or will be, taken to the hospital in Amman.    [Qabalan] Then the illness you say the Palestinian president  has overcome will not affect his commitments, engagements, and  his forthcoming visit to Jericho in the near future?    [Mrs. 'Arafat] Reassure our people inside that Abu-'Ammar  will be on time. He is in good health. There is absolutely no  call for concern.    [Qabalan] Mrs. 'Arafat, thank you.</p>

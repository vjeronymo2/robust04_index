			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLOPIAN TUBE IMPLANT LEADS TO BIRTH OF GIRL  </P> <P> A baby was born this week at an Orange County hospital after what is believed  to be the first implant of a frozen, fertilized egg in a woman's Fallopian  tubes in the United States, officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The baby, a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce girl, was born Monday, said Dr. Lawrence  B. Werlin, director of fertility services at Hoag Memorial Hospital  Presbyterian.  </P> <P> The mother, a 37-year-old Mission Viejo resident who was not identified, also  is doing well, added Werlin, who implanted the embryo taken from the woman's  27-year-old sister.  </P> <P> Werlin initially transferred unfrozen eggs, which had been fertilized with  sperm from the older woman's husband, directly to the mother's womb. That  attempt failed to result in pregnancy. Later, using a frozen fertilized egg,  Werlin placed the egg in the woman's Fallopian tubes.  </P> <P> Werlin said the significance of the birth is that in vitro fertilization may  now have a higher success rate. In vitro fertilization involves having a  woman's egg fertilized by a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. In some cases,  the fertilized eggs are frozen for later use.  </P></p>

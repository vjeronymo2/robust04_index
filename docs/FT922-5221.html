			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Being beastly to the bankers THE government has won no friends in the City over the Canary Wharf affair. It is accused of dithering over moving civil servants eastwards, short-sightedness over the Jubilee line, and in general of being beastly to the banks. Yet the government has surely done the right thing by its own free-market principles. It has bailed nobody out, it will get its new offices cheaper, and some future landowner will surely regard a large contribution to the tube line as a prudent investment in value enhancement. Above all, there is a good deal to be said for being beastly to the banks at a time like this, not only to save money, but as a form of education. The case is made in a new paper from the US National Bureau of Economic Research. Paul Asquith, Robert Gertner and David Scharfstein studied* 102 companies which issued junk bonds and then got into cash-flow trouble (mainly, it seems, not because they could not afford the payments they had undertaken, but because the burden distracted their managements, and made them less competitive). Some of them survived, but in no case because their banks helped. On the contrary, banks seem positively to have preferred bankruptcy, because there were unsecured lenders to absorb any losses. Now it is true that the US is not Britain. Bankruptcy is not so final: Chapter 11 allows an orderly debt work-out where this is possible and not just, as here, when the creditors are optimistic - or, more likely, trying to postpone the evil day. There is a far larger number of banks, so lenders are less likely to find that a ruthless approach to one defaulter pushes other and otherwise sound borrowers over the edge. All the same, it would be surprising if British banks were to prove much more accommodating if a similar study were made here. It is nearly always a bank, with collateral, that pulls the plug. That is why so many of us, and not just recent bankrupts, feel a certain schadenfreude when we see banks join their borrowers in trouble because, as at Canary Wharf, the collateral proves largely illusory. That may teach them. In the NBER study it was those companies which still had some assets they were free to sell which were likeliest to survive. In the UK, where companies have fewer alternatives to bank credit (and small companies none), the assets are all hocked; hence the business failures which follow any epidemic of banking folly. In the world of property development, this 'system' has its merits: nothing so quickly restores sane values as a wave of receivers' sales. But it would still be much better to prevent values being bid up to insane levels in the first place; and in the world of operating companies which produce goods and services, the process is disruptive and wasteful. Can bankers be made wise? Probably not, but at least they can be kept cautious. The most effective way would be my own (largely friendless) proposal to outlaw collateral, by enacting that banks would rank with all other creditors in a bankruptcy (a one-clause Bill would do it). This would force banks into relationship banking, rather than simply paying lip service to it in hard times. Attention to cash-flow and management competence prevents nasty surprises - a sound practice which enabled some small banks to survive the holocausts in New England and Texas. Failing a change in the rules, the best the government can do is prolong the agony, and so ensure that it is more than 17 years before folly breaks out again. It could also give a useful signal when it appoints a new governor to the Bank of England this year. It should appoint none of those who were in authority during the Big Bang and the subsequent follies. However sage their private warnings may have been at the time, they are publicly identified with what happened on their watch. Much better a new banker like Lord Alexander, whose whole experience is of clearing up the mess; or, perhaps, a veteran like Sir David Scholey, who passed the 'If' test, and kept his head. *Anatomy of financial distress.

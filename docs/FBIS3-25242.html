			<p>Language: <F P=105> Zulu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>   [Text] The saga concerning the future of kwaZulu thickens  day by day. Last Sunday, the king met with President F.W. de  Klerk where it is reported the monarch said he wanted the  boundaries of Zulu territory restored to what they were before  the Zulus were conquered, so that the Zulu nation can determine  its own future. This coming Monday the monarch will again meet  with the state president. This shows things are getting hot.    We were not aware that things would come to this in this  country, because we had hoped that negotiations would take the  path of genuine compromise leading to the satisfaction of all  concerned. We did not foresee that things would come to a stage  where the Zulu nation would demand what rightfully belonged to  it. We did not know that things would deteriorate to a stage  where the very unity of South Africa would be put in jeopardy as  we presently see it.    The situation, however, has been spoiling for a long time.  When a proposal that a separate delegation from the king be  part of Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] was  rejected, that was the start of the problem. When a proposal  that a delegation of the kwaZulu government be part of Codesa  was also rejected, that too further soured the situation. When  the ANC [African National Congress] and its allies, COSATU  [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the SACP [South  African Communist Party], resolved to begin a campaign to  destroy kwaZulu, that further aggravated the situation.    When, at the Kempton Park talks, government and ANC  negotiators conspired to make side deals, that also soured  things. When kwaZulu government proposals for a new  dispensation that allowed for regional autonomy was rejected,  that was part of the disintegration. When admonitions by other  leaders of the same mind as the prime minister of kwaZulu --  that the way the negotiations were being conducted was wrong --  were cast aside as of no consequence, that was again part of the  disintegration. When the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] protests  that too much power was being vested in the central government  was ignored, that was part of the deterioration of the situation.    Now it appears that this country is facing a very uncertain  future. The situation is truly precarious!</p>

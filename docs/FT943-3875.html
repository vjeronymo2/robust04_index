			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Big Mac serves up measure of global earnings McDonald's Big Mac hamburger has been chosen by Union Bank of Switzerland as an international measure of purchasing power. The UBS researchers, compiling a survey of international prices and wages called Prices and Earnings around the Globe, say the best way to illustrate what wages will buy is to relate them to prices of individual products. The best measures, they find, are a 1kg loaf of bread and a Big Mac. According to UBS, the worst place to be if you are penniless and in need of a hamburger is Lagos, the Nigerian capital. There it will take you more than 11 hours of toil, almost two full working days, to earn enough to buy a Big Mac. That compares with 14 minutes in Chicago. International price comparisons and cost-of-living indicators are becoming increasingly valuable to executives negotiating pay packages for overseas postings. The UBS survey uses a uniform basket of goods so that clear comparisons can be made. The survey shows that while the top earnings are in Switzerland, the most expensive flats are in Hong Kong and the dearest clothes in Tokyo. North America also has the least expensive motoring, while those using public transport in Europe can expect to pay through the nose. Among the smaller items, a shampoo and set at a women's hairdresser costs between Dollars 40 and Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) in Oslo. The best places for a cheap hairdo - less than Dollars 7 - are Taipei, Caracas, Budapest, Nairobi, Prague and Bombay. The biggest gross earners are the Swiss, the Danes and the Japanese, followed by the Germans, Luxembourg and the US. London is midway in the earnings league behind Milan and Paris, with Nairobi, Lagos and Bombay at the foot of the table. Luxembourg incomes, however, enjoy the most purchasing power, followed by those in Toronto, Montreal and Dusseldorf. People in the Far East tend to work the longest hours, while the fewest hours are worked by those in Madrid. Of the 53 cities in the comparison, Tokyo is the most expensive, with Lagos, surprisingly, in second place, followed by Oslo and Zurich. If you are thinking about a romantic weekend away, the cost of spending a night for two in a double room with a bathroom in a first-class hotel ranges from Dollars 112 in Nairobi to Dollars 382 in Tokyo.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt and Hannes Gamillscheg: </F> "Sweden Buys German Tanks -- Bonn Promises Compensation"]    [Text] Bonn/Stockholm, 7 Jun -- The FRG and Sweden have  agreed on a joint arms deal worth about 1.5 billion German  marks. As the FRG Defense Ministry confirmed in Bonn on Tuesday  [7 June], in return for the 120 new and 160 old Leopard II  tanks, 809 MTLB armored personnel carriers, and 350 Russian BMP  armored vehicles from the stocks of the National People'e Army  (NVA) that the Swedish Government wants to buy; the FRG commits  itself to concluding a compensation deal of equal size over the  next 10 years.    In order to get the billion-mark order for 160 or perhaps  even 200 new tanks from Sweden for the German armament industry,  FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union)  has made concessions.    In April last year it still looked as if the FRG were to be  defeated by the competition of Britain and the United States for  the armament deal, because Ruehe hesitated to agree to Sweden's  demand for a corresponding compensation deal. At that time the  Swedes were irritated that the German side required "rather a  lot of time" for the negotiations.    The skeleton agreements, signed by Ruehe and his Swedish  counterpart Anders Bjorck in Stockholm on Monday, now provide  for 100-percent compensation as demanded by Sweden, in addition  to the almost free old NVA materiel, but they do not set down  specific projects for this purpose. Details are to be  determined in agreements that are to be extended from one year  to the next. The point will not be the purchase of Swedish  "large-scale systems" for the Bundeswehr but equipment  components, e.g. for the Navy or the Air Force, a spokesman of  the ministry in Bonn said. Thus, one might conceive of the  purchase of engines, drive aggregates, or guided missiles.    For Bonn there is very little prospect of a compensation  deal  involving the Swedish JAS-Gripen fighter plane, which is favored  by Sweden, since the FRG is involved in the development of the  "Eurofighter 2000" aircraft, and next year the decision on the  procurement of this "Eurofighter" must be made. Future  cooperation in the development of a new generation of combat  aircraft and submarines is being considered, however, it was  said in Stockholm.    It was also learned from the Swedish Defense Ministry that  75  percent of the compensation deal will involve the sale of  Swedish armament goods and 25 percent the sale of civilian  high-tech products.    In addition, both sides agreed that only 30 of the new tanks  for the Swedish Army will be built by Krauss-Maffei in the FRG;  all others are to be produced in Sweden with a license.    Instead of being scrapped, the 350 Russian armored vehicles  from NVA stocks are to be offered to Sweden to replace its  vehicles which have been used up in the UN mission in Bosnia.    Bjorck justified the purchase by citing better protection  for  troop transports -- in Sweden the armored vehicles are to  replace tarpaulin-covered trucks -- as well as the favorable  price. The Swedish Army has bought the NVA vehicles at the  "unit price of a used Volvo," Bjorck said.</p>

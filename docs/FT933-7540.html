			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cosmo in partial suspension JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday disciplined Cosmo Securities, a second tier broker which faces extraordinary losses of Y69.8bn (Dollars 682m), by ordering a suspension of corporate business operations. The company announced last week it had a negative net worth of Y7.1bn due to losses stemming from tobashi deals, where clients' accounts are shuffled to hide unrealised losses. Daiwa Bank will rescue Cosmo by a share purchase, becoming the country's first bank to hold a stockbroking subsidiary. The ministry ordered that Cosmo suspend operations of certain corporate businesses from next Monday to September 3. Cosmo announced a pay cut for its executives for three months from September. Mr Hiroshi Nakano, Cosmo's president, takes a 30 per cent cut. Other board members face cuts of between 15 and 20 per cent. The ministry of finance is investigating the country's 48 brokers for other concealed cases of irregular dealings. Officials claim that Cosmo was unrepresentative, but analysts believe more cases may be uncovered. The scale of the problems confronting the Japanese brokerage industry was highlighted yesterday as Yamaichi Securities said it was considering a rescue of Yamaichi Finance, an ailing non-bank finance affiliate. Yamaichi's bailout will follow Nomura Securities, which last month announced a restructuring of its property lending affiliate, and Daiwa Securities, whose finance affiliates hold mounting bad loans. Most Japanese brokerages set up non-bank financial affiliates during the late 1980s, extending loans on stock and land collateral. Many loans have turned bad as a result of plunging land and stock prices. That has also eroded the collateral at the finance companies. Some Y180bn of Yamaichi Finance's Y370bn loan portfolio is seen as non-performing, and the company's unrealised losses of its collateral totals about Y80bn.</p>

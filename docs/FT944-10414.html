			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Untransparent' LME attacked The antipathy some metal producers and consumers feel about the London Metal Exchange was voiced yesterday by Mr Yves Rambaud, chairman of Eramet of France, the world's fourth-largest nickel producer. Questioned about the recent sharp rise in the nickel price at a time when exchange stocks were also increasing, he said the LME was a 'very untransparent market.' It was not possible, for example, to know who owned the stocks in LME warehouses. He said consumers were 'frightened' of the LME and more and more of them were looking for long-term supply contracts from producers. About 80 per cent of Eramet's nickel went to stainless steel producers, Mr Rambaud told the Association of Mining Analysts in London. These customers wanted two things in particular: continuity of supply and prices not to move outside a certain range which eliminated the peaks and the troughs in LME prices. About half of Eramet's sales were made on long-term contracts with these terms. 'Both we and the consumers agree this is a good system,' he said. Mr Rambaud suggested that demand in the western world for nickel this year would grow at between 7 and 9 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in 1993 and well above the annual average of 2.1 per cent seen in the past 20 years. This would leave the market in balance because there was no room for western producers to increase output and no possibility that Russian exports would grow. Eramet previously forecast a supply surplus of 15,000 tonnes this year compared with surpluses of 49,000 and 75,000 tonnes in 1993 and 1992. He pointed out that Russia's production could not increase unless big investments were made in its industry and then it would take three or four years for this investment to have an impact. Meanwhile, nickel consumption in Russia was at such a low level it could not fall much further. Western producers needed an average price of Dollars 3 to Dollars 3.20 a pound to break even but a price of Dollars 3.50 to Dollars 4 was required to make it worth investing to expand existing capacity. Prices of more than Dollars 5 were needed for new capacity. The LME three-month price closed last night just below last week's 2 1/4 -year high at Dollars 7,427.50 a tonne. Eramet previously announced it would lift annual capacity at its 82-per-cent-owned SLN (Societe Metallurgique Le Nickel) in New Caledonia from 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes. Mr Rambaud this would be done step by step, 'in line with market growth'.</p>

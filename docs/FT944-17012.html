			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Threat of Tube strikes recedes The threat of further industrial action on the London Underground subsided last night when the executive of the RMT transport union decided to contact Acas, the conciliation service, and pursue its pay claim through arbitration. London Underground said it was considering its response to the RMT proposal. The Underground appeared relieved that the union had not chosen new dates for industrial action to follow last Friday's strike which partially disrupted the Tube network. The union has suggested that the Underground uses its own wages board, which has both union and management representation and can arbitrate on a binding or non-binding basis. The RMT is claiming a 4 per cent increase and has rejected a 2.5 per cent rise accepted by five other unions representing Underground employees.</p>

He said: "The hopes the population had on the administration  of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada were so high when he was  inaugurated last August that it was impossible to satisfy them  all. Even if we brought in a magician to run the country, it  would have been impossible to satisfy the demands immediately."    A recent poll by the Bolivian Catholic University, UCB,  shows  the people's confidence in the government is decreasing as the  government administration goes on. This situation also affects  President Sanchez de Lozada, but to a lesser degree.    Antelo said the first stage in any government is to bring  order and make preparations. He added: "The harvest comes  later. The people want immediate results; however, they also  want immediate well-being, and that is impossible to do."    He added that government actions will be recognized when the  people are able to see the results of the great measures for  change being implemented and under debate in Congress.    Antelo said: "We understand the people's reaction. It is  valid from their perspective. We believe we are doing out best  to prepare the grounds for changing that perspective, not only  in appearance but through the implementation of measures."    According to the UCB poll, 62 percent of those polled have a  bad impression of the government.    Last October the bad impression was only 44.5 percent, which  means that the discontent increased by 17.5 percent.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways A strategic link with a US airline is probably BA's number one priority so as to realise the full profit potential of its North Atlantic routes. Nevertheless, investors should not hold their breath over reports that Lord King plans to take a minority stake in a business formed from the merger of US Air and the assets of TWA. Stranger things have happened, of course, but given the enormous financial pressures on the airlines industry it seems everyone is talking to everyone. US Air's network of mainly East Coast services would certainly be a useful feeder for BA - but then Lufthansa is also said to have its eye on the same prize. BA, meanwhile, has also been talking to Continental, and is no doubt still keeping its options open with North West and KLM. Besides the plethora of possibilities, the sheer complexity of a BA/US Air/TWA tie-up makes it a longish shot. Given the British airline's indications that it will not enter a deal which dilutes shareholders' interests - a principle which it stuck to in negotiations with KLM - it would be hard to justify investing substantial sums in two carriers which between them lost more than Dollars 600m last year and carry combined debt of Dollars 3.7bn.</p>

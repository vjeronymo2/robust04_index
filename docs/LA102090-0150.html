			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BART VS. BILL: 'COSBY' TAKES ROUND 2  </P> <P> In round two of TV's heavyweight clash between "The Simpsons" and the  Huxtables, "The Cosby Show" opened a lead Thursday night after finishing in a  virtual dead heat with Fox's cantankerous cartoon clan the week before.  </P> <P> NBC's "Cosby" was seen in about 17.2 million homes, compared to about 15.1  million for "The Simpsons."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Fox executives said that they were thrilled with the showing  because, among the teen and young-adult viewers that Fox and its advertisers  prize most, "The Simpsons" has been beating "Cosby" handily. "Cosby's" rating  is bolstered by heavy viewership among people over 50.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, "The Simpsons" continues to be the No. 1 choice, as 39% of all  television sets in use between 8 and 8:30 Thursday night were tuned to  Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11. "Cosby" was the choice of 26% of the area's viewers.  STEVE WEINSTEIN  </P></p>

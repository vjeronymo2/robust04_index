			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: BP attacks Government on ACT reduction scheme BRITISH PETROLEUM hit back yesterday at the Government's decision to squash its plans to issues shares in its Britoil subsidiary in an attempt to reduce its Advance Corporation Tax bill. Last month, BP announced that it was working on a complex plan to issue so-called stapled shares as a way of saving about Pounds 150m this year in ACT payments. However on Thursday night the Government announced that it would be introducing legislation into this year's Finance Bill to stop such schemes. 'We think our scheme was fair and legal and that we were very open with the Government and Treasury over what we wanted to do,' BP said yesterday. 'The law allowed us to do this and in the interests of shareholders we hoped to recover Pounds 150m. The Government's legislation is specifically designed to block our scheme.' BP said that despite this setback it would continue lobbying the Government concerning the issue of Advanced Corporation Tax. BP is one of a number of large companies which are unable to recover all the ACT they pay on dividends because the bulk of their profits is earned overseas. ACT can be set off against UK corporation tax but companies such as BP do not earn enough profits in the UK to use up the backlog of prepaid ACT. The total amount of unutilised ACT in the UK is thought to be as much as Pounds 750m.</p>

Wu made the remarks when asked to comment on a report in the  Japanese media that China exported moldy rice to Japan.    He said that the Chinese State Administration for the  Inspection of Import and Export Commodities had re-examined the  samples of the rice exported to Japan before shipment and  established that there was nothing wrong.    The spokesman noted that officials from the Japanese  Ministry  of Agriculture and Fisheries also admitted that the  responsibility of the rice going moldy was not on the Chinese  side and that the Japanese press reports had over-exaggerated  the incident.</p>

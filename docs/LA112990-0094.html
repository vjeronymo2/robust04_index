			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO PICK MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> Anyone contemplating going on a mushroom hunt would do well to join a mushroom  hunters group or go with a knowledgeable person, advises Betty Ivanovitch of  Golden Gourmet.  </P> <P> Each mushroom has its own characteristics, which make it difficult for novices  to distinguish an edible mushroom from a poisonous one.  </P> <P> Steve Farrar, plant manager at Golden Gourmet, offers some advice for judging  mushrooms for freshness.  </P> <P> Oyster: Make sure the gills underneath look fresh and crisp. Don't worry if the  mushroom caps have a few cracks. They may change color from white to yellow as  they age, but these mushrooms keep well for up to 10 days when stored in their  original container or in a paper bag in the refrigerator. Discard any mushrooms  that have a slimy feel.  </P> <P> Enoki: Color should be white to off-white and texture should be firm. Enokis  get spongier as they age. They are usually sold in shrink-wrap packages which  extend their shelf life to 21 days. Once open, enokis should be consumed within  a day or two. A slight fermented smell is acceptable when the package is  opened, but if the mushrooms smell like strong wine they have started to  decompose.  </P> <P> Shiitake: Stay fresh from 2 to 3 weeks. They turn yellowish as they age, and  white gills are the best indicators of freshness. Discard any mushrooms with  sunken or dark spots on the cap.  </P></p>

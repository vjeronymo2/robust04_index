			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Bayer to pay Dollars 1bn to reclaim its name: German group buys slice of over-the-counter drugs market in US from SmithKline Beecham Bayer is to pay Dollars 1bn (Pounds 649m) to buy back the right to use its own brandname in the North American market more than 75 years after the US government seized the German chemicals group's local assets during the first world war. The deal was announced yesterday, just two weeks after the Bayer name-and-cross emblem changed hands in the sale of Sterling Health, Eastman Kodak's over-the-counter drugs unit, to the Anglo-American group SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 2.93bn. The sale includes OTC products such as Bayer aspirin, Midol analgesics and the Milk of Magnesia indigestion treatment. These will fill out Bayer's existing US range built around Alka-Seltzer and One-A-Day and Flintstones vitamins. Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer's chairman, said the group's US and Canadian activities would switch to the Bayer name as soon as possible. The purchase met two of his prime objectives: regaining the brand rights and extending Bayer's reach in the world's largest OTC medicine market. 'This is a memorable day in our corporate history,' he added. The sale brings SmithKline Beecham down from the world's biggest OTC drugs company, a position held for the past two weeks, to number three. The sale proceeds will help cut SmithKline Beecham's debt to less than Pounds 2.5bn. The company recently reported plans to cut debt through disposal of 'non-strategic acquisitions'. 'This is a non-strategic asset in that we already had the critical mass in the US,' it said. Additions from Sterling, which last year earned Eastman Kodak Dollars 43m on sales of Dollars 366m, will almost double Bayer's over-the-counter turnover in the US. The branded aspirin business alone is estimated to generate Dollars 150m sales a year in the US, and was recently valued by analysts at about Dollars 500m. In the late 1890s, Bayer produced the first high quality acetylsalicylic acid and registered aspirin as a trademark in Germany and the US. Bayer had focused its US interests in its Miles unit, which last year had sales of Dollars 6.5bn. Bayer originally made an offer for the whole of Sterling, but was outbid by SmithKline in an auction. After the sale, Bayer said it would seek 'clarification' from Sterling's new owners of its intentions towards the trademark rights and parts of the operating business. Bayer extended its reach in the US market earlier this year when it paid Dollars 310m for a minority stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned generic drug specialist. Generics are one of the fastest growing segments in pharmaceutical markets.

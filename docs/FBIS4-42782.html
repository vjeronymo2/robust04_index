			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The government and the management of SEAT said  today that the Spanish car make will not disappear. According  to Juan Manuel Eguiagaray Ucelay, the minister of industry and  energy, the Spanish Government is willing to help SEAT, but  without disregarding the European Union [EU] rules set down for  competition and as long as the work force reduction of 4,500  jobs wanted by Volkswagen is carried out in a nontraumatic way.    [Begin Eguigaray recording] The Spanish Government will of  course have to contribute what it can; I underline, it will be  done according to the rules.    The cut in the work force will cost all Spaniards -- through  the state's budget -- some 30 billion pesetas, and if we have to  add subsidies for technological equipment -- and we are quite  willing to do so -- it will cost us more money. [end recording]    The government's subsidies are to be conditional on  Volkswagen -- the parent company to which SEAT belongs --  fulfilling its promises regarding research, development, and the  survival of the make and its distribution and repairs network.

Another important task in  deepening the reform of China's financial system reform is to  separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking and turn  state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks.  This is an important part of comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction  that "efforts must be made to manage banks as genuine banks" and  the key to deepening the financial system reform.    The financial organizational system preliminarily set up  during the 14 year period of reform and opening up doubtlessly  represents a remarkable progress as compared with the banks in  the past which only hired "tellers" and "accountants." This  system is under the leadership of the People's Bank of China and  mainly composed of state-owned specialized banks with various  other economic sectors working side by side and coordinating  with one another through a division of work. However, for many  years, China's state-owned specialized banks have, on the one  hand, performed the functions as commercial banks, while on the  other hand, they have not developed the mechanism of modern  commercial banks in managing theirs own affairs, assuming their  own risks, restraining themselves and assuming the  responsibility for their own profits and losses. This has  prevented the entire banking system in China from meeting the  requirements in developing a socialist market economy. The  functions and scope of operation of the four specialized banks  which are regarded as the major forces of the financial circle  have not been clearly defined. Due to the fact that the  functions of the government are not separated from those of  enterprises, the bank's business operation has been interfered  by the local authorities. As a result, the credit operations of  the national bank are provincialized and funds divided into  pieces. There is no guarantee for the supply of funds in  developing the major construction projects of the state.  Moreover, the profit-oriented specialized banks have plans to  expand their credits, but they lack the mechanism to avoid  risks. Thus, there are increasing number of bad debts and  overdue bills, and their credit rating is notably lowered. Bad  debts in some specialized banks make up as much as 30 percent of  their total assets. The shortcomings and problems which have  cropped up show that it is of great urgency to manage  state-owned specialized banks as commercial banks and establish  a good system of modern commercial banks in order to meet the  requirements in the development of socialist market economy.  This is because that with the vigorous development of the reform  and opening up program, tremendous changes have taken up in the  environment under which the banks operate. The banks' funds have  gradually become market-oriented, and the banks have been asked  to use their funds as a commodity in running their businesses.  Industrial and commercial enterprises have become legal persons  of self-management. Banks have been asked to run as enterprises  instead of administrative organs and cooperate with each other  on an equal basis. After the barriers between different  departments and regions are removed, credit funds are  continuously increasing on the market. Banks at home and abroad  are expanding their cooperation. All this demands that banks in  China link with international commercial banks in business  operations and change their system of only supplying credit  funds to a system of business operation.    Efforts must be made to transform the specialized banks into  genuine state-owned commercial banks, which mainly handle  deposits from and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises  and regard profits as their main target in doing business.  Organizationally they will be national commercial banks, each  with a head office and many branches. In dealing with outsiders,  they are independent legal persons under centralized business  management. After the modern commercial banks start to operate,  it is necessary to follow the principle of managing their own  affairs, assuming their own risks, bearing the responsibility  for their own profits and losses and restraining themselves. It  is essential to view the commercial banks in the country as a  whole, centralize their management and unify the procedure of  fund management. In business operation, modern commercial banks  must uphold the principle of combining profitability, fluidity  and safety. Since they mainly use money deposited in the banks  in extending loans, their risks are higher than ordinary  industrial and commercial enterprises. Meanwhile, they are not  obliged to do policy-oriented financing and "subsidize" those  enterprises which are suffering losses, they can justly pay full  attention to profits from now on. Modern commercial banks should  also independently make their own decisions on investments,  break away from the administrative interferences from the  governments at all levels, and strive to reap maximum profits  with minimum risks. Efforts must be made to strengthen  supervision and control over the risks taken by state-owned  commercial banks. As the owner of state-owned commercial banks,  the state must supervise, through the board of supervisors,  their management and how they preserve and increase the value of  state assets. Nevertheless, the state should not interfere with  the banks' routine business activities.    The most basic characteristics of state-owned commercial  banks is their need to manage their own affairs, bear the  responsibility for their own profits and losses, assume their  own risks and restrain themselves. They must implement the  various guidelines and policies of the party and the state.  Under no circumstances should they regard making investments in  stocks and shares, and buying securities and real estate at  lower prices and selling them out at higher prices a part of  their regular operation. According to international practice,  various countries have set limits on the scope of business  operation for the commercial banks. Even many countries with  fairly developed market economy explicitly forbid commercial  banks to make investments in industries and illegally buying and  selling securities. Therefore state-owned commercial banks  should be forbidden to make direct investments in nonbanking  enterprises.    After the reform of the financial system, China's system of  commercial banks should include state-owned commercial banks,  the Bank of Communications and other national and regional  commercial banks and rural and urban cooperative banks.    Specialized banks must go through a process to become  state-owned commercial banks. It depends on the external  environment, particularly the gradual establishment of the  system of modern enterprises. It also depends on the internal  management mechanism such as the principle of operation and the  system and methods for internal management. All these must be  standardized and improved in accordance with the general  principle governing the commercial banks and the Banking Law.  Efforts must be made in a down-to-earth manner to study and  explore how to carry out reform in this respect.    After reforming themselves, state-owned commercial banks  will  become the mainstay of the new financial organizational system.  They will be able to do a better job in providing financial  services of all types, to keep pace with the developing  socialist market economy and to help promote the national  economy continuously, swiftly and healthily.</p>

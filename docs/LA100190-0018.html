			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> NUREYEV PERFORMS 'OVERCOAT' IN SAN JOSE  </P> <P> Ballet is the celebration of the human body at its most vital. Its language is  couched in terms of strength and limberness, which, like it or not, are the  virtues of youth. Rudolf Nureyev, who as a young man was ballet's most daring  and extravagant star, challenged this truth Friday night with the U.S. premiere  of Flemming Flindt's "The Overcoat."  </P> <P> Dominating the opening of San Jose Cleveland Ballet's California season -- the  two-city company will dance "Coppelia" here next weekend -- Flindt's 1989  ballet was designed to match the 52-year-old Nureyev's current abilities, but,  despite the choreographer's good intentions, he failed to contrive a style  flattering to his star.  </P> <P> Instead of utilizing Nureyev's limitations to create a down-and-out character,  Flindt either laughed at his hero or pretended he was a prince in disguise.  </P> <P> Loosely based on Nicolai Gogol's bitter short story of the same name, "The  Overcoat" tells of Akaky, a humble copyist in imperial Russia whose overcoat is  so threadbare that his tailor refuses to mend it. The impoverished bureaucrat  skimps and saves until the new coat becomes a symbolic reward for a lifetime of  emptiness and self-denial.  </P> <P> Sumptuously designed by Beni Montresor, the ballet moved easily from the vast  library in which Akaky works to his bare hovel of a room to the luxurious  ballroom in which he unveils his new possession. For music, Flindt followed  John Cranko's lead and knitted together several of Dmitri Shostakovich's more  accessible excerpts, drawn mainly from the composer's movie scores.  </P> <P> The role of Akaky ought to have given Flindt and Nureyev varied opportunities  for character development and pathos, but instead Flindt insisted on viewing  the clerk's predicament from the outside.  </P> <P> Dressed Charlie Chaplin-style, in tight jacket and baggy pants, Nureyev played  the copyist mainly for laughs. Perhaps to cover for Nureyev's now-stiff and  unyielding body, Flindt filled his ballet with extraneous props. Besides the  overcoat, there was a long scarf in which Akaky is wrapped for no reason at  all, a recurring umbrella worthy of an English gentleman, and a tea set that  the dancer spends most of his central solo assembling onstage.  </P> <P> When he is not laughing at Akaky, Flindt could think of nothing more than  recapitulating heroic steps from Petipa's time. Most probably he was here  following Nureyev's specifications.  </P> <P> But Nureyev's turns are now wildly unsteady, his leaps barely get him into the  air, and his leg gets maybe a foot off the floor in arabesque. The grand circle  of leaps that once climaxed so many of his variations was here little more than  a carefully calculated walk.  </P> <P> Of course, every once in a while, the master shone through in the perfect  alignment of his arms and legs in relation to his torso, but even these chance  revelations barely outlasted the first 10 minutes of the ballet's increasingly  labored 1 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Except for the effortless elan of Karen Gabay and Raymond Rodriguez as the  French couple and a zestful Marcia Haydee imitation by Pamela Reyman, the San  Jose Cleveland dancers served mainly as a backdrop to Nureyev's embarrassment.  </P></p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Marketing gilts Should the Bank of England make the gilt market more investor-friendly? That is the central question the Treasury will have to answer in its review, launched last week, of the government debt arrangements. Traditionally, the Bank has run the market more to suit its needs than those of investors. Perhaps that matters little when it was a near-monopoly supplier of bonds to UK investors. But as it increasingly competes for funds on global markets, so the Bank needs to pay more attention to meeting investor demands. Investors have a long list of changes they would like to see. The priority is probably the inauguration of an 'open repo' market under which they would be able to borrow and lend gilts freely. Such a system would increase liquidity in the market and enable investors to go short. With the Bank already investigating the idea, repos could be given the go-ahead before the Treasury review is finished. Other items on investors' wish lists include: streamlining the range of gilts available so there were fewer stocks with greater liquidity; announcing in advance which stocks the Bank was to issue so investors would have time to think what they wished to buy; and paying interest gross, so removing the disadvantage gilts suffer by comparison with many rival bonds. The Bank may think it is beneath its dignity to woo investors in this way. But taxpayers cannot be happy that gilts yield more than many other governments' bonds despite the fact that UK inflation prospects are now relatively good. It would be false to attribute all this spread to technicalities about how the market operates. But if a more investor-friendly approach could shave even a little off the cost of funding government debt, it would be well worth it.</p>

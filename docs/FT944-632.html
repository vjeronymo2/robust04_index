			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Rolls-Royce/BMW - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Both Rolls-Royce, the Vickers luxury car subsidiary, and BMW have reason to congratulate themselves on their supply agreement. BMW has outsmarted its rival, Mercedes-Benz, to forge a link which will considerably strengthen its position at the very top end of the automotive market. So soon after the Rover acquisition, it has again demonstrated its nimbleness in seizing the strategic initiative. For Rolls-Royce, the alliance will secure its future as an independent company beyond the present generation of cars. Vickers has been good at cutting Rolls-Royce's costs and improving its efficiency, but does not have the financial clout to develop a luxury car for the next century out of its own resources. Under the agreement, Rolls-Royce will get engines and other components more cheaply than if it developed or made them itself, while BMW will be able to spread the costs of producing such large engines over higher volumes. The deal has been done without Vickers having to cede a ha'porth of Rolls-Royce's equity, but the question of control may in time prove an irrelevance. In 10 years or so, the German company is likely to have made itself indispensable to Rolls-Royce, so that BMW would be the obvious buyer should Vickers choose to sell. In the meantime, shareholders in both companies should benefit.</p>

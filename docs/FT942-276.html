			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: GE bids for rest of Nuovo Pignone General Electric of the US has launched a formal bid for the outstanding shares in Nuovo Pignone, the Italian gas turbines and compressors group, in a move which would end its Milan stock market listing. GE acquired control of the Italian company earlier this year when it bought a 69.33 per cent stake from Eni, the Italian state holding company. The bid for the outstanding quoted shares is obligatory, and has been launched at the same price as the original offer. In theory, buying the 30 per cent stake could cost GE more than L300bn (Dollars 192m). In practice, however, GE will only be able to buy a further 10 per cent of the group with this offer, because Eni will retain a 20.25 per cent stake. The US company is still planning to give up 12 per cent of the company to Dresser Industries of the US and a further 12 per cent to Ingersoll-Rand, once regulatory approval has been obtained. Dresser and Ingersoll-Rand are US turbine and oil industry specialists. GE said it was still in negotiations with a group of Italian banks, which originally intended to buy up to 20 per cent of Nuovo Pignone as part of the GE-led consortium. However, Italian banking sources said they believed the banks were no longer intending to take part in the consortium.</p>

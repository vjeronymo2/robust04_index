			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Newton Kanhema and Janine Lazarus] </F>   [Text] Snipers "planted in strategic points to shoot at the  Zulu crowds" triggered Monday's [28 March] bloodshed in central  Johannesburg, police said this week. "Our information indicates  that the first shots were fired at the Zulus. There is no  evidence that the marchers started shooting," said Witwatersrand  police liaison officer Colonel David Bruce.    Initial investigations showed that there were people placed  in buildings who were assigned to shoot at the crowd, he said.  "It appears that certain elements were planted to cause  trouble. They didn't care who they hit. They fired  indiscriminately."    More information which pointed to planned acts of terrorism  was passed on to WEEKEND STAR this week.    Defence analyst Helmoed Romer-Heitman said witnesses had  seen  a number of men entering buildings around the Library Gardens  with bags that could have concealed weapons. "Several people  who work in the area and who get to their offices early in the  morning apparently saw men they had not seen before going into  buildings along the route and around the Library Gardens,  carrying bags," he said.    The second piece of information concerned at least 10 bullet  holes blasted through thick steel girders in the Library  Gardens. They seemed to indicate that weaponry of a much heavier  calibre than would normally be available to ordinary citizens  was used.    Most of the shots, which left holes a centimetre in  diameter,  went right through the 14 mm-thick steel structures supporting a  mezzanine floor above shops overlooking Library Gardens.    Forensics expert Dr David Klatzow, "who was commissioned by  WEEKEND STAR to examine the holes, concluded that the bullets  were almost exclusively full metal jacket. This means they  would have been fully encased in metal, enabling them to pierce  most armour plating. According to Klatzow, they could have been  fired from either R-1 or AK-47 rifles. Klatzow said the shots  were probably fired from the direction of the public toilets  overlooking Library Gardens.    Commenting on the SAP's [South African Police] use of R-1s,  Bruce said it was useless to equip policemen with handguns in an  attack like that on Monday. "You've got people shooting up  there and you've got a .32 -- what use is that?"    Asked what the police had done to prepare for the Zulu  march,  he said they had been prepared for a meeting, not a march. "We  have no doubt that the investigation will reveal that the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC will have to shoulder some  blame for Monday's crisis," said Bruce.    "What we find most pertubing is that there are people who  have said they saw what happened, but they don't want to come to  the police.    "We must have eyewitness accounts so that we can ensure this  doesn't happen again -- and we can't do it alone."</p>

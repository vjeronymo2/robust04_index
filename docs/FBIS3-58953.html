			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Gavin Cordon, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today confirmed  that Britain may pull its troops out of Bosnia in the summer.  He said the withdrawal of the 2,500-strong British contingent  serving with the UN Protection Force was being seriously  considered by the Government. However, speaking on LWT's  [expansion unknown] Walden programme, he stressed that no  decision had yet been reached.    His comments would appear to go further than those of  Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd who, on a visit last week to the British  UN force, said simply that no decision on withdrawal was  "imminent."    Mr. Rifkind said British troops had helped saved tens of  thousands of lives and any withdrawal move would be taken only  in conjuction with Britain's UN partners. "It is certainly an  option that countries -- not just the United Kingdom -- are  having to look at very seriously," he said. "There are very  powerful arguments both for staying in Bosnia and there are some  powerful arguments for withdrawing."    He denied that his comments were intended to prepare the  ground for a decision to pull out that had already been taken.  "We are certainly indicating the possibility that that may be  the sensible thing to do, but that reflects the reality of what  has happened over the last year or so," he said.    "We have not even taken any view in principle as to the  desirability of withdrawal. What we have said is that the  circumstances are deteriorating -- the situation has got more  difficult. On several occasions we thought there was a  possibility of peace between the various warring factions that  would enable the situation to begin to materially improve but  that is not happening.    "It is therefore inevitable that the countries do begin to  address the question as to where the balance of our moral duty  -- as well as our political common sense -- lies."    He said the UN operation had been successful in terms of  distributing aid to thousands of people who would otherwise have  starved to death. "At a humanitarian level, the UN has been  more successful in Bosnia than in probably any other civil war  in recent years around the world," he said. "It is for that  reason one can't simply rush to the judgment that withdrawal  must be the option to pursue."    However, there was an argument that the UN's presence was  prolonging the conflict by enabling protagonists, who would  otherwise be forced to seek peace, to carry on fighting.    "If we came to the sad but undeniable judgment that the UN  presence was actually prolonging the war then obviously the  course of action we would have to follow would then become much  clearer," he said.    In reaching a decision, the Government would have to  consider  whether troops were still able to carry out their mandate to  distribute aid and whether the risk to British forces was still  "acceptable."    Mr. Rifkind defended Lord Owen's role as the European  Union's  mediator in Bosnia, following the European Parliament vote that  he should be replaced.    "I don't think anyone could fault the commitment, the  dedication and the integrity that Lord Owen has shown during the  period that he has been the mediator," he said.    "On one or two occasions it has looked as if he might almost  have been able to pull off a settlement but what has become  sadly obvious is that at this moment in time the will of the  three factions in the fighting is not in favour of reaching a  settlement."    Later, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said it would  be  "unthinkable" for Britain to pull out of Bosnia unilaterally and  cause the humanitarian operation to collapse.    But he told the BBC TV On The Record programme that it was  quite possible, once the spring offensive got under way that  "the only thing left to us will be to withdraw".    He said: "Mr Major might like to reflect that he is not  going to be left out of the opprobrium. Here is a Conservative  Prime Minister who devalued the pound, raised tax more than  Labour and whose total failure of policy has led to British  military withdrawal.    "I have always said that if we did not act, and act  strongly,  then at the end of the day we would have no action to take but  to withdraw. Any action we now take is more dangerous and more  risky than if we had taken it two years ago."</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa back into profit as cost-cutting takes effect LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, returned to the black in the second quarter of this year with a small pre-tax profit of DM24m (Dollars 13.9m) as its cost-cutting programme started to show results. It said that some DM1bn had been saved since the wide-ranging recovery programme began last August. This included staff cuts, curbs in pay rises, more flexible pay structures and working agreements, and a streamlining of its operations. But the company, which is 51 per cent state-owned, made a loss in the first half, although much reduced at DM221m. This compares with a pre-tax loss of DM542m in the same period of 1992. The airline said the real improvement in its first-half result was DM147m. The other DM174m represented the effect of changes in the method of depreciation introduced in the second half of last year. 'The gap between earnings and expenditure is slowly narrowing,' Lufthansa said. Total spending was 5.5 per cent lower in the first half, with labour costs down 8 per cent. Passenger numbers rose by 4.6 per cent in the first six months to 14m, with freight just 0.7 per cent higher at 564,000 tonnes. However, revenues from flight operations were 0.6 per cent down at DM6.9bn. Lufthansa said prices were still under pressure from 'excess worldwide capacity coupled with fierce and, at times, ruinous competition'. In the second quarter, the average price paid by passengers was about 8 per cent less per kilometre than a year earlier, with cargo yields 6 per cent lower. Lufthansa said the number of its flights fell by 3.6 per cent in the first half, while demand was 7.4 per cent higher, both expressed in tonne-kilometres. The revenue load factor was 4.3 percentage points higher at 67.4 per cent; the seat load factor was up by 4.2 percentage points at 64.3 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE PROJECTS, HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER WORK CUT FROM BUDGET  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's blue pencil knicked Orange County on Friday as he  vetoed more than $4 million earmarked for community college projects and the  restoration of the Huntington Beach Pier before signing the state's  $49.3-billion budget.  </P> <P> Despite the cuts, the governor left intact millions more set aside for major  renovation and construction at UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, as well as  acquisition of Chino Hills State Park.  </P> <P> In addition, Deukmejian also used his line-item powers to restore a formula  first written into law by state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) to help equalize  funding levels for Orange County and others that have been traditionally  under-funded in mental health programs.  </P> <P> Seymour, who holds a key position on the Legislature's budget conference  committee, said Friday that he has mixed feelings about what the new budget  holds for Orange County.  </P> <P> He said he was disappointed that Deukmejian had deleted $1.5 million set aside  for the restoration of the Huntington Beach Pier, a project that is estimated  to cost about $11 million overall.  </P> <P> He also lamented the fact that Deukmejian also cut large appropriations,  requested by the Legislature, that would have meant added brick and mortar for  local community colleges.  </P> <P> Gone is $2.4 million earmarked for new cafeterias at Saddleback and Irvine  Valley colleges. Also deleted was $266,000 worth of new maintenance buildings  or warehouses for Cypress, Orange Coast and Fullerton colleges.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also took about $100 million raised by Proposition 99 -- the  increase in the state's tobacco tax -- out of the budget for trauma care, an  undetermined portion of which would have gone for the operation of the trauma  unit at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> Orange County and four other counties were dropped from a proposed perinatal  substance-abuse pilot project planned for nine counties.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the governor left intact millions of dollars in new construction  projects at UCI and Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> Almost $27 million has been earmarked for the UCI campus for the renovation of  the physical sciences building, to pay for working drawings for a new science  library, to help expand the campus road system and to begin planning for a  center to house engineering programs and the central computing facility.  </P> <P> Another $22.4 million was set aside for a long-awaited 100,000-square-foot  addition to Cal State Fullerton's McCarthy Hall. The addition will allow  overcrowded labs to move out of the poorly ventilated building, the first  permanent structure opened on the Fullerton campus in 1963.  </P> <P> The new building, which will be connected by a second story foot-bridge to  McCarthy Hall, will dramatically improve science programs, according to Jim  Diefenderfer, dean of the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. "We've  worked to get funding for the science addition for six years. . . . This new  building will allow us to provide the very best undergraduate science education  in Orange County."  </P> <P> Also approved in the budget was $636,290 for conversion of unused classroom  buildings at Saddleback Community College into a satellite campus for Cal State  Fullerton. Saddleback Community College District Chancellor Richard Sneed  praised the satellite funding as "historic." Classes will begin in the  converted buildings Aug. 28.  </P> <P> "This is the culmination of three years of work to bring graduate and  upper-division programs to south Orange County," he said. "The beginnings will  be small, but the demand is great, and our next step will be to work toward  permanent facilities in conjunction with the university."  </P> <P> Orange County, which still faces a budget deficit of at least $24 million for  the current fiscal year, is hoping to receive about $20 million from the state  to erase the shortfall. But that grant is still unresolved in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Assistant County Administrative Officer John Sibley said Friday that he expects  to hear about the state grant next week. Without it, county officials have  warned that they might have to severely cut county services and lay off  employees.  </P> <P> Part of the governor's $489 million in budget cuts came when Deukmejian slashed  $50 million out of the $75 million that the Legislature wanted to distribute in  extra money for mental health funding this year. That left $25 million in  excess aid, the same amount the governor proposed in January.  </P> <P> With that cut, Orange County stands to gain between about $2 million extra this  year to bolster its overburdened programs to care for the mentally ill. But  that amount is about half of what the Legislature had in mind for the county.  </P> <P> But while he cut the number of dollars flowing to Orange County, he also took  steps to make sure that it and other under-funded areas in the state made some  long-term gains to catch up in mental health funding with such areas as Los  Angeles, Marin, San Francisco and Napa counties.  </P> <P> Deukmejian restored a formula, written into state law three years ago, that  directs that at least 50% of all increases in the mental health budget for  unrestricted programs be given to Orange and other under-funded counties.  </P> <P> Seymour said the mental health cuts were "bad news," but restoring the special  funding formula makes sure that "whatever Orange County receives, it is  receiving its fair share."  </P> <P> Linda Boyd, the county's administrator for mental health programs, said her  department has tentatively calculated its share of the extra money at about  $1.4 million, a number that is slightly below what is suggested by a  legislative analysis showing $2 million.  </P> <P> If the $1.4-million figure holds true, she said, the extra money wouldn't even  be enough to allow the mental health programs to keep up with increases in  labor and contract costs. "It doesn't even allow us to stay even," she said.  </P></p>

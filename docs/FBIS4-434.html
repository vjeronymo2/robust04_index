			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ministry of National Defense; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] After hearing the lies spread by Radio Muhabura, the  Ministry of National Defense informs Rwandans and the Rwandan  Armed Forces of the following:    1. All Rwandans, the entire Rwandan Armed Forces -- that is  the Army and the Gendarmerie -- are called upon not to believe  the lies broadcast by Radio Muhabura which are meant to divide  Rwandans and their Armed Forces.    2. Radio Muhabura is spreading lies saying that the Akazu  [Habyarimana, his relatives, and close friends] forces are  killing the Nduga [Hutus from the south] and other people whose  opinions differ from those of the Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic. The words are baseless and are only geared  towards dividing Rwandans into two. They are saying that some  are Kiga [Habyarimana's Hutu subclan] while others are Nduga so  that they do not unite and so that the enemy can take over the  country. The tricks of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have  been known to Rwandans for a long time.    3. Radio Muhabura is consistently lying that the soldiers  who guarded his excellency the president of the Republic started  the war and that other Army units stopped assisting them. This  lie is also not surprising since lying is one of the  characteristics of the RPF. Soldiers, gendarmes, and all  Rwandans have decided to fight their common enemy, who they have  all identified, together. The enemy is still the same. He is  the one who has always been trying to return the overthrown  monarch.    4. The Ministry of Defense calls on Rwandans, soldiers, and  gendarmes to do the following: Citizens are asked to act  together, to carry out patrols, and to fight the enemy.  Citizens are asked to support their Armed Forces by showing  them the location of the enemy. The Armed Forces are asked to  continue to carry out their duties by protecting our country and  its citizens. Rwandans and the Rwandan Armed Forces are called  upon not to listen to the lies of Radio Muhabura and other  radios which spread RPF news, as this is meant to divide  Rwandans and to cause fear. It is really sad to see how the  rebels are sending the youth to the war front, trying  unsuccessfully to fight a war they cannot win and believing that  they can capture the country. That is just a dream, as all  Rwandans are alert.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Property Market: The crash - it can happen again / A look behind recent boom-bust cycles When, in 1978, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors conducted a post-mortem on the early-1970s property boom and collapse, it concluded that even if a comparable property price rise were repeated, 'we do not believe that such a sudden collapse could occur again, unless triggered by some event as traumatic as the oil price explosion of 1974'. With the benefit of hindsight their optimism has proved unfounded: they attributed too great an importance to external events and too little to the inherent instability of the property market. What are the roots of this instability? Property development is rendered uncertain by the long lead times involved: when a developer embarks on a large scheme he has to anticipate demand three to five years ahead. Buildings by their nature are an illiquid form of investment. It is therefore inevitable that the property market tends to swing from shortage to surplus and back again, as supply overshoots and is then cut. These cyclical fluctuations are reinforced by the periodic speculative fevers which grip all markets subject to such volatility. For these reasons, property bubbles and crashes have occurred at every stage in the evolution of capitalist economies. The crash of the mid-1970s, however spectacular, was not unique; it was merely the first of the post-war period. Furthermore, it is dwarfed by the scale of the crash which is now under way. Take as an example the City of London office market, one of the most volatile markets of recent times. Between 1989 and 1991 some 15m square feet of new office space was added to the City stock, compared with 5m sq ft in the equivalent three-year period of buoyancy in the 1970s. As a result there is now about 12m sq ft of vacant space available in the City, compared with a peak of no more than 4m sq ft during the 1970s. According to the latest forecasts by Property Market Analysis, a research group, the combination of this severe over-supply and the recession will produce a fall of more than 50 per cent in City rents between 1989 and 1993-94, compared with a drop of just over one third in the last crash. Nevertheless, there are several parallels between the current cycle and that of the 1970s. First, in each case a strong increase in demand for property, leading to rapid increases in rents and prices, was generated by a politically-inspired, but unsustainable, burst of economic growth. In 1972-73 this surge in demand was fuelled by the 'Barber boom', while in 1987-88 it was the 'Lawson boom'; the result was a similar annual 3.5 per cent average rise in gross domestic product in the four-year upswing of each cycle. Second, the wave of development triggered by rising rents was turned into a speculative surge as a result of relaxed monetary policy and the enthusiastic participation of the banks. Thus in each period there was an explosion of bank lending for property development, which culminated in property companies accounting for almost 10 per cent of all outstanding bank debt in the aftermath of each buoyant period. Third, the main bulk of new development reached the market just as the economy, and therefore property demand, was tripping into a recession induced by a tightening of monetary policy. The 1974 crash was precipitated by a rise in interest rates from 4.5 per cent to 13 per cent and a corresponding 1.5 per cent fall in GDP; in 1991 it was an increase in interest rates from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and then a 2.5 per cent fall in GDP. All three conditions are necessary to create the classic property boom and bust. Of course, special market factors will operate in each cycle, but these tend to exacerbate the upswings and downswings, rather than provide their primary cause. In the early-1970s the imposition of a freeze on business rents, and a Development Gains Tax, did nothing to improve confidence in the market, but it was the transformation of economic circumstances reinforced by the oil crisis which made the 1974 crash inevitable. Similarly, while the incentives for development in Docklands encouraged the Corporation of London, the City's governing body, to relax constraints on development in the mid-1980s, the underlying cause of the subsequent central London office explosion was the surge in demand created by economic expansion in general and financial deregulation in particular. Yet does the instability of the property market really matter? The answer must be yes. The scale of the recent development activity was such that it contributed significantly to the overheating of the economy as a whole. And in retrospect, the Pounds 40bn of outstanding loans to the property sector, much of which is now tied up in empty buildings, represents a serious misallocation of resources in an economy which is investing far less than its competitors in productive infrastructure or manufacturing industry. If the instability of the property market does generate such serious economic and social costs, can it be contained? The answer seems to be only to a limited degree. Ironically, in its post-mortem on the 1970s crash, one of the strongest lessons for the future highlighted by the RICS was that 'it is highly dangerous for any government to attempt to regulate the property market by seeking to limit the supply of property coming onto the market in response to demand'. If the 1990s crash teaches us anything, it is the opposite dangers of deregulation - both of the supply of credit and the control of planning permissions. Indeed, the case for strategic planning has been reinforced by the Canary Wharf saga, where offices were built before the transport infrastructure necessary to bring in the workforce. Even if these lessons are learned, property surges and crashes at least as severe as that of the past five years will certainly happen again. The next such cycle is unlikely to be until after 2000, and by then it could well be that the policy context is being set at European rather than national level.

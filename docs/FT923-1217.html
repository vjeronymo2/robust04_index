			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Privatisation plans delayed in Bolivia BOLIVIA'S privatisation programme is running into the sand amid allegations of corruption, a lack of interest by potential investors and opposition from unions and the military. Launched in June by Mr Samuel Doria Medina, planning minister, the process initially involved some 60 state-owned enterprises, to be sold at the rate of one a week. This number has now been increased to about 100, including 14 hotels and 25 military-run corporations. However, the sale of two La Paz hotels was cancelled this month by President Jaime Paz Zamora after allegations of corruption and influence-peddling in the auction process had emerged soon after the sealed bids were opened. Another attempt to sell them will be made next month. A few days before, the first stock market flotation of a state-run company - Fanviplan, a glass-maker - had failed to attract a single bid. Since then, six further attempts to sell the company have met no success. Many said the company was over-priced, given that it was poorly equipped, facing strong foreign competition and running well below capacity, like many others in the first privatisation stage. The government has also failed to find a foreign airline to take a stake in the national carrier Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB). Spain's Iberia bid but this was turned down by the government as 'inadequate'. Mr Doria already faces strong trade union opposition to privatisation and, if the government pursues its stated intention of selling the 25 enterprises run by the military, hostility is expected from older members thereof.

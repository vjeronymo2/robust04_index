			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / US price warriors spark revolution in desktop Japan: A successful assault by American computer makers As the Japanese economy began the year showing signs of a worsening slump, Dell Computer, the US company, announced its arrival in the second largest personal computer market in the world. Dell announced a low-priced desktop computer - a move that heralded a revolution in the Japanese PC market's pricing structure and distribution system. Dell's debut in Japan has added momentum to a concerted assault on the Japanese market by leading US manufacturers which has forced Japanese computer companies to rethink their strategies. Shortly after Dell arrived in Japan, Toshiba announced its first low-cost notebook PC, bringing the price-cutting trend into the notebook market. The Japanese PC market has long been one that seemed to work according to its own rules. The difficulty of producing software which used the Japanese language had allowed a handful of domestic manufacturers, led by NEC, to carve up the PC market among them. While the rest of the world was dominated by IBM-compatible machines, in Japan NEC ruled supreme with 53 per cent of the market, followed by Fujitsu with 13 per cent and Toshiba with 11 per cent, according to the Nikkei Industrial newspaper. IBM had to content itself with a meagre 7 per cent market share. Until as recently as a few months ago, US PC manufacturers had made little impact on the minds of the Japanese PC-buying public, but a price war, triggered last autumn by Compaq, the US company, changed all that. On October 1, Compaq introduced a machine at half the price of comparable Japanese-made PCs. IBM immediately followed suit by introducing its own range of low-priced PCs. This offensive sent a tremor through the Japanese PC industry. Most leading Japanese PC manufacturers, including NEC, the market leader, cut their prices within months. In return, Compaq reduced the price of some of its machines further and added a three-year guarantee. NEC's response has been mostly defiance. It insists that the outbreak of the price wars has had no effect on its business. 'NEC will never compete in a price war,' says Mr Katsuichi Tomita, general manager of NEC's personal computers marketing division. Yet NEC felt threatened enough to use nationwide advertising to spell out that its own system could boast 14,500 software applications, 379 service points throughout the country and proven experience with Japanese language software. In spite of NEC's tactics, the impact of the price wars has been to raise substantially the profile of US manufacturers and improve their fortunes in Japan. Undercutting the domestic competition on price proved to be the quickest, most effective, route for outsiders trying to gain market share. 'We brought out low-priced models because it was the main way to differentiate between IBM's and NEC's machines,' says Mr Tsutomu Maruyama, director of personal systems operations at IBM's Japan General Business Company. IBM and Compaq both report strong sales. The groundwork for the success of the price wars had been laid by IBM. In a bid to spread the use of its own PC/AT standard, IBM had set up an Open Architecture Developers' Group and invited foreign and domestic manufacturers to support DOS-V, a bilingual operating system that allows users to use the English language DOS, as well as more than 1,000 Japanese applications. Most of the leading manufacturers, apart from NEC and Apple, have joined the IBM-led consortium. Yet in spite of the momentum building up around DOS-V, the attempt by US manufacturers to break NEC's dominance still faces formidable obstacles. NEC controls national distribution channels. Two-thirds of PC sales in Japan are still through specialist dealers which have traditionally sold NEC machines. US manufacturers, which were late to enter the Japanese market, will need to build up their distribution channels. The DOS-V camp, with about 1,000 Japanese language software applications, cannot compete with NEC's 14,500 applications. The willingness of developers to write software for DOS-V depends on the penetration rate of hardware, which in turn depends on the number of software programmes available. For the huge installed base of NEC users, there is little incentive, apart from price, to switch to DOS-V. But NEC has already closed the price gap by introducing a low-priced range of its own. 'NEC already has a huge installed base. Why would those people want to give up the security of using something they are already familiar with?' asks Mr Katsushi Shiga, industry analyst at Dataquest, the high technology consultancy. There is also some question as to how far price alone can woo Japanese consumers away from domestic manufacturers. Many in the industry believe that in spite of the attraction of lower prices, discount superstore and tele-marketing sales will not take off as strongly in Japan as in the US and Europe. Japanese consumers, they say, would rather pay for having equipment installed and serviced than having to do it themselves. 'There isn't much of a do-it-yourself culture in Japan,' admits IBM's Mr Maruyama. 'Japanese people don't have that kind of time.' Unless US manufacturers can keep the price gap between their products and those of domestic manufacturers wide, the momentum building up could quickly fizzle out. The signs are that US manufacturers intend to keep up the heat. And Japanese consumers are becoming more cost-conscious and more sophisticated as familiarity with PCs spreads. Apple Computer saw Japanese market revenues lift 50 per cent in the year to September 1991 and 30 per cent in the past fiscal year. The most likely outcome of the current price wars is that the large US manufacturers will gain market share at the expense of smaller Japanese players. The chill wind of foreign competition has forced domestic manufacturers to ask what consumers really want - high prices and free service, or choice.</p>

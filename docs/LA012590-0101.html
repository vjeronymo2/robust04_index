			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA TRAFFIC-LIGHT BILL GETS A GREEN LIGHT  </P> <P> A state bill containing $250,000 to synchronize 40 traffic lights in Ventura  cleared a hurdle this week as it passed through a major legislative committee.  </P> <P> The bill, proposed by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), passed through the  state Assembly Ways and Means Committee on a 12 to 9 vote, clearing the way for  the measure to be heard next Tuesday on the assembly floor.  </P> <P> If passed, funds would be used to connect the signals to a central computer  system which monitors and adjusts traffic signal timings to handle rush-hour  traffic and bottlenecks due to accidents. Most of the other 95 traffic signals  in Ventura are synchronized through the system.  </P> <P> Money to pay for the project would come from the state Petroleum Violation  Escrow Account, which includes money collected from oil companies which  violated federal oil price regulations during the 1970s.  </P></p>

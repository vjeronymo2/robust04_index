			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Slobodan Jankovic] </F>   [Text] Pale -- The day after the ultimatum -- a day of  relief in the areas around Sarajevo. The task of deploying the  Russian blue helmets along the demarcation lines has been drawn  to a close, and the remaining Serbian heavy weaponry has been  moved. Obviously, the moments of high tension are over. The  media event of the day was the news conference of the Srpska  republic's political leadership. Numerous correspondents asked  some 20 questions, most of which were addressed to president  Karadzic. The situation around Sarajevo was the center of  attention, primarily as the first step, the future model for  solving the remaining crisis points. Commenting on this,  Radovan Karadzic stressed that the Serbian side has proposed to  Akashi to continue this peace process -- particularly in the  case of Tuzla -- which was a subject that interested many  foreign correspondents. In reply to a question about Russia's  return to the great diplomatic scene, Radovan Karadzic said:    [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that it was completely  unnatural that Russia had been absent from all these tasks, and  I think that the West had forgotten that Russia is a great  country and a great power, and now it was reminded of this fact  in the best possible way. We are ready to swiftly continue --  in cooperation with primarily Russia, followed by Greece and  Great Britain -- and we are ready to include or accept France  and the United States into this cooperation. [sentence as heard]  [end recording]    Serbian heavy artillery and information on how much has been  done regarding its withdrawal elicited a brief but precise  answer from president Karadzic. Over 50 percent of the weaponry  has been withdrawn to outside the 20-km exclusion zone, while  the rest has been placed under UN control. As soon as weather  conditions permit, we will withdraw these weapons as well,  replied Karadzic. As far as the continuation of the Geneva  negotiations is concerned, the president of the Srpska republic  said that the negotiations now depend on the cochairmen's  ambitions and the readiness of the other two warring sides. We  shall discuss exchange of territory, but Sarajevo will remain  divided into two neighboring cities, said Radovan Karadzic at a  news conference held this afternoon.    We have also noted a significant assessment by the Srpska  republic military leadership regarding the ultimatum. General  Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the Srpska republic army's general  staff, said today that the Serbs had carried out their part of  the bargain. What has been done around Sarajevo has been done  in the best possible way. The combat readiness of the Sarajevo  Corps has not been endangered by this, said General Milovanovic.</p>

The dollar fell Tuesday morning in Tokyo to a momentary low  of 101.90 yen, finishing the morning at 102.85 yen, down 2.84  yen from Monday's close.    The International Trade and Industry minister told reporters  that the current level is untenable since it does not reflect  Japan's economic fundamentals.    A level of 100 yen to the dollar would be a major  psychological barrier, he said.    Kumagai said, however, that speculative moves in the market  to take advantage of the yen's surge could put Japan in serious  trouble, adding Japan's monetary authorities should try to  prevent such moves.</p>

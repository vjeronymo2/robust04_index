			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Technical pressure in the London Metal Exchange COPPER market was maintained yesterday, with the backwardation (nearby premium) widening significantly. While the three months position showed signs of reflecting the market's bearish fundamentals, falling Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 1,949 a tonne, the cash price continued to be bolstered by concern over a potential supply squeeze and its premium widened to Dollars 58 at the close. At the London bullion market the GOLD price closed just 10 cents up from the depressed level at which it ended last week. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology: Say the word - New developments mean speech-recognition systems may soon be a common tool For decades the prospect of computers capable of recognising speech has fired the imagination of researchers and science-fiction writers alike. But early speech-recognition systems required users to speak frustratingly slowly, with pauses between their words. Now, speech recognition technology could be at a turning point. As processing power increases and prices fall, manufacturers of voice recognition equipment, such as IBM, Dragon Systems and Philips, are optimistic about the prospect of making it a common, practical tool. In October, Philips announced a breakthrough in the form of a speech recognition system capable of recognising continuous speech, as well as coping with more than 50,000 words. This development, it believes, makes speech recognition 'mature enough to be used on a large scale in a wide variety of applications'. Its first specialist application is for radiologists, who produce dozens of reports on clinical findings every day. Philips believes that its system cuts the time taken to produce a report by 40 per cent. Enthusiasts talk about speech recognition systems replacing keyboards, mice, dictation machines, handwriting recognition equipment and even copytypists and telephone operators. 'It will be months, rather than years, before keyboards are redundant,' says Kurt Lynn, sales and marketing president of Kolvox, which has developed software applications for speech recognition for legal and office users. Nicholas Stewart, a barrister who has tried out the Kolvox system, is not totally convinced. He thinks competent typists will prefer keyboards for typing long texts. Nonetheless, he thinks the system could be 'very helpful' to barristers in coping with large amounts of administration. Shoosmiths &amp; Harrison, a legal firm which has been using the AllVoice DragonDictate system, is also enthusiastic. It says speech recognition saves time, since texts no longer go back and forth to secretarial staff for transcribing, proof-reading and revision. Moreover, it appeals to users who are not computer literate or good typists. The range of applications for voice recognition technology goes well beyond dictation. In the home, voice recognition can turn on the television, dim the lights or open the garage door. Mail order companies use speech recognition for telephone sales. Speech recognition systems are even being used for language training. French drivers of the Eurostar high-speed trains are using a training program produced by Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computer services company, which checks each element of a user's sentence and rates their pronunciation. The speech recognition market is currently valued at Dollars 289m (Pounds 176.2m) and is expected to grow at 25 per cent a year over the next four years to Dollars 800m by 1998, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, market researchers. Different applications of the technology call for different approaches. Telephone-based voice recognition systems use small vocabularies because they need to be able to recognise a wide range of voices. Their scope is also limited by the quality of telephone microphones, the likely presence of background noise, and the narrow bandwidth of telephone lines which render 'f' and 's' sounds indistinguishable. As a result, the capabilities of telephone-based voice recognition systems are typically limited to yes, no and numbers from zero to nine. By contrast, dictation systems which require large vocabularies, of for example 60,000 words, are trained to recognise a particular voice. It typically takes a few hours for the machines to become attuned to the voice of the speaker, which involves storing examples of the speaker's phonemes, the smallest acoustical component of a language. The process of speech recognition begins with the microphone, which transforms a user's spoken words into an analogue signal which is then transformed into a digital stream of ones and zeros. Decoding software then searches for patterns that match the stored models of phonemes. This involves complex acoustic and statistical models that calculate the probability that a particular pattern matches a certain sound or word. The system also uses a language model, which contains information about the way sentences are composed and the word order in a sentence. The easiest languages for a computer to recognise are those providing the most clues. So languages such as German with long words and rigorous grammatical rules are easier to recognise than, for example English. Within the English language, some vocabularies are easier to recognise than others: the long words and stock phrases used by lawyers, doctors and dentists make them an attractive market for voice recognition tools. The take-up of voice recognition technology is influenced by a number of factors, not least of which is national culture. North Americans, who tend to be more comfortable than Europeans and Asians about talking to machines, provide overwhelmingly the largest market for voice technology. Another potential obstacle arises from the feeling of confusion or even panic that often accompanies a user's first encounter with a speech recognition-based telephone service. 'There are a lot of unsolved problems,' according to BT's Fred Stentiford, who carries out research into the design of automatic telephone dialogues. Inexperienced users speak before a prompt has finished, hesitate, or use too many 'ums' and 'ers'. A long dialogue that relies on simple 'yes' or 'no' answers may also deter users who find it too tedious. Users' growing familiarity with speech recognition systems may ease some of these problems. But some researchers believe speech recognition systems will only become really acceptable once there has been a breakthrough in the theory of natural language processing, allowing a machine to cope with the complex structure and grammar of ordinary speech. Meanwhile, many basic aspects of speech recognition technology are capable of considerable improvement. Researchers are trying to build systems with larger vocabularies that can cope with continuous speech more cheaply. 'Speech recognition is a technology that is never finished,' says Bernie Woollaston, divisional director of Philips Dictation System. 'It can always be faster, with fewer errors.'</p>

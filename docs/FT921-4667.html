			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Japanese to school 'international ladies' THE JAPANESE property company Matsuzato is to open an academy for Japanese women, with fees of Pounds 30,000 a year, at a Victorian country house near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The school, the first of its kind in the UK and probably in the world, aims to produce graduates who are 'international ladies', fluent in English and comfortable in the world of international business and diplomacy. The first 20 prospective 'international ladies', aged from 18 to 46, will arrive next month. Matsuzato, which already owns a golf course near Bury St Edmunds, has spent about Pounds 5m on refurbishing Nowton Court, which was once a prep school and is now renamed St Edmunds Ladies College. Five carpenters were flown from Japan to construct a tea house, complete with tatami mats, and the chef was sent to Tokyo to learn the basics of Japanese cuisine. The idea for the project came from Mr Kanji Kusanagi, president of Matsuzato, who was disillusioned with the Japanese education system. Mr Teruhiko Fujiwara, who represents Matsuzato as director of administration at the school, said: 'The company president found it too rigid. It is his dream to have a school which is not so rigid, not restricted in the Japanese style of education, more relaxed and international.' English will be the main subject on the year-long course, but the students will also take lessons in current affairs, menu planning, dance, golf and 'protocol'. Most Japanese think of Britain as 'the country of ladies and gentlemen', as the school prospectus puts it - an ideal place for the education of refined young ladies. But St Edmunds insists that it is an academic institution rather than a finishing school. All students will work towards recognised English certificates. Resident tutor Ms Helen Ledgard agrees that at Pounds 30,000 the fees are high, but believes they offer good value. Full board and tuition, three European tours a year, other trips and activities are all included. The college is intended to be non-profit making. By comparison, boarders' annual fees at Cheltenham Ladies' College are just more than Pounds 10,000 and at Roedean Pounds 10,700 - although their holidays are longer and conditions not so luxurious. At St Edmunds students will each have a private bathroom. Language schools in London offer full-time English courses for about Pounds 12,000 a year, but not including travel and accommodation. More than 20,000 Japanese come to Britain to study each year and the majority are women, according to the education officer of the Japanese embassy in London. He said: 'Male students are quite often sent by companies, but female students support themselves. I think there is rather strong motivation for women these days because they want to pursue their own careers.' Young Japanese women often have relatively well-paid office jobs but live with their parents, saving most of their salaries for foreign travel and shopping. The school admits that most students are less likely to see themselves as future ambassadors than as wives of diplomats or businessmen, but Ms Ledgard hopes to 'develop their personalities, give them an all-round education and enhance their confidence'.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Gatt panel to rule on Indian car complaint A Gatt disputes panel is to rule on a disagreement over imports of Indian cars into Poland, an issue which could have important implications for the European Union's trade agreements with former communist states in eastern Europe. India says a doubling of Poland's tariff on cars in 1992, coupled with a duty-free quota for the EU under a 1991 bilateral agreement, have hurt its car exports to Poland and thus violated its Gatt rights. According to the Indian complaint, its car deliveries to Poland fell from 4,568 units in 1991-92 to 1,000 in 1992-93 and to 504 in 1993-94. No deliveries have been made this year. India, whose request for a Gatt panel was granted by Gatt's governing council yesterday, said the Polish measures could not be justified under Gatt rules on free trade areas and breached Gatt's non-discrimination principle. Strong support for India came from Japan, which said its own car exports to Poland had been affected, and from a number of other countries including the US, South Korea and several south-east Asian and Latin American nations. The EU and 11 other countries said they intended to make representations to the panel. Among other items discussed yesterday: The council decided to postpone discussion of a disputes panel report ruling mainly in Washington's favour on US car taxes designed to penalise excessive fuel consumption. The EU had charged that these discriminated against European exports of luxury cars. The EU and 46 developing countries requested a formal waiver from Gatt rules for the Lome Convention which gives EU trade preferences to 70 Third World nations. However, the US and some other countries asked for more time to consider the details of the waiver and the council postponed discussion to the annual meeting of Gatt members next month. EU officials said afterwards they were confident that the waiver, which needs a two-thirds majority vote, would pass. A report on dispute settlement activity showed a substantial drop in disputes brought to Gatt over the past 12 months, a decrease attributed partly to the expected entry into force next January of tougher dispute settlement rules under the new World Trade Organisation. Georgia became the last former Soviet republic to become a Gatt observer, along with Sudan which has applied directly for WTO membership.</p>

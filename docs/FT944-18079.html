			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / EU to draw up plan for admitting six eastern members The European Union decided yesterday to draw up detailed measures to integrate six east and central European countries into its single market, in preparation for their full membership of the Union. Foreign ministers of the 12 asked the European Commission to produce a white paper listing the measures that Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania need to adopt in order to prepare their economies and legal frameworks for EU accession. The strategy consciously replicates a 1985 white paper which led to the creation of the single market, and is a demonstration of the EU's commitment to enlargement to the east. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, which is using its presidency of the EU to advance the eastward expansion, welcomed the consensus, saying the white paper 'must be the cornerstone of our strategy'. The white paper strategy, which was agreed in advance by France and Germany, meshes with the Commission's own approach. It is expected to be endorsed at December's EU summit in Essen, while the measures themselves should be ready by next June's summit under the French EU presidency. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, strongly denied that Paris was lukewarm about further EU expansion soon after the enlargement scheduled to take in Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland in January. 'I have done everything I can to push enlargement forward,' he said, adding that more overt enthusiasts were privately expressing misgivings. Indeed, senior officials from the UK, a strong supporter of eastward expansion, said there 'can be no firm timetable before 1996' setting entry date targets. In 1996, the EU will review its constitutional arrangements and how far to tighten Union links before further growth in membership which could risk making it unwieldy.

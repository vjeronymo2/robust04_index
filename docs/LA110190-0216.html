			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> TRUSTEE CANDIDATES REPORT WAR CHESTS  </P> <P> Two board candidates calling for radical change in the Huntington Beach City  School District lead in fund raising, according to their financial disclosure  statements.  </P> <P> Incumbent Robert Mann and challenger Shirley Carey reported collecting three  times more than any of the other candidates through the reporting period that  ended Oct. 20.  </P> <P> Financial reports also showed that challenger Michael J. Cassidy, who reported  having the smallest campaign fund in the race, was the only candidate who  reported receiving a contribution from former Supt. Diana Peters. Peters  resigned amid controversy in August, a move that has sharply divided the  district.  </P> <P> Cassidy, whose financial report covered only his earnings through Oct. 11 and  totaled $1,000, received a $100 donation from Peters.  </P> <P> Board President Sherry Barlow and trustees Patricia Cohen and Mann are running  for reelection Nov. 6 against a field of four challengers.  </P> <P> Mann, who is seeking election to his first full term after being elected in  1987, had accumulated $11,755 in cash donations, loans and non-monetary  contributions, according to his report. He reportedly loaned $9,400 of that sum  from his personal funds. But he was reported to have spent all but $533 of the  money by the filing period close.  </P> <P> Carey, in her first bid for elective office, reported raising $10,590, $4,200  of which came from personal loans.  </P> <P> Cohen, a nine-year board member, reported raising $3,478, including $2,150 in  loans.  </P> <P> Challenger Brian Garland received a financial boost from the teachers union in  raising $2,875 for his campaign. Garland's largest donation was $1,000 from the  Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Assn. Additionally, he reported receiving  $167 worth of postage from the West Orange County United Teachers, the umbrella  union for teachers. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

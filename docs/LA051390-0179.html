			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILE TO PAY COMPENSATION FOR 1976 SLAYINGS IN U.S.  </P> <P> A Chilean official said Saturday that his government has reached agreement with  the United States to pay compensation for the 1976 killing of a Chilean  opposition figure and a U.S. associate in Washington.  </P> <P> The "agreement in principle" came Friday in a meeting between Chilean and U.S.  officials in Washington, acting Interior Minister Belisario Velasco said. He  gave few details on the agreement.  </P> <P> Velasco said the payments would go to the families of Orlando Letelier, a  former Chilean foreign minister who fled to the United States following a 1973  right-wing military coup, and Ronni Moffitt, an aide to Letelier who also was  killed when their car was bombed in Washington.  </P> <P> "In the next few days, a complete announcement with details will be made,"  Velasco said in an interview. He said the matter must now be taken to President  Patricio Aylwin, a civilian who replaced Gen. Augusto Pinochet in March.  </P> <P> Pinochet led the 1973 overthrow of elected civilian President Salvador Allende,  and his military government had blocked efforts by U.S. courts and the  government to seek compensation in the killings.  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said: "I can't confirm  the agreement by the Chileans, but their deputy foreign minister has been in  town discussing bilateral issues with us and also meeting with the Organization  of American States.  </P> <P> "As of yesterday, what we were saying was that we're optimistic our discussions  would result in a satisfactory resolution to the case."  </P> <P> The agreement was not expected to affect criminal cases in the United States  against former officials of Pinochet's secret police who were indicted in the  killings.  </P> <P> Letelier served as Chile's ambassador to Washington and was foreign minister  during the Allende government. In exile following the 1973 coup, he became a  severe critic of Pinochet's rule.  </P> <P> At the time of the Sept. 21, 1976, bombing, Letelier and Moffitt were working  for the Institute for Policy Studies.  </P></p>

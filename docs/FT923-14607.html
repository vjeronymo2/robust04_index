			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (20): Meeting corporate desktop banking demands - Case Study / Lloyds Bank / Lloyds Bank seemed to be asking for trouble when it contracted as many as eight companies to work on a new system LLOYDS BANK used eight companies when it developed its LloydsLink service to enable corporate customers to conduct banking business through their own personal computers. This surprised even the software companies themselves, which were well used to collaborating with others on big projects. The multi-million-pound LloydsLink project was born in 1989. During the 1980s, corporate banking and treasury, one of six business units, had been offering balance and statement information to corporate customers through a computer bureau, ADP. Banks supplied data on computer tapes to the bureau and customers could link to its system to retrieve information. When ADP withdrew the service Lloyds installed ACI's Base24 system to offer the information facilities directly to customers itself. That was in 1988, just as the idea of corporate banking through desk-top workstations was starting to take off. Indeed, the number of Lloyds customers using the ACI system more than doubled - and now they were also asking for extra services, especially payment facilities. In 1989 a team was put together consisting of some of the corporate banking and treasury unit's computing staff and people from electronic services marketing. They looked at what customers were demanding and designed the proposed LloydsLink system. It was to be based on a central switching system, which would handle messages from customers and run payments software; customers would use their own personal computers running software and security facilities supplied by Lloyds. 'We decided an established package was the best way forward for the switch, because of our very aggressive timescales,' says Mr Peter Dailey, head of corporate banking systems. 'This is a fiercely competitive market and we wanted to have the system ready in 12 to 18 months.' The switching system was to be based on a fault-tolerant computer which could keep running even if a fault occurred. Mr Dailey says this, and top security, were the two starting points for the project, because of the high-value transactions that the service would be handling. The two main suppliers of fault-tolerant computers are US companies, Tandem and Stratus, so Lloyds asked them for lists of systems companies which specialised in their machines. 'We came up with 12 possible suppliers of switching systems, from two-man outfits upwards,' says Mr Dailey. 'The small suppliers might have reliable products, but we weren't sure of their long-term resilience as companies.' The shortlist of three companies with working systems consisted of Logica, Data Sciences (then part of Thorn EMI) and a smaller software house, CBC. 'We did exhaustive testing of the three products, because this was going to be the core of the whole system,' Mr Dailey says. 'It was a close thing but we chose Logica, even though it wasn't the cheapest. The Logica Transaction Director was well-established and we had already had a long relationship with the company, which provides Chaps systems to all the major banks. We knew it had experience in this field.' Logica also won a contract to develop some of the electronic funds transfer software running on the switching computer. Mr Dailey estimates that Logica did 60 per cent of the total work. There were consolation prizes for CBC and especially Data Sciences. CBC was given the job of developing software to manage the passing of data to customers for cash management: the balance and statement reporting facilities. Data Sciences got the contract to develop all the software for the customer end of the service. In addition, Admiral was chosen to work with Logica on the electronic funds transfer software, largely because it was familiar with a database management system which had recently been launched by Tandem, manufacturer of the computer at the heart of the switching system. Racal was picked to provide certain security features on the switch and Thyron Drives for its smartcard products: smartcards are the size of credit cards but can contain microprocessors and can store programs and data. They are typically used in fields ranging from banking to medical care to identify the holders and store information about them. US company AT&amp;T Istel was selected as the network services supplier, partly because it had handled networking for the original ADP cash management service. Finally BIS, originally a big UK computing services company but now part of US telecommunications specialist Nynex, was contracted to do some quality assurance. 'We sent out one tender document outlining the entire system and asked companies to show us their skills in the various areas,' Peter Dailey says. 'Some companies bid for everything; others offered skills in particular fields. Logica, for example, did not bid for the personal computer work.' Lloyds' corporate banking systems unit acted as prime contractor. 'It was unusual for Lloyds to project-manage such a big job,' says Mr Dailey. Even Logica was surprised at the arrangement - 'we get projects with two or three sub-contractors but this was unusual,' says manager Mr Peter Manly. Mr Dailey continues: 'We knew Logica could have managed the whole project and we might have saved ourselves some heartache and got going quicker if we'd given the entire contract to one company. But we wanted to take over and run the system ourselves at the end, so we needed to be close to the development work and understand the system.' Mr Manly at Logica says his company would have preferred the commercial benefit of having the whole project, but he admits: 'In reality, we all perform better if we have competition. Commercial pressures kept us on our toes.' Lloyds appointed project managers to the various areas of work and they worked closely with the contractors' project managers. 'We broke the project into application areas, so we managed application development rather than software houses,' Mr Dailey says. This arrangement helped Lloyds to get parts of the service running quite quickly. 'We were under pressure to get services out to defend and win market share,' Mr Dailey says. 'We therefore broke it up into chunks, which were delivered in April and in the autumn, instead of taking the black-box approach, where you don't see anything until the entire job is finished.' The contractors worked mainly on their own premises but there was regular contact with Lloyds, usually at least once a day. 'Good communication was vital These were mainly big software companies, so we knew they were quite capable of managing projects, and that they used proper methodologies. This meant there was no need for us to chase them around at that level. We had to rely on the companies' goodwill to work together and they did so,' Mr Dailey says. Mr Manly agrees: 'There was a lot of enthusiasm and esprit de corps at the working level, with people working late nights and at weekends.' The contractors did their own testing and quality assurance on their work and Lloyds oversaw the integration testing, making sure the various pieces of software worked together. Mr Dailey says the bank benefited from having its own project managers deeply involved from the start. The other benefit of that involvement, seen from the start, is that the corporate banking systems team has been able to take over system maintenance. 'We've built up our in-house team of programmers and analysts who work for the project managers,' Mr Dailey says. There is also a support operation for customers. Customers can generally set up the system themselves on their own personal computers using a package of instructions and program discs from Lloyds, depending on the combination of facilities and levels of security they require. 'The software is complex but what the customer sees is useable and designed to be foolproof,' Mr Dailey says. Customers can telephone a helpdesk if they hit problems. Demand for the services is reflected in the fact that the number of LloydsLink customers is almost four times the number that used the original ADP service, and they are already asking for extra services, including electronic data interchange to exchange orders and invoices with other Lloyds customers. Lloyds expects to move into this market by the end of the year, posing competition to established electronic data interchange specialists with a business message service which is virtually 100 per cent secure. 'People have not tended to see orders as secure messages and are used to using the post - but the trend towards just-in-time manufacturing means ordering must be reliable or there is the risk of goods not arriving,' Mr Dailey says. As far as return on investment is concerned, Mr Dailey points out that the switching system opens up opportunities for Lloyds to add extra services. 'For example, we hadn't even thought of electronic data interchange when we started in 1989,' he says. And he adds, 'We can't be without this sort of system these days. It would be like asking people to bank with us if we didn't have self-service automated teller machines or chequebooks. We see the switch now as a basic part of our infrastructure and something we can build on for the future.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Sergio Luciano in Milan; date not given: "I Am Not the Sheriff  of Nottingham" -- first paragraph is LA STAMPA introduction]    [Text] Milan -- "Those who say I want to take from the poor  and give to the rich, and who compare me to the Sheriff of  Nottingham, are lying. By continuing to twist the facts, the  only thing they are demonstrating is that they want to continue  to lie and defame." Silvio Berlusconi personally is entering  the field in the tax battle: "The first point in our program is  dedicated to the poor. They will be exempt from paying income  tax."    [Luciano] But Budget Minister Spaventa says you would make  the Treasury go "broke"....    [Berlusconi] [Forza Italia economic expert] Antonio Martino  will give Spaventa a detailed response tomorrow and counter his  thesis. Moreover, our program is very clear in this respect.    [Luciano] Many say that it is summed up in the slogan "less  taxes."    [Berlusconi] Far from this. This statement could not be  farther from the truth, given the fact that we are developing a  45-point program and supplying a series of concrete responses to  the various problems. No party has presented such a precise,  articulated, and detailed program during an election campaign.    [Luciano] Do you really envisage safeguarding only high  incomes?    [Berlusconi] First, we propose eliminating income taxes for  poor families. Then, there is the introduction of deductions  for each dependent. The third and fundamental point, is to  reduce VAT [value-added tax] to 2 percent and reduce the number  of taxes to 10 or a maximum of 20, compared to the current 200.    [Luciano] Will the Treasury lose resources?    [Berlusconi] According to our calculations, these  modifications to the current system will introduce more justice  without drawing from the revenues of the Treasury.    [Luciano] But the progressives are also saying that public  spending cannot be reduced.    [Berlusconi] They forget that for years they accused the  government in office of having wasted public money. If it was  really impossible to spend money better, the progressives would  fall into a clear contradiction.    [Luciano] You must admit, however, that the 18 million lire  a  year for four people is a little....    [Berlusconi] This was how Martino answered those asking him  what he considered to be the minimum subsistence level for a  family of four in Rome today. It is certainly not the objective  identified in our government program which is complex and  systematic and cannot be read only in some points and ignored in  others.    [Luciano] The impression that remains is this: less taxes  and  no sacrifices.    [Berlusconi] This impression is entirely mistaken. The key  point of our program is that of relaunching economic development  by relaunching private enterprise and containing where possible  public expenditure, which has exploded out of control over the  past years and which has consequently deprived the economic  system of the savings necessary for development.    [Luciano] What are your basic proposals then?    [Berlusconi] Doing all that is possible to take up the path  toward development. The program contains a detailed account of  many measures in this respect. For example, placing a limit on  public spending by reducing the tendency to increase public  spending by at least one point, in such a way as to bring the  expenditure to 43 percent of GDP in the medium term as in 1980.  This must be combined with a reform and a cultural revolution  in the public administration to transform today's perfect  bureaucratic and political machine that creates difficulties and  bans into a support for those that work and produce.    [Luciano] What role will you leave to the state?    [Berlusconi] The state must go back to doing its job. Not  the  job of the private sector. When done by the private sector,  everything that the state does costs half and is normally done  better. For this reason and in order to work toward a reduction  in public expenditure, we propose that the state return to  fulfilling its fundamental duties, leaving to private initiative  all that the private sector can produce in a system of  competition: health, education, retirement benefits. But to  protect myself from malevolent and unfounded criticism, I must  say that the briefness of an interview does bad service to the  completeness, organization, and precision of our program. I  really hope that our critics will want to examine directly each  of our proposals in the program before making any hasty  judgements.</p>

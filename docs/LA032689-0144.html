			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Democrats meeting in Casper, Wyo., selected state Sen. John Vinich to face  Republican nominee Craig Thomas, a state representative in his third term, in  the April 26 special election to fill the U.S. House seat left vacant by newly  confirmed Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Cheney, a six-term Republican  congressman, gave up the seat less than two weeks ago when he was confirmed as  defense secretary by the U.S. Senate. Vinich won the nod over Bill Downes, a  Casper attorney, and former state Tax Commissioner Carrol Orrison. Vinich said  he hopes to influence some fellow Democrats in the House who have "senseless  ideas and no understanding of the West."  </P></p>
